Lecture 20 The World Economy, 1450 to 1750
In introducing the early modern period of world history in our last session, I emphasized
I frankly think it's pretty obvious that the big deal development underlying all the
others was the intensification of world economic relationships and the inclusion of the Americas
into those relationships.
What we're talking about today fleshes this basic statement out, adds detail, adds theoretical
rigor as we talk about the emergence of a new kind of world economy, again obviously
Americas included.
The intensification point is really vital.
When we talked about the world network in the post-classical period, we mentioned for
example that by the time of the Song dynasty in China, the world network was really capable
of having an impact on basic manufacturing patterns increasing China's stake in this
industrial sector, making silk, porcelain, etc.
When we talk about the early modern period, we're talking about the same kind of intensification
operating in a whole set of different economies and operating at a higher level.
The device we'll use to explore these points is again called world economy theory.
It's the child of an American sociologist, Emmanuel Wallerstein, who has a number of
books on the subject, fairly thick, fairly intriguing, and fairly controversial.
I find world economy theory, which is not absolutely brand new.
It utilizes some Marxist perceptions and it utilizes economic work on dependency theory.
I find world economy theory a really useful device to talk about relationships in the
early modern period and relationships that would endure even beyond, even indeed to the
present day.
The theory has in my judgment three advantages in addition to illustrating the general points
about intensification.
First of all, it clarifies new systematic inequalities in international economic relationships
that begin to emerge in the early modern period and through this helps show why societies
otherwise as different as Latin America and Poland actually can be viewed through something
of the same lens.
Second, it talks about relationships within societies between export and import activities,
economic position in the world economy, and political structures and labor systems.
And these relationships are really interestingly interconnected and I think the interconnections
are in many cases plausible.
And the third advantage, which obviously we will evoke today but have to come back to,
is world economy's utility in helping to explain why certain kinds of economic patterns
internationally endure so long how hard they are to get rid of.
The theory has been however widely criticized and we have to note this too.
Indeed I think exploring the criticisms helps make the theory more useful.
It's a theory that leaves out some factors and we will note in the following discussion
that Wallerstein has almost no place for culture.
I think culture is very important even in the early modern world economy and I would
try to add cultural factors in.
There's surprisingly little attention actually to explicit technologies and I think these
can be added in not without too much difficulty.
So there are certain omissions.
Almost inevitably there are oversimplifications and we'll point out some of these as well.
Wallerstein is generalizing about a wide array of territories and situations and his model
sometimes just shades off from necessary detail.
This is not too hard to fix but we need to work on fixing it.
The theory has trouble dealing with change and that's perhaps one of the most telling
deficiencies.
It's very easy using the theory to say society X is in this position at this time but when
society X changes from this position to that position all the theory can do is say gee
it shifted we need to use the next category.
To deal with change and or explain change too clearly.
And finally also extremely important for the early modern period the theory does not do
justice to the complexity of patterns in Asia and indeed may really distort.
This has been the most recent attack and we need to build this criticism in.
So we're presenting a theory I think it's useful for this period and the next and even
into our own day.
It has flaws it can be amended and let's get going.
Wallerstein introduces three key concepts he actually has four but I'm going to simplify
the simplification just a little bit.
First of all he talks about core societies.
These are societies that are the winners in the early modern world economy and I'll explain
their specific characteristics a bit more in a moment.
He talks about peripheral societies these are the losers and again they have several
characteristics that attach to their dependent weaker position.
And third because not all societies were fully enmeshed in the world economy at this point
he also talks about external societies where prosperity may or may not exist but where
it's not primarily dependent on global economic relationships and we'll need this category
as well although we also need to adjust Wallerstein's use of it.
All right one other preliminary.
Wallerstein argues that these economic relationships particularly core periphery which is the crucial
duo.
These economic relationships are born with the early modern period.
We can see that elements of these relationships existed even in the post classical period.
Not as rigorous because the intensity of the linkages wasn't as great but there were societies
that benefited more from exchange than others did for example China or the Middle East and
there were societies that tended to produce cruder products in their efforts to get into
the game for example Western Europe.
So the relationships are not brand new but we can start with the early modern because
they certainly become more rigorous at this point.
First what a core society is a society like Spain or Portugal in the initial phases of
the early modern period a society like Britain France or Holland by the 17th century.
A core society makes profits from the world economy by doing three things simultaneously.
First it exports finished goods because you can make more money with finished goods because
you have to pay for more stages of the production process than with less finished goods.
So it's an exporter of largely manufactured products.
Second it organizes the trading companies in which world commerce is carried.
So it makes money not just for manufacturing but also from commercial transactions.
And third it builds the ships and runs the ships that carry the trade as well another
source of profit.
Of course there's risk in all these levels as well.
Sea trade in the early modern period was frequently beset by accidents piracy etc.
So profit wasn't assured but in the long term the core profits from the world economy because
of its capacity to operate superior activities and facilities in these three categories.
Take advantage is however closely linked to political advantage and here Wallerstein
isn't always clear as to which comes first probably actually in his view the politics
comes first.
In Wallerstein's view core societies not only have profitable economic relationships internationally
they also have fairly strong states.
The connection is quite clear in the first place if you're profiting from the international
economy your tax revenues go up so you can afford a more elaborate system of government
second if you have a strong government backed by a strong military you can intervene in
international situations in ways that will help position your merchants advantageously.
So advantageous economic position coupled with political strength and third Wallerstein
argues that core societies and he's certainly empirically correct for the early modern period
core societies will increasingly adopt wage labor systems because they need the capacity
to use wages to motivate workers to move them around where manufacturing opportunities
exist other systems of labor simply won't work as well.
Again as a matter of fact there's no question that wage labor spread in the early modern
period whether it's quite so inherently attached to Wallerstein system one could debate.
Peripheral societies are the mirror image of core they have depended economies through
which they will import expensive stuff from the core primarily they will export cheap stuff
raw unprocessed goods of one sort or another.
The trade will be carried by merchants from the core so peripheral societies have a fairly
small merchant class mainly engaged in local exchanges not non-existent but small and peripheral
societies will depend heavily on the ships from the core economies as well so they will
obviously tend to lose money in international economic exchange they're just as fully engaged
in it as the core but they're engaged at a series of systematic disadvantages.
Peripheral societies will also have weak governments their governments will be weak because again
they don't have the tax revenues to do much better and they're also weak because the core
will want to keep them weak so that its merchants and its interventions will not encounter significant
political resistance.
Peripheral economies finally will rely not primarily on wage labor at least in the early
modern period but on forced or coercive labor slavery or harsh serfdom.
Wallerstein isn't necessarily entirely clear as to why this is so the argument obviously
would be that because you're producing cheap products you need cheap labor but I think
we can add one ingredient here that helps explain the situation more fully remember
that in the early modern period many peripheral societies also faced a labor shortage because
of the die off of native populations if it relied on wage labor the wages would tend
to be fairly high because of supply and demand so the effort was instead to introduce slavery
or some form of serfdom in order to cut those costs that would result from a market economy
operating on its own coercive labor was an extensive form.
These relationships and again we're talking about economic, political and social system
or labor system relationships these relationships are clearly easily uncovered in the early modern
period again the great core societies were initially Spain and Portugal but then their
position slipped as they failed to capitalize on their economic advantage and passed increasing
manufacturing and trade opportunities northward in Europe and ultimately the great core societies
were the societies of much of the European Northwest France Holland Britain and some
other participants to a lesser degree.
These were the societies that ultimately generated the great trading companies British Dutch
East India companies etc that clearly organized the trade and sent the ships these were the
societies also that experienced a significant and steady increase of manufacturing both
craft manufacturing pouring artistic goods into the world economy but also domestic or
home production domestic manufacturing where mostly rural workers would combine some agriculture
with work making thread cloth simple metal equipment nails that sort of thing.
The core societies then as you actually look at them clearly illustrate the increasing realization
that money was to be made by organizing the trade very deliberately and increasingly realizing
that money was to be made by emphasizing new levels of manufacturing.
We do need again as I mentioned earlier to guard against oversimplification France and
Britain both core societies were clearly not the same society in the early modern period.
France is a classic illustration of Wallerstein's claim that core societies will have strong
governments with strong militaries.
The British government wasn't feeble but this was of course a period in which Britain underwent
considerable political turmoil and emerged with a relatively small government and periodically
a fairly weak military though always a strong navy.
In other words Wallerstein's basic claims about the core probably work but we need to
be aware that we need to make some internal distinctions as well.
The periphery the classic periphery of course was Latin America.
Latin America produced sugar, produced silver, produced wood products, produced other goods
that were not processed there for the most part but sent elsewhere.
Latin America did in its colonial period experience quite weak governments weak not only because
of core intervention but also because the landlords and mine owners in the Latin American
economy wanted to be free from government regulation as they worked to exploit their
coercive labor.
Certainly Latin America developed coercive labor systems.
The importation of slaves particularly to the Caribbean and Brazil for work in sugar
plantations was a classic case in point but in other areas also with regard to native or
mestizo populations.
Latin American economies featured essentially versions of serfdom where labor would be partly
coerced, partly forced either to work certain days for the mine or estate owner or to turn
over certain percentages of produce systems such as the Encomienda and the Hacienda system.
They're not called serfdom in Latin American history but if we step back a bit they have
very similar overtones.
Peripheries could develop elsewhere.
Wallerstein notes that by the 18th century peripheries were developing in parts of Eastern
Europe particularly Poland where amid another set of harsh serfdom conditions emphasis increasingly
went to producing grain for sale in western markets as Britain particularly converted
increasingly to manufacturing it would need to import food from other places they sought
this food at low prices Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe were willing to oblige and
again weak government the Polish government was notoriously weak in the early 18th century
harsh labor conditions serfdom and reliance on the export of relatively cheap products
carried in western ships in patterns organized by western merchant companies etc.
Africa West Africa particularly can also be seen as a peripheral economy if we take the
step of arguing that slaves constitute something of an unprocessed good African slave systems
obviously developed through a combination of African merchant and political organization
seeking the slaves and bringing them to the coast occasionally with some direct European
intervention and then selling them to European slave traders on the coast the good was again
relatively unprocessed the ships and the commercial companies were European and in return
African merchants and political figures received processed goods again from the core the key
goods were again slaves sugar silver wood products a bit later cotton would be added to the mix
the core products that went into the world economy were particularly guns of great interest for
example to African political leaders and also an increasing array of European craft products
tapestries paintings fancy furniture that sort of thing that could adorn the homes of the successful
members of the peripheral economy peripheral economies it should be added were poor but there
could be some very rich people who made money from the agricultural estates and the mines mostly
these people would not put their money back into the local economy but money there was all right
here too with the periphery we need to note some oversimplifications if West Africa was a periphery
we have to note that its governments were much stronger than those of Latin America much more
capable of regulating European activity the specifics of the pattern are distinct and again
we need to guard against Wallersteinian oversimplification other societies began to demonstrate
at least a few peripheral characteristics by the 18th century particularly as European intervention
increased in India and in what is now Indonesia economies were increasingly turned to production
of goods like spices teas etc the economy as a whole was not yet shifted to peripheral status
but some peripheral characteristics were developing again Wallerstein can't explain
changes of this sort you have to look at military and political intervention the use of military
technology but he can pick up the category once it begins to emerge there are some rough spots
quite apart from the oversimplification what does one do for example with the British colonies
of North America the south clearly was a periphery as Southerners concentrated on the production
of sugar and other goods for sale to Europe they fall quite clearly into a peripheral category
and later on they would actually be a periphery of the of the American north particularly as
cotton production spread but for the middle colonies particularly and for New England
it's not quite so easy to figure out where to put them in the Wallersteinian scheme these areas
had a significant local merchant class they did some manufacturing they ran some shipping
they're not yet core i.e. they're certainly dependent on European monitoring but it's just
not an easy category and we just have to recognize not every size fits all in this theoretical
discussion the key issue however as i mentioned before the key issue is Asia
Wallerstein doesn't necessarily talk in great detail about Asia in his treatment of the early
modern period but the implications of his work would suggest that Asia must be viewed largely
through the lens of externality that is the asian economy is not sufficiently involved in world trade
to be affected by world trade dimensions one way or another this position which feeds and is fed by
real misperceptions about Asia's economic role in the world at this point by misperceptions about
degrees of isolation degrees of disdain for commerce all the old stereotypes particularly
applied to china but sometimes more widely as well these perceptions have to be dispelled
in order to understand the key point and with this the notion of externality has to be largely
dispelled as well there was one clear external asian economy by the 17th century and that was
the economy of japan the japanese decision substantially to isolate taken around 1600
to cut off elaborate contacts with the west included new regulations against japanese trade
with other societies new regulations against foreigners working in japan and without question
japan's economy was not a significant participant in world trade patterns in the 17th and 18th
centuries there was a chink open still the japanese allowed the dutch to trade near the port of
nagasaki because they recognized that having some outlet to the wider world might still be useful
and the dutch at this point did not seem particularly menacing for example compared
to the catholic spaniards so externality was not complete but an external category would
actually work pretty well for japan in this period it was consistent with considerable
internal commercial growth the early modern period sees significant development of commercial
operations in japan new companies processing foods making beer this sort of thing this was
this was a fairly dynamic period in the japanese economy but not because of external economic
relations of any major sort but for china the middle east and india particularly for china
externality simply doesn't work here's probably the favorite world history fact currently and i
mention it to you so you can impress your friends what society what society received the largest
amount of new world silver in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries the intuitive answer would probably
be spain or maybe if you recognize that spain's position eroded after a while maybe britain or
france but the actual answer very definitely is china china got more silver from the new world
than any other society and the reason is very simple remember the old dilemma that we tend to
forget by the early modern period but still operates europeans had long sought chinese goods
they still sought chinese goods it's in the 17th century for example that the word china enters
the english language to mean porcelain so they really wanted this stuff they still have nothing
that they can use to pay for it in a famous passage at the end of the 18th century a british
envoy to the ching emperor of china prostrates himself as one is supposed to do in the presence
of this august figure but urges that the chinese opened their markets to the british he carries
the letter from the british monarch urging this opening and the chinese emperor is very vigorous
in reply thank you very much but there's nothing from the outside world that we need why don't you
go home the chinese simply did not need european goods they produced better goods themselves
or they didn't want them as in the case of massive supplies of guns so what were the europeans to do
in the early modern period the dilemma is an old one we've seen it in the post classical period
but in the early modern period there is a new european answer hooray we now have silver from the
new world and we'll send this to the chinese this is where the europeans appear not just as
dynamic economic entrepreneurs and manufacturers though they have this role in certain areas
but as transmitters they're simply taking a valued american good as carriers to the chinese
and getting what they want in return silver flooded china with significant impact in the 17th
century the chinese government decides for example that all taxes must now be paid in silver currency
a huge challenge to many ordinary peasants who had to increase their market activities
in order to try to earn the silver that they would have to use for taxation purposes social
inequality almost certainly increased in china there's a lot of adverse criticism by chinese
observers about this monetization and commercialization of chinese society so the point is not to
china not just the china is making a lot of profit from this system but that it's a it's a it's a
profit level that will affect chinese society in other ways as well but the point for the world
economy theory is clearly china is an active participant but it doesn't quite fit any of
the models that wallerstein has put forward it's not external you couldn't possibly earn this much
new world sort silver and be regarded as external you are involved in world trade you are impacted
by world trade but it's not exactly core either although that might be the closest fit it's not
core because chinese merchants and ships are not going out to the world as a whole china is a
production powerhouse and many chinese today as china's manufacturing position again become
central to global trade argue that china is quite simply restoring what it had once achieved
after a brief and troubled interruption an interesting vantage point that we will return to
china was a manufacturing powerhouse it was not for foreign trade purposes a commercial powerhouse
it did trade actively still with southeast asia again want to dispel any notion that the chinese
are just sitting there letting westerners bring stuff to them or that the chinese are somehow
disinclined to trade but on a global basis the chinese clearly are not operating the way a core
society is supposed to they have a strong government they might fit a core definition in other respects
but the category just has to be adjusted this is a different situation some of the same comments
apply to india at least until the 18th century india is the second largest recipient of new world
silver because the indians also have a variety of goods that europeans want they have fine cotton
and other kinds of cloth they have spices they have a mixture in other words of specialized
agricultural products and manufactured products and again they have very little need
for european goods during the early modern period new world silver is once more the
greece that operates this particular commercial machine as we've noted by the 18th century when
foreign intervention increases in india this enviable position may begin to shift into a
clearer dependent category but for most of the early modern period india and the middle east as
well trade with some advantage with europeans uh they're not dominated by europeans but they're
not removed from international trade either you simply need for the early modern period at least
a separate asian category that would then allow for specific cases such as japan all right
i think it's pretty clear though again argument is welcome i think it's pretty clear that a
modified early modern world economy system makes considerable sense european dominance with regard
to latin america to some extent africa and increasingly some parts of eastern europe
european economic dominance is very real it's a source of new profits for the west
it's a source of new patterns of economic and political activity for the peripheral
societies involved this is not yet a world system it does not yet embrace most of asia
it needs to be modified to take changes into account not only the economic decline of spain
in portugal but the new position of india and we'll talk about some some relevant changes for
russia in a later comment as well so we need to add to wallerstein a sense of change we need to
recognize that his picture must be complicated by factors such as population shortage cultural
attitudes etc and we need to make a great big adjustment for many key parts of asia as against
not only his tendency but also the larger stereotypes that are simply simply wrong
for this period but with these adjustments i think we come back to the three key points
that i suggested at the outset properly adjusted wallerstein does explain why different societies
fail into some systematic patterns of inequality in the international marketplace in the early
modern period he does explain why weak government has some relationship to dependent economic
status and above all though here we can only make a statement at this point we'll come back to it
as we move on in time he does explain why this system tended to be so persistent it is possible
to fall out of the course spain in portugal did if you don't make full use of your economic
superiority but it's hard because you make enough money from this system that you can make some
mistakes and still be on top it's even harder probably to climb out of the periphery if you're
not making money from the world economic system if your labor force is abused and impoverished
if your merchant class is small it's going to be very difficult to change this position
not impossible because we have to see later on that people do societies do emerge but persistence
the connections between early modern economic relationships and even contemporary economic
issues in the world economy this connection is vivid and this demonstrates the persistence
of the kinds of categories wallerstein establishes
lecture 21 transformations in western europe
it's no secret that the early modern centuries constituted an exceptionally busy time for western
europe lots of changes lots of significant movements we'll be dealing with basic shifts
in our discussion today but we need to begin with a slight sense of caution
and certainly a concern with making sure the developments will be discussing fit into a
world history context the list of major european activities is formidable you start with the
renaissance the italian renaissance began before 1450 of course but 1450 itself is the
conventional date at which one notes the migration of the renaissance to the north the 16th century
saw the protestant reformation the catholic reformation in response the price or commercial
revolution that was stimulated by the advent of precious metals from the new world and which
encouraged additional commercial activity in europe the 17th century sees the rise of absolutism
the variant that developed in britain and the netherlands with the emergence of a more modern
form of parliamentary monarchy and of course it saw the scientific revolution one of the
incontestably great developments of the early modern period the 18th century sees above all the
enlightenment a popularization and expansion of scientific thinking but it also sees the
application of some enlightenment ideas to absolute monarchy in the form of enlightened
despotism the list is obviously considerable and it's important the issue for starters however
is how we make sure that this range of developments in western europe becomes manageable enough
to fit into a world history pattern let me illustrate by raising a specific question
which i won't exactly answer though i'm going to imply my own reaction how much from the standpoint
of world history do we need to know about the european renaissance here's one of the great
staples the glorious staples of the tradition of western civilization lovingly detailed
particularly by people interested in artistic and cultural history but from a world history
standpoint how much time can one afford to spend on the renaissance how much attention
does it absolutely require my own and here i will sort of answer from my own standpoint
my own reaction is frankly probably not much but it can be debated certainly certainly world
history does not afford the opportunity to spend as much time on renaissance then reformation then
science then enlightenment as one would offer in a western civilization approach you just have to
be more selective so we're going to talk first about a big changes approach that is instead of
going through renaissance reformation blah blah blah blah we're going to be talking about
what are the big ways that western europe shifted between 1450 and 1750 this does not do full justice
to all of the individual movements and currents which after all were among other things not
entirely consistent renaissance for example more secular spirit reformation returns to a greater
religious emphasis these eddies are obviously extremely important if one has the luxury of a
western civilization framework but they're not necessarily any more important than some of the
counter occurrence that one could also encounter in china the middle east sub-saharan africa etc
we have to look at the bigger picture so we'll be talking in the first instance about major
categories of change many of which frankly focus a bit more on the second half of the
early modern period than on the first half though of course they're prepared by developments earlier
on two other controls are vital in the first place in addition to simplifying the usual picture so
that it becomes appropriate for a world history framework we will at the end talk more explicitly
about okay these things happened in the west what are their global implications this will be brief
but obviously is also intended to make sure we don't get lost in the western forest and lose sight
of the bigger picture i've mangled a metaphor there but you know what i mean the final control
within this discussion itself is i think a really interesting one and i venture it here
a little bit cautiously but i actually think it'll work what was going on in the west from a world
history standpoint what was going on in the west in the early modern period was partly playing catch
up remember the west had been by the top global standards a somewhat backward society during the
post classical period though it changed a lot and was beginning to move into a more global orbit by
the end of the post classical but in the early modern period the west does a number of things
that bring it close to the levels already achieved in places like china and the middle east now of
course it did so in specific ways that are western but in broader outline we will see and i'll be able
to point this out explicitly we'll be able to see how the west adjusted consciously or unconsciously
to existing global standards but the second angle is attention involves attention to where the west
actually innovated did not follow basic patterns laid out already so we'll need to evaluate the big
changes we'll be focusing on in terms of their placement either as basically catch up with again
perhaps a special western twist or as fundamentally innovative and i think this framework is actually
quite interesting and appropriate of course finally we need to remember that what was going on in the
west is matched by important developments in other parts of the world and we'll have a chance to come
back to that in subsequent discussions the big changes in the west in the early modern period
fall into four basic categories one i will merely mention because we've already covered it but in a
way it was the granddaddy of all categories and that was the increasing place that the west was
winning in world trade and to a lesser extent in world power politics from world trade the west
gained access to new kinds of ideas new perspectives it certainly gained access to new levels of wealth
and commercial opportunity so remember that although we're now going to focus on the other
three big developments this repositioning in the world was a fundamental change in and of itself
the other big developments involved an increasing commercialization of the west european economy
obviously pretty closely tied to global developments significant changes in politics
along lines of increasing governmental efficiency and rationalization and finally
significant even fundamental shifts in cultural outlook and the way many europeans began to think
about the world these developments occurred at the same time they overlapped they could reinforce
each other but i think it's useful initially to look at them one by one commercialization
during the 16th 17th and 18th centuries fairly steadily more and more europeans became involved
in a commercial economy producing at least some goods for sale on the market for sale for money
this included farmers for example it was only in the 17th century that southern french peasants
and landlords began producing wine for sale to other regions thus involving themselves in importing
other kinds of food they would need individual villages began to specialize in shoe production
or nail production or scissors or cutlery production both in agriculture and in manufacturing
ordinary people as well as merchants and landlords began producing more for the market began adopting
an increasingly explicit set of market motivations and practices the development was uneven you can
find a commercial village right next to a very traditional self-sufficient one but the general
tendency was quite marked this meant of course also a growing importance for the merchant class
of western europe which expanded gained wealth both from international and from domestic trade
the expansion of a merchant and capitalist sector was an important part of this phenomenon
absolutely crucial as mentioned already in discussions of the world economy was the expansion
of domestic manufacturing in western europe that system by which rural people while still possibly
doing some farming devoted an increasing amount of their effort to producing goods for sale to
merchants in nearby cities goods like textiles particularly of various sorts but also again
metal products shoes potentially other items so from the 16th through the 18th century a steady
expansion of european commercialization this had a couple of other corollaries most important
commercialization was accompanied by a growing gap between the large numbers of people who owned
some property an artisan shop a bit of land whatever and an equally rapidly growing group
of essentially propertyless or near propertyless workers dependent on sale of their labor for a
wage in other words european class structure shifted away from the more community-based
relationships that had predominated during the post classical centuries along with this in turn
and it's a striking development even as early as the late 16th century came a new and frankly
harsher attitude toward poverty along with traditional religious views that the poor should
receive charity that they would always be with us came an increasing sense that frankly if you were
poor there must be something wrong with you and maybe not every poor person deserved assistance
this is an attitude that obviously still lingers in the western psyche although some other attitudes
have joined in as well the commercialization of the european economy the expansion of domestic
manufacturing the increasing production of food products for sale on urban markets etc in broad
outline were catch-up developments they brought europe to economic levels that had previously
been achieved in places like china and other parts of asia they were not again aside from
individual peculiarities they were not in and of themselves distinctive on the world scene
attitudes toward poverty maybe had a little bit of additional edge the witchcraft scare that was
such an interesting sign of ongoing tension in european life in the 16th and 17th centuries
had something to do with the new social framework that the europeans were creating a disproportionate
number of accused witches were poor people particularly poor women feared among other
things because of the new sense of hostility toward poverty so a few special twists but in
broad outline this is a catch-up development by the 18th century however still on the theme of
commercialization developments began to press beyond a mere catch-up level in two senses first
by this point the expansion of domestic manufacturing and now the beginnings of new technologies
for example the flying shuttle in weaving of cloth new technologies designed to increase the
productivity of manual workers these developments began to push the european economy beyond levels
that had been achieved in other societies it's still within range but you're beginning to get a
level of commercialization attention to manufacturing and productivity levels that are on the verge at
least of becoming distinctive the other 18th century development and this is a striking recent
historical discovery the other 18th century development was the beginning of modern consumerism
in western europe we have noted at several earlier points that consumerism is hardly a purely modern
phenomenon upper classes frequently indulged in a delight in material goods that they did not
strictly need and a capacity to gain some sense of purpose and identity from consumer activities
but it's in the 17th 18th centuries in western europe that consumerism begins to spread beneath
the upper class and merchant level to more ordinary people not everybody of course but to
more ordinary people and it's at this point also that consumer interests begin to take on the contours
of some real passion for example in the 18th century thefts of clothing accelerated massively
a sign that people were beginning to want things as part of their personal set of values and identities
and would be willing to go beyond the law in order to obtain them and again things they did
not strictly speaking need this discovery that a modern form of consumerism predates the industrial
revolution and centered in western europe is indeed an important addition to our sense of what
commercialization could accomplish increasing commercial activity largely in the catch up mode
but capable of pressing beyond that level to more genuine innovation on a world scale second
category of development politics until the 17th century despite the rise of individual monarchs
or the renaissance city-state until the 17th century european politics can still broadly
be described in the terms of earlier emphasis on feudalism but by the 17th century though feudal
remnants lingered by the 17th century european states particularly in absolute monarchies
like that of france european states were beginning to develop a new range of activities and a new
sense of rationalization let me illustrate first of all fairly familiar development central
governments now began to send out an increasing number of bureaucrats to the provinces to make
sure that central edicts were enforced more uniformly throughout the realm and local conditions
in turn could be monitored by central authorities it was at this point for example that national
boundaries between countries like france and spain began really to matter because it now mattered
which state you belong to new functions also included activities such as cultural intervention
it was in the 17th century that the french monarchy decided that it should set up an institution
to help monitor and regularize the french language an activity that the french state
still conducts perhaps in a more beleaguered fashion in the present day it was in this period also
that european states began to set up prisons a tremendous change in potential operations in
criminal justice and a considerable expansion of the role of the state in dealing with criminals
the list is long along with expansion of function came this process we call rationalization an
increasingly self-conscious effort to think through how government activities were organized the
military serves as a prime example here again it was in the 17th century that many european armies
began to acquire set uniforms that officer grades began to be systematically defined so there was
a clear hierarchy of progression that training for certain kinds of officers particularly military
engineers began to be formalized that new activities like hospitals and logistical systems
for armies began to be organized so that when an army moved through the countryside it would not
simply be living off the land and even military pensions established european states became more
active conducting a wider array of functions and their activities were increasingly rationalized
now here too in broad outline most of this was catch up that is european governments are now
beginning to do things that political systems in several other societies china obviously at the head
had done well before this again particular european emphases the prison system seems to have been
unusually stressed in europe for example but the broad patterns are familiar there's no
fundamental innovation europe gained increasingly the political capacity to operate on a global stage
in tandem with the most advanced political systems in other societies that's an important
development but it's not fundamentally novel but here too particularly by the 17th and 18th centuries
a distinctive twist that was more innovative and that is the clear beginnings of the idea of a nation
state that is a state in which a definition of shared culture and tradition would coexist with
the state itself this is a novel development you might find hints of it in patterns that the
chinese had conducted earlier but fundamentally most states previously had not called on active
loyalty of subjects to the extent that the nation state did and they had not assumed
that the state and the cultural orbit were coterminous the nation state concept which would
obviously develop still further in the later 18th and 19th centuries was a fundamental innovation
on the world scene and it would have wide impact beyond europe as well as within it so
political changes very significant largely along fairly familiar line lines if you use the standards
of other societies but with this particular new emphasis third category major developments in
culture three fundamental shifts occurred setting the framework for more detailed changes
in the first place obviously the establishment of printing in europe though initially devoted
primarily to religious tracts opened up massive expansions of opportunities for europeans to
have contact with the written word to gain new sources of information and this was a fundamental
shift in the european cultural horizon literacy developed pretty systematically in the 16th 17th
and 18th centuries and by the 18th century western europe had the highest rates of literacy of any
large society in the world other developments that followed from printing obviously included the
emergence of newspapers weekly for the most part by the end of the 17th century there's a new cultural
apparatus here that's very significant development number two the protestant reformation despite
some effective catholic response shattered the unity of western christianity led to all sorts of
internal conflicts and tensions but in the long run in the long run tended to reduce religious
commitment in europe and tended to increase an attachment to some idea of religious toleration
i know this simplifies a lot of very complicated developments but i think that was the long run
impact and finally the granddaddy of all three major cultural shifts the scientific revolution
itself european science as we've discussed previously had prior to this time shared many
features directly borrowed from many other scientific traditions particularly those of the middle east
but in the 17th century the range of scientific discovery and the increasing sense on the part
of many intellectuals and even through popularization ordinary people that the key to truth lay through
science not faith not tradition this was a fundamental change that no other scientific
endeavor in other societies had yet matched european science obviously was not totally unique
we want to remember that vigorous scientific traditions existed in other societies but
the overall contours of the scientific revolution were really novel and indeed when you combine
printing and growing literacy the printing of materials directed at relatively ordinary people
when you combine this with science one could argue that of all the three areas we've been
emphasizing commercialization political change and culture it's really the culture that makes
western europe increasingly stand out from the standards of other societies and this was not
just an abstract development the other intriguing aspect of cultural change in early modern europe
was how it penetrated into relatively prosaic activities and into the attitudes of relatively
ordinary people let me offer a few illustrations from a fascinating array illustration number one
if you lost a valued object in 1600 and you looked for it you couldn't find it but you really
wanted to get it you would normally employ a local cunning man a magic person who had a magic
stick and he would go around and shake the stick and hopefully the stick would help identify the
lost object and of course if it didn't you'd done the best you could in 1720 same scenario you lose
something you look for it you really want it back can't find it you would no longer turn to the local
cunning man because increasingly this person didn't exist instead particularly if you lived in
cities you would do one of two things or both you would advertise the lost object in the local
newspaper or you would go to the city lost and found office offices of the sort that were increasingly
established from the later 17th century onward specific illustration of a broader phenomenon
during the 17th and 18th centuries magical approaches to nature magical approaches toward
dealing with problems like lost and found begin to pass from favor lots of people still believe in
them if you look at supermarket tabloids lots of people still believe in them today but they are
no longer dominantly fashionable and instead people turned increasingly to a new kind of
calculation of risk and a new kind of rational or scientific approach to nature such that
magical approaches now were either outright disapproved or relegated to obscure corners
in some areas of popular life second illustration quite a different category in 1650
if you had a child you might wait to name it for about two years and when you did name it
you would probably choose either the name of a past relative or the name of another child you
had had who had died or possibly a religious name in 1750 when you had a child you would normally
name it now quickly the child would still be likely to die but the sense of the importance of
dealing with the individual from birth was now on the upswing and that meant a new kind of naming
practice second when you did name the child you would not normally pick a family name you would
never never pick a name from a kid you'd had who'd already died and indeed you would often
stay away from religious names the new fashion was to look for new kinds of names that would express
greater individuality that would give a child a greater sense of being his or her own person
another category and i'll end with this one it's a fascinating array in 1650
if your father told you a young girl to get married and whom to marry you might protest
individually but you would almost certainly lose papa and maybe mama would tell you whom to marry
and the marriage would be arranged on the basis of family property considerations in 1750 if papa
told you whom to marry you're still a young girl and you felt you could not love that person
you might be able to persuade papa that this was a match that should not occur because marriage
had to be based on affection and in a few places like some parts of switzerland if papa didn't
agree you could actually go to court and get the arrangement cancelled the notion that marriage
should be based on love the notion that marriage should be a union that involved affection and
even sexual expression and not just property arrangements was born in this period the list
is long and the basic point obviously is clear fundamental shifts in western culture science
religious division growing literacy yielded impressive and varied expressions at the level
of very popular beliefs and practices affecting a sense of the individual affecting a sense of
family and community affecting obviously attitudes toward risk and nature this is a big deal change
and it marks the extent to which the cultural realm was probably particularly the area where
the west was striking out in new directions now we come back to some cautions and final conclusions
remember that western europe despite all the exciting things having happening there
was not the only place in the world lots of places continued to ignore what was going on in the west
actually some areas saw a few developments by coincidence that were not totally different
from those occurring in the west for example in the same early modern centuries many confucian
leaders in china began to attack popular superstition in magic in order to make chinese life
more rational less uh less dependent on folk superstition than had been the case the west
is not the only place where interesting developments are occurring not the only place we want to look
to as we get a sense of the early modern period as a whole but the changes that did occur in the west
in the early modern centuries when we take the big changes approach had three final implications
number one they almost guaranteed that additional change would occur in the west itself with governments
taking on new roles with new attitudes toward nature even with new attitudes toward children
increasingly interested in seeing children develop in a creative fashion changes of this
almost assured that additional change was underway and of course the increasing pace of
commercialization set the fundamental framework here second these changes would color european
reactions to other societies we've already noted that europeans as they moved into new positions in
the world often began to judge other societies by their technological level well now they might
also begin to judge other societies by how much superstition seemed to be present by how children
were treated it became increasingly easy for europeans to think of other places as uncivilized
because they didn't measure up to the new standards that were present in europe itself and by the 19th
century for happily a fairly brief time many westerners in fact did decide that there were
no traditions other than the western that really merited the term civilization at all and finally
third the developments that occurred in the west would set a challenging target for other
societies as they looked at the west and increasing western success and wondered what they might copy
for example to take an obvious one the european notion of the nation state the idea that the
state and culture should coexist proved to be very popular in other parts of the world
from the late 18th century onward but other western developments for example like new attitudes
toward children might come with somewhat greater difficulty the european package the western model
if you will was increasingly complicated and this would affect responses to western activities
in the wider world as well
lecture 22 the rise of russia
the early modern centuries saw what is incontestably a significant rise of russia
in world affairs it was also a period in which russian political and cultural patterns changed
significantly as well we need to remember and this has come up earlier in our discussions
that russia is a bit of a problem for world historians i've tried to resolve the problem
by an emphasis on russia and possibly a larger eastern european zone as a distinct civilization
part of the problem frankly stands not from world history at all but from an older tradition in
european history that saw russia treated in european history textbooks but often relegated to a
small chapter late in the section which frankly hardly does justice to the significance of russia
in this period and beyond but there are some issues here the issues are compounded indeed in
this period by new relationships that russia developed with the west itself early in the
early modern period for example russian leaders the new czars began to send emissaries to the west
and to utilize western artists and architects for example the kremlin was designed by italian
architects though using russian themes to some extent so russia's relationship with the west
is one of the issues we will have to deal with in this discussion but it was not a relationship
that involved absolute identity it remains preferable to look at russia as a separate case
we also without belaboring the point need to remember that a larger east european zone existed
even beyond russia's borders that shared with russia in some cases commitment to the orthodox
version of christianity uh commitment to agricultural systems that had some rough
points in common the issue of an east european zone of which russia was now the clear leader
is something that we need to keep in mind as we turn to developments in the early modern period
and beyond the most obvious theme and one that's important both for russia itself and for much of
the eurasian world the most obvious theme of russia in the early modern period was territorial
expansion it didn't happen all the time there were setbacks but between 1450 and 1750 russian
territory expanded steadily in several directions not yet reaching its present dimensions but without
question creating an empire of substantial size russia was indeed one of the great gun powder
empires of the early modern period in some ways over time the most successful and durable one
because elements of the empire still exist and we need to look at that that vantage point for russia
as well not totally easy to identify what factors pushed russia to expansion without question one
early one and we've touched on it before involved the issue of trying to drive the mongols further
away pressing further into central asia in order to keep the mongol threat at bay that could at
least be an initial stimulus to expansion russia was also moved at least rhetorically by the notion
that russia had become the heir to the bizantine empire the notion of russia as the third roam
first the roman empire itself then Byzantium then russia again who czar had carefully married one of
the last heiresses of the bizantine throne the the notion of russia inheriting an imperial
mantle may not have justified all the expansion but certainly provided an interesting rhetorical
cover there was also periodically and this could link to the bizantine idea there was also periodically
some sense of religious mission russia for example would frequently insist that it had had some role
to play in the middle east in defense of christianity and particularly in defense of orthodox christianity
a number of motives were at play it was also true that as the early modern period progressed
the russian state itself developed a direct stake in expansion expansion was one of the
ways the czars could justify their rule to themselves and others and many individual russians both
landowners seeking new territories particularly to the east and more ordinary russians seeking
new land opportunities themselves groups like the cossacks who were used so actively in expansion
individual groups developed a stake in expansion as well expansion again took several directions
most important during much of this period was the expansion southward into central asia
and to the borders of the ottoman empire here russia began to influence world affairs in
two fundamental ways with the third issue also interesting there was the direct contact with
the ottoman empire by the 17th and certainly the 18th centuries russian ottoman conflict recurrent
increasingly moved to the advantage of the russians and russia was involved in pressing the
ottoman empire and gradually pushing it back gaining new territories to the south and to some
extent the southeast in the process the second huge change that russia russian expansion in this
direction involved uh was the elimination at least for a long period of central asia as an
independent factor in eurasian affairs you will easily remember at so many points in our discussions
to date the nomadic groups of central asia played such a tremendous role recurrently in migrations
invasions trade connections among major societies russian expansion along with some chinese and
ottoman expansion now placed increasingly placed most of central asia under the control at least
nominally of an organized state and the independent action of central asian nomads began to diminish
central asia indeed became something of an internal colony for the russians providing
opportunities to gain raw materials gain access to products that would then feed the larger development
of the russian economy a very important development in larger world historical terms the same expansion
finally quite obviously began to produce a significant muslim minority in russia itself
the tsar during the early modern period was very careful to present himself to his muslim subjects
as a muslim ruler or at least as a ruler that operated in a muslim tradition didn't claim
to be muslim directly this partly allowed the tsar to continue to call on some of the mongol
precedents although russia was increasingly casting itself as a european state the mongol
precedent was not entirely forgotten but the interaction between the russian state the majority
russian population and this growing muslim minority was an interesting development at the time
and it obviously continues to play a major role in russian affairs to the present day the second
direction of russian expansion was obviously westward started a little later but was nevertheless
marked russia began to move into ukraine into other territories that brought it directly
into east central european affairs and by the end of the 17th century russia was playing a role in
military and diplomatic interactions with countries like sweden prussia austria-hungary some of the
major players in this part of europe and soon although more beyond more after 1750 than before
russia would assert assert a role in european diplomacy more generally this push westward
also brought new minorities into russian rule a significant jewish population was acquired
particularly as russia moved into polish territory uh german ethnic minorities played an important
role in russian activities the third direction of russian expansion was eastward across the
url mountains into syberia and ultimately even beyond this brought russia by the 18th century
into direct contact with china a mid-18th century treaty the almer river river treaty established
a border between china and russia that turned out not to be uh eternal but did indicate the
extent to which russia was now a player a minor player in east asian as well as central west asian
and european affairs and during the 18th century russia pressed beyond east asia proper into alaska
and russian explorer explorers moved south from alaska down into present-day northern california
russian expeditions trading expeditions even reached the northernmost island of hawaii
where remnants of two russian forts still exist this was clearly a truly expansionist society
creating by 1750 one of the largest land masses under single rule that had ever existed before
this expansion created and we've touched on the implicit point here already this expansion
created russia has a multinational society interestingly at the very time that western europe
was increasingly emphasizing the nation state and this multinational quality would be both a strength
and a challenge to russia from this point onward this expansion also created russia as a frontier
society an element that i think we too often forget russia had significant frontier conditions
particularly in the east but also in parts of central asia and pioneering activity cowboy-like
developments are an important part of russian history certainly by the 17th and 18th centuries
and this was one reason that in the 19th century the great french observer alexis de toqueville
would so liken developments in russia to those in the united states two giant societies two
societies exploring their frontiers a relationship that remains interesting to contemplate even again
to the present day russian expansion had one other consequence quite clearly familiar enough
from other world history expansions previously and that was the question of how to hold this
thing together two devices were particularly used in the early modern period first of all
was a strong assertion of the power of the central state and its ruler the tsar russian
for caesar again the connection with the idea of the third rome state authority authority was
widely asserted but frankly it was often fairly hollow because the key device for holding this
vast territory together or at least much of it depended on essentially an agreement between
the russian state and the landlord class both big landlords and gentry-level landlords who were
given increasing powers over russian peasants the serfs political as well as economic powers power
to run local courts power to administer justice power to punish criminals as well as power to
levy taxation and labor service this decentralization into an estate-based management provided russia
the opportunity to establish at least normal political stability even in its huge new territories
and it was not explicitly inconsistent with the idea of a powerful tsar as well so long as the tsar
and his major nobles managed to agree once in a while that agreement broke down and times of
trouble ensued but for the most part it held steady because both parties both the tsar and the
great nobles had a stake in preserving this system russian serfdom then which was a new
development in this period russian peasants in the post classical period had been relatively free
russian serfdom in this period has to be seen then as first of all a major development is in
in its own right but second as a response to political as well as economic conditions
in the later 17th century russia embarked on another pattern of change that was truly important
at the time and is fascinating in its analytical implications because it calls upon us to assess
once again the relationship between russia and other parts of europe and it calls upon us as well
to assess the first instance of a phenomenon that would show up at other places later in world
history the phenomenon of westernization the basic facts are pretty simple a new tsar in the
late 17th century peter the great decided that in order to maintain russia's military mission
in order to further russia's goals of being seen as a european power and not primarily
an asian power significant changes had to occur that would involve russia's imitation of patterns
then visible in the west peter the great clearly one of the great characters not necessarily one
of the nice characters but one of the great characters of world history almost seven feet tall
peter the great had himself traveled to the west particularly to the netherlands
he had worked as a shipbuilding artisan to learn techniques in this area and he obviously was
deeply imbued with the sense that the west had a lot to offer russia that he as tsar needed to impose
westernization reforms under peter took several directions first and these are in no particular
order of priority first were what one might call cosmetic changes but intriguing peter the great
insisted that his nobles trim off their mongol like beards and adopt western rather than asian
dress famous cartoons in the period actually see half peter himself trimming the beards
of somewhat reluctant noblemen upper-class women were also urged to dress in western fashion and
every indication is they were happier about this change than some of the men were western cultural
institutions were imported into russia notably for example the ballet fundamentally a french dance
form was imported into russia and became so deeply anchored there that obviously it became
known almost as a russian institution western art was encouraged other aspects of western cultural
presence were encouraged from peter the great onward so cultural change in the cosmetic or
aesthetic directions truly important another interesting example that i find intriguing
was the importation of the german custom of using fir trees at christmas time russia adopted the
christmas tree a century or more before it would be adopted in other parts of western europe and
the united states little things but adding up to a significant effort to switch russia's cultural
orientation in significant directions second set of changes also cultural broadly construed but with
much clearer purpose second set of changes involved efforts to improve russian education
particularly for the upper classes and russian scientific work under peter new universities
were established the state university of st st petersburg still one of the major institutions
in russia was established at the end of peter the great's reign scientific academies were set up
sometimes they debated scientific and technological changes that nobody was really interested in
implementing in russia but nevertheless an apparatus for joining russia to a broader european
scientific community an apparatus was unquestionably established peter the great decreed that all
nobles should receive training in mathematics at pain at least on paper of not being allowed to
marry if they didn't obtain an educational certificate lots of changes here designed obviously
to improve russia's scientific and technical capacity and improve the training of the people
who would serve as peter the great's bureaucrats second set of changes third set of changes were
political pretty straightforward peter the great was obviously interested in some of the new
specialization and training institutions associated with absolute monarchy in western and central
europe he developed somewhat more specialized bureaucratic services he created a state council
to oversee bureaucratic activities these were i don't mean they're a trivial but these were pretty
obvious things for a an aspiring authoritarian ruler to import to make his rule more clear cut
and finally peter the great instituted significant though not uniform military and economic changes
he established a russian navy importing western artisans and advisors to do so
he tried to improve the armament of the russian army as well as reorganizing it into somewhat
clearer cut categories of command again along partially western lines he also was eager to
organize the russian metallurgical industry taking advantage of russia's terrific holdings
in iron ore so that russia would have the economic basis for independent weapons productions
so that russia would be able to maintain a significant level of military armament at a
reasonably high technical level without having to rely on an ongoing basis on western imports
these changes added up to a desire to enhance the power of the czar
by insisting not only on new bureaucratic reforms to make the state more efficient but even by
insisting on the czar's right to cut off the beard of a nobleman what better way symbolically
to make it very clear that the nobles were subordinate to the rule of the czar than to
argue the czar could determine what they were supposed to look like so goal number one enhanced
the power of the czar and the state in what was still a fairly ineffective state apparatus
goal number two quite clear enhanced the power of the russian military so that it could indeed
play a role in european affairs and so it would have an increasing edge in its military conflicts
elsewhere particularly with the ottoman empire probably the most concrete result of russia's
westernization in this at this point was indeed to make this gunpowder empire increasingly
effective one of the reasons that it would prove so durable goal number three really intriguing
because it's something that happened at this point in russia and would happen in other places
later on goal number three was to deal with what with what one might call an embarrassment factor
with russia vis-a-vis the west peter the great obviously assumed that interchange between russia
and the west would become increasingly frequent he needed western advisors he was encouraging
western intellectual imports but in the process it became very clear that without some additional
changes russia was going to be looked at by the westerners as barbaric and backward how to deal
with this well make at least upper-class russia look increasingly western one of the interesting
specific changes that peter the great introduced for example was the elimination of a russian
tradition whereby when a young woman got married her father would hand a whip to the groom a symbol
of the transfer of male authority over women this blow for greater female independence certainly
pleased upper-class women in russia but it also was another way in which peter was trying to make
at least the appearances of upper-class society more palatable in western eyes equally important
however was what peter the great did not westernize he obviously did not import increasingly current
western ideas about constitutional monarchy the importance of parliament the importance of
division of powers this was of no interest it wasn't yet dominant in the west itself in fairness
but he could have picked it up in holland undoubtedly was aware of it no interest in it it
contradicted the purposes that he had in mind he was not interested either in any significant
reforms that affected ordinary russians he did not ameliorate the conditions of the serfs he
did not try to make russia an increasingly wage labor economy he did not try to bring cultural
change to ordinary russians he did not change the educational apparatus which was frankly minimal
of ordinary russians he did not challenge the hold of orthodox christianity on ordinary russians
because he had no interest in doing so this would have undermined his authority roused
resistances that he had no interest in in encountering perhaps most revealing of all
he clearly did not did not want to make russia a commercial kind of economy along the western
model he wanted economic change he wanted a production basis for successful and independent
military activity but he did not particularly encourage the merchant class he was content to
rely heavily on western enclaves of merchants in moscow and in his new city of st petersburg
to organize the bulk of russia's trade with the west landlords among other things would have
resisted did resist any move to enhance merchant power because they would see this as a threat to
their own social and political superiority peter's goal in fact if we could go back to the terms of
the world economy peter's goal although he didn't know the term was actually to maintain russia as
an external economy capable of producing what it needed for its own economic operation and for
its expanding military activity without depending on other areas but not seeking commercial dominance
over other areas outside of russia itself not seeking a core status in any real way at all
these developments in other words created significant change in russia the westernization
was quite real but also in an ironic way enhanced russia's differences with the west at the same
time this was a russia that did join western cultural life not yet as a major producer but
within a century it would be producing literature music and some art that entered the general
european orbit peter the great was obviously eager to enhance russia's role as a european
diplomatic and military player and this too would expand over time but again he was not interested
he was deliberately uninterested in creating a western society that would not have suited his
purposes which were quite selective and in confirming indeed enhancing the gap for example
between ordinary russians and the new russian upper classes peter the great created circumstances
that were quite different from those of the west and would have different outcomes later on most
obviously by encouraging upper class russians to be increasingly western in their ways by the middle
of the 18th century some russian noblemen did not speak russian at all they only spoke french
by increasing their westernization while confirming the inferiority and servitude of
ordinary russians peter created a social gap that was quite different from that which existed
in much of western europe there were social tensions there as well but they didn't involve
this depth of cultural divide a different product was being created finally peter the great's changes
had at least two unintended consequences that from this point onward would also
help inform russian affairs and on the whole continue to differentiate russia from the west
per se while connecting it to the west without any question first although peter's reforms did not
produce a huge outcry during his own reign his power was too great to permit this after his death
and the arrival of weaker successors a number of voices were raised against what peter had done
coming particularly from the orthodox clergy that were quite worried about the implications of
westernization but coming from some landlords and others as well the result in russia as a whole and
sometimes in the individual russian leaders themselves the result was a real ongoing ambivalence
as to what russia's relationship with the west should be should russia become more western than
peter intended some of the noblemen who now visited the west would argue yes the west was the model
and russia's mistake was simply not going far enough or should russia actually pull back
because core russian values were actually superior to those of the west
and peter the great's flirtation was in fact a great danger the ambiguity with regard to the
western relationship was something that would crop up recurrently in russian history from this
point onward early in the 19th century during the soviet era and i think arguably at the turn of
the 21st century as well it becomes a durable or at least recurrent feature of the russian cultural
character the second unintended consequence was also fascinating while peter again if i could
be permitted to use the world economic terms while peter intended russia to main to remain external
what he did encouraged actually some further involvement with russia in the european dominated
economy on terms that were not terribly favorable to russia itself most obviously despite peter the
great's interest in seeing the russian economy remain independent of the west more and more
upper class russians thirsted for western goods they wanted increasing numbers of western paintings
of the sort that would ultimately accumulate in one of the great collections of western art
anywhere in the world in st petersburg they wanted growing amounts of west of western furniture
they wanted western lecturers they wanted western access in various sorts it became a standard feature
of the life of a young nobleman to have a grand tour in the west that could last many months
even years these appetites for western type goods cost money and along with the continued need to
import certain kinds of equipment from the west created a new balance of payments of situation
in which russia was pressed increasingly to augment its export patterns to the west
by emphasizing timber products minerals and particularly grains russia became by the later
18th century and on into the 19th century one of the great grain suppliers for western markets
depending on servile labor depending on increasingly harsh servile labor in fact as
punishments and restrictions over the peasantry steadily expanded this smacked increasingly
if not of a peripheral economy at least of an economy that was somewhat peripheral not as
different say from latin america as peter the great and other russian leaders might have
aspired to this then was an important set of moves it probably did help maintain the strength
particularly the military strength of the russian imperial experiment and again of all the great
gunpowder empires created in the early modern period russia has had the most lasting success
in maintaining at least much of its expanded territories intact but these developments also
set other new currents in motion in russia that would have further effects on russia's relationship
with the wider world sometimes creating new links particularly with the west but sometimes
creating new tensions as russians might spring back against too much western linkage a process
that again would be set in motion and would crop up from time to time on into the present day
lecture 23 asian empires and a shogunate
our focus in this discussion is on asian societies during the early modern period
frankly it's a presumptuous combination this is a huge territory with all sorts of different
societies that experienced all sorts of different developments during this long period but a few
generalizations are possible and they will help round out our understanding of what was going on
during these interesting centuries one of the first things to emphasize is the extent to which
attention even brief to asian developments in the early modern period needs to fight
long-standing prejudices and stereotypes many of my students who sometimes don't seem to know
a lot about world history when they come into my class nevertheless do know that china was isolated
china was conservative and this set of characteristics seems to dominate some impressions
of china at least before recent times this was a period in which most asian societies were actively
engaged in wider connections in the world on different terms from those that operated in western
europe to be sure but actively engaged this was not in the main an isolationist period this was
not a period of economic retrenchment and the necessity of confronting some of these
misimpressions head on is one of the crucial reasons to deal with this wide-ranging topic
in a specific session we'll return at the end to the question of why it's so important to rectify
the record and many world historians have actively contributed to this task there were two big
developments again trying to look at the big picture with regard to a number of different
societies two big developments in asian societies during during the early modern period the first
which we already touched on in dealing with the absolute necessity of modifying the world
economy approach where asia is concerned the first development was increasing prosperity at least
for some groups as a result of asia's participation in producing for world markets and receiving
goods including american silver in exchange as we noted a number of asian societies were significantly
altered by this growing commercialization merchants gain new roles money use gain new roles
governments gained access to additional resources themselves so this participation
in global patterns yielding again at least selective prosperity was a significant development
in its own right confirming among other things an interest in export-based manufacture in parts of
china an interest in transmission to world markets in parts of india etc the second development
which we've also mentioned but not fully fleshed out was the emergence of a series of gunpowder
empires in much of the asian landmass we will also be dealing today with a somewhat separate set of
developments in japan which don't quite fit the gunpowder empire model but the emergence of a
number of quite solid empires operating over a considerable period of time is a really interesting
set of parallelisms in asian history during this period the new empires were three in number in
addition of course to russia which itself established a significant asian presence during this period
the new empires were three in number first came the ottomans the ottoman empire began to take shape
in the middle of the 15th century it's one of the factors that helped launch the early modern period
it extended its hold over much of southeastern europe including at the high point even hungry
it developed significant holdings in much of the middle east though not all of it it extended its
direct control to egypt and had some nominal control over other parts of north africa though not
morocco this was a major and in fact long-lasting empire it outlived the roman empire among other
things if you just count years the second empire to emerge also extremely important this one developing
in the early 16th century was the mughal empire in india the mughal empire was formed as a result of
invasions from a force that operated through afghanistan early mughal empires were empires
were extremely interested in establishing a solidly based imperial structure in india
they were frequently extremely intelligent they were interested in new ideas they were eager to
combine traditional indian practices with new elements they were explicitly extremely tolerant
in religion they utilized hindus as well as muslims in administration this was a rich period
in indian history under mughal control here too the empire expanded considerably territorially
it never controlled the entire indian subcontinent but it did command an increasing chunk in north
and central india and even attempted to some extent to reach south the third great gunpowder
empire though a smaller one was the safavid empire in persia which helped revive a sense of persian
identity and presence still muslim there was no overall cultural change here this empire had
a significant existence for a couple of centuries china of course operated according to a somewhat
different rhythm because here the imperial tradition was well established and much of the
early modern period saw the operation of the ming dynasty established a bit before the early
modern period but as we've noted briefly before the second dynasty of the early modern period and
in fact what turned out to be china's last dynasty had a few elements of gunpowder empire attached
it as well this final dynasty the ching formerly known as the manchu was organized by manchurians
coming in from northern china and while they adopted chinese institutional patterns and
culture in many ways they remained partially outsiders in their own estimation and in that
of the chinese so there was in china as well an element that was not dissimilar to the other gun
powder empires involving a an intrusion from outside helping to shape the imperial experience
more generally these empires had significant accomplishments it is obviously valid to note
as for example chinese observers have in looking back at this period it is obviously valid to note
that the developments that occurred under the gunpowder and chinese empires were not
overall quite as dynamic as those occurring in western europe asian power began relatively to
decline a little bit if measured against european power for example by 1700 european technologies
in metallurgy and in some branches of textile production were now probably superior to their
asian counterparts not yet massively superior but a balance that had been so long standing in
world history in which technological leadership and innovation centered in asia particularly east
asia and tended to move westward this balance during the early modern period was beginning to shift
toward greater western parity and even slight leadership a shift that would obviously be
compounded in the later 18th and 19th centuries so in talking about the achievements of the gun
powder empires the developments in asia in this period both economic and political it is important
to note at risk of encouraging stereotype which is not my goal it is important to note that there
was a certain shift in balance and asian developments in terms of sheer power politics and economic
dynamism were not quite keeping pace with some of the leading patterns in europe still the gun
powder empires had significant achievements to their credit some textbook approaches mentioned
the gun powder empires and then raced to their decline and we'll have to talk about their decline
at least in part as a late early modern phenomenon as well but the achievements needed to be noted
in addition the ottoman empire brought a number of developments to the middle east and south
eastern europe they obviously helped solidify and highlight a new turkish presence in the northern
middle east the fruit of my migration as well as political control but it was equally important
to note that ottoman administration was never purely turkish it had mixed a number of other
peoples including non-muslims in a tradition that actually had been well established in
earlier periods in the middle east the ottoman empire helped encourage the spread of islamic
belief to a significant minority of people in parts of southeastern europe christian groups were
tolerated for the most part there though there were some forced conversions of a group of young
military people seized as part of the ottoman military force the janissaries but the changes in
the religious map in south southeastern europe were noteworthy as well as some new antagonisms
that seemed to spring up around ottoman control ottoman relationships with arabs also deserve
attention while the ottoman empire used individual arabs as well as christians and jews in administration
on the whole the ottoman empire confirmed a somewhat dependent and inferior political status
for arabs whom many turks look down on to some extent and that pattern has to be factored in
to developments in the middle east even to contemporary times as well the ottoman empire
introduced significant cultural changes into the middle east a form of mosque develop best
illustrated by some of the great mosques of istanbul and its environs that blended actually
Byzantine architectural forms with muslim needs an interesting innovation ottoman contributions
to literature and art often in arabic were also significant political some religious
and cultural achievements then left a lasting mark on the middle east even as the ottoman
hold would begin to decline mughal contributions to india again numerous at its high point a system
of considerable tolerance and intermixture of hindu's and muslim's was a contribution though
unfortunately not an entirely lasting one mughal cultural contributions were really major the mughals
helped further persian artistic influence in india leading to new forms of portraiture the
mughals were also interested in receiving some western cultural influences not deep ones but
influences that affected a style of portrait painting and even dress in the upper classes in
mughal india much of what we rate as indian cuisine today dates from the mughal period in other
words the mughals introduced significant cultural richness into the indian tradition as well as
of course important individual symbols like the great taj mahal the mughals also arguably
further the sense not of indian unity but of the possibility of creating larger territorial units
in the indian subcontinent which of course the british would pick up and then which would feed
directly into considerable indian unity after the british rule passed this was a contribution
worth noting and the mughals also developed administrative and taxation structures that
would have long impact in india again even after the mughals themselves departed mughals were even
interested although this one didn't take in reforming certain other traditional indian practices
for example the practice of sati which they disapproved of but didn't ultimately have quite the
clout to attack directly developments in sapha vid persia again included a revival of a sense of
persian identity it was under the sapha vid empire that farce was established as the dominant
language of the region as it still is today in iran again cultural developments that go beyond the
mere fact of stating the existence of an empire and developments in ching china included again
significant participation in economic prosperity the re-elaboration of the bureaucratic imperial
state significant population expansion occurred under the very late ming and the ching dynasty
again this was a pattern of developments of considerable importance it is vital then to
recognize that during much of the early modern period largely if not entirely independent
of western influence in any cultural or political sense asian kingdoms asian empires were establishing
significant achievements that would have marks that would leave marks that outlasted the empires
themselves it is also true however that some of the gunpowder empires began to show signs of wear
as early as the late 17th early 18th centuries though here the pattern is varied and we need to
be careful of oversimple generalizations the sapha vid empire began to weaken in the early 18th
century the mughal empire began to weaken even somewhat earlier later 17th mughal empires made
what in retrospect it seems were two clear mistakes if the goal was to preserve indian vitality
and mughal rule itself in the first place several later empires began to
reverse the policy of religious tolerance began clearly to favor muslims in administration began
in some instances to attack hindu religious shrines and began to create an atmosphere of
religious mistrust that would continue to affect indian history be exacerbated by aspects of
british rule in ways that obviously have contemporary implications as well the second mistake if this
kind of historical judgment is permitted the second mistake was quite simply an effort at over
expansion the attempt to press mughal boundary southward led to significant military expenditure
the amassing of vast armies including elephant forces uh sometimes successful but at real expense
to the taxation base and indeed the basic economic vitality of india as a whole by the 18th century
mughal hold over india was beginning to fade in favor of local princes the revival of that
tradition of localism so frequent in indian politics indian economic prosperity was declining
indian cultural and educational apparatus was in some disarray as well and of course it was in
this context late 18th late 17th but particularly 18th centuries that european powers ultimately
headed by the english began to interfere increasingly successfully in indian affairs the british and
particularly the british east india company was able to take advantage of growing mughal weakness
to establish a growing british beachhead in the continent itself the british were able to develop
alliances with other indian rulers hostile to each other or hostile to the mughals that further
british rule without the commitment of vast forces the later 18th century saw the increasing
conversion of much of india to essentially a british colony a huge change obviously in indian
history a huge expansion of european imperial presence taking shape at the end of the early
modern period the ottoman empire presents a different picture although europeans sometimes
tried to argue that it wasn't as different as might seem the ottoman empire undoubtedly reached a
high point in the late 16th and 17th centuries a last effort at territorial expansion occurred in
the 1680s as ottoman troops twice attacked vienna hoping to press farther into central europe these
attacks failed and from that point onward the ottomans suffered a periodic series of territorial
setbacks partly at the hands of austro-hungarians who pressed the empire back from the hapsburg
territories but even more at the hands of the russians in patterns that we discussed in our
previous session ottoman territorial setbacks obviously pressed the empire in other ways it
became harder to reward um loyal top bureaucrats and generals many parts of the empire became
increasingly parceled out among chief administrators who might melt the province for personal advantage
corruption and economic dislocation increased but the ottoman empire was still in many ways
quite healthy and would remain healthy well into the 19th century it wasn't as vibrant as it had
been before on the other hand in no sense was it on its last legs but there was one further
development that was interesting as well by the 18th century sensing ottoman weakness and also
undoubtedly exploiting an older prejudice against islam european opinion began to decide that the
ottoman rule was both sick and weak and this european impression that this was an empire cruel
to its subjects cruel to women but also on its last legs was a perception that would create a
reality of its own during the 19th century and affect europe's relations with the middle east
in its own right developments in china much more complex in most respects in fundamental respects
the chinese state and economy remained quite vigorous up until the 1830s for example it was only
in the 1830s and 40s that the european balance of payment situation vis-a-vis china finally altered
so that europe began to be able to take precious metals from china rather than paying them in in
return for chinese goods but there were some signs they they were modest this is a state that's still
vigorous and successful there were some signs of trouble probably by the 18th century china was
beginning to be burdened by overpopulation fed by new food supplies at an overpopulation that
could require so many resources to sustain itself that it would affect larger economic dynamism
and economic growth certainly china ceased being even apart from its relative position vis-a-vis
europe china ceased being a source of major technological innovation at this point there's
some sense as well that cultural creativity lagged somewhat chinese intellectuals were still
vigorously reproducing earlier literary forms and discussing confucian traditions this was
not a cultural collapse but new influences new interpretations of older themes probably declined
somewhat the empire may also have been affected by excessive bureaucratization excessive levels of
paperwork that made decision-making difficult that made communication with the provinces provinces
sometimes cumbersome again none of this would come home to roost still for several decades
but in retrospect we can see some possible signs of trouble one thing is clear particularly with
regard to china and the ottoman empire a possible source of renewal which russia was pursuing albeit
amid complexity as we discussed in our previous session a possible source of renewal was not
pursued and that was the possibility of selectively looking at developments in the west as a pattern
for certain kinds of possible reforms china in fact which had been open to modest west western
missionary activity in much of the early modern period which had been interested as somewhat of
a curiosity but a bit more than that in western developments such as clocks and other scientific
discoveries chinese openness to even modest western presence definitely turned sour in the
early 18th century with increasing restrictions on missionaries persecutions of small groups of
chinese christians this was not a path that china chose to take participation in trade
remained vigorous but there was if anything a retreat from an interest in contacts of other
sorts the ottoman empire which was even more aware of developments in the west because individual
ottomans traveled frequently to western europe there was no barrier of communication here at all
the ottoman empire also rather systematically avoided the possibility of influential contacts
with the west for example the printing press which had obviously been established in western europe
long since the printing press was banned from the ottoman empire until toward the middle of the 18th
century when it was first allowed only for christians not for muslims and the reason obviously was not
just blanket rejection of the west the reason obviously was a government desire to make sure
as sure as possible that it had control over access to information and ideology gradually
this was loosened but pretty late in the game the only western influence that was directly
incorporated by ottoman rulers interestingly enough were western doctors who were called upon
to service the ottoman court even though as far as one can determine they were no more effective
in actual medical practice than were the physicians in the rich traditions of the middle east a sort
of cultural fad that had no clear practical basis we have then a situation in the great states of
asia in which during most of the early modern period significant vigor developed significant
achievements were registered but in a pattern in which gains were somewhat overshadowed as we now
know by the greater vigor of developments in the west and we have a situation where markedly to
tentatively certain signs of absolute decline begin to show as well there's one final case
that deserves attention that actually to some extent interestingly contrasts with the gunpowder
empire developments we've been emphasizing thus far the early modern period was a crucial one
in japanese history as we've discussed previously after some flirtation with western contacts
japanese leaders decided at the end of the 16th century largely to close off contacts not entirely
but largely and emphasize a pattern of internal economic political and cultural development
this was the period that becomes known as the tokugawa shogunate which would last until 1868
under the tokugawa shogunate feudalism persisted the ritual apparatus of feudalism was carefully
preserved along with the social privileges of feudal lords but alongside feudalism and in fact
more effective than feudalism began to be the apparatus of a small but definite central state
serviced by its own bureaucracy not feudal vassals and capable of reducing in most cases
eliminating internal warfare providing increasing political unity which was in turn the framework
for the rather successful expansion of commercial activity within japan that we have discussed
before this was obviously a significant and as it turned out fairly durable political change in
japanese affairs that marked increasing political effectiveness and a de facto modification of
feudalism that was quite significant cultural change accompanied this development as well
even though japan's intense interactions with china were things of the past
the japanese actually during this early modern period turned increasingly toward confucianism
buddhism survived and could be vigorous in some instances the more traditional religion of
shintoism survived as well though it probably faded somewhat but cultural emphases shifted
increasingly to a japanese version of confucianism that had two consequences that would be significant
for the future as well consequence number one was simply an increasing secularization of japanese
culture not an entire secularization but as confucianism spread this worldly concerns began
to predominate in japanese culture along by the way with some interesting new artistic forms that
would mark further steps in japanese cultural identity as well the second implication of the
japanese version of confucianism though it became fully clear only in the first half of the 19th
century was an increasing commitment to the importance of education not just for a confucian
upper class but for broader bands of society and what we would call the middle classes and even
somewhat below japanese confucianism ended up not immediately but over time ended up encouraging
an educational commitment that would lead japan to be the second society after that of the west
in literacy rates by the early 19th century a very interesting pattern that again reflects
considerable cultural dynamism in japan itself these patterns in japan obviously differed from those
in other parts of east asia particularly china the shogunate emphasized a growing importance of
the central state but feudalism was still quite real japanese version of confucianism was somewhat
distinctive particularly in its ultimate educational emphasis japanese population policy or japanese
population behavior was also somewhat distinctive during the 18th century japanese population did
not grow massively did not overcome available resources as was beginning to be suggested in
china a very fairly extensive use of abortion among other things seems to have limited japanese
population growth and most interestingly of all for the future the japanese in the 18th century
began to become slightly more open to outside influence rather than less decisions were made
to exploit the contacts with dutch merchants and what was called the dutch school of translators
in japan people who learned dutch in order to have the capability of interaction with the europeans
this contact was exploited to allow the translation of scientific and medical works into japanese
not other works yet but an indication that the japanese were sufficiently aware of what was
going on in the outside world that they saw that there was a need to take at least some opportunity
to figure out what these developments might pretend for japan itself the patterns that we've
been discussing don't overturn conventional views of asian history in the early modern period entirely
again relative decline is undeniable as long as it doesn't overwhelm an understanding that
there were important positive developments during much of this period asia was not simply sitting
around waiting for western control and guidance this was a series of independent kingdoms capable
of significant achievements specific decline of specific regimes most notably in mughal india
has to be registered as well but the larger sense that somehow this was a crucial period in which asia
began to be backward isolated whatever the term this sense is simply wrong which leads to one final
question why care world historians particularly experts on asia and the world economy have vigorously
insisted that we need to redress this impression of asian economic inferiority backwardness etc
and i think the reasons are twofold one is presumably it's better to be accurate than not
and when we have knowledge of things like chinese acquisition of new world silver
we need to exploit it because otherwise we're simply pandering to error and i guess i would
argue that in itself is a bad thing but point two we need to redress this impression because it's so
panders to older western prejudices about asian characteristics it reflects a very brief sense
of western superiority if we realize that asia remained a vital contributor to world history
up until at least the 18th and even into the 19th centuries and then would again become a vital
contributor to world history by the 20th century the period of asian eclipse if that's even an
appropriate term is very brief indeed and this we have to know whatever our views about historical
accuracy as a means of understanding western asian relations and asian concerns about western opinion
even in the present day
lecture 24 the long 19th century
in this session we introduced the next major period in world history which runs from about
1750 until 1914 the term that is increasingly used for this period is borrowed from a british
historian eric hobsbaum the long 19th century obviously pretty long but nevertheless focused
on the 19th century this period shades off from the early modern period in several ways although
as i mentioned before there's no decisive break in the first place two of the features of the
early modern period now no longer really have much effect in world affairs the columbian exchange
had set up some enduring population patterns but the immediate effects of the columbian exchange
are long gone by the later 18th century except again in the pacific region where something
of the same phenomenon was repeating itself the formation of the gunpowder empires at least the
land-based gunpowder empires is also no longer a dominant theme because and this began to unravel
in the late early modern period itself many of the gunpowder empires are now in increasing
trouble or vanishing all together so two early modern themes are pretty well gone
on the other hand two themes persist recognizably one is the rise of the west which continues and
even accelerates vis-a-vis other societies in the long 19th century and two is the shape of the
world economy which in fact becomes clearer during this period as well this then is conventionally
taken as a new period i once tried to combine it with the early modern but the convention
simply worked against it and it does have some new features in addition to redefine continuities
from the early modern the two big developments and they're closely linked the two big developments
that frame the long 19th century beginning in the later 18th century itself are one the emergence
of the industrial revolution and two it's brief but decisive monopoly by the west the industrial
revolution is in and of itself a great big deal it introduced a new economic form as decisively
different from agriculture as agriculture was from hunting and gathering with industrialization
human productive power increased vastly primarily because of the use of fossil fuels
and other sources of power than humans and animals industrialization was a big deal because it
concentrated work and people in factories and cities not surprisingly industrial societies
fairly quickly britain was the first in 1850 reached a 50 mark of urbanization which by the way
the world as a whole just reached in 2006 but an indication of the ongoing trend the industrial
revolution was a big deal because it transformed even intimate aspects of life for example childhood
childhood in agricultural economies as we emphasized was mainly focused on work and briefly
in the industrial revolution that pattern might seem to continue but pretty quickly it was realized
that childhood and work in the factories did not mix so childhood was redefined yet again
as meaning primarily schooling something that we're still assimilating even today almost every
aspect of life was touched by the industrial revolution and as it began to take shape first
in britain then in other parts of western europe in the united states late 18th early 19th centuries
this does call attention to a major marker but the second point is ultimate is is is equally crucial
the long 19th century itself is shaped not only by the industrial revolution but by the extent
to which for a brief time western societies monopolized the process again brevity is crucial
here ultimately it is absolutely vital to see the industrial revolution as a global phenomenon
in which all parts of the world participate such that the european lead is again
a brief and ultimately probably not terribly significant one but for the long 19th century itself
the enhancement of european power by industrialization and by the fact that most other societies
simply did not move immediately in an industrialization direction this set a framework to which every
society had in one way or another to react even in its european monopoly the industrial revolution
was already in crucial ways global it was caused in part by global connections europeans industrialized
in part because they'd already learned that an emphasis on producing processed goods was a good
way to make money in the world economy producing processed goods in factories simply enhanced
and augmented that advantage global relationships also had helped pile up capital in european
coffers that was available for the expensive modest by contemporary standards but by the
standards of time quite expensive investments in industrial apparatus industrialization had a
global impact also immediately for example in causing the deindustrialization of local industries
in places as different as india and latin america as british and european and american factories
poured out cheap manufactured goods particularly textiles hundreds of thousands of domestic workers
in places like venezuela or india were thrown out of work obviously forcing crucial economic
adjustments in these regions as well as in the in the industrial societies themselves industrialization
european monopoly shape the period in crucial respects
two influences flow directly in the first place as europe increasingly industrialized
it enhanced its demands on other parts of the world to produce cheap raw materials and foods
and to accept increasingly expensive manufactured products or at least increasingly available
manufactured products in other words it increased the extent to which core and peripheral or somewhat
peripheral relationships began to predominate not just in the atlantic economy which really had been
the main focus of the early modern period but worldwide latin america for example and we'll
explore this a little more fully in a later session latin america already a peripheral economy saw more
and more land and more and more workers poured into production for export now not just of silver
and sugar though these continued but also coffee also rubber also fertilizer also a variety of
products that still depended on low cost that still yielded a fairly modest profit to the
society as a whole though still consider considerable wealth for individual business people or land
owners this relationship already established was now vastly extended and as the relationship was
extended the gap between core societies and peripheral societies widened as well for example
in 1800 the average mexican had a standard of living about two-thirds that of the average
citizen of the new united states in 1900 because the average american in a core society became wealthier
and the average mexican in a peripheral society became poorer that relationship was one-third a
really significant change reflecting movement in both directions africa was now deeply affected
by the world economy with an interesting and in some ways unexpected twist the 19th century and
we'll explore this more fully in the next session the 19th century abolished the slave trade and
significantly limited therefore the principal african sale to the world economy in the early
modern period yet african attachment to the receipt of european goods guns etc continued thus
resulting in an african scramble to identify other products that might sell in the world market
such as vegetable oil palm oil cotton other products not always totally suitable to the
african environment products that also again demanded larger amounts of cheap labor such
that for a moment ironically slavery actually expanded in 19th century africa itself every
part of the world was touched by this relationship either becoming more peripheral in the first
place or expanding peripheral characteristics as was the pattern in latin america european
and american thirst for cheap goods ultimately including even some cheap manufactured products
their capacity to pay for these goods with an outpouring of manufactured products of their
own set the world economic relationship into a global framework the second consequence and it
really does relate pretty closely to industrialization the second consequence of this new pattern
was an extension of european or western military advantage from the seas to the land as well
sea-based power remained crucial this was the dominant source of western military threat
in the early modern period and it obviously expands with better guns larger ships steam ships etc
but now a series of developments also opened up the possibility of land-based military dominance
as well these innovations included the development of smaller and more mobile
field artillery already used before industrialization outright for example by napoleon in the french
revolutionary wars the developments included the early 19th century emergence of the repeating
rifle and the possibility which both british and american inventors helped develop the the
possibility of producing this repeating rifle through the standard standardization of parts
on a mass scale developments included by the middle of the century the emergence of early
forms of the machine gun i.e these developments made it possible for small numbers of western
troops sometimes literally a few score to hold off sometimes several thousands even tens of thousands
of troops armed in more conventional fashion as would occur in the european imperialist burst
in africa land-based military advantage was enhanced as well by transportation improvements
steam ships and in a few cases railroads allowed westerners to ship troops and materiel long
distances in fairly rapid order and obviously the telegraph by providing communication links as well
contributed here river boats steam driven now could plow up river which was critically important
for european military penetration both of china and of africa and though more in the later 19th
century the development of new tropical medicines added another ingredient that facilitated western
military interaction with key parts of the world add these things two things together
and one has first a series of major crises in which the new western military edge over other
societies was demonstrated crises that also quickly turned into larger patterns of economic
exploitation as well event number one 1798 napoleon briefly freed from much to do back in europe
takes a french expeditionary force and invades egypt conquering egypt fairly easily he doesn't
stay there because the british chased him out but the ease with which european forces could
conquer one of the heartland areas of the islamic world was not lost on egyptians or on the ottomans
more generally they didn't quite know what to do about it but the balance between european military
authority and middle eastern military power had clearly been dramatically altered crisis number two
the first opium war in china 1839 the british finally in the 1830s found a good that they
could produce quite easily other than simply transporting new world silver that would get
them access to chinese markets this good was opium produced in british territories in india
the british insisted that the chinese accept opium and open their markets more generally
the chinese government weak now but still with some voice resisted british demands and the result
was a conflict in which british and other western troops easily overcame chinese forces and pride
open at least began to pry open this market both for opium which was the widest selling single good
in the 19th century world trade and for european and western activities more generally crisis number
three in 1853 an american fleet under admiral perry sailed into ito bay in japan tokyo bay
and demanded that the japanese opened their markets to western goods this would was followed
not only by another american expedition but by a british expedition in 1854 and after considerable
internal turmoil the japanese did indeed decide that they had no choice but open and indeed in an
in an unusually constructive reaction would launch a process of reform that went well beyond
simple response to western demands crisis number four 1854 five the russians had successfully
achieved another territorial victory over the ottomans and were poised to pry more ottoman
territory away britain and france objected for various reasons including british fear about
increasing russian interference with british contacts with india and britain and france went to
war against russia in the Crimea essentially literally in russia's backyard and although this
was not an easy conflict lots of losses on both sides the west again won the power of industrial
production industrial transportation industrial technology applied to the military area now made
it clear that even russia was clearly behind and then a series of military explosions and penetrations
from the 1860s onward particularly in africa also in additional areas of the pacific etc
there were few parts of the world that europe tried to enter militarily where it failed the
leading one ironically was afghanistan for most parts of the world either direct military penetration
or the successful threat of this penetration now reshape the world at least again briefly
to the west's advantage this was of course the century of imperialism a familiar label
but it can be taken even more deeply what happened fundamentally really was a simplification
of the world economic patterns we've described previously two changes were crucial one we've
touched on already and that was the intensification of the exploitation of the bulk of the world not
now just parts of the world but the bulk of the world by core societies now increasingly including
the united states but the second change and here's where the military part comes in the second change
was the effective elimination of externality no major society could now stay external because
the west through military pressure if not economic cajoling simply wouldn't allow it thus
societies that had regulated western contacts previously like china now found themselves
incapable of maintaining this regulation societies that had sought partial isolation previously
like japan and korea now find that they are not allowed to do this either with a very very small
number of exceptions the world is open to the western dominated world economy for a brief
series of decades in this framework which really was if you will an intensification a redefinition
but intensification of patterns that had already been sketched to some degree in the early modern
period in this framework two or three other components get added in the long 19th century
that need attention as well first of all this was of course at least the early part of the
long 19th century not only an age of early industrialization and its global impact not
only an age of new imperialistic military activities but also an age of atlantic revolutions
beginning in the 1770s a series of risings occurred in various parts of the atlantic world
in north america in parts of western europe in latin america that would extend from the 1770s
on to 1848 49 creating new political regimes new attention to ideologies of liberty
legal and possibly even social and economic equality a whole series of new ideological
thrusts that brought important new political ideas and concrete illustrations of those ideas
into the world stage it isn't entirely easy to talk about how this other important initiative
fully matches the larger framework that was shaped by industrialization and western military
dominance because frankly many of the revolutionary ideals sincerely espoused by europeans themselves
didn't clearly fit the kinds of relationships that europe was also forging with places in asia
and africa after all if the new battle cry was freedom and political participation imperialism
was a denial of freedom at least in many respects and clearly a denial of political participation
so that there was a long lag on a global basis between the emergence of new revolutionary
thrusts and truly global impact atlantic impact quite clear and this is an important aspect of
the long 19th century but global impact in a way would turn out to be greater in the 20th century
than in the long 19th because it's in the 20th century that various kinds of revolutionaries
and reformers would utilize the ideologies of the revolutionary west or the revolutionary
atlantic world to help spur national independence movements social revolutions this sort of thing
so this is a category of developments in the long 19th century we don't want to forget about it
and we will indeed see one clear impact in our next discussion of slavery and abolitionism
but it doesn't totally fit the patterns that we're indicating somewhat more general and we
will return to this one also in greater detail but we can have a first stab on it now somewhat more
general was another new global theme has to be phrased carefully but i think it's a valid one
another new global theme of a need to figure out how to respond to the west western power by the
middle of the 19th century was so palpable was so unavoidable that virtually every major society
or some segment of it had to begin discussing what are we going to do about it how can we get rid of
the west resist the west and what do we need to change in order to do so and what do we need to
change that might imitate at least aspects of western development itself for the opportunity
to regain or preserve some degree of regional independence an early illustration of this
new sense of a need to change in order to resist the west occurred in the aftermath of napoleon's
invasions occurred in egypt where a new leader in the early 19th century muhammad ali effectively
moved egypt toward de facto independence from the ottoman empire and undertook a path of reform
that he hoped would bring industrialization and modern political and economic conditions to egypt
allowing it to retain independence from the west which was otherwise clearly threatened
muhammad ali sent scores of egyptian students to european schools to learn engineering modern
science and other technologies he sought to encourage egyptian industry he sought to encourage
new kinds of cash crops in egyptian agriculture such as cotton it was an extremely interesting
effort but it was also extremely interesting that this early attempt largely failed western pressure
the limits of resources in egypt itself tended to confine the durable results of this reform
movement to the production of new cash crops that could serve the world market egyptian industrialization
was not in the cards at this point but again it was a revealing episode slightly later the
ottoman empire itself would undertake patterns of reform seeking to redo its constitutional
structure to at least admit some new types of political institutions in the western model
seeking to streamline its bureaucracy seeking to create a more efficient forward-looking bureaucracy
seeking to improve and modernize its educational system again these reform movements which crested
in the late 1830s and again in the 1870s had mixed results they were not ungenuine but they
obviously also did not move the ottoman empire to a position of reversing its pattern of difficulty
in face of western interference and objections russia would launch a major reform movement
beginning with the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 leading not only to this emancipation but to
significant new local political institutions reforms of russian law toward a reduction in the
severity of punishments codification of law efforts to spur industrialization and by the 1890s
russia was indeed launched in a significant industrialization process one of the first
such processes to take hold outside of the west proper reform in other words was in the air
however and this is where the complexity has to enter in well i think it is fair to say that
world history in the long 19th century particularly the second half of the long 19th 19th century
is partly framed not just in terms of new western industrial power and military interference
but in terms of efforts at reform and reaction it is important to recognize two things first of all
western power affected different regions differently some were held like india and
increasingly africa as outright colonies some were simply targets of interference like china
and people have debated whether it wasn't actually better for a while to be a colony
than to be a target of of external exploitation the way china was european contact varied so did
traditions and 19th century conditions china although this is not really totally predictable
from earlier chinese history china responded slowly and long inadequately to the reform pressure
and only in the 1890s does a real reform movement begin to catch hold in china this is again partly
because of traditional resentment of of outside interference and models partly because of the
outside interference itself partly because chinese governments at this point were exceptionally
ineffective in one of those downward spins in the chinese political process that occurred
periodically this was obviously quite a different response from that of russia or japan a comparison
that will take up a bit later and even from the ottoman empire responses varied and it is vitally
important to recognize this variety and recognize that even at the crest of european power world
history needs to be seen in terms of interactions and not simply imposition nowhere even in its
starkest colonial holdings did the west simply impose conditions on other societies there were
always reactions always combinations always resistances and in this sense the richness
of world history the need for comparison and variety continues quite strong even in a century
that in broad outline seems particularly simple i.e imperialism and european dominance one final
facet of the long 19th century i think is worth mentioning even though frankly it's a subordinate
theme and that was the tentative emergence of new kinds of international institutions and
arrangements that accompanied industrialization and the increasing increasingly global qualities
of the world economy let me mention a couple of particularly salient developments it was soon
after the middle of the 19th century for example that the universal postal union was formed a
series of agreements dominated by western players speaking on behalf of the whole world
that allowed individual nations to agree on how to transmit mail from one society to the next
we now obviously pretty much take international postal service for granted except in times of chaos
or revolution but it's really only in the later 19th century that this international facility
came into being it was soon after the 1860s as well that the international red cross formed
initially again a western organization primarily but one that began to help set standards not just
for medical activities during wartime but for broader agreements that other societies would
gradually adhere to that at least on paper sought to regulate some of the worst effects
of modern war particularly in areas such as treatment of the wounded and treatment of prisoners
other international agreements allowed obviously technological developments such as the laying of
undersea cables etc western dominated in one sense a facet of imperialism itself the fact
that international agreements were beginning to come into being and one could mention also at
the very end of the 19th century the emergence of a new world court in the Hague these developments
were at least preliminary hints of a partial international political structure that was
itself a marked innovation international connections were also furthered of course
by the development of not only of new technologies but of new transportation arrangements the cutting
of two great canals in the long 19th century first the Suez and then the Panama were huge
developments facilitating international contact and trade this obviously fits the world the spread
of the world economy model but it deserves separate notice because again you're talking about new
kinds of global connections that could go beyond trade the 1880s again toward the end of the long
19th century the 1880s saw the emergence of a new series of private international non-governmental
organizations dealing with issues such as women's rights white slavery problems of this sort and
again we'll touch on some of this in our next session as well this first spate of what we would
now call international NGOs was another sign that people always first from the west because the west
was the dominant player still that people were beginning to think in terms of new kinds of
international connections that would relate to the world economy that but that would go well
beyond it new patterns of cultural contacts are intriguing at the end of the long 19th century
the first real sign of a new kind a new potential for what we would now call a global consumer
culture emerges in the final decade of the 19th century in the beginnings of the internationalization
of several key western sports most notably from britain soccer which begins to spread to
latin america to parts of asia and by the 1920s a little bit after our period literally the whole
world on its way to becoming the world's most agreed upon international sport also in the late
19th century the beginnings of the spread of american baseball to latin america and the caribbean
but also to japan a japanese baseball team defeated an american navy team in the mid 1890s to the great
delight of the japanese to korea and elsewhere these developments seemingly sort of trivial
are another sign that a final facet of the long 19th century that needs to be noted beneath the
surface of exploitation imperialism etc a final facet is the beginnings of the emergence of new
kinds of global connections and contacts some of them institutional some time some of them new
evidences of international cultural interaction that would gain a life of their own and help shape
the next period in world history as well let me emphasize finally the brevity of this
long 19th century particularly the extent to which many crucial developments spread not just
through the whole long 19th century but in its final half or two-thirds this is a story of western
dominance it is a story of western economic and military controls that are striking that make this
period at least superficially unusually simple but again it's also brief the reason we end the
period in 1914 though we'll have to talk about this more in a subsequent discussion the reason we
end this period in 1914 is not just because of the dramatic fact of world war one but because it was
during and as a result of world war one that this kind of easy western dominance in the world at large
began to come to an end a few decades very interesting very important we live with their
legacy still but a few decades only these lectures are part of the great courses series
they are produced by the teaching company these lectures are titled a brief history of the world
part three lecture 25 abolition of slavery and serfdom
one of the big changes in world history during the long 19th century actually starting in the
late 18th and extending to 1914 and even beyond was a process through which formal slavery was
abolished throughout really the entire world and attacks were also made on the harshest forms of
serfdom though there were more survivals here this change deserves attention for several reasons
in the first place big picture slavery as has been obvious from our discussions
was one of the oldest institutions in human society because of capture in war because of
inherited status because of greedy seizure of other people even in one's own society the patterns
varied but the impulse to try to gain ownership over other people and their labor obviously goes
deep in the human experience the century that brought this institution to a close deserves
significant attention in this longer perspective the development in the 19th century also demands
attention in some ways the abolition of slavery in the 19th century although of course we know
what happened might seem counterintuitive after all in many ways this was a century in which
exploitative economic practices increased the world economy extended and with it efforts to get
peripheral societies to produce cheap goods with cheap labor obviously we now have to note that
even though the concept of peripheral economies remains valid as we discussed previously we
now have increasingly to detach it from literally coercive labor which is one of the definitional
characteristics in the early modern period so what we need to do in charting this really
significant change is talk about the issue of causation particularly given the fact that once
we understand slavery's deep roots and understand the exploitative economic relationships that dominate
many other aspects of world history in the long 19th century causation doesn't spring to mind
immediately and almost inevitably it has been much debated and then after dealing with causation
talk a little bit about the process because although changes began early the british for example
worked to abolish atlantic slave trade after 1808 although changes began early the process really
stretched through the whole period and as i've already indicated slopped over slightly into the
20th century as well and then we need to talk about consequences because here too predictably
although slavery really was abolished and that really is an historical change the actual consequences
were messy diverse globally involved and equally inevitably the results were perhaps not quite as
benign as some of the proponents of abolition might have hoped the beginnings of arguments against
slavery they weren't brand new in the long 19th century but the beginnings of arguments against
slavery began to take shape particularly coherently in the final decades of the 18th century two
sources predominated in places like england the netherlands france scandinavia and increasingly
some sectors of opinion in british north america two sources predominated first were maverick or
new protestant religious groups methodists for example and quakers particular among them who
used christianity as it had not been used in the early modern period to argue that the enslavement
of other people was immoral improper and must be ended combining with this sometimes in the same
individual sometimes in separate groups was the force of enlightenment thinking the kind of thinking
that went into the revolutionary wave of the late 18th early 19th centuries as well enlightenment
arguments could certainly be used against slavery enlightenment thinkers tended to stress the
fundamental equality of all human beings they tended to target exploitation of which slavery
was the worst example they sometimes could add also utilitarian arguments that slavery was not
only wrong but inefficient in a society that ought to be bent on uh more effective motivations
for labor and productivity agitation in anti-slavery groups took a number of forms it wasn't a constant
force from the late 18th to the early 19th century but periodically waves of outrage would develop
huge petitions were signed in england and other places against slavery practices pressing the
british government to act against slavery internationally and particularly of course
to act against slavery in the british colonies these petitions on occasion could command an
amazing percentage of urban populations for example in some of the new factory centers
in great britain along with petitions came efforts to educate larger numbers of people
in the evils of slavery plays pamphlets ultimately for example materials literary
materials like uncle tom's cabin which was widely popularized not only in the united states but also
western europe these materials were used to help bring additional people into the anti-slavery crusade
boycotts were even sketched although they probably weren't terribly effective but an
interesting tactic in which people were urged to identify goods like sugar that were slave produced
and try to find alternatives this was a major campaign and it obviously gradually had effects
the french revolution added fuel to the fire french revolutionary principles obviously building
from the enlightenment also argued against slavery and during the radical phase of the
of the revolution legislation was introduced to abolish slavery in the french colonies during
the 1790s also the great hasian revolution which was a revolution both against french colonial
control and against slavery added force to the anti-slavery arguments obviously illustrating the
capacity of former slaves to rise against the institution and build a new society also possibly
increasing fears in slave-owning sectors that protest might attack the institution directly
as well if something new was not undertaken the key innovation in all this and this is certainly
one cause of this huge historical change the key innovation in all this was what several
historians have identified as a new kind of humanitarian thinking again could derive from
maverick strands of christianity or the enlightenment or both and the key principle here
was that moral concern could and should now extend to situations that were distant from
one's own that involve people that were different from oneself that involve people who not might
not even share one's own religion the great world religions had obviously already permitted
concern about distant others if they were in your religion concerned about christians in the holy
land concern about conditions among muslims as other muslims learned about them on the great
pilgrimage to mecca but this new humanitarian thinking went even beyond this to suggest a moral
responsibility for unjust conditions virtually anywhere in the world of which slavery now seemed
to be the most obvious and the most objectionable this was an important force and it had ready
audience the concern about morality also spread to other areas for example at the end of the 18th
century some russian nobles like a man named radishev who had traveled in the west and who
knew enlightenment thinking and sometimes had some familiarity with the french revolution as well
thinkers like radishev wrote convincingly against russian serfdom on two grounds first it was
inefficient radishev turd the russian countryside and argued that serfs simply did not work very
hard for their masters but when they were allowed to work on their own plots of land on sundays for
example they worked extremely productively russian economy would be better off so this argument meant
went if serfdom were abolished but again the moral component was here as well regardless of
economic efficiency radishev argued russian serfdom was evil and should be dropped radishev's writings
were not published tatham the great prevented this they were indeed published only after the 20th
century communist revolution but the attack was revealing it showed the potential for certain
kinds of thinking that initially developed in the west to spread more broadly the actual pattern
of emancipation and abolition was gradual and varied the french revolution for france itself
and for surrounding territories abolished serfdom permanently in much of western europe the abolition
of serfdom would extend into central germany and austria through the revolutions of 1848 the
institutions seemed to be incompatible with modern enlightenment style political principles as noted
britain sponsored an abolition of the atlantic slave trade in 1808 some trade still got through
british blockades but effectively the big days of the slave trade were over britain abolished
slavery in the colonies in colonies like jamaica in 1833 the french revolution of 1848
extended the attack on slavery in the french colonies slavery was clearly on the ropes
in some of the latin american independence wars in the early 19th century for example in mexico
the abolition of slavery was part of this process of revolt although in the bigger slave holding
societies in latin america emancipation occurred noticeably later russia moved against serfdom
in 1861 and a major emancipation there deserves comparison with abolition movements in other
societies the argument obviously was humanitarian in part in part based on a sense that russian
social conditions were lagging behind the standards of the civilized world i.e the west
and the embarrassment factor once again russia needed to improve its standing by ridding itself
of this awful institution but a more pragmatic motive was clearly involved as well the defeat
of russia in the crimian war convinced many russian leaders that the institution of serfdom
was um a drawback to russian economic and military performance russia needed a more
flexible labor supply one that could move around at greater need as economic resources and demands
required the question of why this occurred has obviously bedeviled historians and it is not
easy to resolve it we know one component there is simply no doubt that the points already made
the emergence of new kinds of humanitarian arguments and effective political campaigns
based on these arguments involving the mobilization of public opinion the use of petitions educational
campaigns etc we know that this was a factor but not surprisingly many types of historians have
concerned that too much emphasis on humanitarianism might be over simple might lead to a conclusion
that somehow the west had found a conscience in a period when in other respects the west was hardly
pure as the driven snow so other options have been sought and they need to be explored as well
additional argument number one slavery was slavery and harsh serfdom were uneconomical
on the whole historians who have analyzed this argument and it's it's a powerful argument
have concluded that it's probably incorrect that this was not a major motive for abolition
slavery was still very economically effective in producing sugar this was the height of the
use of slavery for cotton production the the crassist economic reasons for ending slavery
probably don't apply although larger considerations like those for example in post-crimean Russia
larger considerations about the need for greater labor mobility may still have operated whether
they were correct or not some historians have even demonstrated looking looking at the american south
that you could easily even have applied slavery to the creation of factory industry although this
was not widely done the notion that slavery died because it was economically ineffective
is probably overall a non-starter but it has been asserted a more circuitous self-interest argument
does also merit consideration some people have argued that some of the moral fervor devoted to
attacks on slavery were designed to distract industrial workers in centers like northern
england from their own plight get them excited about the conditions of distant peoples get
them outraged against distant planters and maybe they'll forget about the fact that their own
conditions were really pretty vile uh whether this is whether this was deliberately understood
or not can be debated but i suspect that one has to grant there was an element here in which people
were directing morality against distant evils as a convenient means of ignoring evils under their
own noses uh the evils may have been greater it is also important to note that the atlantic system
the american system of slavery was a particularly harsh and degrading form of slavery compared to
slave situations earlier in world history in the classical world or the islamic middle east
for example so we don't want to forget that this was a um a real set of atrocities that were being
addressed that some of the propaganda about abusive slaves was based on grim reality but
we don't have to rely on humanitarian sentiment alone there may have been other factors another
factor that must be considered is the concern about slave revolts or individual acts of defiance
by individual slaves the abolition of slavery except in a few important single instances
like eighty the abolition of slavery did not directly result solely from slave protest but
we want to remember that slaves were active in their own behalf that former slaves like
Frederick Douglass in the american north were eloquent in their attacks on this institution
and their voices and their protest or potential protest needed to be added to the to the mix as
well finally and actually i think this has been underdeveloped in the larger exploration of causes
of the demise of slavery we also must keep in mind the larger global demographic context
in the 19th century population rates were increasing although at different speeds in most
parts of the world and this meant and we'll see the application of this more fully in a moment
this meant that there were now alternatives to slavery in terms of sources of of relatively
available and frankly fairly cheap labor you could call on the growing numbers of people
who were crowding the countryside in southern europe in asia elsewhere you could call on these
people to replace slave labor without necessarily losing much of a step in terms of economic
profitability slavery of course did not die a painless death slave owners in many cases argued
fervently for the importance of retaining the institution they might appeal to property rights
and property rights loomed large in the thinking of political leaders in many places in the 19th
century but they might also and this was an interesting connection between southern american
planters and russian landlords not a deliberate connection just a coincidence of approach they
might also argue in addition to property rights that slavery was an essential institution to
provide guidance and motivation to childlike peoples russian aristocrats not the ones influenced
by western thinking but the ones who were arguing for special russian needs and conditions uh russian
aristocrats might argue that the serfs could be charming people but they were essentially children
and if they didn't have kindly landlords telling them what to do organizing things for them they
would simply fall apart emancipation in this sense would be a disaster not just a russian society
but to the very people that the reformers wanted to assist and obviously american
southerners made much the same case but the efforts to resist the tide of abolition lost
as noted slavery and serfdom were abolished in the western world and in territories under
western control by the middle of the 19th century slavery and serfdom were abolished in russia and
the united states in the 1860s lincoln's emancipation proclamation was motivated certainly by some
sense of the injustice of slavery but also with a careful eye cocked to world opinion abolishing
slavery in the secessionist states was a means of conciliating british and french public opinion
which was otherwise slightly inclined to sympathize sympathize with the south against the competitive
industrial north so this factor of opinion as well as morality was beginning to come into clear play
slavery was attacked by european imperialists as they moved into africa indeed the argument
that imperialism was essential to counter what was in fact a growing use of slavery in the 19th
century african economy was one of the big arguments one of the big humanitarian white
man's burden arguments for imperialism wasn't the main reason the imperialists went in but they
really did work against slavery once they seized the reins of government in africa the abolition
of slavery extended to additional parts of latin america later in the 19th century the abolition
of slavery in brazil in 1882 was a huge move and again brazilian reformers by this point were picking
up the twin arguments of humanitarian injustice and the ascent and the sense that civilized world
opinion was now hostile to this institution and hostile to societies that didn't get on the bandwagon
appropriately slavery was abolished also in the later 19th century in places like cuba and now
finally the anti-slavery forces began to attack the other stronghold of slavery in parts of the
middle east and efforts to persuade local middle eastern rulers to renounce slavery extended from
the later 19th into the early 20th century by say 1923 the formal legal institution of slavery
was effectively ended and this as noted was a huge historic change the abolition of serfdom or
serf-like conditions was a little less systematic but here too there were major gains serfdom
was abolished in other parts of eastern europe for example in the later 1860s in places like
rumania in the wake of russian reforms so this was a huge movement it derived from complicated
causes but it represents a major change in global conditions in the 19th century and a major change
in one of the staples of world history up to that point what were the consequences i think
there are four categories here that deserve attention and i'll start with the most immediate
and work to the more general first obviously specific emancipations although although they
might derive from similar causes actually had very different solutions to the problem of what
would happen after slavery when slavery was abolished in jamaica for example in 1833 the
abolitionists who had been extremely hostile to slavery turned out not to have paid very much
attention to what would happen to the slaves once the institution was ended the their moral fervor
was very clear when it directed against something more diffuse and ineffective when it came to well
what's going to come next uh waystations were established that provided a period of years in
which uh jamaican slaves could still be bound for example to apprenticeships only gradually did full
abolition occur russian emancipation in the early 1860s where serfdom was concerned was considerably
more generous than american abolition only in a very few regions were american slaves directly
given land after the abolition of slavery whereas in russia a complicated formula was designed to
let peasants have the access to most land while still preserving the aristocracy as a class so
peasants got a good bit of the land although they deeply resented the fact that they didn't get all
of it the landlords kept some and they viewed this some as including the more productive they did get
the land but they were required to pay redemption payments to help provide financial means that
would preserve the aristocracy even in serfdom's absence and they were tied to their village
at least to some extent until these redemption payments were satisfied this was again in terms
of strict economics a more generous solution than that adopted in the united states but because
russian serfs were in the majority because restrictions seemed particularly annoying precisely
because so much had been gained it was it was as if half a loaf had been achieved but the rest of
the loaf was still absent russian emancipation ironically triggered a recurrent series of
peasant protests against their remaining obligations against their landlords against the
redemption system a series of peasant protests that would continue to crescendo into the 20th
century feeding the russian revolution of 1905 and then feeding as well the great russian revolution
of 1917 conditions in the united states where african-american x slaves were treated less
generously but were smaller in number and were subjected to a number of vigorous racist attacks
the aftermath here was different not necessarily healthier in terms of the society as a whole
but less conducive directly to significant social protest so point one the abolition of
slavery and serfdom had varied varied effects in terms of what happened to the former slaves and
serfs in terms of political consequences and one has here to go something on something of a case
by case basis it's also been argued in the case of american slavery that another aftermath of
slavery was an increase of racism now that people of color could not be subjected to
servitude directly in law many people who had become accustomed to their superiority over
people of color now manifested their claims and their uncertainties in a cre increasingly
overt racism this phenomenon was noticeably more marked in the united states than in latin america
latin american racism was less virulent among other things latin americans differed from citizens
of the united states in not necessarily not necessarily regarding someone who had some
colored blood in their background as clearly african gradations were smoother but it has also
been noted although overt racism was an is is less of a factor in latin american society where
slavery had previously existed nevertheless the people of darkest color tend to be lowest on
the economic totem pole some degree of prejudice and identification obviously persisted here too
in the aftermath of slavery impact number two not surprisingly although not pleasantly
many societies saw efforts to revive conditions that had some similarities of slavery
even though they weren't quite as bad in terms of strict legal onus in brazil for example for a
while uh orphans were deliberately recruited into the labor force without any choice of their own
treated effectively as slaves at least until they became adult in the belgium congo under king
leopold while slavery was abolished uh workers african workers were forced into mind work on
pain of physical mutilation a situation whose differences from slavery frankly are too uh
too subtle for anyone clearly to discern slave like conditions or at least conditions that evoke
slavery might also result from harsh sharecropping systems where people although legally free could
work the land only if they agreed to uh heavy taxation in kind as a result of their tenure
and in this system it often became very difficult to get out from under the burdens to the actual
landowners or in many factories in mexico as well as in the united states uh conditions of indebtedness
were used effectively to tie workers to their owners that is workers had to shop in company
stores they piled up big debts they were not legally free to leave their employ until these
debts were resolved but wages were too low really to permit this even in more recent times
semi-slavery has been produced for example in some of the pacific islands under united states
control where textile companies uh recruit labor from asia seize the passports of the workers
and tell them if they don't work well they will automatically be shipped home because
they have no voice over their own conditions again a familiar enough point slavery was gone
but what we could i think legitimately regard as slave semi-slavery cropped up in all sorts of
different places impact number three particularly impact of the abolition of slavery in the americas
with slavery gone labor needs now had to be satisfied by looking for new streams of immigration
one source in the later 19th century involves southern and eastern europe
where large numbers of people from spain italy poland etc came to the americas came to places
like brazil and argentina significantly adding to ethnic diversity contributing
relatively cheap wage labor at least keeping the price of wages down because of their sheer numbers
even more interesting as a response to the abolition of slavery was the new flood of
emigration out of parts of asia from the philippines from china from japan a bit later from korea
and also from india huge numbers of workers coming to places like the pacific coast of
latin america coming to the caribbean coming to other parts of southeast asia itself often in
conditions of indentured servitude i.e contracts would be signed for five or seven years during
which the laborer was obligated to perform his or her tasks this was not slavery some of these
people later achieved freedom and could actually make a significant economic headway but a really
interesting extension of the abolition of slavery into new worldwide patterns of labor
organization and migration streams a very important development in the later 19th century
that would continue obviously to resonate in the 20th finally final consequence the kind of
moral outrage the kind of world opinion that had been mobilized against slavery didn't end
with the abolition of slavery itself in the later 19th century for example some of the same
kinds of moral outrage petitions education campaigns etc were directed at new evils such as
the exploitation the brutal exploitation of workers in the belgium congo a major organization
devoted to this cause or to the phenomenon of white slavery the notion that large numbers of
american and european women were being slow sold into prostitution in places like latin america
the fear by the way was exaggerated although there was some reality to it but the campaign was
intriguing the point is here by the end of the 19th century building on the effective experience
of the anti-slavery crusade a new kind of world opinion with organized organizations to back it
was available that could be applied to other kinds of abuse or other situations in which
injustice could be perceived the london anti-slavery society the largest the oldest international
ngo anywhere in the world continued its operations as it does still today but now directed toward
other forms of labor abuse and there's really a direct connection between the kind of world
opinion that had formed against slavery and more recent organizations like amnesty international
that seek to use world opinion against other abuses of human rights this consequence of great
importance for the 19th but also the 20th century is the final legacy of this really
interesting moment in the in the history of the world in the long 19th century
lecture 26 modernization and nationalism
our discussion today is frankly a bit of yin and yang we're going to talk about new divisions in
world history during the long 19th century but we're also going to talk a little bit tentatively
about some common trends that cut across these divisions and then as the third segment we're
going to talk about the spread of nationalism which was both a common trend at a source of division
again bit of yin bit of yang divisions in some senses are pretty obvious we've already noted
the important division that opened up in the long 19th century between societies that industrialized
almost exclusively in the west until the very end of the period and the large number of societies
that were still largely agricultural that became increasingly peripheral as their economies were
bent to service to the industrial zone a few economies hovered a bit in between
russia and japan particularly or noteworthy for launching an early industrial process
before 1914 but a big division that as we discussed earlier in comparing the united
states and mexico had big implications as well for increasing differentials in standards of living
but the developed less developed division a 20th century concept which however can
be applied to the 19th is not the only division going there's also the obvious division
between societies held held as colonies with the spread of imperialism and societies that
remained at least technically free it was obviously interesting that in a century that
saw the extension of european imperial controls over africa and oceania latin america politically
at least gained independence for the most part we've noted before but it deserves emphasis
the interesting comparison between china and india india held as a colony china increasingly subject
to european territorial seizures and exploitation but remaining technically independent as noted
before some historians have argued that in this trade-off china actually had the worst of it it
would have been better to have been a colony but even among colonies differences loom india
held for a long time by the british though certainly suffering from british imperial control
fared better under imperialism in the long 19th century than africa did africa was seized later
its territories were divided among competing european states
who raced each other to some extent to see who could exploit what the fastest and probably there
was greater racism applied to african subjects than to indian although racism could be involved
there as well divisions obviously run deep in the long 19th century and in the two subsequent
discussions we're going to focus on particular patterns that need to be held up against more
general developments but we've also argued and here we come to a at least feeble effort to establish
some common themes we've also argued that along with differential economic change differential
imperialism came some increasing realization of the need for certain kinds of reforms and without
oversimplifying the process this realization normally included some sense that at least certain
aspects of what the west had developed would need to be copied possibly modified possibly limited
but copied if societies were to gain enough strength to establish or retain independence
in a world increasingly dominated by european political control and by the control of the
industrial zone now there is a theory called modernization that might begin to be applied to
the 19th century and because it's a theory that has widespread hold in our thinking
even though it is disputed by scholars i actually believe it's important to trot this theory out
examine it and then talk about how it might in a very limited fashion apply to the 19th century
itself modernization theory which was the brainchild of american sociologists back in the 1950s
though it owes something to earlier german work by people like mox vapor modernization theory
fundamentally argues that as societies realize the directions of industrial modern political
states headed initially by the west they will begin to change a number of aspects of social
activity in parallel directions modernization theory argues then first that societies will
increasingly head in the same basic directions and that there will be connections between
developments say an intellectual life in family life in political life and so on modernization
first of all argues that increasingly societies will become or will try to become industrial
economic modernization really means industrialization catching up to the latest technology moving
increasingly toward an emphasis on manufacturing or other high tech sectors as opposed to agriculture
this is a fairly simple concept modernization however extends beyond the economy to argue
that there is a phenomenon that we could call political modernization in which governments
will try to take on some new functions for example mass education in which they will
possibly shed some older functions for example protection of any particular religion political
modernization will involve the creation of larger bureaucracies specifically trained to
their function and chosen at least to some extent by merit rather than privilege or kinship ties
alone political modernization then argues for the creation of a somewhat new kind of state
whose operation will parallel the modernization of the economy modernization theory might be
applied to intellectual life as a society modernizes its culture it will for example
increasingly emphasize science not necessarily to the exclusion of other areas such as religion
but certainly gaining increasing emphasis as the society seeks to adjust its culture
to what it's doing in the political and the economic arena one could even apply modernization
to aspects of family life family modernization would involve among other things reduction to the
birth rate now modernization theory is widely assumed in certain kinds of scholarship for example
russian historians and i really think this is a wrong application of the theory russian historians
routinely refer to the peter the great's reforms as modernizing latin american historians frequently
for refer to modernization it's a hard concept to escape but it has its bitter critics and even
aside from criticism it has severe limitations the criticisms are twofold primarily first of all
critics argue that looking for a single direction in world history in the modern period
is simply oversimplifying very complicated patterns even within single societies they will
argue like the west itself while you can talk about modernization for some groups what about
workers what about agricultural laborers what about even women at some points not every group
proceeds in the same direction at the same pace and certainly this criticism can apply
to an effort to to see modernization on a world stage modernization obviously and this is the
second second objection risks holding societies that seem to be slow in the process up for some
particular kinds of criticism a staple for example in modernization literature in the 1950s was
why is turkey slow so slow to modernize it's been trying for three four decades why isn't it there
yet well that's not necessarily either a fair or a useful vantage point on turkish history
attention then there is arguably something to the modernization notion and i'll come back to
that in the moment but we also have to to to play that benefit against the undoubted reality
that modernization uh unfairly tries to simplify directions that different groups
and different societies will take it's also important to recognize even if you like modernization
theory as i still sort of do even if you like modernization theory there's a lot of areas
of social life to which it does not apply for example france in the united states probably
would be regarded as equally modern if you measure government industry standard of living etc but the
united states is a much more religious society than france modernization does not predict exactly
what will happen to religion modernization doesn't predict crime rates there used to be the notion
that with modernization certain kinds of crimes would increase but if we actually look at crime
rates over the past two centuries as societies quote modernized sometimes they went up sometimes
they went down there is no pattern there's a modernization of police forces fighting crime
there's a modernization in criminals technology more likely to use guns blah blah blah but no
modernization of crime itself so the theory has to be limited in this respect also even and we'll
touch on this in a later discussion even conditions of women although they may quote modernize in some
respects modern women are likely to become more educated uh in modernizing modernizing societies
women may be pulled out of the labor force or they may be added in there's no pattern so the
theory even if you like it is limited and finally and this is a tricky one that i want to mention
now and we'll come back to it modernization has to be distinguished from mere westernization
that is societies may modernize without becoming western two examples one societies may modernize
without becoming democratic for example if we use modernization theory the soviet union clearly
modernized in the 1920s 30s and 40s but it did not become by western standards democratic can't
use the theory for form of government another really important example that will help control
our use of modernization theory even if we like it japan clearly modernized if we can use the theory
at all beginning in the later 19th century but it did not become western it copied aspects of
the west it became more like the west but it did not westernize across the board distinguishing
between modernization and westernization may help us save the concept though it obviously adds
some subtlety all right we will look at aspects of modernization in various aspects of world history
from this point onward without trying to overuse the theory or shortcut actual exploration for the
long 19th century itself and particularly for its final decades late 19th very early 20th century
it seems to me there are three areas in which one can see common trends in virtually every
major society in the world very different levels but common trends one that we probably don't pay
enough attention to is quite simply public health headed by western sanitary ideas and engineering
increasing numbers of societies whether under western control or not
realize that governments needed to take more responsibility for public health measures
cleaning up swamps controlling sanitation issues in the cities etc because the result
would be healthier and more rapidly growing populations sources of economic and military
strength what we might view as modern public health measures were born in western europe
in the 1830s and 40s maybe with some antecedents before they spread quickly to the united states
no more rapidly in the north than in the south japan as it began to encounter western influences
from the 1860s onward adopted new public health measures as one of its first interests seeing
again the clear utility of new efforts to limit disease control contagion etc even colonial situations
by 1900 began to see the introduction of new efforts at public health if only because the
colonizers realized that they needed to protect their settlements white settlements against contagion
and they couldn't look to those settlements alone they also had to pay attention to other
native sectors of the city public health concerns spread rapidly in latin america in the later 19th
century again in emulation of western patterns as middle-class reformers tried to discipline
lower-class habits which they found as uncivilized and dangerous in the interests of greater social
hygiene in other words although at very different levels virtually every part of the world or at
least the urban sectors of every part of the world was attempting some new levels of public
health by the end of the 19th century and as a result the stage was set for the massive global
population increase that would occur in the 20th century that has more to do with public health
measures than any other single factor second limited modernization sector education by 1900
virtually every society in the world was attempting to expand student exposure to schools
and to spread schooling to at least some limited sectors of the lower classes at least in the cities
and to add technical and scientific subjects at least to some extent to the educational agenda
now this might be a massive effort as in the west or japan whereby the 1890s virtually every child
of appropriate age was in school that was modernization of education writ large but colonial
authorities much more gradually but still recognizably in india or even africa colonial
authorities began to create some new access to education sometimes assisted by missionary efforts
china would expand its attention to student life by the 1890s among other things beginning to send
students to learn from other societies such as japan the united states or western europe
the impulse to spread education it still might be very limited or it might be literally universal
the impulse to spread education and to redefine it somewhat was quite widespread third area of
limited 19th century modernization involved military technology and organization a society
first encountering the west or at least encountering the west in a new and more ominous relationship
would almost certainly look to improving military technology and copying western forms of military
training and the organization of officers above all this is one of the first things japan did
china would show interest here earlier than it showed interest in economic modernization
and again even the colonies changed the training of troops in order to provide effective fighting
forces thus the british in essence modernized aspects of the indian military in india providing
new kinds of weapons and new kinds of training segments of the african military under the french
for example would be modernized in similar directions this is one reason why in so many
cases in the 20th century leadership of new states will come from people who had received
military training they had more exposure to what we might vaguely call the modern world
than did some other members of society all right the point hopefully is clear without yet arguing
that modernization was coming to describe global history in the long 19th century that would be
too sweeping we are arguing that despite the huge divisions that we referred to earlier
there were some common patterns of change that had interesting implications for the future
and then in the 20th century we may see greater utility in some version of the modernization
concept so long as we remember its limitations and the criticisms to which it's legitimately been
subject one phenomenon that also spread widely in the 19th century that has i think an ambivalent
relationship to modernization one phenomenon was the rise of nationalism and nationalist loyalties
nationalism simply put is the belief that there is an identifiable national culture
that is majorably different from other cultures has different historical traditions have has
different artistic and literary standards as a somewhat distinctive value system often probably
usually cultural nationalists will go on to argue not only is our culture different from others
it's also frankly better and most nationalism will also go on to argue not only is our culture
distinctive and better it should also be connected to our state either an existing state or a state
we should have so nationalists typically argue that there are recognizable divisions among peoples
based on different national traditions sometimes some racial or ethnic thinking will be added in
as well but these are essential and that these traditions should be housed in an appropriate
state that will express the national interest and the national identity nationalism although we can
see hints of it earlier in world history in certain kinds of political loyalties and perhaps
particularly in cases like china where there were such efforts to shape a national culture at least
at the elite level and attach it to the state nationalism in a full sense is a modern phenomenon
it contrasts with more traditional types of loyalty either to religion or to locality
or to both if you scratched most people in 1750 any place in the world and ask who are you where
are you from you would normally get an answer i am of this religious faith and or i am of this
village and small region and that that constituted the horizons nationalism was born i think of two
factors and it was born in europe it was born first of a an objection to enlightenment thinking
that tended to argue that all peoples were fundamentally the same a current of thought
reflecting among among other things the fact that nation states were already beginning to exist in
europe a current of thought headed interestingly by some german thinkers in the 18th century like
hereder a current of thought are argued against this to focus on the particular identity of
individual peoples that was factor number one the second factor was the extent to which
which increased population movement associated with early industrialization and urbanization
and the creation of a new kind of middle class gave an audience first for a type of loyalty
that would be larger than the locality and would help up rooted peoples in the city see a sense
of identity even though they were cut off from their local roots and nationalism also provided
middle class people a way to argue about political loyalty and identification that would be different
from aristocratic loyalty aristocratic loyalties went to class and often crossed regions as
aristocrats more easily identified with other aristocrats than with their own society middle
class thinking increasingly saw nationalism as an alternative alternative to this and also possibly
an assistance to the development of more national wider markets that would also help them
economically nationalism was then born in western and central europe it received a huge boost from
the french revolution not surprisingly the first case in which a national anthem was generated
the french revolution by tearing down local institutions and reducing the power of the church
basically created a situation in which many people argued that now that the government
belonged to the people and the people of France the people of France owed it loyalty owed it the
kind of loyalty that became associated with nationalist fervor from western and central
europe and from the enthusiasm of the french revolution itself nationalism obviously quickly
spread in two additional directions visible by the late 18th early 19th centuries first of all
it spread to the americas united states nationalism probably did not clearly exist before the american
revolution though there were certainly hints of it but it most certainly followed from the revolution
as americans began to argue we have our own society now we need to define it in terms of
characteristics and loyalties in ways that will differentiate us from the old world nationalism
clearly spread to elites in latin america and was fundamental to the nationalist independence
movements that we'll talk about in our next discussion nationalism also began to spread
to eastern europe serbian nationalism for example can be identified as early as the first decade of
the 19th century greek nationalism clearly surfaced soon thereafter and was uh in the in the 1820s
applied to a new attack on ottoman control that would lead at the end of the 1820s to the independence
of the greek state in the case of nationalism in the americas nationalism was obviously primarily
used to form new states or to undergird new states and identities in the case of the spread of
nationalism to eastern europe nationalism obviously became a force that attacked some of the great
traditional multinational empires and from the early 19th to the early 20th century much of
eastern europe and the middle east became a battleground between new particularistic nationalisms
and the larger political units of political entities such as the austro-hungarian empire
or the ottoman empire nationalism spread to the middle east by the middle of the 19th century
at least as some arabes began to write about an arab nationalism that would be a new kind of
political expression different obviously from european control or influence but also different
from traditional uh measures in islam nationalism would spread to india by the 1880s
with the formation of the indian national congress it spread clearly by the 1880s to japan
by the 1860s i should have noted this earlier nationalism is clearly visible in the writings
of russian intellectuals and hints of this occurred earlier nationalism by the 1890s is also visible
in the emergence of a young turk movement and by 1900 african leaders are beginning to talk
increasingly in nationalistic terms in other words during the long 19th century from the 1750s
to 1914 nationalism was effectively created and gained some attention in virtually every part
of the world now the attention levels varied as with modernization we're not talking about
absolutely uniform trends nationalism in africa or in turkey in 1900 was undoubtedly
largely an upper class phenomenon uh some military leaders that sort of thing important because it
operated at the leadership level but nationalism was not yet a mass loyalty this would be something
that would occur in the 20th century india also saw mass nationalism only after 1900 but the fact
that this force spread so widely is obviously intriguing what's involved several points it
seems to me are worth emphasis in the first place obviously as in europe originally nationalism
provided some loyalties for people facing rapid economic and political change sometimes moving
toward cities nationalism as it contrasted with more traditional loyalties clearly had new meaning
nationalism also provided some interesting alternatives to traditional loyalties in some
other respects most important here although the the boundary lines have to be watched carefully
in each individual case most important was a certain implicit tension between nationalism
and the more traditional force of religion nationalists might argue that their religion
was an important part of the national tradition many indian nationalists hindu nationalists would
would argue precisely this but the question if push comes to shove is the national loyalty or
the religious loyalty primary was an interesting one that began to be posed in the 19th century and
would continue to affect people on into our own day if for example you're a middle eastern
nationalism nationalist confronted with an aspect of islam that may seem to hold your
society back what do you do about it islam is certainly an important part of the national
tradition but maybe it needs to be modified maybe some other interests need to come first
the tension between nationalism and religion although not always breaking out into overt conflict
is something to keep an eye on in a number of political stories from the later 19th century
onward nationalism and this is indeed in some ways part of the same argument nationalism
usually helped people simultaneously entertain the possibility of a certain degree of change
while insisting that change had to be modified or controlled by attachment to tradition
all nationalists you can't be a nationalist i think without arguing that there are some national
traditions that are absolutely sacrosanct that give your society its special flavor now these
traditions may be real or as many historians have noted and it's a very useful concept these
traditions may be invented for example from the 1880s through the 1920s many japanese leaders
argued that reverence for the emperor reverence for shintoism was a vital part of the japanese
national tradition well frankly that wasn't entirely true it sounded good it could be believed
but it was partly an invented tradition and nationalists almost everywhere have been busy
for the past 200 years inventing new kinds of rituals that soon become converted as if they were
long-standing national traditions an interesting example close to home the tradition of thanksgiving
was an invented tradition introduced by abraham lincoln in the 1860s as a means of fostering
national unity it seemed like it referred back to colonial experience and a long pattern of american
holidays but it didn't it was an invented tradition though a very useful and hopefully pleasant one
to which shopping parades and football were soon added actually in the 19th century itself all right
so nationalism has to argue that there are important traditions they may be real they may
be imaginary but they're there but nationalists are also likely to argue that in order to express
national strength certain kinds of changes were needed so under the guise of nationalism you might
argue that we need more attention to industrial development we need changes in our styles of dress
so that we can become more efficient and business-like the turkish leader atatürk in the 1920s will for
example argue that turk should abandon their traditional headgear in favor of western style hats
because hats were more modern and respectable and therefore would actually defend the interests
of turkish nationalism interest in change could be quite sweeping most indian nationalists would
come to argue that the caste system itself had to be cast aside no pun intended because it hampered
national unity and national resistance against the british look to nationalism then and this is one
of the things that can relate it in odd ways to modernization look to nationalism to provide
an interesting mixture of traditional attachments and identities a sense that we are different from
everybody else with some sense as well that we need to do some things differently perhaps like
other people perhaps like the west nationalism finally was obviously an increasingly important
rallying point for many peoples around the world against the west it worked better than invocation
of purely traditional loyalties did because it united people across traditional boundaries of
class caste or even gender it spoke a language that westerners themselves used and therefore
could be utilized to make westerners feel guilty in ways that invocation of traditional religion
might not nationalism spread as a global force beginning in the long 19th century because it
served so many different purposes and particularly of course because it served as the most convenient
rallying cry in a world increasingly controlled at least for a short period of time by the west
but a world in which different interests had to find expression
lecture 27 formation of latin american civilization
our discussion today focuses on developments in latin america in the long 19th century
we've sketched some very general patterns of world history in the long 19th century the new
force of the world economy as the west industrialized the limited but possibly measurable development
of modernization certainly the force of western military strength and imperialism the spread of
national loyalties but each of these larger factors needs to be seen in context of particular
civilizations experiences we don't have time to deal with each individual case and we've tried to
make some reference to particular cases as we went along but we will indulge one major case
today that of latin america where hopefully we can see without belaboring the point the action of
some of the larger forces but in a particular context where particular historical experiences
worked out latin america is an important instance as well because there is a general concern
in world history about making sure that appropriate attention be paid to latin america beyond
generalizations about the emergence of a peripheral economy and that sort of thing
latin america like some other parts of the world including north america does not loom
in world history as the source of one of the great traditions it's a borrower of forces and
influences from other places that then merge with more local elements and traditions but latin america
has had a varied and significant role in world history and this discussion today is meant to
capture some elements of it from the colonial period latin america which in many ways is the
world's newest major civilization although we'll need to talk about at least one other candidate
from the colonial experience latin america had developed a number of important features
its economy was in many respects dependent on that of western europe through the intermediary
of spain and portugal though particularly by the 18th century important local manufacturing and
other economic activities had developed we don't want to overdo the dominance of exports
latin america also and one latin american has argued that this is actually the most distinctive
issue that latin america brought in from the colonial period latin america also had developed
some significant issues concerning the formation of effective governments given the importance of
outside intervention of colonial control from spain and portugal as well as economic interference
from some other sectors given the importance also of landlord rule in many parts of latin america
developing central governments that have had any kind of effective control over the
larger territories they officially ruled was a significant issue spain and portugal had both
tried to address this issue during the 18th century in a series of reforms called the bourbon
reforms after the dynasty back home that put the administration of the colonies increasingly in the
hands of people sent out from the iberian peninsula born there and hopefully increasingly
talented and efficient so there was some political change on the eve of the long 19th century but
it had some some diverse implications something of a latin american culture began to be forged
in the colonial period as well obviously imports from western europe were predominant at least
officially with the spread of catholicism pushed urgently by a series of catholic missions
by the importation of architectural and artistic forms often around the religion
so that the center cities of many colonial cities in latin america had a very european air
but mixing with those imported factors were important traditional uses of color
the veneration of local gods and goddesses that were now transformed into worship of some of the
saints this was a this was a mixed culture that began to gain great strength from its mixture
just as the population itself after the columbian exchange eased increasingly mixed people of
european native and sometimes african origin in various ways even latin american family forms
reflected some distinctive traditions officially europeans priests and governors urged that european
standards be applied to families but in fact partly because of colonial sexual exploitation
of native women large numbers of illegitimate children were born and this remained a characteristic
of latin american families beneath the top layer although elite men were frequently involved
on into the contemporary period this sounds perhaps a little bit harsher than
it actually turned out to be because correspondingly the popular culture developed mechanisms
by which illegitimate children could be appropriately cared for sheltered etc but this
was not exactly a european family set of family standards even as officially the recommendation
sounded very western the big first event in some ways the shaping event of latin american
experience in the long 19th century of course involved the wars of independence that stretched
primarily between 1810 and 1820 these independence movements reflected firm convictions organized
around liberal and nationalist beliefs imported from western europe and the united states and
inspired indeed by united states and french revolutionary example the goals were obviously
national independence from spanish portuguese although the brazilian case is more complicated
from spanish control but also the formation of liberal political states that would have
parliaments constitutions that would not be monarchies that would at least have some defense
of individual rights there was normally on the part of the leaders of the independence movements
some hope to curb the powers of the catholic church without necessarily overturning the church
this was again a liberal nationalist movement much in the mold of similar efforts in western europe
and north america the social base of the independence movements was usually fairly shallow
most of the leadership was creole that is people of european origin born in latin america
and only vague hints if at all existed of more popular support for these national
risings correspondingly although in a few cases social measures resulted such as the abolition
of slavery in mexico correspondingly the social results of these independence movements were
very limited these were political movements they did successfully chase the spaniards out
in part because spain was itself so distracted by the napoleonic wars and subsequent political
turmoil back home also because the british and other european agents were eager to protect these
independence movements for very selfish reasons these movements were political successes but they
did not overturn the basic ruling forces in latin american society that revolved around the church
the landlord class and increasingly the military after independence was successfully achieved
during the 1820s 30s and on into the 40s many latin american nations exhibited what we call
new nations problems a limited concept but a useful one that first gets illustrated by the
latin american experience but then also by experiences later in the 20th century in many parts
of africa southeast asia etc and here's the argument and again it's a it's a perfectly factual one
as far as latin america was concerned new nations can successfully form once colonial
overlords are chased out but they will characteristically have a number of problems first of all
identifying experienced political leadership one of the grievances of the independence leaders
was the fact that they had been so excluded from participation in government in the 18th century
under the colonial spanish reforms but by the same token there just weren't very many people
that had actual experience in running a state so here's here's here's the first of the new
nations problems second the formation of new nations the attack on the colonial overlords
normally leads to at least a brief period of economic dislocation and in this case in the
latin american case this period was exacerbated by the importation of british industrial goods
now that spanish tariff protection and military protection had been withdrawn economic hardship
would be the second characteristic new nations problem and it hit home very hard in the latin
american case disputes over political legitimacy would be a predictable third problem who's supposed
to rule what political constitution actually should be adopted while most of the independence
movements were hostile to monarchies certain political forces for example in mexico really
tried hard to find a new monarch because that's that that's the system that made sense to them
quarrels about political legitimacy could also have to do with the territorial integrity of the
new states most nationalist leaders in latin america hoped for fairly big states on the united
states model to the north thus the united states of central america or the effort to form a form
agron colombia but most of these more ambitious combinations fell apart because nobody actually
recognized the legitimacy of this territory and more parochial interests but not predeterminated
and in the process there would be considerable political turmoil until the boundaries were
settled upon and became somewhat traditional and finally although this was not an overwhelming
issue in latin america there's also the question of external boundaries who's going to claim what
territory as two new nations collide border wars in other words are a final component of new
nations phenomena the results of new nations problems show in two characteristic outcomes
first a pronounced tendency toward political instability this is a familiar part of 19th
and even 20th century latin american political history regimes leadership changed a lot mostly
it was leadership change that is coup d'etat that would bring one person in instead of another
but sometimes real political principles were involved there was an ongoing tension between
conservative and liberal forces in latin american politics the conservatives banned on protecting
church and landlords the liberals interested possibly in a little bit of social reform
certainly some education certainly some limitations on the church certainly some effort at a
parliamentary system that would give representation at least to the upper classes these quarrels as
well as purely personal rivalries helped create frequent political instability and along with
this came a frequent tendency to what in latin american history is known as caudismo the selection
of individual dictators whose authoritarian rule at least showed some hope of cutting through the
instability of cutting through the quarrels so latin american political history in much of the
19th century after the successful wars of independence was marked by frequent regime changes
frequent periods of personal authoritarianism but also a deeper seated tension between liberals
and conservatives who might oscillate in power and who might both provide actual sources of
authoritarian rule liberals perhaps a little less often than conservatives but they could have
their caudillos as well interestingly and pretty obviously at first blush this aspect of latin
american history contrasts interestingly with the experience of the united states also a new nation
but not one in which some of these new nations phenomena occurred to the same degree different
colonial experience had given more north americans some experience in government economic problems
existed after the american revolution but they were less conclusive there were certainly quarrels
about political boundaries and it took some time to forge the actual agreement on what the united
states were to become but these problems were simply less paralyzing than to the south and
obviously the results would shape a rather different political experience less this sound
too self-congratulatory it's also important to note that the united states would have one granddaddy
of a new nation's problem because when the nation was formed there was no agreement on what was to
happen to slavery and this new nation's problem would crop up in a massive civil war a far worse
period of turmoil in concentrated fashion than any of the latin american states faced but the
political experience was undeniably different the long 19th century was also in an important
period for the development of latin american culture two or three points here need to be
emphasized in the first place and this is perhaps the most basic point the long 19th century saw
latin america emerge from very tentative cultural expressions except when brought directly by europeans
to the potential for creating literary currents artistic currents etc of their own a large number
of reasonably talented and successful latin american novelists for example emerged in the 19th
century they understandably exploited some characteristic latin american themes talking
about frontiers talking about ethnic diversity at the same time these novelists and other artists
were for the most part strongly influenced by literary and intellectual patterns developed
particularly in western europe to some extent in the united states this is then first a period of a
first flowering of latin american high culture not simply culture controlled by european derived
missions and church officials but also a period in which western influences retain a very strong
hold increasing western cultural influences showed in some other respects that go beyond
high culture although they still have some contact with them in many latin american countries
cities were expanded or created very much upon european architectural lines i had the experience
once of seeing a friend from argentina visit me in paris it was his first visit and his first
reaction was my goodness they've made paris look just like Buenos Aires he had the connection right
but he had the chronological priority reversed latin american center cities particularly in
places like argentina were deliberately created along european models a new urban middle class
emerged and we've touched on this actually before that increasingly espoused other european values
in part because so many wealthy latin americans routinely traveled to western europe as part of
their acclimatization and education these political values could include the new public health efforts
efforts to insist on european sanitary standards against the presumed barbarism or insufficient
civilization of the lower classes it could include efforts to impose increasingly western standards
on existing native populations the tension between liberal reformers in the cities and
native americans was frequently quite great which was one reason that latin american liberals even
by 1914 almost never advocated political democracy their notion of politics needed to be restricted
to a smaller group of voters who could be counted upon to pursue proper standards
another reform target uh was prostitution i mentioned earlier the increasing white slavery
scare of the late 19th century which particularly was directed toward places like argentina argentine
reformers in turn were acutely embarrassed by any notion that argentina did not measure up
to western standards of control over prostitute activities and again reforms were introduced
increasing european immigration again to places like argentina uruguay chile to some extent brazil
also furthered an increasing european influence although this was much stronger in some parts
of the south american continent than in others increasing interest in european sports or american
sports was another area in which latin american culture seemed to be changing in a western direction
but along with these urban and sometimes upper class manifestations that seem to be amalgamating
latin american culture with that of western europe and the united states with the exception of a few
regionally specific themes important groups of people of native american mestizo or african origin
also continued to defend popular religious traditions and amalgamations that reflected a
somewhat different rhythm advocated and exhibited certain dance styles that retained a much more
distinct and original latin american flavor again this was a culture that was gaining
increasing expression it was not it was not entirely homogeneous and the results could be
quite creative as well as expressing a certain degree of tension any discussion of latin american
the long 19th century has to note and it's a theme that we've evoked in general already
has to note the increasing peripheralization of the latin american economy there were some changes
here over time initial economic dislocation after the successful independence movements
was followed by the middle of the 19th century by some recovery of a certain degree of prosperity
in many parts of latin america but the later decades 1870 or so onward of latin american history
were marked by increasing peripheralization that showed in a number of ways both old and new
the old ways and the point here is pretty obvious involved the increasing number of
peoples and territories who were locked into the production of export goods including new ones
some of them not fully suitable to the latin american environment and capable of causing
a great deal of environmental damage one of the new effects of the world economy as it intensified
its impact on places like brazil but the crops now included coffee this is the great age of the rise
of latin american coffee production it included of course silver and sugar but it also now included
from places like chile increasing production of minerals important for industrial activity
to the north or back in europe minerals like copper and the intervention of large outside
industrial combinations for mineral production for food production like united fruit company
operating in central america was an increasing factor in the latin american economy increasing
numbers and and and segments of the latin american economy were thus bent on producing goods for the
export market dependent on very cheap labor not for the most part now slave labor but dependent
on very cheap labor organized in various ways and increasingly producing goods that in turn
would support imports of more expensive processed goods or would produce the revenues of an upper
class that was increasingly oriented to spend its money on leisure activities for example in western
europe rather than plowing them back into regional economic development all this is familiar enough
the new component and it became quite visible in places like venezuela at the end of the 19th century
the new component was the graphic illustration of how hard it was even for dedicated sensible
reformers to pull latin america out of this peripheral relationship the temptation obviously
and a perfectly sensible temptation was to try to figure out how one might industrialize
elements of the latin american economy and indeed increasing numbers of factories were
established but to establish a factory one had normally to at least at the outset to
import machinery in from western europe or the united states the question then arose fine
where do we get the money where do we get the foreign currency in order to do this
well the short run answer was we will borrow and the source of borrowing was characteristically
european or american banks anybody who's looked at the details of latin american history in the
19th century particularly the second half of the 19th century will recognize the frequency with which
outside investors from britain france of the united states tried to muscle in on latin american
development in order to make sure that their debts could be collected the key issue here was indeed
the formation of increasing international indebtedness that simply made the weakness
the dependent status of the latin american economy more visible more hard fundamentally to remedy
in order to pay for the importation of outside equipment the obvious recourse was to increase
the production of export products that could earn foreign currency but two things happened
when this avenue again a perfectly sensible avenue nobody's nobody's behaving stupidly here
we're talking about sensible reform minded leaders usually liberal sometimes authoritarian but really
interested in pulling their areas out of economic dependency the usual recourse in addition to
borrowing because after all ultimately one had to repay the loans in some fashion or the europeans
and americans would muscle in the recourse was to expand the production of goods like coffee
which for example began to occur in places like colombia and venezuela to expand coffee production
one pressed production farther and farther into the interior more acreage more product
but to get this production to market you also had to develop feeder railroads again a sensible
modern sounding economic device so railroads increasingly cut in from the export ports
into the interior in ways that would allow this increased production actually to reach market
but to build the railways one had to buy stock from again the industrial societies
another kind of expensive export that could and often did simply deepen the economic morass
and finally and this began to be a huge problem by the end of the 19th century and it would
continue to our own time for parts of latin america and many other parts of the world this
very sensible effort to increase coffee or whatever production in order to earn increasing foreign
currency to pay off debts and hopefully get out of this economic trap this increased production
would drive down prices so many regions in latin america and elsewhere were now trying to grow
coffee or other characteristic tropical products in order to pull themselves out of economic
dependency that prices dropped and the goal of escaping the economic pincers of dependency
actually became increasingly unrealizable not every latin american society suffered these
problems equally argentina with its beef exports actually enjoyed a certain degree of real prosperity
in the later 19th century although not one that led to a fully articulated pattern of industrial
development there was very there was variety and certainly individual enterprises could
could succeed and even and even prosper but the general problem was real and again the
points are twofold economic dependency expanded as a framework for much latin american economic
activity and the problems involved in dependency particularly with the addition of this deep
international debt the problems involved tended to deepen as well two points in conclusion
one a clear point the other sort of a question first of all the developments in latin america
illustrate obviously the variety of historical experiences that a major society could have
in the long 19th century the issues that we've just concluded concerning economic dependency
might seem almost formulaic though again there were some new elements even here but along with
economic dependency could come significant political innovation not only the achievement of
independence but the emergence of new kinds of political movements some interesting back and
forth in terms of political control ultimately some capacity to develop things like at least hints of a
beginning on new educational systems which was pushed for examples by reformers in mexico
the variety of developments when you look at politics culture as well as economy
the variety is impressive we don't want to get trapped in examination of economic dependency
alone and forget that this was not the be all and end all of historic possibilities during the
long 19th century the question i think is equally interesting and it's not my question i actually
as a as a non-specialist on latin america would have hesitated to raise it but latin latin american
themselves sometimes debate the experiences of the long 19th century and earlier colonial
precedents around this question was latin america a western civilization on the plus side
in other words for the affirmative and as an indication that this is not simply
an artificial or imperialistic structure on the affirmative side would be obviously many
aspects of latin american high culture that we've talked about uh where the european western
orientation was quite clear where where there was indeed increasingly a latin american contribution
to a common western intellectual enterprise against this however even on the cultural front
was the extent to which latin american developments tended to be somewhat stronger on what we might
call the humanities side than the science side i don't i don't mean there was no science in 19th
century latin america but was not a characteristic strength it was not a major emphasis for example
of the new universities being established so even on the cultural side where the western tinge is
greatest the issue of correspondence is somewhat complicated and certainly on the side of popular
culture even larger questions arise as latin america again was home to a number of vigorous
popular religious movements that differed considerably from their european counterparts
though sometimes expressing some european influence even here the political front is just plain mixed
it is vital to remember that there were clear western political ideals and goals in latin american
politics around liberalism and nationalism this was too early in the 19th century and the strength
of these movements persisted the extent to which conservatives in latin america fought for church
and army you could see echoes of this in european politics as well but the balance was somewhat
different the instability was somewhat greater with a couple of european exceptions and it's
important to remember although perhaps at the level of detail that even latin american liberalism
though certainly linked to its western cousins had some distinctive features for example in being
much more reluctant to embrace political democracy because of some of the special conditions of latin
america's latin american society and ethnic makeup and finally of course when you get to the level of
economic patterns and resultant social classes the picture does not look particularly western at all
the answer to the question is latin american civilization western is clearly mixed it is to
some extent the question is a legitimate one it can help organize some of the comparisons
that latin american experiences should be subjected to but there are some complexities as well
that reflect earlier traditions and that reflect some of the other new additions
to the latin american experience during the long 19th century
lecture 28 china and japan 19th century pressures
our discussion today focuses on comparing japanese and chinese developments in the
long 19th century frankly particularly from the 1840s 50s onward the comparison
is interesting in several respects a number of societies can be brought together to help examine
how 19th century factors were shaped by particular experiences i've already suggested for example
that comparing india and china in terms of economic political etc change in the 19th century is
intriguing china and the ottoman empire are often compared both hesitated at reform although china
much more than the ottoman empire both failed at least by 1914 really to come to terms with the
industrial economy and the military power of the west japan and russia constitute an interesting
comparison here are the two societies fundamentally non-western that managed to launch a significant
industrial revolution by the 1890s the process can be compared both in terms of what they had in
common and how they managed the process in similar ways and obviously also how the process differed
and had different results revolution in russia's case for example not so in japan but i like the
japanese-chinese comparison for a couple of key reasons first of all pretty obviously it is a key
contrast between a society that introduced a surprisingly successful series of reforms the
japanese case and a society that was unusually laggard comparison of extremes perhaps but
comparison nevertheless second and this goes back to something we touched on earlier we're
dealing here with two societies that shared a good bet japan had been massively influenced by china
it was by this point a confucian society culturally as was china the extent to which
the two societies had participated if not in a single civilization orbit at least in very
close interaction raises particularly acute questions of why one experience would differ
so much from the other and the final reason to emphasize this comparison is because it had such
significant impacts for the 20th and even the 21st centuries and we will at the end move from the
long 19th century comparison to a an evocation of the subsequent implications as well
both japan and china were essentially forced into a reform mode or rather a consideration
of the need for reform the consideration of the need to find some new way to deal with new
western power by developments toward the middle of the 19th century we've already noted the importance
of the first opium war beginning in 1839 in bringing the chinese to realize that the west
now had a military force that was capable of unseating chinese policy intentions and chinese
traditions the chinese also also had to come to realize that the west was so eager to gain access
to chinese wealth and markets that it would push virtually any kind of product that would
accomplish this end and opium was obviously a case in point japan's introduction was a little later
and possibly a little less crude and maybe here is one of the reasons for different experiences
later on but japan also was forced the arrival of western fleets from the united states britain
and elsewhere the arrival of western fleets was not merely a hollow demonstration would you please
open your markets it was a statement if you don't we will come in with force and there were
actual military clashes during the ensuing couple of decades between western forces and those of
japan and there were ongoing western constraints on japanese activity westerners planted in japan
for example to insist on regulation of japanese tariff policy these constraints would ease only
in the early 20th century so forced entry unwelcome intrusion are factors in both cases now in theory
possibly even in history one might have expected the chinese to react more successfully than the
japanese after all it was china that had the great political tradition japan had patched up its
politics under the toko gao shogunate but nobody would point to the japanese state as a world model
of this juncture the chinese also had its tradition of technological superiority that it might call on
the japanese although certainly not big technological laggards had fewer inventions
to point to their credit perhaps most interestingly of all and this is a factor that continues to
color the japanese experience japan was in terms of responding to the industrial pressure from the
west what japan was resource poor it had small holdings of coal but insufficient fuel supplies
really to sustain an industrial revolution it needed to support other kinds of materials
cotton for example metal ores in ways that china did not china's advantages here were
considerable and maybe over time will win out but for the moment the first proposition is as
both societies were forced into the consideration of change japan might have been expected to have
a great deal more trouble japan did of course have some assets unlike china its 18th century
experience had begun to move toward a bit more openness to foreign influence china had done the
reverse japan had moved more clearly toward dissemination of education in the confucian
or buddhist mold then had china where education was still reserved more exclusively for members of
the elite these advantages and others may begin to help tell the story of why reactions differed
beginning in 1868 after 15 years of real debate and near civil war over what to do with many
upper class japanese samurai advocating a resistance to the west and only gradually being forced to
concede victory to the forces of reform also from the upper classes in 1868 japan launched on a major
series of reforms that go under the heading the meiji era meiji means enlightened there was a
new emperor known as meiji or the enlightened one most of the reforms were actually not dictated by
the emperor but by talented advisors around him some of whom had active exposure to the west
japan began even before 1868 to send certain observers to the united states in western europe
to find out what went on there and what might be emulating the meiji era included reforms in
really an impressive variety of categories politics was obviously one in 1868 the feudal system was
abolished and gradually over the next couple of decades the japanese evolved a system of parliamentary
monarchy with a constitution based on limited suffrage but with a parliament that looked indeed
the parliamentarians dressed very much uh in the western fashion japan managed also to begin to forge
a new kind of elite that among other things would dominate the government an elite which
continued to include representatives of the military of the old feudal classes although no
longer officially titled but with a strong admixture from newer business elements and some
intellectuals creating an upper class that was arguably more flexible more open to change while
not exactly immune to tradition at the same time political change was joined by a number of other
kinds of reform obviously early attention went to changes in the military japanese began to create
a european style military structure they began to create a modern navy they upgraded the technology
of their military infrastructure was also modernized quite quickly railroad networks were
established that really along with with new kinds of shipping unified the various islands that make
up japan to a much greater extent than had ever been possible before i'd mentioned previously
japanese enthusiasm for new public health measures that began to permit the rapid expansion of japanese
population a problem ultimately but a source of strength as well in 1872 the japanese mandated
a mass education system revealingly requiring school attendance not only for boys but for girls
a major departure in japanese tradition it took 15 20 years for this school system really to reach
mass proportions even the japanese could not work overnight miracles but by the 1890s relevant age
groups really were literate really were schooled in ways that had no precedent in japanese experience
prior to that time educational reform also included significant modifications of the
intellectual tradition a major educational reformer fukuzawa argued explicitly that confucianism
was holding japan back because of its hostility to new kinds of science and its insistence on the
hold of tradition over newer or creative thinking fukuzawa was not an entire innovator he would also
periodically recognize the value of confucian traditions but there was no question particularly
for the upper classes for the talented elite japan increasingly opened educational opportunities
that would emphasize scientific and technical training and also schooling in modern languages
headed by english and german in ways again that were quite new in the japanese experience
japanese enthusiasm for change extended quickly to consumer items although japan partly for reasons
still of of lower standards of living hardly became a western consumer paradise immediately
enthusiasm for products like toothpaste for example grew quite rapidly by the 1880s and by 1900
department stores were establishing themselves in sections of tokyo that were particularly seen
as windows into the newer kind of life this reform and its broad sweeping nature its its
application to so many different aspects of life really needs to be emphasized this reform however
was not a complete cave-in to westernization a specific example cropped up again in the field
of education in the 1880s in the 1870s after the 1872 education measure for a brief span of years
the japanese really seemed bent on creating a western education system they imported western
teachers they imported a professor from rutgers university to head the system this looked like
westernization in the making but in the 1880s under imperial leadership they pulled back
mass education remained scientific and technical emphasis remained bought western books in the
social sciences were increasingly restricted japanese textbooks were written and the and the
guiding theme here was the importance of maintaining japanese traditions new or old
that emphasized group loyalty loyalty to the emperor as opposed to western individualism
western skepticism values that were seen as hostile to japanese development and political
stability finally of course the reforms included a massive effort at industrialization outright
by the 1890s japan was beginning to establish a significant factory system strong emphasis of
course on export production because japan could only survive by producing enough for world markets
that it could afford the fuels and equipment that were needed for industrialization to operate
effectively japanese industrialization was stimulated by high taxes on the peasantry which
helped free up funds for investment by poor working conditions massive utilization of
women workers for silk manufacture was involved here in frankly near-servile conditions with
young girls bought from their families and taken to sweatshops where they were housed and regulated
by their employers but the use of silk for exports and the capacity to seize a good bit of the silk
export market from the chinese by concentrating on it by using modest changes in equipment
provided vital opportunities for foreign earnings and capital formation that in turn would fuel a
more general industrial development in the future by the early 1900s the japanese were
capable not only of making modern steamships but also modern trains by the second decade of the 20th
century japanese industrialization would be moving into a heavy industrialization as well as
light export industry phase and the process was often running in a pattern that would yield
ultimate share of world industrial leadership to the japanese by the second half of the 20th
century china's pattern of course was vastly different there was no clear decision to embark on
reform the first railway line built in china by a private outfit was actually torn up by the
government that just was resistant to this kind of uh technical progress this kind of imitation
of outside example the chinese were modestly interested in western military innovations
but without a more thoroughgoing reform pattern they simply couldn't afford or organize the kind
of military and political changes that would allow them to catch up to western standards
hesitation hostility were part of a pattern of hesitation that has led one historian michael
gaster to write a book about china's struggle to modernize an interesting title that sort
of captures the spirit of this age china's responses were obviously further complicated
by massive internal unrest in the middle of the 19th century civil war broke out between the forces
of the government and a new kind of semi-christian religious group that led to massive levels of
death and dislocation china's reactions were hampered obviously by the increasing tendency of
most of the western powers and russia to seize chunks of chinese territory where they did indeed
for example around shanghai develop new kinds of industry but industry under western rather than
chinese control these um intrusions on chinese territory reduced chinese economic capacity
particularly in some of the areas that were most uh accessible to foreign trade uh they caused
consternation they caused increased hostility to the foreigners themselves the box of rebellion
would be a manifestation a quite understandable manifestation of anti-foreign hostility that
tended to channel passions in ways that the japanese were devoting rather to reform efforts
only gradually beginning in the 1890s did the chinese begin and to organize and organize may
already seem too formal did the chinese begin to uh to see more concerted efforts
to come to terms with the new situation it was at this point for example that significant numbers
of university students began to go from china to places like japan or the united states it was
at this point that christian missionary activity began to have some impact in setting up new kinds
of educational institutions in china proper it was at this point interestingly that foreign
criticism combined with some chinese reform sentiment directly to begin to attack the
old practice of foot binding which would now gradually decline so there was reaction but it
was late and it was obviously incomplete and it contrasts quite markedly with what was going on
in japan so why explanation i think is predictably complicated because again uh one might have assumed
that china's response would have been more effective than the japanese but here are some components
obviously though there's a chicken and egg element here western encroachments on china
were much more unsettling than those on japan partly because the west had a an older historical
first for chinese access the japanese produced some goods the west wanted but there was less
pent up demand for interference and that may have helped provide some breathing room for the japanese
quite clearly also and here there's an element i think of historical accident
quite clearly also western intervention caught japan and china in different phases of a political
cycle the chinese were in one of their periodic political daldrums they don't happen too often
but they were happening to the ching dynasty by the middle of the 19th century and this meant that
western intrusion was less opposed less effectively opposed the chinese wrote eloquent letters for
example protesting the the opium war and the introduction of opium but they were pretty
powerless to do much partly because their government was so debilitated by that juncture
the toko go shogunate had his own problems there was some social unrest from the later 18th century
onward there were periodic problems with uh collecting sufficient tax revenue but the japanese
state encountered the west at a point of greater strength it needed to be revamped that's what the
major reforms in the political arena did but there was more intrinsic strength in the first place
one can also suggest and we've hinted at this already that although japan and china both
operated within a confucian tradition japanese confucianism had been somewhat less um traditionalist
somewhat less bent on absolute resistance to foreign influence and more interested than the
chinese tradition in spreading the benefits of education at least slightly more widely
than the elite itself japanese feudalism something that was absent from chinese tradition at least
since the middle of the classical period japanese feudalism may have created an advantage in two
respects first of all the extent to which feudal classes remained in japan gave japan a uh a quicker
appreciation of the military aspects of the western challenge then occurred in china where the
military simply although possessed of a of an impressive tradition where the military simply
had less voice japanese feudalism may also have created types of group loyalties that could be
utilized for industrialization that could be utilized for political action even in a
newer parliamentary system china didn't have this tradition and obviously that may have been
a factor as well very simply japan had a history although not a recent one of successful imitation
and china did not japanese could know from their earlier interact interactions with china itself
japanese could know that it was possible to imitate without losing your identity without
surrendering to foreigners china's one big experience of imitation the more importation of
buddhism had ended fairly badly their experience with the mongols had in their opinion ended
fairly badly and there was no tradition of a sense of fruitful interaction with influences from the
outside and every reason in terms of chinese tradition to be very suspicious of this kind of
possibility unquestionably when you add up traditions of imitation political effectiveness
possibly even an element of of of transformed military feudalism without question the japanese
managed to borrow from the west while controlling western influence much more effectively than any
other non-western society in the long 19th century of course the japanese copied from the west of
course they imported western educational and military advisors and of course every so often
they seem to indulge in almost silly kinds of consumer fads orgies of interest in western
styles and fashion but the japanese managed fairly carefully to regulate the actual levels of western
ownership during industrialization they had to borrow from the west they had to import western
technologies but far more effectively for example than the russians in the same period actual western
ownership was limited and as we've seen in the educational sphere actual western influence was
modified by an insistence on a mixture of old and invented traditions of japanese group loyalty
solidarity emperor worship and that sort of thing the difference between japan and china
was not simply a sterile exercise in 19th century dynamics it obviously by the end of the 19th
century had very real consequences in the 1890s japan and china went toward directly and to everybody's
surprise except that of the japanese the japanese won fairly handily they had the modern military
they had already sufficient industrial strength to fuel the modern military they had a navy that
was superior to that of china they beat the chinese and began to establish as a result
the pattern of japanese influence in korea which was one of the areas of contest that would be
such an important aspect of japanese policy and korean experience on into the second world war
japan would soon also confront russia also over bragging rights and power relationships
in the pacific in the russia japanese war of 1945 and again to everybody's surprise except that of
the japanese the japanese won that also russia although industrializing remained a more cumbersome
society had more trouble bringing military force to bear in the pacific then did the japanese who
were there who were more effective industrially already at this point etc so power balances began
to shift as the japanese began to make their own claim into a global power or at least a strong
regional power relationship that was very very new in terms of japanese history the result was
obviously a series of tensions between japan and china that began to translate comparative
differences into ongoing military hostilities that would extend into the renewed japanese
attack on china in the 1930s would extend into world war two and even today marks continued
hostility and tension and anxiety between these two significant asian powers a somewhat less
concrete but also very real result of the different paths of japan and china in the
long 19th century involves social stability japan's reform pattern remember it had a near
civil war that helped out helped sort out some tensions before the reform uh uh sequence began
in earnest japan's reform experience including its industrialization created massive social
tension there were lots of japanese who worried that that valued traditions were being lost there
were lots of japanese exploited workers who sought to express themselves in social protest
only to be repressed often rather brutally by the government so this was not an easy process or
one in which the japanese waltzed nicely into modernity but the japanese did manage the japanese
did manage to affect significant change without complete social upheaval the chinese experience
here obviously was quite different without trying to make a revolutionary outcome seem
absolutely inevitable it seemed to many chinese leaders to many reform minded chinese by the
second decade of the 20th century that the only way china was going to be able to get off the
dime the only way china was going to be able to mount a successful response to western intrusion
and western example was through outright revolution through a major forcible change
in chinese political social and cultural structures this is what happened in china this too
would differentiate chinese and japanese experience not only in the middle of the 20th
century but in ways that continue to reverberate the japanese experience at the end of the long
19th century was long really unique japan is an absolutely fascinating but unusual case
of significant response to outside stimulus without totally losing identity again modernization
without full westernization and it needs to be taken not only as an important addition to the
roster of industrial and military powers of the modern world but as a as a fascinating example
of a capacity to change constructively without again collapsing all signs of traditional identity
china's case although in extreme the chinese sluggishness in responding to outside challenge
which we've tried briefly to explain was greater than that of many other societies
china's case was however in many ways the more typical lots of societies for various specific
reasons had difficulty coming to terms with what the west was now suggesting was necessary for
effective political and economic operation but equally obviously one final point the chinese
deficit here if that's a fair term for their difficulties of the later 19th century the chinese
deficit here was not permanent we're talking here about a century or so of clear disarray and
confusion mixing internal tensions with the force of outside intrusion and exploitation but this
was not the last stage in china's modern story and when we pick up beginning next time with the
advent of the final period in world history we will have among other things not only to recognize
the significance of japan's ongoing role and and its example of modernization without absolute loss
of identity but the growing muscle of china in world affairs as well
lecture 29 the 20th and 21st centuries as a new period
we're talking today about the 20th and 21st centuries as a new period in world history
this is the first of eight discussions we'll have about contemporary developments in world
history's perspective and indeed the the period is best known as the contemporary period because
although it began in the 20th century in most respects it seems to be continuing into the
21st for how long we obviously don't know any new period in world history raises issues of
selection of major themes it's never magical or automatic to make sure you've identified the
right things but this new period in world history is obviously particularly challenging and i always
stress with world history teachers that if they don't find the 20th 21st centuries the hardest
possibly the most interesting but the hardest period to deal with they may be doing something
wrong there are several ways to state the challenges the first one and i really want to
mention this though it's a little bit uh oblique to the main point the first one is to make sure
that as we talk about developments over the past century we make sure to me to maintain contact
with earlier patterns with the characteristics of some of the individual major civilizations
with earlier processes that had been established in world history because there's a danger of all
of a sudden jumping into the excitement of change and tumult and forgetting that there is a history
that went before so this is a new period i don't see any reason to engage in sterile debates about
whether 1914 and world war one usher in a new period it's well established it would be fairly
silly to challenge it but it's not a period that stands in isolation from what went before
and this raises challenge number two a little more specific although it's a new period there
is obviously carryover from what happened in the long 19th century as well as even earlier
for example the influence of the west continued to be very strong on into the 21st century
particularly perhaps in the area of culture to some extent in terms of political institutions
and certainly still in world economics and military power the world economy also persisted
in some ways this is a theme we're going to talk about more specifically next time it really should
be folded into the periodization discussion but it's another continuity and if we argue as we
briefly did that one can trace the limited beginnings of modernization in the latter part
of the long 19th century clearly modernization blossoms further with all the cautions attached
to the concept in the contemporary period so novelty yes i think it's valid to say new period
but the spillover is unsurprising and significant the two key issues however in dealing with the
contemporary period in world history that we didn't have in previous periods the two key issues
involve the recency and complexity of developments over the past century and the simple fact that
we don't know the end of the story we can talk about change away from long 19th century patterns
and we'll do that quite concretely in our discussion here but we can't always indeed we can't usually
say well the the the old patterns have shifted and now the new patterns are well established they
aren't and we can have questions we can see change we can't make final determinations
usually of new directions and that's just part of the territory the busyness of the past century
partly of course reflects our own involvement in it some of us live through a fair part of it
and it also reflects the extent to which we are traditionally and properly filled
with stories about world war one about world war two the depression some of the development
since world war two etc it's it's hard to place this in perspective it's hard to sort out and
making this a little bit more specific the 20th early 21st centuries themselves since 1914
are conventionally divided into three chunks there is 1914 to 1945 dominated by two world wars
the depression the clear disarray of western society some stirrings in other societies the
force of new revolutions particularly in the soviet union this is period number one period
number two 1945 to around 1990 involves obviously the overarching system of the cold war which
although i think less important than it seemed at the time obviously provides an alternative
to the main frame of reference that applied to the world war and interwar period and then the
soviet union collapses the cold war is officially over and one enters the third phase of the
contemporary era marked perhaps by the emergence of the united states as quote the world's only
superpower possibly by the early 21st century with some new questions about whether even that
role was going to last all that long i think the best way to sort out this internal periodization
because frankly 30 year chunks are just too short for world history they would magnify details in
the contemporary experience at the expense of the big picture i think the best way to sort out these
intermediate chunks is to see world war one as opening a new series of questions about the western
role in the world and particularly west european role which led to a clear decline of western
european world affairs marked after world war two which then opened a transitional framework in which
at least officially the soviet union and its allies and the us and its allies disputed world
dominance that transitional system failed much like other earlier transitional systems for example
the great chinese voyages at the end of the post classical period other transitional systems have
been sketched and failed the cold war was a first statement of what to do about the shifting world
power balance it didn't last and now in the third phase of the contemporary era were involved in
some more open-ended questions about what the new power structure will be and we'll return to this
in just a moment one final preliminary and the preliminaries are again a little more
detailed than usual because this really is a tough assignment an intriguing one but tough
we are accustomed to hearing that the pace of change has sped up in the modern world and maybe
it has but it's really important to remember that if this is a new and major period in world history
opening up with world war one it's still very novel its advent is still very recent so it's not
totally surprising that some of the details have yet to be worked out some of the new themes
have yet to be fully established change may well speed up but we don't want to exaggerate that
process it takes a while for any world history period to sort itself out and i think that's
clearly involved here all right what are the new themes i want to begin by sketching a few
possibilities most of which yield this nagging question well what's the actual novelty here
what's the what's the definite new pattern then talk about the clearest way in which the long
19th century stops predominating and then turn more positively to the basic themes that i think
are really definitional for this contemporary era socially if you look at the world in 1900 or even
1914 the dominant social class in most societies a couple of exceptions to be sure including the
united states the dominant social class in most societies was still the landed aristocracy the
class that had loomed so large in the history of agricultural civilizations for many centuries
by the early 21st century while landed aristocrats still played some role in some cases the aristocracy
is really pretty well gone a huge change in the fabric of world social structure and it had been
replaced and here i think we can see what came next it had been replaced by a new kind of middle
class upper business professional class sometimes mixing in government bureaucrats that thought of
the world more in industrial than in agricultural terms more in urban terms than in rural more in
managerial structures than in terms of private land ownership a really significant shift this is
one way to say this is a new period and in this case we can even put a face on the next pattern
something of the same thing applies to politics but here with later certainty about what the
new pattern is striking fact if you look at the world's major political regimes in 1900 or even
1910 they were predominantly monarchies or empires again some interesting exceptions but predominantly
in most parts of the world if you look at the dominant political regimes of the early 21st
century these systems are largely gone a huge change not just compared to the long 19th century
but compared to the longer history of agricultural societies in the world what the alternatives were
however was less clearly established democracies in some instances perhaps a growing number of
instances replaced monarchies and empires but other candidates still successful in the early 21st
century included authoritarian regimes communist systems it's clear that the old political systems
had stopped working with very few exceptions less clear whether there would be a single agreed upon
alternative that would take their place women's affairs and again we'll talk more extensively
about this in a later discussion women women's affairs or gender relationships also seem to
enter a clear new period in this contemporary world history era older systems of patriarchy began to be
modified by efforts to give women the vote improve their educational levels provide them some new
legal rights even by the later 20th century even reduce average birth rates in almost every
region of the world though at different rates on the other hand it was not clear exactly how you
define the gender system that would replace the old system it wasn't yet at least clearly egalitarian
it hadn't clearly worked out on a global basis what women's economic role should be it hadn't
clearly worked out some issues of ongoing or renewed male violence against women we can see
change it's valid to see the contemporary period partly defined by significant shifts and new
questions about gender relations but defining the new is not as easy as suggesting that the
suggesting that the old was beginning to disappear and finally this is very much the case and again
we'll have a an explicit discussion of this very much the case when one turns to culture
the contemporary period of world history sees a clear set of new challenges to certain kinds
of older cultural beliefs challenges coming from communism from a greater mass appeal of
nationalism and from consumerism and science values that were emphasized in places like the west
and japan but first of all these new cultural options didn't entirely agree with each other
and second of all quite clearly they had not by the early 21st century clearly succeeded in
displacing the old no most notably the hold of world religions the cultural map of this
contemporary period of world history was exceedingly complicated and one can't even say for sure
that the older patterns that had prevailed previously had been definitively vanquished
point one then in addition to the preliminaries on the complexities of the period itself point one
it's possible certainly in social structure almost certainly in political regimes fairly
extensively in gender relationships it's possible very clearly to see that something new began to
go on in the world beginning fairly early in the 20th century less clear particularly aside from
the replacement of the old upper class socially less clear how the world would come to define
what the alternative system would turn out to be or whether there would in fact be a clear
decision about this at all and in the cultural realm lots of change lots of effervescence
lots of lots of real conversions to new patterns of belief but no overall clarity at all as to what
was going to become core become central in global cultures and possibly culture will remain at
least for a long time one of those areas and this isn't a new phenomenon in world history either
where you simply have to say you can't define the period in this category you have to look
on a case-by-case basis despite the presence of some overarching trends and questions
the clearest way to begin a more coherent definition of this new period in world history
and particularly the clearest reason to begin essentially with world war one involves the
the shift away from several of the dominant patterns of the long 19th century and even
to some extent aspects of the early modern period clearest here in turn remember we're
going to talk about the world economy next time clearest here in turn is the relative decline
of the west this i have to say is somewhat controversial sometimes people get upset about
this particularly if the united states is included in the west so i want to be clear
relative decline first of all does not necessarily mean absolute decline many people worried during
the period between the world wars many people worried that the west was really beginning to fade
as rome had faded earlier or other analogies of this sort the revival of western europe the
success of the united states after world war two may well have put these fears permanently to rest
we don't yet know obviously the future there are continued concerns that 50 years hence western
europe will simply be less significant than it is today and there may even be some some questions
about the united states staying power but to date this century has not seen from from an
internal standpoint this century has not seen a clear decline in western affairs and indeed
western europe has been remarkable in post world war two particularly in its ability to absorb
loss of power particularly loss of colonies without denting basic economic uh political
and cultural dynamism and capacity capacity to innovate we're also not arguing that the west
has somehow declined relatively so much that it's still not a and perhaps the major player in world
power politics but i think the evidence here is compelling and again i think it begins to show itself
in world war one world wars one and two in many senses can be seen apart from their global
dimensions which are also important as a giant internal civil war within the west in which the
west accelerated its inability to maintain its power position in the world because of the amount
of damage different western societies inflicted on each other in not just one but two major conflicts
economic damage huge population losses erosion of the capacity to rule other parts of the world
etc the measurements of relative decline that are particularly important i think are twofold
although again we'll have to talk about a world economy angle here next time as well first of all
military of course in the early 21st century the west particularly if the us is included still
possessed the greatest amount of military power in the world as a whole the us way ahead of the
whole pack but the capacity of the west the capacity that was so obvious in so many parts
of the world during the long 19th century the capacity of the west to move almost at will
militarily clearly had stopped by the second half of the 20th century several factors obviously
contributed to this including the extent to which western countries themselves particularly in europe
began to be less willing to invest quite as heavily in military activities to maintain
uh fully cutting-edge military technologies first beyond this several other parts of the
world began to emphasize new military tactics that could stalemate the west's advantage in
conventional armament the big development here wasn't new but it became more important the
big development here was the success of guerrilla warfare in places like vietnam but also as it
turns out if you look at algeria and then more recently iraq the capacity of resistance elements
in urban settings also successfully to resist the overwhelming superiority of western armaments
the west's military advantage uncontested still could obviously be almost nullified by the emphasis
on these renewed strategies second as individual countries even middle-sized countries outside
the west gained independence and gained some measure of growing economic capacity one of the
things they did with these two developments was to invest in increasingly significant military
force which meant that the capacity of small numbers of western troops easily to move into
a country like iraq was actually gone the west of course could still defeat middle-sized countries
but it took a lot more planning it took a lot more economic commitment like the huge build up
before the gulf war of the early 1990s and obviously as iraq would later demonstrate even
that kind of military success though possible in one sense didn't really assure victory so point one
from the 15th century onward on the whole the west had been gaining increasing military
advantage over other societies first on the seas then in the long 19th century on land as well
the contemporary period of world history saw this trend interrupted not eliminated yet but interrupted
and the west's military action in the wider world became more complicated and more contested
related to this was the second key development the west's capacity to control most of the rest of
the world directly through colonies and colonial administrations clearly ended in the contemporary
period of world history which means that one of the really key developments beginning between the
wars and again world war one is a is a valid starting point and accelerating after world war
two one of the key developments in setting the framework for this new period in world history
was the movement of decolonization the west's willingness or inability to resist the formation
of independent nations where colonies or significant western enclaves had previously
predominated now of course western political and economic influence could survive decolonization
in some cases but the political map of the world became not just more detailed in terms of the huge
increase in the number of independent nations but more complicated in the sense of a much reduced
capacity of any single civilization or society to dominate the world politically relative military
decline clear political decline some new competition in the economic sphere which again
will detail in a fuller sense in our next session these developments marked a clear
termination of one of the dominant themes of the long 19th century setting the stage obviously
for other themes to take their place what's the final outcome again i have to come back
to uncertainty some people argue that the relative decline of the west will ultimately yield
predominance of another civilization and probably the most common candidate is east asia but
although we've had many world history periods the post classical the long 19th century in which
one civilization really did wield a power position much greater than others there's no
inherent reason for this to be the next pattern maybe there will be greater balance among several
sectors in the world either harmoniously relatively speaking or amid great tension again we don't know
the end of the story all we know is that the story is largely new several new themes do begin i think
to gain ascendancy in this contemporary period of world history themes that were only sketched
hinted at or prepared in the long 19th century previously a couple of candidates need to be
mentioned and then i want to turn to what seemed to me to be the two crucial ones first of all
obviously some centuries hence people may look back at the contemporary period of world history and
say ah the fundamental innovation in this period was the beginning of humankind's conquest of outer
space and i'm perfectly willing hoping that our societies last long enough for this to be possible
i'm perfectly willing for this verdict to be rendered but in the early 21st century although
space exploration has occurred it has not yet had sufficiently deep impact on the nature of human life
or the main patterns of global societies for me to do more than list the possibility for a future
retrospective a more serious candidate is the altered nature of war in the 20th century and
the altered nature of military technology the two world wars were what some observers have
described as total war that is they mobilized all the major resources of key combatants not just
armies and navies but the economy harnessed to the war effort propaganda tying civilians into
the emotional qualities of war and there was a third total war in the later 20th century the
several years conflict between iran and iraq add to this obviously the fact that world war two
ushered in a new military technology that could as far as anyone knows bring human life and perhaps
life in general to an end in the world nuclear military capacity and you have a possible formula
one of the key new themes of the contemporary era in world history clearly different from patterns
previously involved heightened organizational capacity in war the fact that all resources could
be bent to the conflict and societies insist on total surrender as a result of this investment
plus the new and devastating and fearsome new technology and maybe this has reshaped
world affairs more generally i'm not frankly absolutely sure many wars continue to be conducted
at slightly less awesome rates world diplomacy has not been entirely reshaped by the nuclear
threat so put this down as a possible and maybe with an asterisk we hope this will not become
one of the defining characteristics of the new world history period the two that i think are
again in addition to the negative the relative decline of the west the two themes that i do
think deserve clear emphasis are first of all massive global population increase the 20th
century saw a tripling of world populations from about two billion to over six billion and the
process would clearly continue at least into the middle of the 21st century at that point
declining birth rates may usher in a new demographic regime among other things featuring the growing
aging of societies and maybe all bets will be off but for the moment this huge surge in global
populations is a noteworthy phenomenon in its own right never before had world populations
increased so rapidly in such a short span of time and it carries over into a number of other
definable features that begin to reshape the world although there had been a couple of hints
in the latter latter stages of the long 19th century for example world population explosion
clearly helps encourage new patterns of immigration and instead of immigration largely
consisting of movements of peoples to societies that were broadly speaking culturally somewhat
similar to points of origin immigration particularly by the later 20th century though there were
hints even in the 1920s and 30s immigration now increasingly consists of peoples moving from
africa latin america parts of asia to particularly western societies not just the us now but western
europe as well as of course canada australia and to a limited extent even to japan movements that
bring people from much different cultural backgrounds together that constitute a much more
interesting mix and possibly a more challenging and tensor mix than most migration patterns had
previously involved so population explosion vital in itself leading to new types of immigration
patterns and new challenges to many societies in the process population explosion also places
unprecedented stress on global environments global environmental change and i'm not merely
trying to be politically correct here global environment environmental change is an inescapable
facet of development certainly by the later 20th century and while there are several components
the population explosion the sheer multiplication of human wastes becomes
an inescapable part of this process that's theme one defining theme number two probably more
predictable involves the steady not constant but recurrent acceleration of communications and
transportation technologies that speed up contacts around the world that speed up the capacity of
people to move quickly in contact with other people that set a i think revolutionary new
technological framework for relationships among major societies key developments obviously include
radio sometimes linked by an undersea cable of the emergence of of satellite communications
the emergence in 1990 of the internet air travel the list is long and frankly fairly familiar
but the main point is not the list of specific technologies but the extent to which they pose
unprecedented new opportunities and in some ways unprecedented threats and challenges
to the identities of individual societies the acceleration of movement of ideas goods and
peoples what sometimes gets referred to as globalization which we will turn to in the
very final discussion in this sequence this it seems to me is an indisputable mark of the
new period in world history now we don't fully know how this one will work out either again
we can see the new forces we can't fully determine what kind of world they're going to shape because
we're only a century in to the new developments we'll turn next time as i suggested to changes
in the world economy where unexpectedly i think we'll find some echoes of the themes
we've been talking about today significant new change not full certainty about what the changes
will lead to
lecture 30 the world economy change and continuity
we're talking in this session about the world economy in the contemporary period of world
history 20th early 21st centuries this is a fascinating opportunity to note continuity
in world history between long 19th century or even early modern slash long 19th century and
contemporary but ultimately also to talk about change and the discussion today needs to be put
in the context of the kind of periodization of the contemporary era that we talked about in
the previous session at first blush one might argue this is one area where continuity predominates
after all you can concede independence of new nations you can concede changes in the
situation of women but surely in the world economy there's more persistence than change
the core as we've discussed it in previous sessions undoubtedly still exists and therefore
peripheries still exist that's continuity although we have to note some important adjustments
we use a term the third world that in some ways would seem to enshrine continuity
the first second third world ideas were initially cold war terms but over time
third world came to mean parts of the world that were not industrialized that were vastly poorer
than the first world higher rates of infant mortality lower educational levels lower life
expectancy a whole series of indices by which we measured great gaps between the industrialized
part of the world and the bulk of the world gaps that obviously had begun to open up in the long
19th century in many ways and the world economy concept itself as enunciated by Emmanuel Wallerstein
was meant to enshrine persistence Wallerstein's whole point he's a sociologist not an historian
Wallerstein's whole point was that you needed to go back to the early modern period and then the
19th century to see the origins of the fatal economic gaps that would persist in the contemporary
world that's why he was interested and again he was partly right the core core characteristics
can still be identified in the 21st century there are societies in the world and they include
old core participants western europe much of western europe at least and the united states
which had joined the core so solidly by 1900 core societies continued to operate and in broad
outlines in ways that were quite similar to their previous patterns they exported expensive goods
they imported cheaper goods they relied on wage labor they had for the most part strong and often
fairly stable governments the basic definitions that we saw applicable even in the 16th century
again the goods changed the core now exported financial services professional services of
various sorts including banking and and other kinds of consultations they included interestingly
a whole host of entertainment staples the second largest export of the united states by the 1990s
involved movies videos music etc and by the early 21st century japan's leading export
involved recreational activities of this sort animated cartoons movies music games of course
etc so the list here had changed but again one was talking about relatively sophisticated products
through which one could make a good bit of money the trading companies that dominated the export of
these goods still emanated from the core ships now might carry the flags of other countries for
convenience purposes but the basic definition still applied there were a couple of anomalies
that had probably begun to develop in the 19th century that need to be noted a few societies
mostly where white settlers predominated didn't actually display core characteristics in terms
of export import but managed still to maintain a fairly high standard of living notably places
like canada and australia canada a leading raw materials and food supplier to the united states
australia by the later 20th century the leading raw materials supplier to japan produced a lot of
goods that were technically unprocessed though they had significant industrial sectors as well
but because they produced these goods with relatively sophisticated technology and paid
relatively high wages they sort of fit a semi core definition in ways that don't need to delay us
too much peripheries obviously still existed because core can't exist without periphery
peripheries still characterized by relatively weak governments perhaps a bit stronger than
before but relatively weak on a global scale peripheries continue to export cheap goods
these goods might now include lower level kinds of factory production where low labor
costs predominated that is textile goods certain kinds of electronic equipment this sort of thing
so again the roster changes but the basic definition and particularly the fundamental
inferiority in global economic exchange continued to be significant the location of the periphery
obviously shifted there were still peripheral societies in parts of latin america parts though
not all of central america and parts of the andean region in latin america the exports of these
parts of latin america sometimes now included some new goods not only some cheap factory
products in certain instances for example from nicaragua but also goods such as drugs that
many observers have argued are in some ways a classic peripheral good in which a few people
can make a good bit of money most of the actual peasant producers of the good earn very little
and the good enters the world economic exchange in order to be exchanged with the core an odd
anomaly but one that actually might fit rather interestingly into the world economic framework
the key periphery now however during the contemporary period of world history
became many parts of sub-saharan africa where food supplies raw materials mining supplies
became predominant although africa had been colonized by the end of the long 19th century
it's really only in the 20th century that the african economy becomes converted more fully to
peripheral status with the colonial powers expanding mining operations converting many
areas to the production of goods like cotton the portuguese in their colonies in africa for
example greatly expanded cotton production at the expanse of soil quality and local food production
as well the peripheralization of africa was really a significant development in the contemporary
period and marks one of the features we most obviously note and frequently lament about the
state of much of africa today so location shifts but again many aspects of the fundamental definition
prevail probably the most striking shift if we just stopped there that one would have to note
during the contemporary period of world history was the significant entry to the core first of
japan and then of other parts of the pacific rim headed of course by south korea and taiwan
the advent of japan and the pacific rim japan of course had begun industrializing at the end of
the 19th century emerged into core status only after the 1950s when it rapidly became the second
largest economy in the world after the united states the emergence of these societies into the
core was a truly significant world historical development in two senses obviously first most
basically it now significantly modified the easy association of core with west so when we talk about
the relative decline of the western world affairs we now can add that the core is essentially
essential monopoly over core of western europe's essential monopoly over core status is now
qualified significantly by the addition of parts of east asia the more subtle change that this
development involves is obviously the recognition that a second culture zone becomes capable of
advanced industrialization and participation in the core japan south korea taiwan imitated western
countries in many respects they imported technologies they took advantage of western
economic assistance in some instances or military purchases in the case for example of south korea
but they did not operate from a fundamentally western cultural base but rather from a modified
confucianism and it became clear that confucianism was a second cultural tradition that could be
adjusted in ways that were successful in world economic competition confucian emphasis on group
group loyalty on group values on collective decision making and obedience to decisions
once made on close relationships between the state and what we would call the private sector
these attributes were obviously different from those of the west but as it turns out equally
successful to the point that for a time in the 1980s westerners were wondering if their economies
didn't need to shift toward a more neo-confucian basis this obviously again represented an important
set of changes so one could look at key developments in the contemporary period of world history
and argue the world economy is still flourishing for better or for worse there are still societies
that reap disproportionate benefits from world economic trade there are still societies that labor
under terribly difficult inferiorities the pattern is basically persistent all that's changed is
some geography some of the entrance in both camps and some of the specific goods exchanged
and these would be important observations that obviously among other things call attention to
the persistence and sometimes the worsening of global economic inequalities and the other gaps
that accompany this in terms of life expectancy levels educational levels and so on but emphasis
on persistence would I think miss the more important development which was the clear beginnings at least
of efforts to move away from the world economic framework in one of several ways or maybe more
than one because efforts were frequently conjoined the world economic framework in this sense is
still a very useful analytical tool for contemporary world history but in terms of adjustment and
reaction not of literal continuity several things happened perhaps first beginning fairly early
in the 20th century a number of societies decided that the world economy was not working to their
benefit and they needed to use political devices to pull out to set up their own market framework
their own exchange framework that would release them from primary dependence on global economic
relationships the first big country to do this was of course Russia under communism particularly
under Stalinism where the doctrine of socialism in one country essentially proclaimed that the
Soviet Union could carry through an industrialization process without significant contact with the
rest of the world they would not sell a lot to the rest of the world they would not buy a lot from
the rest of the world they would not depend on outside experts save to a very limited degree
and at least for several decades it looked like this policy which was really really a revival
of an attempt to be external it looked like this policy worked the soviet process of industrialization
accelerated rapidly at many points for example during the 1950s soviet economic growth seemed to
be more rapid than that of places like the united states we know now that all of this came at
considerable cost in terms of low wages social frustration and environmental damage but at
the time it looked like a very successful policy and it certainly certainly freed this country
the soviet union from world economic relations of the walrstonian sort china later under chairman
mao particularly in the 1960s period attempted a similar isolation initially china's industrialization
after the communist revolution was completed in 1949 china's industrialization was meant to proceed
along somewhat soviet lines and in conjunction with the soviet union but then china moved toward
even a more go-it-alone policy with the notion that it could utilize its vast population base
create industrial centers and individual households and bypass some of the conventional
apparatus of industrialization and it could do this largely independently of the rest of the
world including now the somewhat hostile soviet union a fascinating experiment over several
decades in relative economic isolation japanese efforts as world war two neared to set up a
a set of japanese relationships with a colonial sphere in east and southeast asia represented
another effort at partial economic isolation japan envisaged what it called the co-prosperity sphere
in which a set of countries would trade with japan in unequal relationships it was sort of a
world economy and miniature but in substantial isolation from larger world currents nazi germany
obviously also to some extent sought to separate itself from the world economy the basic hope was
if hope is the right word was that germany could set up a colonial relationship with the agricultural
regions of eastern europe and again have a mini world economy in which german industrial might
was supported by cheap exports from the slavic hinterland and again would isolate itself from
world economic currents this was a fascinating interlude and it is obviously echoed even in the
21st century by small cases of economic isolation and north korea comes to mind most notably but
it's equally noteworthy and a really significant set of developments in world history that by the
later 20th century most of the societies that had tried the go it alone policy came to the
conclusion that this policy was a mistake that it cost too much in terms of isolation from the most
advanced technologies the most promising opportunities for world trade and one by one the world economy
was rejoined japan obviously rejoined the world economy as did germany as a result of defeat in
war china decided to reenter the world economy soon after the death of chairman german mau the
decision was made in 1978 as china opened its markets to greater world trade and more outside
expertise and the soviet union under gobachev in 1985 decided the same thing that isolation
was too great a price to pay for the preservation of some economic independence so a fascinating
chapter a fascinating set of experiments in modifying the pressure of the world economy
seems to have come to an end although obviously it could recur the more durable efforts to adjust to
the world economy in ways that would complicate the fairly pure core periphery relationship
the more fascinating and durable efforts fall into several categories but before detailing
these we need to be reminded that we explored in discussing the early modern period and certainly
in the long 19th century how terribly difficult it is to climb out of the periphery when you have a
low wage economy a small capitalist class intense pressure for more sophisticated exports and more
powerful countries from the core it's very difficult to climb out and it's not surprising
that relatively few societies even in the early 21st century have climbed out completely
and elements of peripheralization in the sense of low wage export sectors elements of
peripheralization will still exist in the economies we're about to discuss but one of three methods
often again in combination could begin to get countries out of the worst throws of peripheralization
the first method it's very humble not very dramatic the first method began to take shape
interestingly in the 1920s with a policy called import substitution and early countries to
introduce this policy included places like turkey and iran newly independent after world war one
where import substitution was practiced relatively self-consciously the technique is this you use
the government working hopefully with some interested private entrepreneurs you use the
government to help set up production branches of some of the essential but less sophisticated
types of industrial products so that you no longer have to import them from the core products such
as textiles automobiles basic appliances that sort of thing by doing this obviously you don't
necessarily totally break the core periphery relationship but you reduce it because you
reduce the number of items the number of relatively expensive foreign currency requiring items that
you're bringing in from the outside import substitution is of course accompanied usually by
protective tariffs and many economists particularly in these days of free market thinking many
economists question the long-term utility of these measures but short run these measures actually can
work in helping to create a bit of a window through which the worst kinds of dependency
can be modified latin american countries suffering hugely from the great depression which
hit their resource sales tremendously latin american countries began to move toward import
substitution in the mid to late late 1930s headed by places like mexico brazil etc india would adopt
measures of import substitution after it achieved independence in 1947 the goods that were produced
for import substitution were not necessarily as high quality as those produced by the core
locally produced automobiles for example were frequently derided as being inadequate etc
and many people particularly the wealthy resented the fact that to get a really good product you had
to pay these huge import duties but the fact was these products did satisfy part of local demand
they did reduce the pressure the the the trap between expensive exports cheap imports so that
was step number one and many parts of the world followed this policy and some continue to follow
it to this day though it's now less popular option number two was not available to all
comers but option number two involved the capacity to seize on one particular kind of good that was
either so valuable or that could be newly produced so efficiently that this good translated into
exports would begin to break out of the peripheral economic mold the most obvious case in point here
familiar to everybody was of course middle eastern oil middle eastern oil increasingly
sought from the early 20th century onward was initially a peripheral product when western
companies controlled the oil supply controlled the wells in the middle eastern north africa
oil was essentially a cheap product that mainly fed the profit coffers of the western corporations
but once political independence was achieved by major middle eastern and north african nations
after world war two political measures could be utilized to seize control of the oil and to make
it a very profitable export indeed and obviously that's what's happened to key countries like the
gulf states iran iraq some parts of north africa in the decades since the 1950s these countries might
not yet round out into fully modern or industrial economies though many of them are attempting to
use oil resources to produce longer-term economic diversification but the development certainly
helped ease the core periphery pressure from a number of the wealthier segments of this part of
the world but other products could be utilized as well chile for example by the 1970s and 80s
was breaking out of the worst peripheral trap by emphasizing uh vegetable and fruit production
for particularly united states markets this was obviously not a highly processed good but by using
more modern technologies by improving without revolutionizing conditions of labor
chile began to manage to emphasize this export sector in a way that was consistent with greater
economic prosperity with greater parity in terms of world exchange so along with import substitution
many countries obviously managed to seize on particular opportunities or methods
to break out of peripheral status to some degree method number three develop at least a few sectors
in which your economy could begin to compete with the big boys and actually export widely
in the processed goods market on a worldwide basis there are a lot of examples here brazil for
example negotiated with the united states during world war two the american provision of a modern
steel industry in return for american use of some brazilian observation posts during the war the
brazilians knew exactly what they wanted to do and they utilized this initially imported technology
to build a steel industry that by the 1970s and 80s was capable of competing successfully
with steel producers in many parts of the world including the united states brazilian steel was
one of the core types of commodities even though brazil as a whole economy was not yet core brazil
provides a second example the brazilians became aware of the military implications of the computer
industry fairly early and the government began to sponsor military investments in computers
and from this space which initially involved some technological exchange with other parts
of the world including the united states from this space brazil began to develop one of the
leading computer export activities in the world as a whole most brazilian computers are exported
not to first world markets but to markets of other less developed countries where they're capable
for example of withstanding interruptions in electricity supply but the brazilian computer
export industry became fourth largest in the world again brazil's competing in this sector
with core societies the brazilian economy continues to have large patches of poverty
many industries and agricultural sectors that smack still of peripheralization but because of
leading export sectors plus some import substitution brazil moves out of the easily definable category
mexico turkey there are many of other examples of these gradual processes of developing export
sectors some of which will be competitive on world markets even though the economy as a whole
has not yet jumped up to full core status but by the 1990s and the early years of the 21st century
the big stories here were of course china and india china managed to foster a rate of industrial
production growth that made it increasingly almost literally the workshop of the world wages paid were
low workers were exploited there were many tragic stories in this process which suggested that the
chinese were engaged in a fairly classic early industrial operation that hardly propelled them
as yet at least to the front ranks of core producers but the fact was basic chinese industrial goods
in textiles in electronics in gift areas christmas in the western world became increasingly a
chinese celebration in terms of the export industry the capacity to produce large amounts of produce
that was competitive worldwide obviously makes it impossible now to define china as a peripheral
or even semi-peripheral economy india's transformation emerging a little more slowly but clear by the
21st century india's transformation involved less emphasis on global manufacturing although indian
exports competed very successfully in the indian ocean basin and beyond and more the development
of service industries high technology industry where indians among others often skilled in the
english language could play service sector roles and roles in software and related kinds of technological
development that propelled india's growth by the early 21st century the economies of india and china
were growing at a rate of 10 or so a year and again while this did not yet catapult them into core
status it clearly promised that if continued this rate of growth would significantly adjust these
economies in terms of broader global relationships the key point is that for a whole host of societies
many parts though not all of latin america key parts of eastern and southern asia some sectors
in the middle east may be hints by the 21st century of a couple of cases in sub-saharan africa
a number of societies by using one or more innovative innovative methods a number of societies
were able to complicate their definition in the world economy and this really is the key point
through the 20th century though with particular acceleration after world war two perhaps in the
second third the final third of the 20th century and the early 21st a whole batch of societies began
to move into a no man's land between peripheral characteristics and core characteristics the
mixed quality here needs to be emphasized these societies for the most part had not yet caught
up to the most advanced levels in terms of life expectancy education although educational levels
in some cases were accelerating rapidly so they still could sometimes earn the label third world
although really it's increasingly misleading and inaccurate they were however joining a parade of
activity that i think constitutes the main point in a subtle but increasing redefinition of the
world economy to match the new qualities of the contemporary period in world history generally
the contemporary period continues elements inherited from the long 19th no question about it
but increasingly it puts its own stamp on these patterns and really what one is probably dealing
with by the later 20th early 21st century was what some economists are calling really for the first
time the industrialization of the world by the late 20th century after all the industrialization
efforts that we've discussed previously in the west the united states japan even south korea by the
late 20th century probably about 20 of the world's population had been directly industrialized
but by the early 21st century with the advance of industrial operations in brazil china india
and elsewhere probably upwards of 60 another 40 in other words were now actively involved
in industrializing economies and industrial operations this still left a really significant
minority not yet touched some of which was outright peripheral but the change is huge
and this had one final implication although one needs to be cautious here the emphasis that the
world economy had generated on the increasing inequality of economic relationships among
different parts of the world that's not gone but increasingly by the 21st century the key issues
were actually not so much among regions but within them because what this process of partial
industrialization or import substitution what this process seemed to generate involved increasing
wealth inequalities within countries within china within latin america within the united states
and these regional internal economic inequalities probably now increasingly commanded the greater
attention now that the world economy was becoming so much more complex
lecture 31 an age of revolutions
the 20th century was an age of revolution revolutions began in the second decade of the
century and continued at least until the 1980s our discussion today focuses on the revolutions
themselves in terms of their basic dynamics the way they reflect fundamental changes in the
contemporary period in world history but of course above all the ways in which they actually
helped launch these changes particularly in the societies directly affected but to some degree
more widely at risk of a little tedium we need to do a bit by way of definition a revolution
is a violent attempt to change the political system introduce new personnel into that system
not just new people but new social layers of people and usually to affect some degree of
social change revolutions obviously differ from coup d'etat there are lots of coup d'etat in the
20th century and before these can be significant in an individual society they put a different person
at the helm they can be bloody to a certain degree but they don't change the fundamental shape of
things there are a couple of instances at various periods in world history where where one can also
talk about revolutions from above for example turkey in the 1920s under the great leader kamal
out of turk can be seen as an effort to change society and aspects of political behavior in
fundamental ways but from state control rather than from upheaval from below this is an interesting
effort it can be regarded as legitimately revolutionary but it's not in a literal sense a revolution
the most important distinction really significant for the 20th century not
uninteresting for earlier periods also involves making some differentiation between revolutions
and wars of independence there were lots of independent struggles in the 20th century particularly
after world war two they too were significant when successful as they usually were they would
obviously change the regime they'd get rid of the imperial power they would by definition change
personnel they'd get rid of the imperial power and they could do some of the work of revolution
in beginning a process of social reform usually top-down and even introducing changes more widely
but most wars of independence are not revolutions in the sense of using violence to undertake
a kind of thorough political and social cleansing the distinction is significant even though the
20th century must be seen as a period of both types of phenomenon the 20th century as a century of
revolution involves activities in many different parts of the world it compares interestingly
with the previous age of revolution 1770s to 1848 which was an atlantic zone very significant we
talked about it before but involving western europe the united states latin america and leaving
really much of the rest most of the rest of the world out pretty much all together revolutions in
the 20th century didn't happen everywhere and we'll need to come back to that point but they did occur
in parts of eastern europe in significant parts of asia in significant parts of latin america
in a few parts of the middle east this geographical spread represents a measurement of the extent to
which activities that previously were regional now tend to become global news of revolutions news
of the success of revolutionary regimes inspiration from revolutionary leaders these now could spill
into societies that were very different in terms of cultural and political tradition
from the societies where the revolutions occurred in the first place there were four granddaddy
revolutions in the 20th century three of them occurred in the second decade of the century
one in 1979 revolution first broke out in mexico in 1910 1920 uh it reflected a variety of grievances
it involved a variety of groups there were important middle-class liberals involved in
the revolution seeking mainly to concentrate on political and constitutional reforms after a
period of authoritarian dictatorship under profirio de az there were peasant revolutionaries
poncho via others uh interested in raiding interested in in many cases fundamental land
reforms there were movements among urban workers mexico had by this point a significant if minority
industrial sector the goals of the revolution were quite varied and not surprisingly it took a decade
of recurrent revolutionary activity for anything like a settlement to be worked out the revolution
ultimately produced a limited series of land reforms affecting some regions but not the bulk
of the country and the installation of a one-party political system that provided political coherence
genuine but non-competitive elections and other results that will come back to in trying to do
more by way of summarizing revolutionary consequences more generally the mexican revolution
in one sense was somewhat unusual in having relatively little direct spillover this was not
a revolutionary contagion but the example of peasant revolutionaries the example of limited
land reform and really moving peasant claims for access to land this undoubtedly had an
influence in other parts of latin america where peasant risings would occur some decades later
the second great revolution of the second decade of the 20th century was the chinese
truly historic beginning in 1911 a batch initially of middle-class revolutionary students intellectuals
overthrew the imperial system as far as we know forever a system that had recurred in china and
because it had recurred one is slightly hesitant to say forever but a system that had recurred in
china for many centuries was now toppled and an initial effort attempted to establish a western
style parliamentary democracy hampered tremendously by the power claims of regional warlords and
landlords hampered certainly subsequently by the invasion of the japanese and by key divisions
among chinese revolutionaries between the nationalists who were heirs to the
parliamentary liberal tradition although increasingly authoritarian in style
and the new communist movement that was born in the early 1920s and would ultimately prevail
essentially the chinese revolution up and down interrupted by japanese innovation
invasion the chinese revolution would run from about 1911 until final communist victory in 1949
the third great revolution initially the sort of bellwether of 20th century revolution
was the soviet of 1917 there had been a foreshadowing in the russian rising of 1905
the communist revolution was certainly inspired by russia's hardships in world war one
but it also fed from much longer-standing peasant and worker grievances from the widespread
concern about the police and authoritarian measures of the czarist regime which despite a
modest concession right after 1905 continued to repress political expression a variety of
resentments boiled over there was a brief period of liberal rule complicated by a liberal effort
to stay in the in the ranks of the world war one powers but finally during 1917 itself the
bolsheviks took over and launched a period of significant political social and cultural upheaval
the final great revolution is really much different and much later the iranian revolution of 1979
was hailed at the time as possibly the first great quote third world revolution a revolution not
dependent on western ideas of any sort remember marxism as well as liberal democracy were western
in origin the iranian revolution was a an islamic revolution in a predominantly shiite country a
rebellion against undue western influence against a an authoritarian and in some ways corrupt
political regime it urged a return to more fundamental islamic political principles
it represented a statement by peasants and others that the country had moved off its proper moorings
the revolution was meant to inspire or was was held possible capable of inspiring a wave of
similar revolutions in other societies in a literal sense this obviously has not yet occurred
but perhaps judgment should still be out in addition to these granddaddy revolutions
the 20th century particularly after world war two was peppered by other revolutionary surges in
smaller areas the 1950s for example saw a revolution in egypt bolivia and of course cuba the 1970s
saw a revolution in nicaragua vietnam constituted a revolution as well as a war for independence
an interesting combination but the revolutionary component was quite significant uh the number of
episodes that ought to be regarded as revolutions certainly is open to subjective judgment but
we're dealing with a significant number overall in a significant number of places one other point
partially definitional deserves some emphasis as well we know from our knowledge of earlier
revolutions like the great french revolution of 1789 and now we know from for example the
soviet experience as well big revolutions major upheavals take a long time to work out
the actual revolutionary years may be five or ten ten in the mexican case five or so in the russian
case six maybe from the 1970-1917 rising to the end of the civil wars in 1922-23 the the episode
may be fairly short but it really takes a long time for revolutionaries to work out their goals
for different sectors of society to react to adjust to internalize for initial revolutionary
excesses or experiments to be whittled down into more manageable proportions for example clearly
the french revolution was not fully worked out in france until at least the 1870s a literal
century after the initial rising and some would argue it took even longer than that for groups
finally to reconcile themselves to a central revolutionary legacy so the revolutions of the
20th century in some cases are still working themselves out i'm convinced that later history
will look back on the upheavals in the soviet union in the 1980s and early 90s as effectively
part of the larger revolutionary trajectory and obviously the further workings of other revolutions
need time as well revolutions of course never change everything revolutionaries in the 20th
century sometimes argued they would but revolutions always managed to preserve unwittingly at least
significant segments of the quote old regime the russian revolution for example tossed up
institutions that looked quite similar to the czarist political police the names changed but
some of the purposes and methods remained distressingly consistent the soviets also replicated
some czarist interest in territorial expansion though under new rhetoric replicated czarist
interest in emphasis on heavy industry revolutions never change everything but they do if at all
successful change a lot the core components of 20th century revolutions add up to four or five
basic points obviously each revolution has its own imprint its own biography and it's significant
to spend some time on individual profiles who the leaders were and leaders can have a tremendous
role in shaping revolutionary dynamics what the actual specific grievances were and of course
what the outcomes were for purposes of world history however i think it's fair to go beyond
the individual profiles and look at some general features both in terms of causation and then
even more significant consequence causes first of all include weak regimes it's a truism obvious
perhaps but revolutions do not occur against regimes that are full of them and vigor even
if they're corrupt and unjust in other respects regimes that have the power and will to send
the military against revolutionaries particularly in the 20th century where military armaments were
so superior to the weapons available to civilians these regimes are not toppled now of course they
may be eroded by failed revolutionary efforts a regime may be weakened over time but one component
of all the major 20th century revolutions involves weak and vulnerable regimes a czar who is inept
influenced by a crazy advisor is a an invitation to revolution in this sense a boy emperor in china
heir to the throne but not yet capable of really wielding power an aging dictator in mexico
an aging shah in iran ill to boot these are components of regimes that had previously
been capable of effective repression but were losing their will losing their grip and in which
characteristically key segments of the military either refute refuse to move against revolutionary
dissidents or actually join them component number one consistent in broad outline across the cases
component number two every revolution this is true in the earlier atlantic episodes and
certainly in the 20th century every revolution needs at least one large social group that has
elements that are perfectly willing to engage in violence who feel violence is justified
in order to achieve legitimate social ends in the 20th century revolutions the most consistent
provider of this kind of revolutionary muscle came from the peasantry 20th century revolutions were
heavily peasant in composition and dynamic and peasants characteristically wanted greater access
to land in a period in which population growth was pinching resources abolition of the landlord
class and their continued claims over peasant labor and peasant revenues they wanted what they
saw as social justice in the countryside they believe that the land was legitimate legitimately
theirs that it was being taken from them and they needed and could act with justice to redress the
balance many revolutions in the 20th century also of course involved a working class or
proletarian component in the cities russia was sufficiently industrialized in 1917 and the workers
sufficiently if illegally organized that worker risings in st petersburg and moscow played a
significant role in the revolutionary outbreak workers were also involved in the mexican revolution
but the working class component is a bit more of a variable peasant revolution is really a core
feature of 20th century revolutions at least in most of the major cases a third component
along with weak regimes and a sense of real social entitlement a third component involves what i think
might be called an ideological buildup before the revolution usually illegally sometimes partly
through activities in exile a key factor both in the soviet union and in iran
ideologies are disseminated that help inspire many revolutionaries and particularly many
revolutionary leaders it's important to remember it's it's easy to sit here and or stand here and
pontificate about what revolution's involved it's really important to remember that dedicated
revolutionaries risk a tremendous amount they're risking their freedom they're risking their lives
and the inspiration of a guiding ideology is almost crucial they may be misguided they may be
open to criticism in various respects but one has to respect in most instances the sincerity
sometimes even the fanaticism of the ideological principle various ideologies obviously served
in the 20th century in mexico and to a certain extent in early china and even very early russia
revolutionaries in some instances were inspired by liberal and democratic principles the notion
that regimes should provide political access to all peoples that regimes should protect individual
liberties that they should be constitutional etc in the iranian case the dominant ideology
developed initially in exile was a restatement of what people like the ayatollah komeini viewed
as the fundamentals of islam the ideology came particularly from the religion although early
in the iranian revolution there were liberal and even a few communist components as well
they quickly got shoved to the side but the dominant revolutionary ideology of the 20th century
operative in russia ultimately in china in vietnam in cuba and elsewhere the dominant
revolutionary was ideology was of course marxism marxist analysis developed in the 19th century
called for an understanding that capitalism was creating a majority a growing majority
of oppressed working class people taking their wages in order to swell capitalist coffers
that justice called for an overthrow of the system marxist ideology also urged that revolution
had in fact history on its side the ultimate course of revolution was predetermined by a
larger historical dynamic in which ruling groups would create their own antithesis and the antithesis
would swell and grow and ultimately triumph the sense of inevitability did not deter revolutionaries
from feeling that they also needed to work terribly hard for the revolution but it provided
some ultimate comfort and marxism and this i think is too frequently forgotten in american
treatments of the subject marxism also provided a truly glowing view of the ultimate future of a
revolutionary society after a period of adjustment after a period of proletarian dictatorship in
which the trappings of the bourgeois regime would be called out a society would emerge in which
people produced spontaneously what they could produce took from society what they needed the
state would wither away inequalities against women would be eradicated this was human perfection
and the process of history once this perfection was achieved would then stop a beautiful vision
we may dismiss it as as unrealistic or even undesirable but its beauty i think has to be
acknowledged at least in explaining why this ideology proved so inspirational in again
so many otherwise different settings final component in the 20th century revolutions was
some degree of concern and this could relate to marxism or islamic fundamentalism some degree
of concern about undue western ownership and influence the iranian revolutions
revolutionaries very clearly were concerned about american and european influence in the
oil industry in in other modernizing sectors in iran under the shah and wanted iranian cultural
values to be reasserted mexican revolutionaries far earlier worried about the extent of american
ownership of of mexican land and property russian revolutionaries including ordinary workers were
inspired in part by concern about the large number of foreign owners in russian industry
and the kinds of profits that were being siphoned off concern about western control if you will
concern about signs of of of western core economic activities as well as cultural influence provided
a final final uh spark for the revolutionary tinder what did the revolutions accomplish here
again if time permitted one would need a case by case analysis because consequences varied greatly
with the dynamic and goals of the revolutions themselves but in general in general 20th century
revolutions first of all uniformly produced authoritarian regimes they might have intended
otherwise particularly in early liberal days but revolutions produce authoritarian regimes
inevitably at least for a while for several good reasons revolutions major revolutions of the sort
we're discussing here in the first place produce internal backlash aristocrats conservatives
sometimes religious leaders begin to organize often military movements against the revolution
and this induces the revolutionaries to feel well we may want have wanted a liberal regime
but we've got to regroup we've got to impose authority we've got to emphasize the leadership
role in many key revolutions and again this was true in the atlantic period as well as the
contemporary period in many key revolutions there's also significant foreign resistance
the russian revolution for example was greeted by half-hearted but not insignificant invasion
attempts by the united states britain france and japan the japanese stayed longest foreign
invasion can help inspire revolutionary leaders or simply foreign opposition as in the case of
iran can help inspire leaders to say we need to we need to pool our resources toward authoritarian
control to defend the revolution against its enemies it's noteworthy however that while these
impulses toward authoritarianism crop up in every major revolution regardless of time
they occurred quicker and more fully in the 20th century cases than had been true in the
atlantic revolutionary period there were fewer liberals around to defend liberal principles
authoritarian impulses under communists or islamic fundamentalists fundamentalists triumphed much more
rapidly second consequence social change would be at least undertaken to some degree and in some
cases it would prove overwhelming it was revolution communist revolution in russia and then in china
that eliminated the landlord class sometimes with great brutality sometimes with ham-handed efforts
at reeducation or political discipline but the social change here was significant the mexican
revolution as suggested earlier went less far in this regard but even here there was significant
social change in some regions and enough wedding of appetites to suggest that further social change
might be in the offing revolutions in the 20th century uniformly attempted cultural
reconditioning whatever their specific goals 20th century revolutionaries agreed that the
revolution should provide an opportunity to create a new kind of human being to reorient
cultural signals inherited from the past and often operating under foreign influence as well
thus one of the one of the key strengths in many ways one of the key triumphs of the mexican
revolution which was a little half-hearted in the social realm one of the key triumphs was the
emergence of a new kind of populist culture embellished by significant artistic and architectural
efforts to express the people to pay homage to the indian heritage of mexico to pay homage to the
importance of workers and peasants obviously the communist revolutions would spend a great
deal of time emphasizing cultural reeducation emphasizing new artistic principles under the
banners of socialist realism and cultural reconditioning was one of the key points
of the iranian revolution as well these efforts might not fully pay off foreign influence among
other things could never be as fully eliminated as some of the revolutionaries hoped but the
effort to retool culture and the effort certainly to expand education and to use education to create
new types of people this effort was a significant part of the revolutionary outcroppings as well
finally all the revolutions though to different degrees depending on their power did reduce
western influence at least for a time owners were expropriated landlords were kicked out the mexican
revolution didn't manage to eliminate united states influence as fully as hoped but there was
some adjustment the cultural efforts were obviously designed to provide a regional revolutionary
alternative both to the traditional culture and the foreign culture the the recasting of western
influence at least for several decades is an important part of the revolutionary process as
well and in all the major revolutions and this is goes back to the basic definition new types of
people were propelled into opportunities at political power people from worker or peasant
backgrounds did not necessarily run the whole show but there was significant new political
mobility and with this a surge of new blood new interests new abilities to connect the
revolutionary regime with ordinary people in ways that deserve attention as well revolutions again
occurred in some places not all they did not they have not yet occurred for the most part
in countries that during the 20th century experienced an independent struggle seemingly
although independent struggles don't usually go as far in reform and change as revolutions do
they accomplish enough that at least for a while the opportunities for outright revolution are
bypassed revolutions also did not occur although there were some hints once in a while in the
aftermath of major war revolutions also did not occur in the successfully industrialized
societies where there was enough contentment and prosperity and or enough military power on the
part of the existing regime to beat the forces of revolution back either directly or through
cultural manipulation but revolutions did have influence beyond their borders in two senses
marxist movements obviously could compel significant attention even in societies where revolutions
did not turn out to break out they didn't have a lot of influence in the middle east because of their
anti-religious stance but marxist elements in india could be significant in certain regions
marxist elements in africa including the the african national congress in south africa could
provide significant inspiration so revolutions could help engender other types of protest movements
and could also help push regimes as a means of avoiding revolution into certain kinds of political
and social change that might not otherwise have been undertaken. Literal revolutionary societies
have their own quality it's important to remember for example that china experienced a revolution
in the 20th century india did not both are interesting both have significant reforms and
changes to to point to but their actual trajectories are marked by the fact of revolution on the one
hand not revolution on the other but the influence was considerable 20th century revolutions also of
course helped create a new conservative bloc among world powers ultimately headed by the united
states the united states if one can generalize undoubtedly entered the 20th century with a sense
of its own revolutionary heritage and a certain sense of sympathy for certain kinds of revolutionary
strivings particularly of course when they involved efforts against colonial regimes
bought from the mexican and certainly the russian revolutions onward americans at least
americans in power increasingly found themselves concerned about the impact of revolution on
american property rights concerned about the impact of revolution on american values concerned
about the potential for the importation of revolutionary movements into the united states
the united states and some other powers particularly in western europe increasingly
became conservative bastions in a century of revolution and that was a not uninteresting
division in the world as well a key question which is important to evoke but frankly unanswerable
is whether the age of 20th century revolution is now over with the 20th century itself there have
been no major literal revolutionary outbreaks for at least 20 years there have been significant
movements for example the collapse of communism in a few cases involving violence but literal
revolutions really don't seem to have been particularly active as opposed to successful
reform efforts like the anti-apartheid struggle or the the movements against communism the increasing
collapse of marxism as an inspirational ideology probably not to be revived although who knows
the increasing disappearance of the peasantry as more and more of the world becomes urban
these changes might suggest that while revolution may well come back at some later stage the current
era of revolution is over we don't know we don't know we're terrific as scholars at defining what's
happening once a revolution is broken out we can put it into categories we can put it into the
framework of 20th or contemporary era revolutions but predicting them is really really difficult
as the CIA among other things has discovered so question not answerable what is important to
remember for contemporary world history even if the age of revolution is passed is that revolutions
provided a really significant spur to change in a number of major countries and a number of majoring
regions beyond the revolutions themselves we may as americans take some comfort in the possibility
that revolutionary revolutions themselves are over but we also want to recognize what a powerful
expression and powerful impulse revolutions were in the contemporary period and how many
really significant changes particularly in social structure in educational systems how many significant
changes they helped introduce
lecture 32 the united states in world history
in this session more than in most i wish we could debate directly the subject today is
putting the united states in world history and the main way to do this is to talk about certain
kinds of issues that don't always have clear resolution but that need to be discussed in
order to figure out how to make this connection we begin frankly with a practical statement when
world history began as a teaching subject in the united states 20 years ago or so in terms of any
significant incidents most world historians didn't do much with the united states our reasoning was
very simple students had a good bit of american history outside of world history we had heavens
knows plenty to do so let's let them learn american history in us courses we'll do the rest of the
world our situation is already more complicated than that of american history leave us alone
and for their part and i think still it's fair to say in most instances american historians
were delighted not to have to do too much with the rest of the world most american history textbooks
at the college level even very good ones today have at most 20 to 25 percent of their material
in any way shape or form talking about the united states as an actor in the world or as
acted upon in the world the notion of leaving the rest of the world pretty much alone was a
deep-seated assumption if not a practical necessity in american history teaching as well well pretty
obviously this sort of practical compromise was intellectually indefensible and over the past
10 15 years world historians have increasingly realized that while they don't need to get involved
in the internal details of american history thank heavens we don't need to deal with the
jacksonian bank crisis for example uh any more than we get involved in the details of internal
history of china or western europe or whatever we can't leave the united states out the united
states becomes too important a player in world historical activities world history involves
a sufficient number of really interesting analytical issues where the united states also
plays a role you can't leave it out so instead of we're going to leave it out our discussion now
revolves around how do we put it in so that it's manageable so that it fits the things we do with
other societies and does justice to the role of the united states particularly of course in the
contemporary period though we'll spill back into the 19th century and even a bit into early modern
issues as well a key issue one has to confront at the outset and it relates to the practical
traditions of american education where high school students for example conventionally
do a world history course of some sort in their southmore year and then separate us history in
their junior year colleges usually divide between us surveys and world or western surveys in addition
to the practicality we need to face one other issue that will color our discussion very strongly
most us history and i trust it's obvious that actually do quite a bit of us history research
but i'm not a trained us historian um most us history is posited in its teaching role at least
on what is broadly called the exceptionalist approach and the argument although it's not
always an argument often it's just a set of assumptions the assumptions run as follows
the united states was obviously initially heavily influenced by ideas and practices and people
from europe although we would grant native american and african influence as well but over time and i
think certainly by the early 19th century maybe a bit before the experience of being in america
the mixing of peoples the interaction with the frontier perhaps god's will whatever created a
separate set of american trajectories an exception to european patterns and some would add a superiority
to european patterns as well this american exceptionalism is a perfectly legitimate analytical
stance if it is approached analytically but too often it is merely asserted merely assumed
and this is a further returned to a sensible discussion of the united states in world history
there are three issues that i want to take up the first one's prosaic but not unimportant
and it will help lead to the more elaborate two issues that i want to tackle particularly
the first issue is simply chronological at what point in time does a world historian who
again has lots of other stuff to do and who leaves many societies out for simply practical reasons
at what point does a world historian need to include the united states in his or her coverage
because the involvement of the us in the world becomes so significant obviously there's some
justification for a little bit of attention to the united states in the colonial period at this
point the united states was a slave recipient slave imports to what became the us constituted
only about a tenth of the total traffic across the atlantic much more went to the caribbean
in brazil about a tenth is not insignificant so us participation in atlantic slavery in the slave
trade is an obvious topic the colonies contributed a little bit to the world economy particularly
from the south we've talked about this before in treating colonial america particularly the south
in world economic terms and the us received not only slaves but a certain amount of immigration
from other parts of the world particularly europe so there's a colonial connection i don't think
frankly it needs terribly elaborate attention and some of it again can be subsumed into other
concepts such as the world economy and that sort of thing the american revolution probably warrants
more attention the revolution a helps illustrate the range and and trajectories of the larger
phenomenon of atlantic revolutions the revolution undoubtedly inspired revolutionary activities
in western europe french revolutionaries made appeal to american example to some extent and
actual american institutions would influence european revolutionaries at key points although
they rarely adopted the american system outright and as we've noted there's no question that along
with the great french revolution the american revolution had real inspiration to the latin
american wars of independence so for a moment at least us history the history of the united states
that as it became the united states has to be put into world history along with a number of other
examples it doesn't necessarily need to be need to be treated in national isolation during the
early 19th century a crucial period in american history per se the nation was pretty obviously
heavily preoccupied with domestic developments uh the westward expansion which of course brought
the nation in contact further contact with canada and and increasingly mexico but not the wider
world with defining american institutions and characteristics with disputing over the issue
of slavery all really important developments but not necessarily ones that require extensive
treatment from a world history standpoint wouldn't hurt but again as a matter of practical time
there may be some some some limitations that can be accepted but without much question by the time
one gets to the 1860s or at least post civil war you begin to have to treat the united states as a
significant part of world history more generally for several reasons in the first place by this
point the us economy although still very dependent on uh european capital and loans and european
technological inspiration the us economy is growing enough that it has real influence on world trade
patterns exports of industrial goods establishment of american companies in other countries by the
1870s for example two of the biggest uh companies in russia were singer sewing machine and caterpillar
tractor export of american agricultural products now that shipping permitted uh massive uh outpouring
of grain across the atlantic these were influences of the united states on the world economy and from
the world economy that really have to be considered as part of any sensible treatment
of the later 19th century the us at this point is also becoming a weapons supplier
to other parts of the world an intriguing amount of weaponry was provided for example to the
japanese civil war uh or civil strife uh in the later 1860s from civil war remnants the united
states involvement in the arm trade in other words begins at this point and becomes a reasonably
consistent theme in world history right up to the present day and possibly beyond the united
states role in larger world affairs particularly as westward expansion begins to be completed
is an obvious point familiar enough in u.s history the u.s becomes a somewhat um
conflicted imperial power taking important colonies in the 1890s and through the expansion
toward hawaii but also criticizing colonial activities sort of mixing an imperialist appetite
with its anti-colonial revolutionary heritage but a player nevertheless the united states early in
the 20th century enters the course of european diplomacy per se playing intermediary between
european combat combatants at key points and of course with world war one enters the diplomatic
military mainstream of the world quite directly brief pullback with isolationism but frankly
uh and while that needs to be treated it's frankly a blip that doesn't need to be lingered upon
from the standpoint of a clear recognition that from the essentially final third of the 19th century
on to the present the u.s in world affairs is a prime topic both for the world at large
and for the united states indeed historians who are now beginning to really urge a quote
internationalization of the u.s survey history course really recommend frequently that the whole
period from about 1900 to the present be organized in terms primarily of the mutual interaction
between american interests and policies and activities in the wider world a really interesting
orientation that would cut through the survey course tendency to organize american history
increasingly one decade or one presidency at a time an approach automatically guaranteed
to overshadow the woods with the trees so chronologically you have to deal with u.s history
in world history the invitation is an intriguing one but you don't necessarily have to deal with
all of it there are some periods that can be treated much more briefly uh the the interact the
interaction is particularly reserved for the past 150 years the second question is the one
that i have most fun discussing with my college classes and that's the question okay now that
we've agreed that the u.s needs to be put into world history what's the analytical framework
within which we do it in our discussions we have frequently used what's broadly called the
civilizational approach arguing that one way to help organize world history is to look to
particular societies or civilizations that develop identifiable characteristics and identities
that differ somewhat from other major societies or civilizations and constitute a a unit that
can be utilized in an interaction with larger world forces in ways that make sense uh of comparative
developments that make sense in terms of the way larger world forces actually come to play
upon individual cases and individual lives all right so the obvious question is is the united
states a separate civilization or not and if not the normal alternative though i want to sketch
briefly a second one the normal alternative would be to see the u.s as part of an expanding and
expanded western civilization zone there are many prestigious universities that have american
civilization courses and programs can Yale and the university of pennsylvania be wrong the united
states may indeed be regarded as the newest of the great civilization traditions newer even
than latin america which i think would have to be conceded latin america got started earlier
and was long more important in world affairs than was this upstart north american society
so a legitimate case can be made for the u.s as a separate civilization this is the thrust
of the american exceptionalist argument but now we need to subject it to real if brief comparative
analysis rather than just assuming it because there's an alternative case as well briefly
however first the united states certainly can be fit into a smaller number of societies that world
historians call settler societies as they emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries settler societies
in this definition are societies in which the majority of the population ultimately becomes
of european extraction but in which native peoples have to be dealt with and frequently
substantially exterminated by one means or another and in which other strands of immigration may
play some role as well settler societies are also of course frontier societies though there are
frontier societies like russia that don't involve the settler component to the same degree the united
states certainly might be viewed as the most important case of a slightly larger nexus of
settler societies that would include canada australia and new zealand and that that's an
approach that probably should be developed more fully in world history as a means of recognizing
some distinctive features of the united states but not distinctive features that take them out of
the settler category altogether but rather than linger linger on this category beyond mentioning
it the important thing frankly is to face head on the question of u.s exceptionalism versus
subsuming into a larger western civilization category again most american history courses
implicitly assume the exceptionalist stance though they don't discuss it very clearly
the other case can be made as well so i ask my students and i ask you though we can't discuss
it directly if you want to make the case for durable not just brief but durable american
characteristics that really differ from those of western europe and possibly also in some cases
canada and new zealand as well australia may be a little more like us what's your best case
what's your best case they have to be distinctive they have to last over a considerable period of time
and we're often running here's a list that i find provocative among other things because it lists
some traits that we would probably regard as quote good and some traits that we would probably
somewhat regret first of all certainly in contradistinction to western civilization
until the 20th century the united states never really had an aristocracy uh it had some groups
that were perhaps semi aristocrats southern planters took on some aristocratic heirs um
dutch settlers uh in parts of new york more briefly had aristocratic pretensions at least
from the standpoint of land of the state owners but in terms of a durable legal class that made
its mark on society and culture we never had one western europe clearly did nor on the other end
of the scale did we ever really have a peasantry we had a free farming tradition that differs
markedly in terms of economic behavior and even some political impulses from what peasants are
likely to do so there are distinctive features of american social structure that could easily feed
an argument for needing to treat the united states as its own entity or as part of the
settler category rather than as part of western civilization the united states clearly had an
experience of internal slavery and following slavery racial issues that did not affect western
civilization to the same degree of course western civilization had been involved in the
slave trade and in setting up atlantic slavery and there had been more slaves in europe than we
sometimes recognize but a large slave issue and a large problem of resolving slavery after
emancipation simply does not describe the european experience and it's fundamental to the experience
of the united states many historians would argue that partially related to this and related to the
greater ethnic diversity generally that would constitute the united states the united states
has frequently experienced levels of crime and particularly levels of violent crime much different
from those of western europe and also possibly a reflection of the frontier tradition a fascination
with guns and a reluctance to discipline guns that's very different from the western experience
as well particularly by the time you get to the later 19th early 20th century religion is another
intriguing point united states obviously managed to industrialize and modernize while remaining
ups and downs a little bit but while remaining on the whole an intensely religious society
as measured by the amount of religious practice polls about religious beliefs etc the western
tradition certainly had religion at its base we got a good bit of our religion from european
origins but by the 19th century and certainly in the 20th many societies in western europe were
becoming increasingly secular and the contrast by the 20th century between minority religious
interest and practice in western europe and massive outpourings of religious enthusiasm and
religious evaluations in the american case is an intriguing and in some ways somewhat unexpected
differential the united states and this began to become clear in the later 19th century as well
the united states was much more hostile to socialism than was western europe probably this
flowed from a revulsion against doctrines brought from outside by individual european agitators
certainly it flowed from a particularly vigorous capitalist self-defense in the united states
that proved much more successful than that in western europe it also owed something to the
fact that american workers came from so many different countries and had so much difficulty
for a time communicating with each other that a class tradition did not clearly develop to the
same degree absence of socialism compared not only to the west of europe but also to many
other parts of the world absence of socialism is related also by the time you get to the 20th
century to the fact that the united states never developed a significant welfare state
by european standards we moved a little bit in that direction from the new deal onward
but the absence to date at least of anything like a government organized medical care system
is a really distinctive marker for the united states compared to the rest of the west
and to industrial societies generally there are other candidates used to hear when i first
evoked this question used to hear a sort of conventional murmurings about the united states
as a nation of tinkers as a more inventive people than other parts of western civilization
this frankly doesn't hold water if you look at rates of american invention compared to european
or more recently those of some other parts of the world they're they're not unimpressive but
they're not dominant either i think that one's largely faded away interesting issues with regard
to social mobility american exceptionalist teachers mini high school teachers devotedly teach
the united states as an open society in which you could start low and rise high and yet actually
the data are much more complicated than that in the 19th century it was less likely to fall
socially in the united states than in western europe but no more likely to rise because after
all both societies were industrializing urbanizing etc and in the 20th century no significant
difference in mobility rates at all either down or up so the notion that the us is a particularly
open society is an interesting frankly largely myth but we're not done it is also interesting
that americans believe that they're open whereas europeans more characteristically believe that
they're closed so americans are much more likely to exaggerate opportunities to rise from below
europeans interestingly are more likely to minimize they think it's harder to rise than it
actually is and thus this can have political consequences may relate to socialism etc but
it's a cultural difference not an actual social differentiation and one could go on the obvious
point is when you actually start to analyze the facts of the situation the exceptionalist argument
has some real strength to it it is legitimate as long as you know what you're doing as long as you
compare directly it is legitimate to talk about distinctive american features but but this needs
to be balanced by a recognition also that the united states has continued to share a great deal
with a larger western zone obviously all parties recognize that there was extensive european
influence at the outset we also really need to realize that this influence has continued
in the 19th and 20th centuries cultural immigration institutional back and forth even at the level of
contemporary consumerism is really significant and marks a connection that must not be forgotten
even more impressive and i'll sketch this only briefly it's not as
as dramatic as the exceptionalist points but it's really fundamental even more impressive
are the instances where developments in the united states essentially parallel those of western europe
same basic direction same time same reasons suggesting a shared civilizational dynamic
examples from the early 19th century the industrial revolution the united states did copy
great britain in its early industrialization but the main point is american industrialization
proceeds almost as part of the same process of expanding industrialization that affected
france belgium germany and elsewhere it's part of the western orbit similarly same time period
the united states began to reduce its birth rate in what became known as part of the demographic
transition same basic time same basic reasons as many west european countries such as france and
just a little bit later great britain jumped to the 20th century the re-entry of married women into
the labor force of the 1950s and 1960s essentially the same phenomenon same rates same basic reasons
us and western europe the so-called sexual revolution of increased teenage sexual activity
beginning around 1960 or perhaps a little bit before same patterns us and western europe it's
as though again because of mutual influence shared origins and ongoing participation in a similar
kind of industrial and political society you're talking about different versions of the same
place obviously there's no full resolution to this civilizational discussion you can make a good
case either way and any party to one side has to recognize their samaritan the other the point is
as we try to put the u.s. in world history we've got to recognize there's some serious issues
about what kind of categorization to use what kind of civilizational framework makes most sense
one final point on this very quickly the relationships don't necessarily remain constant
in the decades right after world war two the u.s. and western europe undoubtedly converged
increasingly the u.s. developed increasing welfare activities europeans toned down socialism
europeans got rid of aristocracy and peasantry europeans began to face increasing immigration
lots of parallels that made it likely that it was going to become increasingly logical to recognize
they're part of the same civilizational package but then in recent decades increasing separation
again partly as the u.s. remains a great superpower heavily militarized and western europe reduces
its commitment there new attitudes differentiations arise concerning things like the death penalty
concerning things like appropriate stances toward teenage sexual behavior the dynamic can
oscillate and that complicates and vivifies key analytical issues as well final question
relating to the question is u.s. separate civilization but different as the u.s. becomes
more important in world affairs later 19th century onward does it exert a special mark on
the rest of the world or is it largely following the dynamic prepared by larger western interactions
already again a debate is possible and their points on both sides but think about it if we're
going to make a case there's no question that the u.s. exercise is increasing power its role in
world war one is enhanced further in its role in world war two cold war only superpower the events
and and and incidents in which the u.s. influence on the rest of the world expands is an undeniably
important part of contemporary world history but the underlying question is as it did this
as it did become more significant was it doing anything special here are some candidates and
again i wish i could debate you directly and certainly it's not a subject that's easy to resolve
here's some candidates europeans frequently argued that as the united states became more
important in world affairs beginning particularly with woodrow wilson after world war one the u.s.
displayed a combination of inexperience and moralistic naivete that contrasted with the more
sober realistic approach that europeans themselves took in other words they saw the u.s. as recurrently
more idealistic more starry eyed more risky actually more dangerous because they didn't
recognize the sober realities of world affairs they constantly thought for example that american
values could be easily translated to other parts of the world so as the u.s. becomes more important
this unrealism slice moralism becomes more important as well differing from the world
as it had previously operated under west european leadership more strictly some critics have urged
and i think this would particularly bear on world war two and after that the united states displays
an unusual penchant for high-tech approaches to military military activities delights in
sophisticated weaponry delights in long-distance bombardments in ways that go beyond what perhaps
would be militarily desirable or necessary again a controversial point may be worth undertaking
at some junctures though i think the force of this one probably has faded by the 1980s
some analysts argued that as the year as the united states became more important in world affairs
it became more interested than western europe was in promoting a destruction of colonialism
and a an encouragement to democracy maybe this would play i think it's it's relevant for the 1950s
and 60s perhaps a little bit less so thereafter an interesting element and finally and again please
the list can be expanded i'm only offering a few a few talking points finally a real case
for american influence in helping to shape world consumerism the united states was not the origin
of modern consumerist society western europe was as we've touched on previously but the united
states embraced consumerism increasingly in the 19th century it had a huge national market
much larger than any individual european country would which helped develop the apparatus for
the dissemination of consumerism it did not have an aristocracy or some other traditional groups
ready to criticize the shallowness of consumerism there was a lot less opposition
to consumerism in the u.s than elsewhere so by the 20th century certainly with the
explosion of hollywood for example as the world's movie capital which had clearly been established
by the second decade of the 20th century the united states is prepared to play a cultural
role a popular cultural role in world affairs different from that of the west more generally
and a distinctive whether for a good or for ill a distinctive contribution to world affairs more
generally but again finally this approach needs to be balanced against a sense that as the united
states became more potent in world affairs it really picked up the neo imperialist core mantle
that western europe had already developed as it tried to pick up the pieces of empire for example
from the french in vietnam or pieces of british policy in the middle east and greece after world
war two the u.s despite a different tradition in part despite different rhetoric was really behaving
not as an outright imperialist but as an imperialist legatee in ways that really are much more
significant than any sort of special united states thrust and the same certainly applies to core
activities where in its interest in obtaining access to cheap goods in protecting the the export
opportunities of high-tech operations along with basic foodstuffs the united states behaves
much as core societies have since the advent of the world economy again a really tough revealing
debate in which historical traditions play against contemporary operations in which the united
states is separate as against the united states as part of a larger western thrust needs to be
discussed very directly as we accomplish the essential goal the unavoidable goal of taking
seriously how we approach american history from a world history context
lecture 33 contemporary democracy
our discussion today focuses on political change in the contemporary period of world history
and more specifically on the various surges and sometimes setbacks of political democracy
two preliminaries i need first of all to offer a definition of democracy nothing particularly
sophisticated here i view democracy as that system that allows lots of people at least
majorities of people opportunities to vote for political candidates and political parties
there may be some exclusions the united states for example is regarded as a democracy even
though it excludes quite a number of people who've been convicted of felonies of particular
feature of the american system of criminal justice voting is part of democracy obviously but so are
opportunities for reasonable freedom of expression opportunities for different candidates and
different parties to compete in elections and to have enough freedom of expression to illicit
or solicit support for their candidacies second preliminary involves the obvious relationship
between my sub theme the rise of democracy or the rise fall rise of democracy and
particular facets of american foreign policy at various points in the 20th and 21st centuries
the united states has been a vigorous sponsor of democracy in other parts of the world it has
tried this recently obviously as one particular expression and therefore the topic today relates
to aspects of american foreign policy but i also don't want to get bogged down in a detailed
assessment of that policy or be associated one way or another with the virtues or drawbacks of
this policy so the relationship is clear it's not my main focus the most obvious the most
indisputable aspect of our topic today is the fact of political change as i mentioned in introducing
the contemporary period in world history a few sessions back almost no part of the world by
the early 21st century had the same system of government as it had had a century before there
were obvious exceptions including the united states but political change was a fact of life
for a variety of otherwise different regions and this means more particularly
that the dominant political forms of the early 20th century which were empires and monarchies
gave way in most instances to change empires of course fell most obviously because they could
not sustain themselves against the rising tide of nationalism and demands for national independence
this was the fate quite obviously of the great european colonial empires but we also want to
remember that austria-hungary and the ottoman empire fell victim to these forces as multinational
empires early in the 20th century and later on elements at least of the russian empire would
also be peeled away so empire no longer seemed a viable approach by the second part of the
contemporary period of world history as it is thus far played out the fall of monarchy is perhaps
less self-evident obviously the tide of revolution one of the important phenomena of the contemporary
period worked against monarchy all the revolutionary movements wanted to replace monarchies with some
form of republic monarchy fell victim also to a more general sense that somehow the form was
associated with an older system with outdated policies that the form was not supple enough
or expressive enough to fit modern circumstances and monarchy in some specific instances also fell
victim to its very definite association with aristocratic social systems agricultural rather
than urban systems of economic and political expression so with rare exceptions monarchy also
fell victim to a felt need for change of course figurehead monarchies remained in some instances
and there were a few more active cases there are vigorous monarchies in a few parts of the middle
east in a few although probably a smaller percentage of cases in sub-saharan africa
and in a couple of instances elsewhere but in general the dominant forms of the early 20th
century forms that had survived centuries of existence during the history of agricultural
civilizations these dominant forms fell by the wayside replacing them if we look at the contemporary
period of world history as a whole replacing them were three or four major options because the second
point is that no absolutely uniform pattern of response emerged to the fact of political change
the old was out how the new would be defined was a matter of contestation one option obviously
was democracy and we're going to return to that momentarily democracy as i've very crudely defined
it already but early on also fascist totalitarian systems emerged they are mainly a creature of
the 1920s and 30s they were extremely hard to dislodge only defeat in war really finally did
the trick but they were not sufficiently vigorous or popular enough to revive after their world
war two defeat but there's no question in a number of parts of the world fascist or at least semi-fascist
alternatives seemed attractive and some elements of this approach can be found even after world war
two fascism appealed in societies where there were significant issues of national frustration
defeat in war or appetites for more territory fascism emerged where there were pronounced
vigorous social divisions with fascism serving as a a popular cover for upperclass domination
but under new political labels fascism obviously served as vehicles for new leadership ambitions
for new efforts to use modern methods of propaganda and intimidation to link peoples
with this new principle of leadership a second alternative also usually called totalitarian
in that it involved governments that sought to control most aspects of the society under them
and also to eliminate all vigorous forms of political opposition totalitarian options also
obviously emerged in societies that were seized by communist revolutions or conquered by
communist regimes communism was not the same as fascism though some similarities can be found
but it did coincide with fascism in this emphasis on strong central government control
coupled with significant efforts to appeal to popular support and to insist on active popular
loyalty a fourth form we have democracy fascist totalitarianism communist totalitarianism a fourth
form shades off a bit from totalitarianism the boundary lines are not always totally clear but
this involves a a somewhat a updated version of authoritarianism where leaders or single
political parties or in many cases military combinations will seize control eliminate most
effective political opposition not however necessarily construct quite such a powerful
central government apparatus as fascism or communism involved authoritarianism surfaced
again in countries where social divisions ran deep and it was difficult to gain agreement on any
single political or social system without the imposition of authoritarian controls they surfaced
in some cases in societies that were eager to modernize but mistrustful or at least the leaders
mistrustful of other mechanisms for doing so where a top-down approach seemed essential
authoritarianism was obviously and is still a significant political response to change in
the contemporary world history period the world history contemporary the world history's
contemporary period began as we've noted already with world war one and the aftermath of world
war one initially very briefly seemed somewhat encouraging to possibilities for a spread of
democracy to additional areas of the world beyond its then current home in western society both
europe and north america the mexican revolution flirted with democratic systems and did install
universal suffrage for the first time in mexican history but obviously fairly quickly the revolution
turned to a reduction of political competition in favor of one party rule democracy was established
in germany and italy for the first time although germany had had approaches to it previously
democracy was also established in most of the new regimes of east central europe the regimes that
had been carved out of the previous territory of the russian and austro-hungarian empires this
initial democratic surge obviously went south fairly quickly most of the new regimes were
incapable of sustaining democracy given the inexperience of their citizenry with democratic forms
given sharp social divisions for example in east central europe sharp social divisions between
landlords and peasants such that landlords as a means of trying to inhibit social unrest supported
authoritarian alternatives basically to keep peasants down and as well known as is well known
the only durable democracy to emerge from this east central european zone in the interwar period
was that of czechoslovakia every other system crashed including the democratic experiments in
the new nation of yugoslavia democratic systems were also also briefly installed in japan an
important development of the early 1920s but there too they quickly fell fell victim to more
authoritarian leadership and particularly the demands of military authorities the surge of
democracy was interesting it suggested already that the success of democracies in some parts of
the west provided a model that seemed logical to many new regimes in other parts of the world
there were also hints of democracy even in sun yacht sends china though here too they fell victim to
landlord usurpation and civil war and ultimately invasion so a flurry of interest but obviously
also the interwar period is dominated not really by the durable spread of democracy but by its
increasingly beleaguered stance because the real winners from this first period of political change
involved the rise of fascism in italy and central europe the rise of new authoritarian systems some
of them semi-fascist in places like brazil or spain or east central europe the rise of communism
of course in russia the soviet union itself democracy even faltered in its home base of western
europe where the erosion of centrist parties increasing social conflicts increasing divisions
over responses to the fascist and communist threats paralyzed many democracies and caused it to become
difficult for them to develop constructive responses to the major issues of the day this
was not a happy period for democracy though of course it did survive and even demonstrated
capacity for some regeneration in particular cases like the united states the aftermath of the
second world war ushered in a more durable expansion of democracy beyond its previous
concentration in north america and western europe and i should also add australia and new zealand
clearly successful cases of democratic installation during the early 20th century particularly noteworthy
of course was the establishment of democracy in western germany and in italy where allied
occupation encouraged a political change that it has to be recognized took surprisingly successful
route given the experience of the interwar period obviously the defeat of fascism removed one
alternative at least in these societies and democracy began to flourish and has done so ever
since in these cases democracy was also established in japan under american leadership and here too
it took successful route japanese democracy has operated somewhat differently from western
democracies at key points during much of the post-war war two period japan was dominated by a single
liberal democratic party and new leadership came more from struggles and competitions within the
party than from interparty competition but there was such competition and it had reasonable freedom
of expression and political contest japan has to count as one of the new success stories also
and of course soon after world war two a huge gain for democracy came in the in in the establishment
of the democratic government in newly independent india india obviously utilized its experience
under the british even though the british had not given them full democracy india benefited from
leadership emanating from gandhi nehru and others who were committed to democratic systems
older indian traditions for example of the the regional concentrations of indian politics which
inhibited against the construction of two centralized estate earlier traditions also
of government through advice councils and this sort of thing may also have encouraged indian
democracy but the fact was that india stood out from 1947 onward as being the world's largest
and ultimately one of the world's most successful democratic systems in the main however
the decades immediately after world war two were again not particularly friendly to democratic
systems many of the new nations established in the wake of decolonization initially launched
themselves as democracies again the popularity the respectability of this form and its pleasingness
in western eyes contributed strongly to this initial impulse but equally obviously democratic
systems survived in very few of the new nations india here stood out as a really interesting as
well as a really significant exception new nations issues the lack of abundant experience leadership
the lack of citizen experience with democracy itself disputes over boundaries disputes over
social systems internal social strife all of these conditions which were already familiar
from new nations experience in latin america all these conditions tended to yield fairly quick
replacement of initial democratic experience experiments with usually authoritarian leadership
sometimes with vaguely fascist trappings latin america in post-war decades also tended to emphasize
great variety and oscillation but latin america also tended to emphasize either new style popular
authoritarian systems like peronism in argentina or military leadership equally bent on inhibiting
political opposition and maintaining strong central authority democracy again did not seem to flourish
and the expansion of the communist world not only through russia's move into east central europe
but through revolution in china and then in then in vietnam and the communist seizure of north korea
added new regions to the list of clearly non-democratic alternatives beginning in the 1970s however
a new current can be discerned that seems to lead fairly directly to the present day pattern
of unusually extensive hold of democratic systems in the world at large the 1970s saw first the
establishment of democratic systems in the southern fringes of europe spain portugal and greece where
monarchies and or authoritarian systems had previously flourished spain of course did install
a newly vigorous monarchy but one that was committed to effective democratic rule later in the 1970s
the really historic shift of latin america two democratic forms began a shift that would extend
from the late 70s into the 1990s and would see virtually every latin american country except
cuba embrace democratic systems with a considerable degree of genuineness and some signs at least
of real durability so authoritarian regimes fell away by the 1990s mexico's one-party system fell
away to more widespread political competition and open political expression this was a truly
important surge following this first flush of new democracy in some parts of the world
the 1980s saw democracies installed in a number of places in uh east and southeast asia usually on
the heels of popular agitation so democratic or more democratic systems developed in south korea
and taiwan and ultimately in the philippines democratic systems also obviously and this was a
third important region regional extension democratic systems also began to develop
between the mid 1980s and the early 1990s in most parts of what had been the former soviet empire
gorbachev's decision in 1985 to open russia itself to new levels of political discussion
and competition was not initially intended to install a multi-party democratic system
but it certainly began to lead in that direction and then the dismantlement of the soviet empire
led to a number of installations of democracies either fairly peacefully or with only modest
amounts of violence in almost all of the string of former soviet or soviet dominated territory
in east central europe in some other parts of the former soviet empire as well the 1990s
continuing this surge saw the expansion of democracy in many parts of sub-saharan africa
uh most african countries remained one-party rule authoritarian but over 20 regimes during
the 1990s did shift to democracy and the movement seemed to continue into the 21st century crucial
were the this was the establishment of democracy in nigeria africa's most populous nation and of
course the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a successful democratic political
system in south africa again the uh sub-saharan african map remains politically divided but
the trend was reasonably clear and finally early in the 21st century additional democracies were
established usually through peaceful but well organized protest in places like ukraine georgia
indonesia and elsewhere this was as i said already by the early 21st century this was the most
extensive incidents of democratic politics the world had ever seen up to that point
causes are at least at one cent in one sense fairly easy to determine the spread of democracy was
certainly encouraged by the western powers and to some degree also japan and india there was a
clear desire to see democracy established in additional parts of the world partly in in the
first instance because of cold war competitions partly because of a genuine ideological commitment
to democracy as the fairest and preferred political form the spread of democracy in
latin america in the late 1970s owed a good bit actually to the impulse of united states form
policy under president carter who probably gets less credit than he should for at least one successful
move that had deep implications uh for human rights defense and the spread of democratic systems
particularly in the americas so western sponsorship and encouragement the larger
popularity still of the western political model that is the west seemed to be offering
examples of successful societies one badge of westernness was by this point clearly well established
and well functioning democratic political systems and by the 1970s and 80s the west was now sufficiently
out of the game of defending imperialism and empire that different societies could emulate
the west without having a sense necessarily that they were caving in to some sort of vestige of
imperialist control democratic political systems spread also without question because it was widely
believed that there was a direct association between democracy and economic prosperity many
latin american systems converted because of a belief that with democracy would become would come
a an additional commitment to freer enterprise a dismantling of some former state interventions
in the economy and the association seemed reasonably clear gorbachev's opening of the
russian political system obviously was directly tied to his deep commitment to economic reform
of a system that had become economically moribund so the association of democracy with economic
change was a key part of the picture and certainly by the time one gets to the later 1980s partly
because of what was going on in the soviet union the the failure or at least the considerable
failure of the marxist political alternative meant that people interested in political change
had probably a smaller set of options available to them and in this sense also democracy could seem
particularly attractive two issues remain as we cap this aspect of the contemporary period of
world history by noting the unusual spread of democratic systems but two issues one there
remain key parts of the world in which this democratic surge has not at least to date taken
china is a key case in point the chinese decision in 1978 to introduce market reforms
was a sincere and significant change in policy but it was accompanied by an equally clear assertion
that the authoritarian aspect of communist political rule should not budge so china and in its wake a
few other societies notably vietnam attempted the really interesting effort to introduce rapid
economic development rapid economic change while holding the political landscape still and thus far
though it required a major putdown of democratic protest in china in 1989 thus far this experiment
seems to work the middle east is another region in which democracy remains the exception rather
than the rule although there are a few additional stirrings in the early 21st century partly under
american encouragement israel at least for israeli citizens is a democratic beacon it's important
to remember also that although there were ups and downs in this process by the late 20th century
turkey was fairly firmly established in the camp of democratic countries in which democracy and
reasonably free political expression seemed to have found durable base but much of the middle
east remains anchored in one party systems in authoritarian rule in monarchy and while a
certain amount of political discussion may be encouraged and there may be change in the offing
this is not a democratic bastion and of course there are still other parts of the world where
exceptions need to be noted what causes the exceptions and how deeply rooted are they the
two biggest exceptions to the democratic surge china and many parts of the middle east raise
interesting issues concerning the interaction between older traditions and more recent developments
china for example is historically a confucian or neo-confucian society in which political
interests ran strong but democratic impulses were quite feeble confucianism and democracy
do not readily mix although they can ultimately reach some accommodation at the same time of course
china is also a society that experienced successful revolution reasonably recently
as we've established previously revolution does not immediately at least lead to democratic
competitive political systems so china entertains an interesting combination of probably
undemocratic traditional impulses combined with recent events that inhibit democracy as well
something of the same balance may operate in the middle east experts debate inconclusively
the extent to which islamic traditions may or may not be compatible with democratic political rule
so there may be a traditional element here that needs to be considered but more obvious in this
case particularly are more recent inhibitors the fall of the Ottoman empire early in the 20th
century led to a whole series of new regimes essentially new nations particularly in the
middle east proper where social divisions questions about legitimacy in some cases religious divisions
clashes between secular leaders and religious majorities all of these factors which are 20th
century factors really all of these factors inhibit democracy at least to date as is the
case in other new nations instances in other societies and other periods as well the second
key question about the late 20th early 21st century spread of democracy the democratic
gains in answering the question we've thrown out the old political system what would the
what will the new one be like the other main question obviously involves durability by the
early 21st century questions were developing about russia's commitment to a really open democracy
as apparently authoritarian impulses efforts to squelch political opposition gained increasing
ascendancy among a mid russian leadership and in a few latin-american instances questions
remained current as well about whether a society that had not previously sustained long periods of
democratic rule really would be able to sustain it now questions also involved concerns about the
association between democracy and expectations of economic prosperity this was an attractive
combination but what if it didn't work how many societies could maintain democracy particularly
when it was still fairly new amid frustration at economic stagnation or even economic decline
there were obviously questions other issues however might encourage greater optimism for
democracy even in additional regions in the future as the use of computers spread for example
although some regimes like china managed to put some clamps on computer access and and access to
freely available internet programs people did experts did begin to wonder with computers with
increasing difficulties of preventing access to new ideas and new forms of political expression
would there be a technological underpinning that would see democracy spread still further
we don't know the answer to these questions we know the questions exist and they exist because
of the undeniable change in global political climate in the final decades of the 20th and
early decades of the 21st century the rise of democracy has certainly generated a number of
speculations about the world's future some experts have waxed enthusiastic about prospects for
democratic systems expanding everywhere some have urged that once democracy is the common
form everywhere wars will diminish because democracies do not engage in war against each other
these flights of optimism probably were at the very least overblown but it's important to factor
them in to our assessment of recent trends and prospects for the near future what is clear again
is that political change has been a key feature of the contemporary period of world history
that it has yielded unprecedented recent interest in democratic political forms but finally and this
against over simple american assumptions about what democracy will bring that it has also produced
a variety not just as specific constitutional systems but of political impulse the early 21st
century for example saw a wave of socialist victories in latin american political elections this
didn't make these countries any the less democratic but it meant that they were making democratic
choices that differed from the preferences of united states leadership the same thing may occur
as democracy spreads to other parts of the world particularly for example should it spread to the
middle east the spread of democracy does not necessarily in other words erase the need to
pay ongoing attention to global political complexity
lecture 34 contemporary cultural change
the contemporary period of world history has seen massive amounts of cultural change
in most parts of the world in this sense the contemporary period might be compared to the
post classical period as a time in which large numbers of people rethought or were encouraged
to rethink many aspects of their traditional beliefs we can do the same thing for culture
at first at least that we did for politics in our last discussion if you look at the dominant
cultural systems of most parts of the world around 1900 you would obviously emphasize the
continued hold of the big world religions plus hinduism in india plus confucianism in many
parts of east asia if one fast forwards a century later the hold of the religions has been at least
qualified confucianism has been profoundly challenged the cultural map quite simply has
become more complex and again this means that for whatever set of reasons large numbers of people
have rethought at least parts of what their parents or grandparents thought several decades
earlier but the story is perhaps unfortunately more complicated than the story we tried to tell
for politics in politics we could argue that although there was no ultimate global agreement
on a new political system at least there was wide agreement that the old systems no longer worked
in culture that turns out not to be the case perhaps until the 1970s it looked like one or more
of the new cultural systems would gain ascendancy and the old would really be pushed back but
revivals of religion new religious dynamism makes it clear that we simply cannot call
the new cultural scene which means that although we deal with cultural change we also deal
with significant cultural contestation and competition among regions but even more
within regions and often even within individuals points to which we'll return at the end of the
discussion there were several reasons to see the contemporary period in terms of cultural change
new migration patterns ultimately could encourage cultural change because migration now increasingly
brought people from one cultural zone to a very different zone and in that encounter they might
change or modify their earlier beliefs and if they went home again either permanently or on
vacation they would bring seeds of cultural change with them in turn massive urbanization and it is
really important to remember that underpinning the contemporary period in world history has been a
massive movement of people from countryside to city massive urbanization tore people from familiar
cultural as well as social contexts and could leave them open to new kinds of loyalties active
missionary efforts if that's not a misplaced term saw people vigorously pushing one or more of the
new beliefs a subset of this obviously involves the great revolutions of the contemporary period
each of the revolutions systematically attacked older cultural systems religion or Confucianism
in favor of some new or new combination of commitments lots of people were encouraged
pushed or even forced to rethink their older cultural underpinnings there were three main
new competitors for cultural allegiance none of the systems none of the three systems was
actually entirely new origins go back at least to the 19th century maybe even to the 18th but it
was in the contemporary period that these systems began to win larger mass followings and began
therefore to contest more fully some of the over older beliefs packages the first entrant was nationalism
nationalism as we discussed earlier could combine with older belief systems because nationalism
always praised tradition to some extent nationalists might even embrace older religious values as part
of the traditional lexicon but nationalism tended to move people at least partially away from older
religious formulations and it might encourage them to move away more substantially Indian nationalism
for example in the personification of leaders like Gandhi urged Indians possibly to retain
their older commitments to Hinduism or Islam but to modify these by new views about social cast and
class by new views about gender by new views about politics this was not a frontal attack
on older beliefs but it encouraged some real modification African nationalism was even more
committed to cultural change African nationalists had to attack either directly or indirectly
some of the older polytheistic religious loyalties because they seemed backward
because they introduced new kinds of important kinds of social and political divisions for example
into tribal units for a variety of reasons African nationalists in urging people to gain
a new sense of loyalty to their nation and state African nationalists really worked hard to undercut
or modify traditional religious loyalties source one then of cultural change involved the spread
of nationalism particularly in African Asia and the extent to which nationalist beliefs could give
people new loyalties alongside of or in some cases instead of their older ones the most systematic
competitor for cultural allegiance in the 20th century was of course Marxism Marxism has been
dubbed the equivalent of religion the gospel according to saint Marx and it has many religious
like qualities particularly in the hands of Marxist leaders in the 20th century thus Marxism argues
that religion is explicitly wrong religion is an instrument of class oppression
and people should be encouraged to free themselves of it as preparation for the Marxist revolution
and then the glorious society that will come in the future Marxism urged attention to scientific
principles of history and to science itself it urged a commitment to materialism and the
material forces that in Marx's view drove the historical process it urged commitment to
principles of social equality to new kinds of political formulations and again in the hands
of actual Marxist leaders in the 20th century it produced not only beliefs but also rituals
deliberately designed to compete with older religious forms so there were new holidays
new parades new martyrs new symbols that could really supplant religion in the eyes of many
Marxist faithful not only in the societies that went communist but in societies for example in
parts of western europe where communist movements gained a strong hold the third competitor for
belief in the contemporary period in world history doesn't actually have as tidy a label
but it is probably ultimately the most important of the three some anthropologists have dubbed this
third new cultural commitment liberal humanitarianism i don't insist on the term but
we need some label for it and i'll stick to that for the moment liberal humanitarianism as it spread
in many parts of the west in japan and elsewhere liberal humanitarianism it seems to me emphasized
at least three principal kinds of identity or intellectual commitment the first was to consumerism
consumerism is a cultural system that urges that people gain part of their satisfaction and part
of their personal and group identity from the process of consuming new kinds of goods that they
don't strictly speaking need from the standpoint of material survival but which bring them pleasure
and pleasure is an important component of this new consumerist package including often sexual
pleasure so consumerism could give people a new set of goals a new set of identities that could
powerfully compete with older identities as well but consumerism isn't the only part of this package
which is why i don't want to use that term alone it's too narrow liberal humanitarianism also
involved a substantial commitment to science as a means of explaining the world around us
as a means frequently when transmuted into social science of also explaining social systems
and as the potential solution for many kinds of social and individual ills liberal humanitarianism
thus urged pretty obviously that when a person got sick the basic authority whom one one should
consult was an authority uh credentialed by science rather than by religion magic or some
other mechanism the third pillar of the liberal humanitarian approach is a considerable degree
of tolerance and cosmopolitanism a sense that there are things to learn from other people
there are different specific ways of doing things that could be tolerated liberal humanitarianism
humanitarians pride themselves on openness and interest in openness to an interest in foreign
ways and foreign goods that can be part of consumerism so it's a package defined by
increasingly enthusiastic consumerism increasing commitment to science as explanation and solution
and a considerable degree of tolerance and cosmopolitanism these three systems nationalism
marxism and liberal humanitarianism obviously are not identical so the the first point to note
is that as each challenge traditional beliefs they also frequently challenged each other
communists strictly speaking marxists were not supposed to be nationalists marx marks and marxist
leaders firmly combated nationalism as another cultural component that could mislead and misdirect
the working classes nationalists were frequently hostile to consumerism consumerism is a more
individualistic form of expression and nationalists often looked to a more collective expression so
it's important to note that although all three of these systems could compete with older religious
and philosophical beliefs they just they certainly didn't agree with each other but two points first
they could and did in fact frequently combine most marxists in world war one there were a few
exceptions most marxists ended up for a combination of tactical and cultural reasons actually embracing
a certain degree of nationalism many marxists down the line would also find themselves interested
in consumerism and even sometimes a certain amount of tolerance combinations are a common part of a
process of cultural change and that certainly applies here combinations also apply of course
to the ways these systems could interact with older cultural values the fact that these systems
gained ground and did win many people away from traditional cultural allegiances shouldn't blind
us to the fact that many people picked and chose and combined elements of these new systems
with older older elements as well thus many japanese consumerists liberal humanitarian's
in a in a society that was culturally increasingly secular would nevertheless continue to use some
buddhist rituals for particular purposes for example funerals italian marxists were sometimes
notorious male italian marxists for sending their wives and children to church and baptism
just in case they didn't believe in religion but maybe they needed a little bit of a safety net
so again a combination was possible the three new belief systems also finally did share some
points in common they were first of all all secular again they might combine with some continued
interest in religion but strictly speaking they all judged society and individual in terms of
activities in this world the success of the national state the success of the proletarian
movement and the communist system the success of the individual in gaining new access to consumer
goods in displaying toleration etc they were all secular they also were although nationalism once
in a while could challenge this they also were broadly speaking progressive that is they believed
that society over time would or at least could become better if the national state gained ground
as the communist revolution took hold as standards of living rose so that people had
greater consumer consumer satisfactions they looked to a certain degree of social progress
if not as inevitable at least as desirable and possible and they obviously in both of these
capacities tended to pull attention away from the idea that the goal of the individual was to
look for greater satisfaction after this life for progress from this life to the next rather than
for progress within this world and finally although again nationalism could challenge this in some
instances for example Nazism as a case in point these systems for the most part were attached to
some commitment to science science is most obviously part of the liberal humanitarian package a
belief that scientific research is an important key to the future etc but it's important to remember
that Marxist also established great faith for science Marx himself prided his theories on their
scientific qualities and most nationalists in practice if only because they wanted to see
increasing national strength urged attention to science increased emphasis on science education
etc as well in these qualities secular this world progressive and scientific in these qualities
also these systems tended to challenge the old so if we could stop here we'd have a picture not
entirely dissimilar to the picture we drew for politics the time before for various reasons people
in a variety of societies became open to new beliefs new beliefs were available in three
different packages which obviously had some relationship to political change as well and
these packages all challenged the old systems that were the primary identifiers culturally
of the world in 1900 but two problems although they add up to a fundamental statement to date
the new systems although they have gained ground and significantly complicated the cultural map
have not dislodged the older beliefs nearly as clearly as the new political systems
have dislodged their older counterparts two problems first of all very simply
the picture we've drawn thus far does not entirely fit some key regions most notably
sub-Saharan Africa has to be defined in the contemporary period of world history thus far
as a scene of massive cultural change there's been a little bit of interest in Marxism although
this has been more a leadership than a mass interest and no durable Marxist societies have been
established some real interest in popular nationalism although here too more leadership
interest than actual systematic mass conversions certainly some attraction to liberal humanitarianism
as early as the 1920s as novelists like Chinua Chibi have portrayed Nigerian urbanites for
example began to be converted to a new sense of the importance of improved living standards new
kinds of sexual expressions etc in such a way that they would defy older family and religious
cultural traditions that for example urged people to give up their daily routines on occasion of
the death of a close family member in order to go home and make sure that all the rituals
and arrangements were taken care of so the new belief systems particularly consumerism
did gain ground encouraged among other things by some exposure to new western education systems
but the big cultural story in 20th century sub-Saharan Africa has been the massive gains of
Islam and Christianity among the sub-Saharan African populace in 1900 about 80 percent of
African people would have identified themselves as polytheist by the early 21st century this
percentage was down to 20 percent with about 40 percent of the people muslim about 40 percent
christian roughly evenly divided between protestant catholic so this is big cultural story a story of
missionary activity on the part of christians and muslims alike a story of individual african people
in groups seeking new kinds of religious affiliations that would attach them for the first time to one
of the great world religions a really important vibrant story of cultural change but very different
from the story that would emphasize the rise of marxism nationalism and liberal humanitarianism
latin america also provides a somewhat different story here too of course nationalism had some
roots marxism would gain ground in certain cases and without question increasing interest in
consumerism science and cosmopolitan outlook would spread particularly among middle class urbanites
but much of the cultural story of latin america in the past half century has been the increasing
interest particularly in places like brazil and guatemala in the increasing interest in
protestant fundamentalism massive movement of evangelical missionary activity into parts of
latin america with huge successes to register and also again in places like brazil the growing
importance of new religious amalgams which combined elements of christianity with elements of
of native american and african tradition and sometimes some european scientific beliefs as well
change in the religious scene not changes away from the religious scene marked this regional
situation a third regional case although more a more strictly recent one obviously involves the
cultural aftermath of the fall of marxism in eastern europe and the effective reduction of marxist
cultural enthusiasm even in china in the wake of the fall of marxism some people were once again
open to new religious influences there were were revivals of orthodox christianity in russia
interesting new penetrations here also of protestant evangelical missionary activity
particularly stemming from the united states although closely watched by and sometimes
hampered by russian authorities and orthodox priests the rise of the fallen gong in china
a vaguely buddhist derived religious movement extremely unpopular with the communist authorities
authorities is another interesting specific religious story applying to a particular region
so point one the pattern that we started with the challenge to traditional belief systems by
new cultural allegiances remains a valid one it's part of the process of world history in the in
the contemporary period but we need separate regional stories as well that are sometimes
quite different from or at least provide significant modifications to the basic narrative
the second issue very familiar since the late 1970s the second issue can have more global
dimensions although it also has regional components the second issue involves the revival of religious
enthusiasms and the rise of what some authorities call religious fundamentalism not only in islam
where the phenomenon has been most clearly noted but also in western particularly united
states christianity in hinduism and even in elements of judaism and buddhism as well religious
fundamentalism and it's a complicated challenging and doubtless over simple term that some authorities
don't like to use at all religious fundamentalism obviously urges first of all the transcendent
importance of religious commitments and a religious cultural framework as against
the new forces of nationalism marxism or liberal humanitarianism religious fundamentalists don't
like any of these three options although they may obviously flirt with one or two of them to some
degree religious fundamentalists also urge that there is a an established traditional body of
religious truth to which adherents of their religion should return often involving stricter
moral codes than seem to be predominant in contemporary society rearrangements of gender
relationships to insist on real or imagined traditional qualities they insist then that there
is a and this is why the fundamentalist term is used they insist that there is a core set of beliefs
back in the original religion from which religious people themselves have strayed so religious people
need to return to their foundations and religion needs to be re-emphasized as against its new
cultural competitors religious fundamentalism however and this again applies to all the
fundamentalisms not just islamic religious fundamentalism also of course typically involves
innovation religious fundamentalists among other things are adept at using modern technology
they they are skilled at uses uses of the internet and other technological devices
to spread their message and win or reattach adherents many religions under the spur of
fundamentalism also become more intolerant than they had been traditionally hindu fundamentalists
for example are noticeably edgier sometimes even outright aggressive with regard to India's muslim
minority then hindus often were in more traditional times islamic fundamentalists typically
scorn the basically tolerant traditions of their religion when it comes to other faiths when it
certainly comes to one of the modern belief systems and even sometimes increase the intolerance of
minority or or or dissonant groups within islam itself christian fundamentalists so christianity
traditionally is is less marked as a tolerant religion christian fundamentalists are often
also noteworthy for their intolerance of other cultural and political alternatives
many fundamentalists although this is not necessarily new in the religion also insist
increasingly on the importance of gaining state support for their religious goals and for their
religious codes so fundamentalism the rise of fundamentalism indicates obviously a definite
and vigorous reaction to the new secular cultural alternatives involves also a reaction to the
somewhat more latitudinary and tolerant approaches within the religion itself and suggests significant
innovation particularly when it comes to political policy and the uses of technology
why is fundamentalism gain ground a huge topic i admit but it seems to me some some outlines
are relevant first of all fundamentalism is gain ground in part in specific reaction to the
the cosmopolitan features of new cultural systems particularly of course consumerism but sometimes
Marxism as well it's a it's a reassertion of real or imagined traditional identity as against
outside influences that are seen as harmful as well as unfamiliar religious revivals also reflect
the fact that many of the new cultural systems perhaps all of them
fail to provide many people with real spiritual satisfaction we've noted already they're secular
they can be regarded as superficial they do not probe the mysteries of life and death
they do not encourage attention to forces beyond the secular realm to to the nature of divinity
they do not encourage exploration of the of the afterlife for purely spiritual reasons
many people may find existing cultural alternatives as established by modern missionaries modern
advocates may find these systems just simply wanting and obviously particularly
though it's important not to be oversimplistic here religious fundamentalism has frequently
appealed to social groups particularly urbanites particularly poorer urbanites who find them
left find themselves left out of the benefits real or imagined of the modern world people who
are having trouble getting jobs people who are having trouble identifying any improvements in
their in their standard of living it's difficult after all particularly to sustain a commitment
to consumerism if your real consumerist opportunities are in fact extremely restricted
so for a variety of reasons particularly for certain groups i think also for for for certain
regions uh religious alternatives seem to be increasingly important toward the end of the
20th early 21st century because of failures and unevenness in the new belief systems themselves
and finally of course the cultural collapse of marxism the fact that one of the belief systems
is no longer vigorous enough to be particularly attractive can factor into this religious revival
as well the results are twofold first obviously a certain degree of regional division a few regions
although perhaps touched a little bit by religious revivals a few regions seem largely content to
be pretty secular japan has not significantly revisited its conversion to a combination of
nationalism but above all uh consumerism and commitment to science western europe remains
largely a non-religious society so a few regions really seem to have been part of a process of
cultural change that has at least temporarily reached a fairly uniform conclusion of course
they're religious minorities of course there are vestiges of religious belief but this is no
longer the dominant framework most parts of the world however need to be seen in terms of
significant internal divisions of conflict among groups within the region of course there are
region regions in which religion looms larger than average the united states is an unusually
religious society much of the middle east is unusually religious and interestingly although
people worry about the conflict between the united states in the middle east this is actually a
quality they share and could be the basis for some constructive dialogue the key point however is
not to see most of the regions of the world in totally straightforward terms that is they've
either converted to one of the belief new new belief packages or they're simply religious the
conflict between secular loyalties and leadership and religious enthusiasms in the middle east
in the united states in latin america to some degree in africa although religion may be more
purely dominant here although not a single religion these conflicts are actually it seems to me
the key point which leads then to the two final points first of all we can talk and have talked
about the importance of cultural change about the importance of cultural challenge
as helping to shape the contemporary period of world history but we sure don't know the end of
the story is the revival of religion merely a a last gasp as secular loyalties will ultimately
end up predominating or is it as some people would argue not necessarily themselves particularly
religious is it the wave of the future and it will be consumerism marxism nationalism that will
that will end up being scrap heaps in the refuse bent of history we just don't know the end of
the story and the second conclusion obviously involves insisting on the real complexity
that cultural divisions within regions as well as among them add to the story of global politics
we talked last time about the potential for the spread of democracy in additional regions such
as the middle east well obviously one of the question marks about democracy in the middle
east involves the questions about cultural division middle eastern democracy might produce new
majorities for the islamic faith and for islamic fundamentalism the extent to which this cultural
option is seen as operating intention with frequently desired political goals adds obviously
a huge complexity to policy determinations as well as calculations for world history to come
lecture 35 gender in contemporary world history
changes in gender relations and debates and questions about gender relations constitute
one of the really important themes in the contemporary period of world history they also
allow us to measure this period against previous developments and as we will discuss particularly
at the end of this session they raise some really interesting analytical issues for any
contemporary person to think about so it's not in the interest of political correctness making
sure that we pay due attention to women but because these issues are really an important aspect of
contemporary world history and touch so many other aspects of contemporary world history
that we introduce this segment at this point again first a backdrop because we haven't specifically
dealt with gender issues for a while early in our discussions we established that patriarchal
gender relations became characteristic of agricultural economies and we talked about the
reason for this we talked about the extent to which all the great classical civilizations enshrined
patriarchal relationships in codes of law and codes of conduct although each society had its
own particular take on exactly how to interpret patriarchy we noted for the post classical
period that two frankly contradictory trends began to emerge that constituted the next reshaping
of gender relationships in the first instance the spread of world religions established the new
importance of spiritual equality between men and women and began to attack certain traditional
practices like female infanticide but at the same time sometimes partly perhaps because
religions allowed women new cultural outlets at the same time some key practical trends set in
that could worsen women's conditions the most notorious being the beginning of the practice
of foot binding in parts of china particularly initially among the urban upper classes the
early modern period and even the long 19th century did not introduce systematic global changes
in gender relations there were important specific social and regional stories the spread of western
colonialism often brought western standards to hunting and gathering or agricultural peoples
and westerners sometimes with the best of intentions began to insist on domestic roles for women
public roles for men for example as against uh native american practices that would lead to
de facto deterioration of women's conditions the spread of world economic relationships for
example the development of transatlantic slavery had clear implications for gender relations
including in africa where more men were taken than women the industrial revolution for those
societies directly involved had gender implications as well but nothing nothing before 1914 or so
it's not a magic date for gender but nevertheless nothing systematically challenged the basic
patriarchal frameworks that had been established in agricultural economies and often deepened
in the post classical period the contemporary period of world history ushers in some developments
that it seems to me clearly erode traditional patriarchy even though they don't necessarily
establish real equality yet and broadly speaking i think that the contemporary period of world history
will be regarded as one in which many traditional gender assumptions were rethought many traditional
relationships reconstituted a significant period of gender change that then and a period in which
gender change played a significant role in political cultural and economic discussions as well
there were a number of factors pushing for change most of the great revolutions of the 20th century
in interesting contrast to the atlantic revolutions didn't that usually didn't have a lot of gender
impact in any real sense most of the 20th century revolutions heralded their implications for
gender relations conservative implications in the case of the iranian revolution but at least in
principle libera liberating consequences in the marxist revolutions and in mexico women found in
the revolutionary regimes again with the exception of iran women found new opportunities for certain
kinds of public roles they found them new themselves newly praised in art principles of
legal equality were established actual domestic situations might not change as much as the
rhetoric suggested women might be continued might continue to be expected to perform largely
domestic functions or to combine these with demanding work roles so marxism particularly
didn't in fact usher in heaven on earth for women but the rhetorical change and to some
extent the changes in real opportunities were significant nevertheless nationalist movements
frequently used women actively these were ways in which the population could be further mobilized
these were people who could help stimulate and exemplify resistance to colonial oppression
in often it often occurred that once the nationalist movement succeeded women were
shunted aside this was a characteristic pattern for example in africa but even that process by
creating frustration and galvanizing women to voice their concern that what had been promised
was not being delivered even that process could help accelerate change larger developments also
enter in obviously world economic relationships could have an impact on gender and we'll touch
on this more clearly a bit later on changes in production processes could provide new opportunities
for women for example in certain kinds of factories but they could also produce new competition
for women's work there was no single set of impacts here but the but the the framework obviously
needs to be attended to it's also true obviously that larger processes such as urbanization such
as the reduction of infant mortality larger processes would also have an impact on women
in many instances one of the reasons that women in most societies by at least the later 20th
century earlier in some cases began to have fewer children than was traditionally the case
involves simply the working out of an understanding of what urban conditions and modern public
health conditions implied for traditional levels of birth rates equally important and
increasingly important from the 1950s onward were the operations of international agencies
both governmental and non-governmental by the late 19th century in fact a number of
international feminist movements had formed they were in fact almost entirely western
but they claimed international audience and they worked hard to gather at least a few
representatives from places like china iran etc these movements pressed a women's rights agenda
on governments around the world and on other international agencies that would press for
greater legal equality in some cases for rights of political expression etc by the 1920s and 30s
women's agencies became fairly adept at pressuring the league of nations to issue statements at least
urging gender equality not a lot happened but the fact that an international agency a representative
of the international community could be pushed to this kind of declaration in principle was itself
revealing the united nations would turn out to be even more sympathetic than the league
to women's rights statements in principle united nations charter statements of rights
conventionally included gender issues and while these might ring hollow they nevertheless provided
a framework of legitimacy for pressure in individual societies toward changing gender
laws and gender relationships more widely then in 1965 the united nations began a pattern of
sponsoring years of the woman every decade or even a decade of the woman and these measures
punctuated by large international conferences such as the one held in mexico city in 1965
or the one held in bejing in 1995 these conferences would spawn attendants by women's groups and
women's representatives literally from all over the world and in their wake not only would the
conferences themselves issue ringing pronouncements about the importance of equality about the
importance of equal pay etc pronouncements in themselves interesting but the conferences would
spawn local NGOs local non-government organizations that would work on women's rights issues that
would report on these issues to larger groups like amnesty international by the 1970s and 80s
a real international network was being established whereby wrongs against women could be fairly readily
publicized and international redress sought a variety of factors pushed for change during the
20th and early 21st centuries there were certain clear directions to change as well largely in line
with at least a watered down version of these formal agendas in the first place beginning
a little before the world war in scandinavia and after the world war in various other societies
the notion of allowing women the right to vote sometimes first in local elections then nationally
gained growing currency after world war one voting rights for women were established in the
united states in the soviet union in germany in turkey interestingly and often gradually then in
other european countries though full european conversion to women's suffrage was not completed
until after world war two indeed well after in the interesting single case of switzerland women
normally where voting was permitted at all by the second half of the 20th century women normally
voted other legal rights really were attached to this basic conversion in the suffrage systems
legal rights that established increasing parity with regard to access to divorce legal rights
establishing clearer title to property as against male or familial control these activities were
important areas of gains for the women's rights agenda third area along with voting rights and
legal rights involved education without any question although in some regions like africa and the
middle east women's education at the primary level continued to lag behind that of men women
gained ground on men during the 20th and to date the 20th 21st centuries they gained ground partly
because they started from a lower base so the increase in literacy rates for women was more
rapid than that for men because women had more ground to make up by the early 21st century in
in an impressive variety of societies women actually began to gain majority ascendancy
even in the ranks of students in higher education in iran in the united arab emirates in the united
states in various other places by the early 21st century women constituted about 55 percent
or more of the university population a really tremendous change and probably probably a promise
also for further change in the future because as women's educational parity gained ground with
that of men it surely would lead subsequently to other demands for greater job opportunities
greater political voice etc voting rights and legal rights and educational change
also propelled increasing female representation directly in elected legislatures obviously there
were interesting regional variations here intriguingly despite its vociferous feminist
movement the united states actually lagged in this area not only not generating in until sometime in
the 21st century an actual female president but lagging also in the percentage of women elected
to congress and even to state state legislatures but women did gain in the united states they gained
political leadership roles in various parts of europe periodically in south asia while not in
leadership roles in china they certainly held important ministerial positions the same applied
to russia perhaps with a slight lag political gains then went beyond constitutional and legal
rights women also gained although this is a more contested terrain as to its significance women
also gained in consumerism while men frequently accused women of being voracious consumers as a
means of gender criticism the fact was that both men and women participated in consumerism
and both found meaning in it i'm not arguing here that women necessarily found more meaning than
men did but because this was an area in which they had some clear opportunities for self-expression
in buying things in identifying goods that were desirable etc consumerism also can be seen as a
terrain in which they gained a new measure of equality or at least a new kind of outlet for
expression and as a subset of consumerism the rise of women in sports particularly international
sports and some key sports in the later 20th century was an interesting development as well
these various changes to one degree or another applied literally to almost every region of the
world different degrees of course different specific chronologies but they add up i would suggest
to what i think we have to admit is probably the end of literal patriarchal systems that is
patriarchal systems while they may be compatible with informal voice for women with individual
women achieving great things patriarchal systems are not compatible with systematic legal equality
or with equality of voting rights now we don't have to use this statement to argue that therefore
everything's just fine feminists still enjoy using the term patriarchy as a means of slamming
ongoing inequalities and more power to them but i believe from a historical standpoint
we have to see developments in the 20th century as suggesting the beginning of the end of the
kind of patriarchal systems that had predominated through the long agricultural period of world
of course not all the systems really worked the way they were supposed to on paper in rural
india for example women have the right to vote but fathers or husbands move in behind them and
make sure they vote the way they're supposed to but india itself has tried to take corrective
measures here by insisting that a certain percentage of elected village council members
for example be women the change really is fairly general and it's inconsistent it seems to me
with literal patriarchy but but here as in so many aspects of our contemporary world history
story we can point to patterns of change we can point to new issues and new causes but we don't
know the end of the story there are at least four or five intriguing complexities the first
obviously is regional unevenness some regions have more smoothly adopted gender change than others
there's no secret here regions that have experienced revolution like china see far less
debate about new roles for women once the revolution is completed then do regions where
change has been more incremental like rural india or obviously the middle east prior cultures
undoubtedly help explain why some regions have moved more quickly or systematically than others
no question about differences in regional speed and degrees of regional resistance the speed
question applies particularly to one of the other really significant areas of change in gender
relations in the contemporary period that i think is pointing in a clear direction but where we have
to be a little hesitant at this juncture and that is the change in the birth rate by the end of the
20th century every major region in the world was participating in a slowing of the birth rate
but some regions had achieved what we call the demographic transition in which the average
family the average woman has a quite small number of children almost all of whom will live
and some regions had yet to reach that level western europe the united states had demographic
transitions effectively by the end of the 19th early 20th centuries japan and the soviet union
had their demographic traditions either between the world wars or right after world war two
latin america where the population is still growing rapidly but the actual birth rate
has slowed markedly had its fundamental demographic transition in the 1970s sub-saharan africa however
and some islamic regions have yet to have a full demographic transition even though the birth rate
has begun to drop now the dilemma here is obvious i think there's probably a common trend i think
without knowing for sure that succeeding decades will demonstrate that this is another area where
women's conditions are changing in similar directions but it's really premature to say this
and the unevenness is marked where the demographic transition has occurred or is occurring women's
lives obviously changed markedly not only because of new laws and new political rights and new
educational opportunities or even new consumerism they change because far less of life is consumed
by the act of conceiving bearing and rearing children and we believe we can say from western or
japanese or russian experience or currently chinese that this tendency to reduce the birth rate
birth rate will inevitably have further implications for women's lives and their
relationships with men down the line but the picture is a little murky second issue
there is unquestionably a an economic complication to generalizations about gender relations in the
contemporary period of world history there are of course several key patterns in which along with
new rights new education etc come new opportunities for or no new demands on women to participate
in the labor force outside the home communist societies building on earlier tradition usually
insisted on substantial levels of women's work all along the line they might work in jobs that were
paid less than those of men they might be slanted towards certain occupations rather than the full
range but work opportunities and some praise for work opportunities were part of the picture
early on western europe the united states and slightly more slowly but now clearly japan
obviously have a different pattern in the 20th century women's work commitments
gain ground systematically aside from brief episodes in the world wars women's work
commitments gained systematically only from the later 1950s onward this was the point in
the u.s. and western europe where married women began to re-enter the labor force
where up to 44 percent of the labor force would become female where it became expected that women
would have career or work roles and pure housewifery became the exception to the rule japan again
entered this picture a little later it's less far along but it seems to be moving in a similar
direction this is another interesting pattern but there are also cases in which world economic
conditions seem to discourage uh women's work participation at least in some of the newer
and more promising areas of the economy while globally located factories in mexico for example
may allow new opportunities for women experience of women in africa economically through much of
the 20th century and into the 21st has been considerably less encouraging in africa as
colonial peripheral type jobs expanded men tended to seize them going to the mines or to the cities
leaving many women back home so that women de facto became increasingly responsible for agriculture
increasingly also without male supervision that was an interesting change in itself but
involved in in the sector of the economy that was least prosperous least changing whereas the
newer opportunities not always necessarily pleasant in terms of working conditions but the
newer opportunities and the higher earning opportunities tended to be reserved for men the
african pattern at least to date is a serious complication to any easy generalizations that
along with um political gains educational gains etc necessarily come economic opportunities that
increasingly match or at least approach the levels available to men the economic picture is more
complicated some similar developments occurred with the fall of communism in much of eastern europe
with the collapse of marxism despite its its incomplete commitment to women's gains with
the fall of marxism with the fall of political support for gender equality with increasing
economic turmoil at least in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the communist system
many women found their economic positions eroding jobs became harder to get participation in the
sex trades both in their own countries and in export other places participation in the sex trade
increased as a as an evidence of of economic dislocation it would be nice to think that in
the long run economic opportunities will keep pace with political and legal changes but the
fact is we don't know this yet third complication pushback without question sometimes in trivial
ways sometimes in very profound ways men individual men sometimes groups of men in many societies
have found ways to retaliate against women for the gains they see around them or the gains that
they think are threatening it's not easy to claim that violence against women has increased in
contemporary world history but in fact it's fairly likely that is men in family situations or other
situations using direct attacks on women as a way to express their own frustration as a way to try
to keep women down as a response to some of the pressures that really were urging significant
revisions of traditional gender relationships it is at least possible and i think many international
agencies would argue quite likely that rape and violence against women has increased as an instrument
of war particularly in the second half of the 20th century and early 21st it's a complicated
situation because obviously we don't have clear records before these bloody conflicts and it's
also very clear and important that international standards have changed so that rape is in is
regarded increasingly in human rights activist eyes as a very very serious crime whereas previously
was regarded as more trivial so this is a complex issue but probably more civil strife more conflict
involves attacks on women than was previously the case certainly the rates are horrendous
family violence may have increased in certain instances as well there has been a troubling
incidents in the last few decades of dowry murders in india and pakistan these are not at all typical
this is this is rare but troubling where men uh dissatisfied with the level level of dowry they
receive in marriage uh attack and murder their wives seeking apparently opportunities for
another dowry round or simply expressing rage other gender separators cromp up as well i don't
mean that this is terribly important but i think it's intriguing that it was in the early 20th
century in the united states that clear color demarcations began to be introduced to make it
obvious who the girl was and who the boy was the pink for girls blue for boys is a surprisingly
recent innovation of the 1920s in other words in superficial ways i don't mean that that's terribly
important in in the larger scheme of things in superficial ways and in more serious ways
men may push back sometimes this pushback also take legal form in the later 20th century as
one african country after another subscribed to united nations charter principles and established
women's property rights actual african courts arguing on the basis of african tradition
held that women did not have such rights that men and families controlled property women did not
push back as an important qualification if an unsurprising aspect to the general pattern of
gender change and the final complication is i don't mean it's the most important but it is
really interesting and it's cropped up really i think particularly clearly in the last couple of
decades the final complication involves i suppose a world history version of what do women want
here's the issue western feminists and through them and some other advocates from places like
japan or egypt or elsewhere feminists have usually until recently as they pressed human
rights organizations and international tribunals have usually agreed on a human rights agenda an
individual writes an equality agenda for women but as more and more regions can step back a little
bit from colonial and western influence and assess the situation it turns out perhaps not surprisingly
that some very articulate women argue that the western version of feminism is not in fact what
they want let me give three illustrations some indian women writing in indian women's magazines
have argued for example very explicitly that while feminist goals in some areas are quite
suitable for what indian women should strive for they do not want to see india fall victim
to western marriage patterns the argument here is that arranged marriages are better for women
they're more likely to produce stable marriages they put less pressure on women to beautify themselves
as a means of attracting men to force themselves into a cosmetic and other distortions this is not
perhaps one of the deepest concerns about gender standards around the world but it really is an
interesting one there are aspects of the western feminist women's package that some women in india
and probably elsewhere simply don't want second example really interesting the extent to which
and it's not brand new but i think it's received increasing articulation in the last couple of
decades the extent to which many middle eastern women while not not subscribing to traditional
patriarchy argue that they can find in islam and in regional traditions satisfactory expression for
their needs they want they may wish islam to revise itself a little bit but they don't want a
strictly western version of women's rights and they will sometimes argue as do many individual
women in places like egypt at various points in the 20th and 21st century they may argue that
women's rights are in fact best exemplified through adoption or retention of traditional
costumes veiling may be seen by some women as an important expression of their ability to make
individual choices and an important gesture of defiance against undue international influence
as well finally some african feminists very articulate african intellectuals from places
like nigeria have argued that the western international women's rights package is too
frequently individualistic that africa has separate traditions of collective and family
protection for women that need to be revised again this is not a statement let's just go back to
to unadulterated tradition but which pose alternatives to western and current international
standards as well so the fourth complication is as women do gain new opportunities for expression
new levels of education they may continue to differ regionally in terms of the goals they seek
so the key points are these questions have been widely opened up some of them shared pretty
much around the world some of them specific to particular regions resistances have been roused
patterns of change have been very uneven if you look from the political to the economic category
for example but the questions are there and these questions are it seems to me an important
new part and a rather fundamental part of what we can see as shaping the contemporary period of world
history
lecture 36 globalization and world history
the most exciting social science concept to hit the streets in the 1990s was the concept of globalization
focusing obviously on an intensification of contacts among various societies in the world
to the extent that basic frameworks of life were set by these contacts the theory was a social
science theory initially but a batch of historians calling themselves the new global historians have
joined in arguing that globalization is one of the most fundamental changes in human history
that the species is lately has yet experienced discussions of globalization are an inescapable
part of dealing with the 20th and 21st centuries as a new period in world history but there's
really more involved today we'll be talking about globalization in historical context but in broad
historical context because globalization provides an opportunity to look at the broad sweep of world
history not obviously in great detail but in terms of key moments and key issues as a means of
setting globalization in appropriate historical context globalization is most often discussed
of course in terms of is it good is it bad how fast is it proceeding what are the objections to it
and history will help with these issues for sure but the primary first question for globalization
is a focus on the extent of change involved and where change is concerned history is the
inescapable disciplinary tool for assessment we'll begin with a brief further definition of
global globalization itself but then turn to the connection to world history reaching well back
into materials we've covered previously in our discussions globalization obviously first and
foremost depends on a sense of rapid technological change particularly in areas of communication
and transportation and as we've already noted new connective technologies form a basic part of
defining the 20th century as ushering in a new period in world history technologies such as the
airplane radio contacts satellite television the internet born effectively in 1990 the list is long
and it parades at various points through the 20th and into the 21st centuries globalization also
however involves a sense of range of activity globalization for example by the 21st century
was touching the lives of children in 2004 for example the united arab emirates banned the use
of boy jockeys and camel races because as they approached globalization they realized that world
opinion would disapprove of this use of children in ways that would be disadvantageous to the
emirates generally a year later in 2005 the united states supreme court ruled that children could
not be put to death for crimes making the united states one of the last societies to agree on this
issue but when the supreme court did this it specifically cited the importance of world opinion
in setting standards to which the nation must adhere globalization can also be discussed
finally not only in terms of technology in range but in terms of optimism for the future and frankly
here's some silly things get said such as for example the notion that two societies that have
mcdonald's will never go to war with each other the notion being that once you get this far along
in consumer interest you'll turn away from war in the interest of further consumer pleasures
that would be nice to believe i frankly am somewhat dubious but the very fact that this
kind of theory can be put forward calls attention to the extent to which globalization is seen as a
new force but before we conclude too briskly about globalization isn't as a new force we need to turn
back to world history and we begin frankly as we began the course itself by noting that one of the
key themes in world history throughout from early to now involves a recurrent tension between human
interest in forming local and regional societies that have clearly established institutions and
identities that provide a comforting predictable framework for human existence on the one hand
and on the other the clear advantages or inescapability of contacts with other societies
these tensions began to emerge early they've been progressively redefined and in one key way
globalization is simply the latest iteration of a redefinition of these tensions
early in the human experience to go back briefly to the days of agriculture and early
civilizations early in the human experience two aspects of what we still regard as globalization
were already emerging one for example was migration people began migrating early
first to lands that had not been populated but then subsequently by the time of agriculture
and civilization to lands that had at least some other peoples in them migration is still a key
feature of globalization of course migration now can proceed over longer distances more quickly
it involves the possibility of going but also coming back in ways that can affect both ascending
and receiving societies so migration has changed with globalization but it remains a force that
we have to recognize launched early in the world historical experience the spread of disease another
key aspect of globalization also has early roots as we have seen now here too there's change globalization
allows disease to spread to spread more rapidly globalization also begins to generate some
institutions like the world health organization that we hope can have some role in stemming
the impact of disease through global contacts but the basic force is not new in the early stages
of the human experience while contacts through migration through the spread of disease were
crucial for example in spreading knowledge of agriculture in these early stages of the human
experience contacts obviously formed a vital but subordinate theme in a situation where the key
attention of leaders and ordinary people alike was being devoted to the formation of local and
regional societies clusters of institutions clusters of cultural identities when we dealt
with the classical period for example we talked about a key system of contacts that connected
the various classical societies from china in the east to rome in the west a long route such as the
great silk roads but we also noted that while these contacts were interesting and clearly sparked
consumer and merchant interest they were not yet fundamental in shaping the identities of the
societies that were forming in the classical period at this point the balance between regional on the
one hand contact on the other was still slanted in favor of the regional with the post classical
period however between about 500 CE and 1450 CE we saw the balance decisively shift and frankly
some world historians would argue that what we now call globalization really began around a thousand
CE this was the point at which along with migration and disease spread trade among various regions
at this point in the old world afro-eurasia trade was now added to the list of factors that routinely
and fundamentally connected various societies creating new tastes new dependencies on remote
regions allowing merchants to play a growing role not only in trade itself but in certain kinds of
cultural contacts and from about a thousand CE onward many world historians would argue
there's simply a recurrent intensification of the basic framework rooted again initially in trade
the basic framework that would make contacts and convergences increasingly superior to regional
identities in the balance that continued to shape the experience of peoples and societies in world
history the early modern period with the addition of the americas and then oceania to the list of
societies involved in global contacts with the intensification of trade connections and biological
connections the early modern period clearly is another chapter not necessarily a fundamental
one but clearly a very important one in this ongoing process of the intensification of the
importance of contacts in the human experience so as i've already implied some world historians
particularly pointing to the post classical period as a swing era between primary focus on
localities and regions and primary focus on contacts some world historians would argue
the framework's already set and all we need to do with globalization is talk about subsequent
tweaks subsequent intensifications to patterns of interaction dependencies on contact already
well established but there are two other alternatives to this view that don't wipe
the view away but argue for greater change in the last century or possibly two centuries
candidate number one for slightly more focused attention is the long 19th century and particularly
at second half where many historians now argue the process of globalization as distinct from earlier
patterns of contact the process of globalization really begins obviously new technology is clearly
involved even at this earlier phase with steamshiping the railroad the telegraph etc other developments
such as the sewers and Panama canals helped link societies with more rapid connections than ever
before and obviously international trade was intensifying very rapidly as we've seen as we
talked about how societies progressively were drawn or compelled into the framework of international
trade on terms that were sometimes not to their best liking the long 19th century also saw the
addition of two other features to the list of contacts that began to shape the human experience
along with migration which obviously surges in the long 19th century and disease impact
which has its moments as well and obviously trade along with these three factors now come first
signs of what we would now call cultural globalization at the end of the 19th century most
obviously international sports interests were beginning to emerge for the first time based on
european and american sports like soccer and baseball people in various parts of the world in
latin america in asia in africa began in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries to pick up
sports interests in ways that would continue to feed what we can clearly see as a key element of
international culture from that point onward cultural globalization was then a factor we can
identify about 200 years ago or at least 150 the other new addition to the ranks was what we might
call the early phases of political globalization it was in the second half of the long 19th century
that international agreements began to forge opportunities to send mail from one society
to another no matter where this these societies were located in the world other agreements featured
treatment of prisoners in war and so on and also international non-governmental organizations
bent on defending women's rights or attacking slavery began to shape
international political discourse to some degree so there's a good case to be made for the long
19th century particularly with new technologies but also with two crucial additions to the list of
elements that were beginning to have international shape there's a good case to be made for the
long 19th century as the effective crucible of globalization as opposed to important kinds of
contacts that had had helped set the stage earlier in the world history experience the 20th century
raises two issues in this connection the first is frankly unexpected although of course we know
it and that is the extent to which the second quarter of the 20th century saw a number of
societies actually deliberately pulling away from globalization at least in part and sometimes
virtually entirely seeking to set their own economic patterns their own cultural patterns
either new or traditional the soviet union under Stalin pulled away uh japan and germany pulled
away to some extent at least economically the united states pulled away politically china under
chairman mao a little later would pull away for several crucial decades in other words a good
argument for seeing the late 19th century as the effective beginning of globalization gets additional
vigor when we realize that a whole host of developments in the first part of the 20th century
can be seen as deliberate reactions to a globalization that was not yet acceptable that
was not yet seen as serving general interests adequately but the second feature of the 20th
century returns us to the question of the extent of change by the second half of the 20th century
even amid the tensions of the cold war it becomes clear that the new connective technologies in
communication and transportation that new organizational capacity particularly in the
form of multinational corporations that differed from earlier international business units in being
able to locate production facilities to specialize production facilities almost literally every place
in the world to seek best labor and regulatory advantage these multinationals as they differed
from previous international trading organizations form a way to measure 20th century globalization
as a partially new animal along with technology itself it's also in the 20th century that at
least two final elements final to date at least get added to the globalization picture along with
intensified political and cultural globalization first of all as we increasingly realize it's in
the later 20th century that environmental change goes global instead of environmental impacts by
human activities having mainly regional consequences which had been true in the 19th century and even
earlier with agriculture now human activities in one region seem potentially or actually to have
environmental impact on regions quite distant through the spread of acid rain through nuclear
disasters and obviously through the forces of global warming along with environmental change
comes the first set of explicit protests against globalization beginning in 1999 in Seattle here
was a sign not that globalization was stirring discontent and concern because that actually
had occurred earlier but globalization is now a sufficiently defined phenomenon that various
groups with labor interests environmental interests concerns about excessive consumerism
various interests can now unite around an effort to see globalization itself as the key if diffuse
target so the 20th 21st centuries can be seen as different even from the long 19th
in the extent of technological change in the accumulation of various aspects of global
contact from early forces like migration and disease through trade through political and
cultural globalization now on to environmental and even protest mobilization and it's this list
that may convince people finally that it's the 20th and 21st centuries that actually see the crucial
measures of globalization itself the issue is frankly somewhat open i think the two crucial points
are first globalization almost inevitably must be viewed in the larger lens of world history we
have to turn back to previous types of contact and previous types of concern about contact in
the name of local identity we have to have this broader vision to see what's new but also what's
recapitulative about the globalization process itself and we need this historical view we need
this perspective on the extent of current and perspective change we need this also because
this becomes a crucial part of assessing the quality of globalization is it good is it bad
do economic advantages outweigh the costs to specific cultural identities do economic advantages
themselves spread widely or uniformly enough these are questions that i think take on new meaning
and new capacity for assessment if we take the world historical view world history contributes
one other point of assessment that becomes crucial in discussions about what globalization is
and where it's heading and that is something that again we've done recurrently in our discussions
of world history from 3500 BCE onward and this element is the extent to which different societies
because of their prior historical experience and cultural and institutional contexts respond
differently to common forces of change in other words the extent to which different civilizations
react to globalization in different ways because again of the kinds of experiences they've had
in previous world history episodes as well as differences in their contemporary approaches
and experiences take for example the case of india many indians find globalization or at least
partial accommodation to globalization fairly easy because after all india has long been a society
open to outside influences reasonably tolerant obviously the british experience in the colonial
era is a particularly important instance of this but even farther back in indian history
we see an openness to outside contacts that helps explain why many indians particularly in the middle
and upper classes seem to be quite adept at accommodating to globalization without losing
all sense of internal cultural identity they've done that before on the other hand again historically
india is also a stratified society in which other groups particularly in the countryside
particularly in the lower classes are much less impacted by globalization much less drawn to it
so that one can see in indian society differential accommodations to globalization differential
levels of tolerance indeed calling on earlier historical experiences east asia
japan first and then china form a second kind of case historically without falling in the to
into the trap of seeing east asia as somehow historically isolationist which would really
as we've discussed before be inaccurate historically it is nevertheless fair to say
that east asia has not usually been an active outreach into the global environment and here
we have to note that beginning with japan and now more recently south korea and more recently
still china east asia quite simply changed japan reached its crucial decisions about what we would
now call globalization in the late 19th century calling attention again to the 19th century as
a crucial aspect of the globalization experience and the japanese decided that globalization could
not be resisted outside contacts and influences had to be addressed and accommodated but obviously
without fully losing a sense of japanese distinctiveness and identity the japanese changed in their wake
somewhat later south koreans would change and more recently till still particularly beginning
in 1978 the chinese seem capable of a really impressive turnaround in light of their earlier
history in which they become active players and even eager participants in the globalization
process here's a different package from that of india based on a different set of historical
experiences but a package that seems quite successful in its own right because of the ability
to change in light of global pressures and global opportunities sub-saharan africa is a third case
i think frankly that sub-saharan african encounters with globalization in the 20th and 21st centuries
must be best understood so far at least in terms of seeing globalization as a recent
intensification of economic inequalities international economic inequalities that actually
had begun to develop with the formation of the world economy in the early modern period africa
obviously has various cultural connections with globalization political connections as well in
various rights agitations etc and the spread of democracy more recently but so far the crucial
impact of globalization on africa is to enhance the african position in the international economy
as a supplier of relatively inexpensive raw raw materials and foods globalization is here
again a contemporary instantiation of a system of trade inequalities that began several centuries
earlier again a third case the point i hope is clear globalization is a force that requires
response from every major part of the world that's a new element but it's a it's it's a force that
also gains responses based on the historical experience of different societies and the
willingness and ability of different societies to alter that experience in light of globalization
itself it has to be seen as a common force but one that generates a number of different stories
based on different civilizational pasts and it is of course crucial to remember
that this process rouses resistance as well as accommodation different societies will see
different aspects of globalization as menacing or at least troubling the middle east for example
which accommodates significantly to globalization in many ways and divides over the eagerness with
which this force is embraced the middle east obviously uses many people in the middle east at
least use a religious lens in which to view globalization and use islam as the key shaper
of this lens islam itself as an international force can accommodate globalization but it can
also view aspects of globalization particularly on the cultural side as troubling and needing
considerable constraint and regulation europeans embrace globalization in many ways more readily
because they help set up the globalization system itself they benefit from it in many obvious ways
but europeans continue to worry about certain aspects of globalization including perhaps most
obviously the contemporary versions of the old pattern of human migration europeans and immigration
set up a a a tension point at various junctures during the final decades of the 20th century
in the early 21st and these tensions have not fully been resolved the united states which has its
own concerns about global migration but probably handles this force a little bit more comfortably
than europeans do the united states has its set of concerns about globalization focus perhaps
most obviously on issues of political sovereignty the united states stands out from a number of
societies in its reluctance to subscribe to political globalization to international agreements
that might seem to bind american freedom of action politically even as most societies in western
europe and many parts of asia find these agreements more comfortable when they apply to landmines
or environmental change or various issues of this sort each society then develops and emphasizes
its own resistances based again on historical experience based on a sense of what the crucial
regional identity is that needs to be protected against globalization itself world history then
as we have seen it shaped over many millennia provides a perspective on globalization and
globalization in turn provides an opportunity to renew our sense of why the world history
enterprise is indeed a significant one there are as i hope many of us would agree a whole batch
of good reasons to be interested in history the past is fascinating for its own sake we see the
we see the varieties of possibilities in human response by looking at experiences in various
societies through history there are a batch of good stories it can be seen as entertaining
all sorts of good reasons but among them and i would argue frankly primary among them is the
opportunity to see how the past shapes the present and since our present is inescapably a global one
i trust it's at least arguable if not absolutely clear that world history becomes one of the crucial
frameworks for historical knowledge that we need to explore in order to understand our own times
and very briefly i admit we've tried to use this last discussion as a way to see how that works and
let me recapitulate if globalization is a new force we can establish how new it is only by
looking at previous historical experiences and that means in this instance inescapably world
history we need to understand that contacts are not a new phenomenon that resistances are not new
either and then we need to say well but in the 19th century and maybe again in the later 20th
century while the basic tension between the regional and the global is not a brand new one the
terms of the tension changed crucially and history helps us make that determination world history
is also essential as we've just been discussing in helping to determine why different societies
react to globalization in different ways they bring different cultural baggage they bring
different kinds of economic contacts with global forces shape not just recently but in some cases
going well back to the 16th and 17th centuries we need history to see this aspect as well and we
need world history finally as the framework in which we can begin to sort out looking at our own
society but also Africa or China or India we can begin to sort out well as we begin to assess
globalization and not simply define it what's good about it what's dubious and what's probably bad
and what can we do if anything about any of those features there's one final question to pose that
comes straight from world history that comes straight from the discussion we've been having
here that I think is an appropriate note to end on we have argued as will many world historians
that from 3500 BCE or so using the concept of civilization is one not the only but one of
the key mechanisms by which we can make sense of the variety of experiences that constitute world
history and we've argued that civilization is a form of human organization but also that as
individual civilizations developed they formed identities and characteristics that would mark
them off in part from other societies around them that would allow their members to see themselves
as somewhat different from societies the next continent over or even the next subcontinent over
civilization becomes in this sense a crucial form of identity as these
factors develop through world history but now the question by the 21st century under the impact of
globalization are we beginning to reach a point at which civilization itself as an expression of
identity civilization itself will begin to yield ground to other more global forms of identity
some world historians not necessarily eager partisans of globalization are arguing that
that is in fact underway that for example it's more important now for a scientist to talk to
other scientists based on this identity regardless of whether they come from islam or japan or the
united states science becomes the crucial framework for discussions rather than civilization
of origin and the same might be held for certain kinds of athletes for certain kinds of businessmen
and managers for certain kinds of social scientists as well as scientists are we beginning to see a
situation in which at least at the middle and upper class levels civilization begins to take a
backseat to other more global expressions of identity and training i think this has to be a
question i don't think it can be answered yet but if this is the case it adds weight to the sense
that we are in an era that is beginning to experience a fundamental shift away from some
of the common currency that world history has maintained really for over five thousand years
this is a possible it's not yet definite there are even those who argue that civilization will
trump globalization and that we will see a new clash of civilizations focused particularly on
tensions between islam and the west i not only hope that this view is incorrect i believe it is
unless it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy but it too calls attention to the extent to which
we're at a point in world history at which we need to weigh what's persistent from the past
what's newly introduced thanks to new organizational forms new human interests new technologies
we don't know the future we can raise questions that we can't answer but what we do know is that we
cannot we cannot even formulate sensible questions we cannot even cast aside scenarios that frankly
are dubious and risky without knowing the history that lies at their base world history in this sense
intriguing i hope in its own right is a vital tool to help us sort out what shapes are present
and what will shape our future we genuinely hope you have enjoyed these lectures from our great
