Elemental matters and introduction to chemistry lecture three count like a chemist
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to count like a chemist
Next time you go to the grocery store take a minute and look at the packaging on some of the products you buy
If you buy eggs, you probably pay for them by the dozen not by the pound if you buy flour
You pay by the pound but not by the quart when you buy milk you buy by the volume
For either modern technical or archaic manufacturing reasons. We just don't count it that way the grocery store
Chemists use the same range of measuring techniques as grocers
But chemists have a problem the big complication in chemistry is the fact that the individual molecules or atoms chemists count are so small
That any normal measurable mass or volume is going to contain an inconceivably huge number of particles
The trillion atoms is not enough for you to see with your eye
however
Historical chemists have come to our rescue if you look at the periodic table our friend
The number at the bottom of each block on the periodic table gives the mass in grams of
A sample of atoms of that type that always contains the same number of atoms
That number is 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd
That scientific notation is a shorthand for chemists who don't like to write out lots of zeros
But if you prefer zeros in decimal notation, this number is 602 million trillion or
602 sex trillion
That 602 followed by 21 zeros
Chemists give this number a specific name one mole
Any collection of 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd items is one mole of items
This is exactly the same thing as saying a million items is one times 10 to the six items or a dozen is
12 or a ream is 500
But back to the periodic table
Note that one mole of sodium metal will have a mass of 22.99 grams and one mole of lead has a mass of
207.19 grams
But both samples would contain the same number of atoms
So the individual atoms of lead must be heavier than the individual atoms of sodium
What about a mole of sodium chloride?
One mole of sodium chloride salt will contain one mole of sodium ions and one mole of chloride ions
Since the sodium atoms have given their electrons to the chlorine atoms to form the ions
one mass of sodium chloride
Ways exactly the same as one mass of sodium plus one mass of chlorine atoms
So we can calculate the molar mass of
Compounds from the periodic table as well. What about one mole of methane CH4?
Can you see that one mole of methane will have the same mass as one mole of carbon plus four moles of a hydrogen?
One mole of carbon is 12.01 grams
Four moles of hydrogen is 4.04 grams for a total of 16.05 grams
While you might find it annoying to hear the unit gram after every number here
Chemists are pretty neurotic about keeping units with their numbers
It helps in problem-solving and it avoids
catastrophes like the crash of the Mars orbiter in September 1999
Which resulted when scientists from NASA and engineers from Lockheed Martin failed to communicate their units clearly to each other
The engineering team was using English units while NASA scientists assumed that everything was in metric terms
As a result a lander that was supposed to land on Mars crashed into the surface instead
How big is a mole? Let's do a quick calculation to illustrate
Let's figure out how long it would take if you sat down to count a mole of sodium atoms
Assuming you could count one every second
Scientists call this technique unit analysis or dimensional analysis
The time it would take is a number of atoms we want to count
6.02 times 10 to the 23rd times the inverse rate at which we count them one second per atom
But we'd prefer to express this not as
602 times 10 to the 23rd seconds, but in some period of time that we can relate to
So let's convert from seconds to lifetimes
We know that one minute is 60 seconds. We know that one hour is 60 minutes
We know that one day is 24 hours
One year is 365 days and let's be optimistic and say a lifetime is 90 years
If we set all of these up as ratios and multiply them times each other
We get 602 times 10 at the 23rd atoms times one second per atom times one minute per 60 seconds
Times one hour per 60 minutes times one hour per 24 days times one year per 365 days
Times one lifetime per 90 years
It will take us 2.12 times 10 to the 14th lifetimes to count a mole of sodium atoms
This is 212 trillion lifetimes
212 with 12 zeros after it the 6,000 years of recorded history only allow for 67
90-year lifetimes
Think about this for a moment and you will begin to perceive how small atoms ions and molecules are and
How many of them are even in the smallest speck of dust?
You can certainly see why chemists prefer to weigh out samples counting them is absolutely impossible
Now that we can appreciate how enormous a number a mole is
Let's do a couple calculations
You'll have to do if you're using this as a supplement to a chemistry class in high school or college
The salt canister in my pantry is about half empty. Let's say it contains
292.2 grams of salt sodium chloride
How many moles of salt are in my pantry?
Just as we use the density of a substance to convert from grams to liters mass to volume
We can use the molar mass of a substance to convert between grams and number of moles
We know that one mole of sodium chloride has a mass of 58.44 grams. We find that from the periodic table
So to solve the problem of how many moles of salt are in my pantry
We begin with what we know and use the molar mass of sodium chloride as a conversion factor
We find that 292.2 grams of sodium chloride times one mole of sodium chloride per
58.44 grams of sodium chloride is
5.000 moles of NaCl
The zeros after the decimal following the five represent significant figures
Since the periodic table I have gives me the mass of sodium and chloride to four
Significant figures and the mass of the salt in the problem is given to four significant figures
I can keep four significant figures in the answer of how many moles I have
The zeros to the right of the decimal are significant here the sample of sodium chloride
Contains 5.000 moles of sodium ions and 5.000 moles of chloride ions if we wanted to count them
Individually we would have 5 times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd sodium ions or 3.01 times 10 to the 24th sodium ions
That's a lot
You'll note that what we're doing here is building a repertoire of conversion factors
Molar mass allows us to relate grams to moles and density allows us to relate mass to volume
Conversion factors make it possible for us to count the number of atoms ions or molecules in a sample
If we know its mass or its volume
This flexibility is important in making chemistry a more practical science
But it is a complication for generation of chemistry students
Most introductory chemistry texts provide a flowchart of some sort to help you organize conversion factors
Sometimes chemists call one mole Avogadro's number Avogadro was an Italian chemist who studied gases in the early 1800s
He first proposed that any volume of any gas sample
Contained the same number of molecules as that same volume of any other gas as long as the temperature and pressure were the same
His hypothesis was based on careful study of reactions between gases
Today's definition of one mole is formally defined as the number of carbon 12 atoms in 12.011 grams of carbon
As such it is an experimentally determined number and subject to some uncertainty
Those of you who like to think of science as simply a set of rules written in dusty books
Should know that there is currently an active discussion under way about redefining Avogadro's number
You can follow developments about this discussion through publications like American scientist or chemical and engineering news
Or through public information provided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
The National Institute of Standards and Technology or the Bureau International de Poillet measures at Severe in France
Let's take a brief detour into Avogadro's world and see the genesis of his revolutionary idea
The story starts in the 1660s
Robert Boyle and his assistant Robert Hook were working at a house in Oxford, England and
Sit out to measure the volume of a gas sample as a function of pressure
The device they used was similar to a mercury barometer a
J-shaped piece of glass tubing is closed at the short end
Mercury is porting to the tube
When the levels of mercury on both sides of the tube are the same the pressure exerted by the gas
Captured in the short end of the tube is equal to the atmospheric pressure in the room
As more and more mercury is added to the open long arm of the tube
The pressure on the gas sample is increased and the volume is observed to decrease
Boyle and Hook determined that the relationship between volume and pressure was exactly an inverse relationship
We would write mathematically that V the volume equals a constant divided by P the pressure
The first time I visited Oxford
I was delighted one morning to turn a corner and come upon a historic marker
Noting that the site before me had housed the home of Robert Boyle and was the exact location where he and Hook had discovered Boyle's law
It reminded me that science is all around us. We just have to open our eyes to see it
The next of the gas laws was discovered by Charles a French mathematician who lived from 1746 to 1823
Charles is noted as one of the first people to ascend in a hot-air balloon a
Feet of bravery enabled only by the fact that the first launch of a hot-air balloon had carried a sheep a duck and a rooster
To ensure that high altitude probably less than a hundred meters would not be fatal to its living passengers
Charles scientific contributions were to perform a systematic study of the volume of a gas as a function of its temperature
Charles determined that all gases showed a linear increase in volume with temperature
More interesting when his experimental data was extrapolated to determine the temperature where the gas would occupy zero volume
All the samples he investigated gave the same result on the centigrade scale
The volume of every gas sample went to zero at minus two hundred and seventy three point one five degrees centigrade
Today you can see Charles's law in action if you buy helium balloons from the party store
The balloons will undoubtedly appear fully inflated in the store
But if you're having a party on a cold day in January
You may be surprised as the balloons appear to deflate in your car on the way home
Once you get them in your house, they will warm up again and reinflate the deflation results from the cold temperature outside the store
The balloons reinflate as they warm back to room temperature in your house
Mathematically Charles law is written volume equals a constant times temperature
Avogadro followed Charles and observed that the volume of a gas
increased linearly with the amount or mass of the gas present
He hypothesized that equal volumes of two gases when held at the same temperature and pressure
Contained equal numbers of gas molecules
Avogadro's law is also mathematically a linear relationship
The volume of a gas equals a constant times n where n is the number count of the molecules in the gas sample
The constants in each of these three gas laws are different numerically and they have different units
But eventually the three separate gas laws were combined into one overall equation and today we call that equation the ideal gas law
PV equals nrt if you measure the pressure the volume the number of moles and the temperature of any sample of a gas
The ratio of the pressure times the volume divided by the number of moles times the temperature
Always gives the exact same numerical value. We call that value r
It's a universal constant called the gas constant
Let's return to the solutions we discussed in lesson 2
When solutions are prepared in the lab
It is usually easiest to report the amount of solute and solvent used in terms of the mass or volume of the components used
But solutions turn out to be trickier than you might assume
While the mass of a solution is always equal to the sum of the mass of its components
The volume of a solution is not always equal to the sum of the volume of its components
You can probably already understand why?
In a macroscopic analogy, let's assume we decide to place some stones in a pail
We fill the pail to the top. Is the pail full?
It is if we try to add more stones
But what if we want to add sand instead?
You know that you can add the sand shake the pail and watch the sand fill in the spaces left between the stones
In general the bigger the stones the more sand you can get into the pail
When you have filled the pail with sand, is it full?
Not if you try to add water
Even if the pail looks completely full of stones and sand
You know that you can add water and the water will fill the small spaces between the sand particles
The total mass of the stone sand and water in the pail is exactly equal to the mass of the stones
Plus the mass of the sand plus the mass of the water you've put in the pail
But if you measured the volume of the stones the volume of the sand and the volume of the water
Independently before you mix them you would not find the volume of the stones plus the volume of the sand plus the volume of the water
Equal the volume of the pail
Chemicals work like stone sand and water
When you mix them together
Especially when you make solutions they can fit into the spaces left between their partner's molecules
Volume is not conserved
So in chemistry there are two approaches to making solutions
One is used when the solute is truly a minor component in the solution
This technique is called volumetric preparation. The other appropriate for any solution uses mass exclusively
Let's begin with the volumetric methods
It is easy to measure the volume of liquid in your kitchen use measuring cup
In a lab chemists have a wide range of calibrated volumetric measuring devices as well
One of these is called a volumetric flask
A volumetric flask is wide at the bottom but has a long very narrow neck
The manufacturer of the volumetric flask calibrates the glassware and provides a single mark on the neck of the flask
Indicating the position of the meniscus when a specific volume of solution is contained in the flask
The manufacturer reports the volume and its uncertainty actually on the glassware itself
Careful medicinal pharmaceutical or environmental chemists often keep scrupulous historic data on their volumetric glassware
Recalibrating it periodically so they know if the volume of the sample it holds changes even slightly from one experiment to the next
To prepare a solution of sodium chloride in water a chemist would weigh out a known mass of salt say 10 grams
And put it in the volumetric flask
The chemist would then add some distilled water and swirl the flask until the salt appeared to dissolve
Once the salt was dissolved the chemist adds more water until the meniscus is exactly level with the mark on the volumetric flask
Let's say it's at 100 milliliters in this case
Since all the salt dissolves we could say that the concentration of salt in this solution is 10 grams in 100 milliliters
This is a perfectly good way to report the concentration of a salt solution. Of course, it is not the only way
If we want to use the solution in a chemical reaction
We might want to know how many sodium or chloride atoms are present in the 100 milliliter sample rather than the mass
To report this we convert the 10 grams to moles. That's not too hard 10 grams times 1 mole divided by 58.44 grams is
0.1711 moles of sodium chloride
So now we can report the concentration of the salt solution as 0.1711 moles in 100 milliliters
But remember that the leader is the base unit of volume
Chemists prefer to use base units whenever possible
This concentration unit using leader as the standard volume gets a special name
molar
abbreviated capital M
The solution we have prepared by dissolving 1.711 moles of sodium chloride in enough water to make one liter of solution
has a concentration of 1.711 molar
Remember this is exactly the same concentration as the solution which was prepared by mixing 0.1711 moles in 100 milliliters
There's just more of it
So the same solution
Can be described as having a concentration of 10 grams of sodium chloride per 100 milliliters
Or 0.1711 moles per 100 milliliters or 1.711 molar
They are all different names for the exact same concentration
The unit we use depends on the problem. We are trying to solve and our personal preference
As long as we know how to interconvert between units we can understand each other and that's the goal
Chemists call the solution preparation strategy described here dissolve and dilute
They always completely dissolve the solute before adding enough solvent to reach the final volume
Because they know that dissolution can change the volume of the solution when compared to the sums of the volumes of the solute and the solvent
When volumetric concentrations are used this can be a significant source of error in lab work or in calculations
Once we know the molar concentration of a solution we can easily use volumetric measurements to obtain any quantity of a solute we want
For instance if we measured out 50 milliliters of our 1.711 molar sodium chloride solution
We would have 50 milliliters times 1.711 moles per liter times 1 liter per thousand milliliters
0.0855 moles of sodium chloride
Since multiplication is transitive we can multiply the factors in any order and get the same answer
So if you prefer to convert milliliters to liters first and then determine the number of moles, that's fine
If we know that we want exactly six grams of sodium chloride
We can determine the volume of solution needed to do that as well
using 1.711 molar as the solution
Concentration and the molar mass as a conversion factor
We can take six grams times one mole divided by 58.44 grams
times one liter divided by 1.711 moles and see that we need
0.060
liters or 60 milliliters of solution to provide the six grams of sodium chloride
The problem-solving method here employs concentration in the same way as density as a conversion factor
The units you have and the units you want determine whether the conversion factor is used right side up as defined or upside down
In the previous lesson we discussed the precipitation of calcium sulfate from mixing together solutions of calcium chloride and sodium sulfate
Let's revisit the reaction and consider it in more detail
The balanced chemical equation for the reaction can be written in several ways
The first includes all of the information available
We write calcium chloride aqueous plus sodium sulfate aqueous
produces calcium sulfate solid and two sodium chlorides
aqueous
Notice a few things
The subscripts identify the precipitate as a solid and the NACL
Requires a two in front of it so that the number of sodium and chloride atoms on both sides of the reaction are the same
The reaction reflects a procedure we're conducting in the lab
But it does not do a very good job of telling us the actual chemistry that's happened to form the precipitate
In reality all the species present before the reaction is initiated are better described as independent
Solvated ions in solution as are the sodium and chloride ions in the product
It is more helpful to write the reaction in a form called a complete ionic equation
The complete ionic equation is calcium plus 2 aqueous plus cl minus 1 aqueous
plus sodium plus 1 aqueous plus SO4 minus 2 aqueous
Produces calcium sulfate solid plus na plus 1 aqueous plus cl minus 1 aqueous
This form of the reaction shows all the species in their correct states both before and after the reaction
But it does not reflect the chloride is actually present in twice the concentration as the calcium
The complete or total ionic equation also requires that we write the sodium and chloride ions the same on both sides of the arrow
While this emphasizes that they do not participate in the reaction
It is something that a chemist focused on the chemistry of the reaction would really prefer to avoid
In the case where the reaction is the most important feature the net ionic equation is the most concise way of conveying information
The net ionic equation shows only those chemical species which undergo a change in the course of the reaction
Here the net ionic equation is calcium plus 2 plus sulfate goes to calcium sulfate solid
Note that this net ionic equation completely ignores the presence of the sodium and chloride ions
We call them spectator ions because they don't participate in the chemical reaction. They just hang around and watch
The stoichiometry of the balanced net ionic equation
Allows us to determine how much of each solution we need or how much product will be formed
Let's consider kitchen stoichiometry for a moment before we examine the solution stoichiometry here
An old recipe I have for pound cake calls for a pound of flour pound of sugar pound of eggs and a pound of butter
The stoichiometry is pretty straightforward
If you have a pound of flour a pound of sugar a pound of eggs and a pound of butter you can make one pound cake
But if you only have a half a pound of sugar, you can't make a whole pound cake. You could make half of a pound cake
Sometimes half a pound cake might be enough or it might be the best you can do
Chemical stoichiometry is exactly like baking stoichiometry
In baking the recipe tells you the ratio of the amount of each ingredient you need to use
If you short an ingredient you can reduce the amount of all the ingredients by half
And usually things will work out fine. You just make half as much product at the end
Or if you're having a big party you can double the recipe and make twice the products two pound cakes
In chemistry the balanced reaction takes the place of a recipe
The balanced reaction tells you the number of each kind of reagent you need and the number of products that they can form
It can be bred as referring to either individual molecules or moles of molecules
So in the precipitation reaction we just discussed where the net ionic equation is CA plus 2 aqueous plus SO4 minus 2 aqueous
Produces calcium sulfate solid. We can read this as one calcium ion and one sulfate ion make one calcium sulfate formula units
Or a million calcium ions and a million sulfate ions make a million calcium sulfate formula units
Or one mole of calcium ions plus one mole of sulfate ions makes one mole of calcium sulfate
The precipitation is said to have a one-to-one stoichiometry
If you only have point two moles of calcium ions you can't make a mole of calcium sulfate
But you can make your point two moles of calcium ions with point two moles of sulfate ions to make point two moles of calcium sulfate
What would happen if you mixed a solution containing point two moles of calcium ion with a solution containing point three moles of sulfate ions?
You would run out of calcium before you used up the sulfate ions
The calcium ion would be considered the limiting reagent in the reaction
It would place a limit on the amount of product that could be made
From this mixture you could make point two moles of calcium sulfate
Leaving point one moles of sulfate excess behind in the solution the sulfate would be called the excess reagent
That's really all there is to chemical stoichiometry. You don't need to make it any more complicated
But of course life is always more complicated, isn't it?
Let's consider the solution stoichiometry. We would face in a real laboratory environment
There are two exceptions to the chlorides or soluble rule
One is silver chloride and the other is lead chloride
Silver chloride and lead chloride both precipitate out of solutions
Let's say we're trying to get all the metals out of some water samples
We have 50 milliliters of a solution containing point zero two molar silver nitrate and
50 milliliters of a solution containing point zero two molar lead nitrate and we have a bottle of point one
O-molar sodium chloride
How much sodium chloride solution do we need to add to the silver nitrate solution to precipitate all the silver?
Even if you can intuit the answer here, it is helpful to illustrate the calculation of the answer using a systematic approach
First write the net ionic equation for the reaction that occurs
Sodium plus one ions aqueous plus chloride minus one aqueous
form silver chloride solid
This reaction has a one-to-one stoichiometry
If we figure out how many moles of silver in our sample, we will need that same number of moles of chloride ions to precipitate them
Since both of the reagents are present in solution
We will need to convert from moles to volume using the solution concentrations as the conversion factor
Remember, we have 50 milliliters of point zero two zero molar silver nitrate
to calculate moles
We take 50 milliliters times one liter per thousand milliliters
times point zero two moles of silver nitrate per one liter
times one mole of silver ions per one mil of silver nitrate and
Find that there are point zero zero one zero moles of silver ions present
The point zero zero one mole of silver ions requires one mole of chloride ions for every mole of silver ions to precipitate
Which means that we are required to provide point zero zero one mole of chloride ions to precipitate the silver from our solution
Since the chloride we have is in a solution of sodium chloride and
That solution has a concentration of point one zero zero molar
The point zero zero one moles of chloride ions times one liter per point one zero zero moles of chloride ions
Means that we need point zero one zero liters or 10 milliliters of chloride solution to precipitate our silver
so we get a stoichiometric
mixture of chloride
precipitating all the silver by mixing 10 milliliters of point one molar sodium chloride solution with
50 milliliters of point zero two molar silver nitrate solution and together they produce point zero zero one mole of silver chloride
precipitate
We can add more sodium chloride solution if we want, but no more silver chloride will precipitate once we run out of silver
The point zero zero one mole of silver chloride we produce will have a mass of
point zero zero one mole times a hundred and forty three point three two grams of silver chloride per mole of silver chloride or
point one four three grams
Chemists can separate precipitates from solutions by running the whole thing through a piece of filter paper
The filter paper collects the solid but lets the supernatant solution and the ions it contains run through
This is pretty much the same as your coffee filter holds coffee grounds while the solution drips through the pot
What about 50 milliliters of point oh two molar lead nitrate? How can we get the lead out of that solution?
Let's follow our same procedure
This time the net ionic equation for the reaction is lead plus two aqueous plus two chloride minus one aqueous
Produces lead chloride solid
This reaction does not have a one-to-one stoichiometry. In fact, it says we need two chlorides for every lead
This isn't any different than needing two wheels for each bicycle or two pieces of bread for every sandwich and
The steps required to answer the question what volume of sodium chloride solution is needed to precipitate all the lead
Are the exact same steps as the ones we proceeded with in answering the silver precipitation question?
So let's start at the beginning. How many moles of lead ions are present?
We have 50 milliliters of point oh two molar lead nitrate
50 milliliters times point oh two oh moles of lead per liter of lead nitrate solution
Times one mole of lead plus two for every mole of lead nitrate means that we have point zero zero one zero mole of lead ions present
that many lead ions
Times two moles of chloride for every one mole of lead means we need point zero zero two moles of chloride to do the precipitation
and
The point zero zero two moles of chloride ions that come in a solution with a concentration of point one mole per liter
Means that we need point zero two zero liters or 20 milliliters of chloride solution
Not surprisingly we find that we need twice as much chloride to precipitate the lead
Because of the two-to-one stoichiometry
But we still make the same number of moles of product point zero zero one zero moles
The point zero zero one zero mole of lead chloride precipitated will have a larger mass
However, because the mass of lead chloride is two hundred and seventy-eight point oh nine grams per mole
point zero zero one moles times two hundred seventy-eight point oh nine grams per mole means that will precipitate point two seven eight grams of lead chloride
These general steps allow you to solve any problem in solutions stoichiometry in a principles of chemistry course
It really doesn't matter if you're working on a tenth gram scale as these problems illustrate or whether you're dealing with tons of reagents
The structure of the calculations is exactly the same
Now let's look at some solutions made by dissolving gases in water
We know that fish have gills and breathe the oxygen dissolved in water
Just as we breathe the oxygen dispersed in the nitrogen in our atmosphere
If you consider the solubility rules we've discussed so far you might predict that oxygen a non-polar
Homo-nuclear diatomic gas is not soluble in water at all
Obviously the existence of fish overrules your conclusion
But please don't ignore the solubility rules we've established so far nor the solubility principles that underlie them
Let's examine five gases quickly and see how their Lewis structures
compare
with their solubility
The five gases will look at our oxygen gas nitrogen gas carbon dioxide gas ammonia gas and hydrochloric acid gas
Oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide are all major components in our atmosphere
Ammonia and hydrochloric acid are two of the most important industrial chemicals
First draw the five Lewis diagrams and predict the solubility of these gases in water based on the intermolecular forces they experience
Your drawings will show that nitrogen oxygen and co2 are all non-polar molecules
You would predict that they are not soluble in water
On the other hand ammonia and H3 is very polar and in fact has hydrogen bonds. It should be very soluble in water
HCl is also highly polar, but it does not form hydrogen bonds
So you might predict that it should be less soluble than ammonia
What do the experimental results show in order to compare apples to apples?
We need to be a little bit careful about how we set up the experiments to make these measurements
If we take a water sample and purge all the air from the space above it so that we can expose the water to an atmosphere
Which contains pure nitrogen or pure oxygen or pure ammonia and if we keep the pressure of the gas above the water the same
Say normal atmospheric pressure one atmosphere and we keep the temperature of everything the same say room temperature
25 degrees centigrade then we can get some results that compare apples to apples
We can report the solubility of gases in grams per kilogram of water
Nitrogen and oxygen gas have measured solubilities of 0.018 and 0.039 grams per kilogram of water respectively
Ammonia and hydrochloric acid have solubilities of 470 and
695 grams per kilogram of water respectively
When we look at the measured solubilities
It is clear that the predictions we made based on the structures of molecules are aligned with these results
The compounds we predict would be soluble
Dissolve hundreds of grams for every kilogram of water to form aqueous solutions
The compounds we say are insoluble can dissolve only milligrams into the solution
It turns out that a more sophisticated analysis of the solubilities of the alcohols and salts we discussed in lesson 2
Requires us to modify our initial atom and description of non-polar molecules as insoluble
Mother nature is more sophisticated than that
The rules we developed from macroscopic observations apply to macroscopic quantities
But nature is often quite subtle and not interested in an absolute pronouncement
So this more sophisticated view of solubility is not the compounds dissolvent to two camps the soluble and the insoluble
But that they are arrayed along a continuum
Some are admissible some are very soluble some are slightly soluble
But in water the universal solvent there are almost no compounds that are completely insoluble
If the small solubility of oxygen and water is sufficient to support all of the fish life on earth
You can imagine the miracles and headaches caused by the presence of other equally insoluble compounds in our aquatic world
You might note here that we skipped the solubility of CO2 gas
The solubility of CO2 gas illustrates the continuum of solubility, but with a twist
Following our rules you would predict that CO2 should have a solubility of about 0.1 gram per kilogram of water
Because CO2 is a non-polar gas
But in fact the solubility of CO2 is more than 10 times this amount
1.45 grams of CO2 will dissolve in a kilogram of water at 25 degrees centigrade
This seems a little bit out of line
but
If we investigate further we find that the CO2 solution we've prepared has some distinctive physical properties
Different from those of nitrogen or oxygen saturated water
In particular if we test the conductivity of the three solutions
containing oxygen
nitrogen and CO2
We find that the oxygen and nitrogen solutions do not conduct electricity, but carbon dioxide
forms a slightly conductive solution
Not equal to the conductance of salt in water, but not zero either
There must be some ions in a carbon dioxide
aqueous solution
Where do they come from? If we employ a pH meter to quantitate it
We see that in contrast to oxygen and nitrogen
dissolving carbon dioxide in water makes the water acidic
If we measure the pH of water containing HCl gas
It's more acidic than the water containing CO2
On the other hand if we measure the pH of ammonia
containing water, that's basic
We will examine the chemical reactions that accompany the dissolution of carbon dioxide hydrochloric acid and ammonia and give a formal definition
of the term pH in lesson seven
Let's draw our introduction to counting like a chemist to a close with one more concentration conversion
We have reported the solubility of gases in water in terms of grams of each gas that will dissolve in a kilogram of water
How would we determine the concentration of the gases in terms of moles per liter?
We would need two conversion factors here
The first would use the molar mass of the solute gas to convert from grams to moles easy enough
The second conversion factor will have to give us the volume of the solution
That requires knowing the density of the solution
Pay careful attention here
We need the density of the solution which relates the mass of the solution to the volume of the solution
The mass of the solution is the total mass of both the solvent water and the solute that's dissolved in it
In the case of oxygen
0.039 grams dissolve in one kilogram of water
The molar concentration of oxygen in a saturated oxygen solution is therefore
0.039 grams of oxygen in
1,000 0.039 grams of solution
times one mole of oxygen per 32 grams of oxygen
times one gram of solution per one milliliter of solution times a thousand milliliters per one liter or
1.2 times 10 to the minus third molar
Now we are able to count like a chemist
Before we continue our discussion of the properties and behavior of chemicals that constitutes most of this course
We'll take a brief detour to investigate where atoms have come from anyway
This investigation will lead us to the stars and back to the dawn of time itself
This ends lecture three
