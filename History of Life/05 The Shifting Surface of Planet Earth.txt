Felly, now we have a toolkit, a toolkit which we can use to read Earth's story.
We have the principles of stratigraphy and deep time, we have biostratigraphy so we can correlate
between areas.
And we understand how we can use fossils but need to be careful because we can use fossils
a we understand how we can use fossils, but need to be careful, as records of past earth systems.
I'd like to add one more part to the puzzle. That's the thing that brings it all together, the Grand Unifying Theory of Geosciences.
In this lecture, I'd like to ask, what was the original Grand Unifying Theory of Geology?
Also, what evidence supports drifting continents, and why was it trashed by the scientific community,

House ofOTH questions,
it is almost as if the two continents he noted had been torn apart.
He suggested, potentially by earthquakes and floods.
Similar ideas were proposed by Antonio Snyder Peliegrinian in 1858.
He reconstructed this superconsent.
In fact, it looks fairly similar to the reconstructions we have made today.
He also based this reconstruction on the similarity of plant fossils that are 300 million years old
that are found across the Atlantic ocean.

A organisations basi'r váll y oes coes of North America
move into Newfoundland
And then they're gone
They seem to disappear
Into the Atlantic Ocean
But then when you come across here
To Britain
How on earth could that be? How can characteristic mountains here and here develop?
Sepulated by the Atlantic?
Wel, the way that we can do that is to create a larger continental mass,
and what we have there, when we bring North America and that part of Europe together,
is a large mountain chain called a caladonian mountain chain
that existed about 400 million years ago.
It's not just mountains, though. It's also the stratigraphy, the rocks on various continents that match up.
We have certain areas of rock, for example here in Africa and in South America, that are really ancient rocks.
They're called shield areas, precambrian shield areas, really ancient areas of the crust.
Again, they have very characteristic rocks, very characteristic sediments and deformational histories.
And when you bring South America and Africa together, those rocks match, almost like putting together two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
In addition, lava that is found erupted here in Africa of a certain chemistry and a certain age matches almost exactly lava that you find in South America of the same age and the same chemistry.
Obviously, that lava flowed from Africa across to South America when the continents were once joined.
When you look at the stratigraphy of South America and Africa, it really is very, very similar on these parts of the coastline and really only differs after we understand when the South Atlantic opened up.
There's other evidence, too, that comes from glacias.
Wagner, in particular, was looking at a glaciation that occurred about 280 to 270 million years ago.
Now, glaciasians leave some very characteristic features behind, characteristic features in the landscape, characteristic valleys, but also some characteristic sediments that we call glacial till.
It's caused when a glacier rumbles across a rock surface, chewing it up and producing this very lumpy sediment. We'll meet some of it later.
They also scratch rocks. Glacias have rocks embedded in there on the surface, and as they move across a rock surface, they gouge lines or striations into them, and these can be very useful.
You can see some glacial striations there in Hallot Cove in South Australia. It's a photograph I took a number of years ago.
When you look at all that glacial evidence, which can tell us where the glacias were and what direction they were moving in, it doesn't make sense when you plot it on a current continental configuration.
First of all, we have a major glaciation in what is now tropical Africa. Also, though, look at the direction of movement of those glacias.
You have some glacias that are moving from the ocean and up onto the continents. Glacias just don't do that. What does make sense?
Well, when you reconfigure the continents to form a southern polar continent that we call Gondwana land, now we don't have glacias jumping off in the oceans and on to land, and we have a much more reasonable climatic model to understand a large glaciation in the southern polar hemisphere.
Other kind of climatological evidence comes from coal. Now, coal is basically just compressed plant material. You can get coal forming, though, in a number of environments, including temperate environments.
But when you look at coal that we are familiar with in the northern hemisphere, it generally comes from a period called the Carboniferous.
That period gets its name from the fact that there's lots of coal produced in this period between 359 and 299 million years ago, and that coal we can tell by looking at the fossil evidence was deposited in hot, swampy, warm, everglades-like environments.
Yet, the majority of the coal that we extract today comes from temperate regions, from areas like where I grew in the north of England, and also, like in this open cast mine here in Virginia.
Once again, north of England and Virginia are not tropical locations. Something doesn't work with current continental configuration.
Corals are also a very good climatic indicator. They're very specific in the type of environments that they like to live in. Tropical corals like clear, shallow water between 77 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
And yet, remember what I told you about when I was a small child clamouring over those hills in Derbyshire? I found tropical corals in Derbyshire.
But they've not only just been found in Derbyshire, we've found this. Similar tropical corals in the Arctic Circle. Again, it only makes sense if you can rearrange the continents so they match up with more reasonable climatic regimes.
Other fossils help in this understanding of the fact that the continents must have been in different configurations. This creature is Lystrasaurus. He lived around 250 million years ago.
He's a pig-sized, kind of sturdy creature. Again, from comparative anatomy, we can tell that he was a strong walker, but probably not a very strong swimmer.
And yet, we find Lystrasaurus in India, South America and Antarctica. How did it move between these continents? In addition, given that Lystrasaurus is a reptile, how on earth did it survive in currently located Antarctica?
Same goes for Mesasaurus. Mesasaurus is a little older than Lystrasaurus, and this time he is aquatic, but he's a freshwater reptile. He couldn't have crossed oceans.
And yet, we find Mesasaurus fossils in Africa and South America. It doesn't make sense. Plants come into the picture as well.
There's a particular tropical fossil flora that we call glosopterus. It was a common group of permean plants between 299 and 251 million years ago that you find very commonly fossilized in the southern hemisphere.
However, when you actually look at the distribution of the glosopterus fauna, you find it in South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica.
This is far too wide a distribution for a tropical flora. In fact, the distribution once again only makes sense when you reconfigure the continents to form an obvious climatic belt centered around the southern pole there.
Using this evidence and other pieces of evidence, Wagner would ultimately publish his hypothesis of continental drift in a publication called The Origin of Continents and Oceans in 1915.
By the third edition of this publication, he proposed the existence over 200 million years ago of a supercontinent called Pangea, in Greek that means all lands.
And the reaction of the scientific community, utter damned rot, president of the American Philosophical Society. How about geologist Barry Willis further discussion of it merely in cumbers literature and be fogs the mind of fellow students?
And then there was geologist R. Thomas Chamberlain. If we are to believe this hypothesis, we must forget everything we learned in the last 70 years and start all over again. Oh, how right he was.
Unfortunately, the scientific community dismissed Wagner's ideas. The vast amount of fossil evidence that he brought to the argument was largely dismissed by the proposal of the existence of land bridges that, with no adequate explanation, suddenly popped up between continents such as South America and Africa and then mysteriously sank back down into the ocean.
Wagner queried this and said, well, how could you have land bridges popping up? They are not going to be able to sink back down into a very dense crust. Land area is generally a lot less dense than oceanic rocks.
It couldn't just bob down there. It would pop up again like a cork. Even so, they wouldn't listen. Why was this the reaction of the scientific community?
Well, in a way, it can be kind of common. Wagner was questioning a scientific paradigm, a world paradigm, not unlike the struggle that people had accepting, I guess, Darwin or the hypothesis of an ancient rather than a young age.
Basically, Wagner was the little boy in the crowd pointing out that the emperor really wasn't wearing any clothes at all. In addition, horror of horrors. Wagner wasn't even a geologist. How dare a meteorologist try and tell us geologists are business?
Even so, in 1926, a symposium was called to discuss this new hypothesis. Wagner himself was invited. However, it just basically turned into a slanging matcher, an opportunity some say for people to just abuse Wagner.
There are reports of Wagner just sitting very quietly at the back of the lecture room, smoking his pipe and not saying a word.
You see, the biggest problem with Wagner's ideas were the mechanisms, not really the evidence.
Wagner had gathered enough evidence to suggest that the continents had moved around, but the mechanism that he proposed to explain why they moved just wasn't acceptable.
He suggested that it was centrifugal forces causing these continents to move. The Earth's spin would effectively cause the continents to move around like bumper cars.
In addition, the gravity from the sun and the moon he proposed might also help shift the continents.
Now, any physicist will tell you that there's not nearly enough energy in those forces to cause the moving of continents through oceanic rocks.
Wagner didn't give up, though. He was really dedicated to solving this problem and continued to look for evidence to support his hypothesis in Greenland.
His last field season was in 1930. He was the expedition leader to this Greenland field area, and he was leading a party of colleagues to relieve some people who were short on supply in another base camp.
They made it through. Conditions looked nice, so they decided they would make the return journey.
Unfortunately, on the way back, they were hit by a large blizzard, and Wagner and his companion went missing.
They were found later in April, buried in the snow.
But how would Wagner's ideas of drifting continents ultimately be vindicated?
Well, I always think it's funny the way that science can turn.
New scientific discoveries and ideas can sometimes emerge due to other consequences, other connections, if you will.
And the idea of drifting continents will be vindicated by World War II, and the fact that the Allies really needed to find German U-boats.
Meet Harry Hess. He is a geologist, but significantly for our story, also the captain of the USS Cape Johnson.
It was a transport ship, and the USS Cape Johnson had just recently been fitted with a piece of rather fancy new technology, sonar, to detect German submarines.
Now, sonar works by bouncing sound signals effectively down into the ocean.
If it meets a German submarine, it will bounce off it and be recorded back at a detector, so you've detected your submarine.
If there's no submarine there, it will just bounce off the ocean floor, and that's what Hess wanted.
He left his sonar on while he was crossing the Pacific Ocean, and in doing so, started to create profiles of the ocean floor in the North Pacific.
And he discovered something rather quite amazing. The ocean floor in that area, in fact he would later discover all over the world, wasn't flat.
It was covered with ridges, with sunken volcanoes along the edge of continents very commonly. There was a deep oceanic trench.
Now, this was bizarre because if the oceans had been there for billions of years, they should be full of sediment, and they should be completely flat.
Hess thought about this, and he realised that he could, given the evidence of his oceanic profiles, come up with a mechanism that might more adequately explain the drifting continents.
He suggested that at the ridges, these long ridges that he found under the ocean floor, magma was rising up continually, generating new ocean crust.
As that new ocean crust was in place, it would displace the older crust to either side. This older crust would eventually descend and be recycled back into the earth at the ocean trenches.
Hess termed this sea floor spreading, and in 1962 published his ideas in the history of the ocean basins.
According to Hess, continents don't just plough through ocean crust. Continents are the thickened parts of crustal plates, and the continents are carried on those plates.
They move as oceanic crust spreads from a mid-oceanic ridge at its edge, or is subducted at another plate boundary.
We now know that the earth's crust is a bit like a giant fractured eggshell, and each of the pieces of those fractured eggshell represent the plates, and these plates are all moving relative to each other over vast amounts of time.
The movement is slow, but don't forget our concept of deep geological time. Slow movements over a lot of time can cause a lot of change.
Hess's mecanism was also an awful lot easier to swallow. It explained some other mysteries as well. As we said, why was the ocean floor not smooth if they were over four billion years old?
Well, basically the reason is the ocean basins aren't that old. They've been continually recycled and changed.
It's also explained, therefore, why no fossil in the ocean basin has ever been recovered from oceanic sediments that is older than 180 million years. The oceans are being continually created and recycled.
Later dating techniques would confirm this. When you date ocean crust, you find it is youngest at these spreading ridges and gets progressively older and older and older towards the trenches.
A true global scale conveyor belt of oceanic crust.
Evidence of the removal of crust at trenches came from this guy here. This is Hugo Bénier for Caltech. He was studying earthquakes in the Pacific, and when representing these earthquakes on a cross-section diagram came up with this, it really is quite a fantastic image.
It still makes me shiver a little bit when I look at this, because what Bénier was actually looking at here was the evidence of a plate being subducted below another plate.
Can you see those little dots? Each of those little dots represents a focus of an earthquake, and those little dots that are at an angle going diagonally across the diagram represent the earthquakes that are being generated.
As a plate is being physically thrust below another, complaining with earthquakes as it goes.
Today we have other ways to image the deep interior of the earth. This image that you can see here was generated by a technique that we call seismic tomography.
The blue area that you can see on this image is the Pacific Plate. This is descending physically below the islands of Tonga.
Can you imagine how much joy this image would have brought to Wagner? The vindication of the idea that the earth is not a static place. It is dynamic. It's continually moving.
This is plate tectonics. This is the grand unifying theory of geology. It explains all the major geological phenomena that we see today and also helps us and myself as a paleontologist to understand changes in the deep geological past as well.
What we know about plate tectonics is that the majority of the activity occurs generally at the plate boundaries, and so what I'd like to do is just go through a quick run through some of the plate boundaries that we get.
First of all, there's a divergent plate boundary. This is the boundary that Hess described where the ocean crust is continually being generated, oozing up. It was described by some people like a wound that's refusing to heal.
Most of them occur underneath the ocean, so they're fairly remote and difficult to see, but there is one area in the world where you can actually go and stand on one, and that's in Iceland.
Iceland has an oceanic ridge, or it's not an oceanic ridge there of course, it's just a spreading ridge, a constructive divergent plate margin running right across it.
So one part of Iceland is moving towards North America, another part of Iceland is moving towards Europe.
Another class of plate are what we call convergent plates, and we have three subclasses here. We can have instances where oceanic plates are meeting oceanic plates, and when that occurs we'll get a process that's called subduction.
This is where one plate is physically pushed below another into the earth. If we have ocean to ocean plate convergence, we'll find that an oceanic volcanic island arc develops above the descending plate due to the heating that's caused in that particular instance.
And you can see that over here. You can see here the Aleutian Islands. This chain of islands is being developed as the Pacific Plate is being pushed below it.
You can see it here in these photographs. Each one of those islands is basically telling you that a plate is being pushed physically below it by the process of subduction.
That process generating melting, the generation of magma, and that arc of volcanoes.
Then we have ocean to continent collision, where we have an oceanic plate meeting a continental plate. One of the first things that will happen when that occurs is a train wreck.
Basically continental rocks aren't as dense as oceanic rocks, so they can't physically be subducted. So the edge of the continent gets rocked up.
Just think of the rocky mountains, or the mountains that run along beside a lot of the major continental areas.
All the mountains that run all the way down here and the mountains into the Andes, all caused by the movement of plates interacting with these continental plate areas.
They're also responsible for these oceanic to continental collisions, particular types of volcanic activity, like the activity we see in the Pacific Northwest.
Mount Baker, Mount St Helens are all generated by the intense forces that are causing subduction in that part of the world.
Then we have continental to continental collision. As I said, continental rocks are less dense than oceanic rocks, so they physically can't really be subducted.
Push down into the earth. They just bob back up again. So when a two continental plates meet, there's only one way for them to go, and that way is up.
We can probably see that most spectacularly here in the Himalaya, which represents a collision, an ongoing collision between India and Asia.
Another form of plate boundary, the transform plate boundary. For those of you who live in California or around San Andreas, this is one you're probably very familiar with.
Here the plates are just sliding past one another. In this part of the world, the North American plate and the Pacific plate are moving past each other, but not smoothly.
It kind of sticks occasionally, builds up pressure and then will give all of a sudden, and that's when we get the earthquakes generated in that part of the world.
So, Wagner has largely been vindicated. Plate tectonics explains so many of the features of the Earth's surface that geocinclinal theory really never could.
It explains the distributions of fossils and rocks. It explains why we find tropical corals and dinosaurs in what are now polar regions.
It explains why we have chains of volcanoes. It explains why we have bands of earthquakes, and it explains why we find mountain chains where they are, all explained by the movement of earthquakes and their interactions.
As I said, plates move very slowly. The Atlantic, for example, is spreading and opening at about the rate that my fingernails are growing.
This is why the concept of deep time is very important to add to our understanding of this.
Over the vast time of deep time that the Earth actually represents, processes that do operate at the speed that fingernails grow can cause mountains to rise or whole ocean basins to be opened up and removed.
Time is all you need.
So, we now have an understanding of an Earth, an Earth as an ancient body because of deep time.
We have an understanding now of the shifting surface of that planet, plate tectonics.
I think now we're probably ready to start to open up a window into Earth's past.
It's time to see if we can interpret those ancient biospheres in the light of all that we've covered so far.
So like with the best stories, let's start right at the beginning.
