The idea that we're going to be exploring in this lecture is molecular biology.
A seemingly innocuous technical name that you might just blow off.
But in fact what it stands for is the idea that life is molecular processes and that's
all that it is.
The idea of molecular biology is that in explaining the molecular processes in living things we
will have explained life itself and as that explanation matures we will be able to synthesize
life out of the ingredients that go into those molecular processes.
When we look at it that way then the idea of molecular biology is an extraordinarily
profound idea and therefore it's one that we really need to explore, see how it emerged
and appreciate the extent to which it is changing the world in which we live and we really know
this as we'll see in a moment that we experience those changes.
On the one hand the idea of molecular biology or the idea that life is reducible to the
interactions of bits of matter is a very old idea.
It goes back, as we have seen in earlier lectures, it goes back to Epicurus and Lucretius in
antiquity, the Greek atomistic philosopher Epicurus who explicitly argued that all living
things are just combinations of atoms and that when the atoms reconfigure themselves
they form either other living things or dead things but that there's nothing more to life
than a peculiar configuration of lifeless atoms.
Of course Epicurus himself was indebted to the earlier Greek atomists, Democritus and
Leukipus and his follower Lucretius in the Roman period made this idea famous in the
Roman world through his epic poem On the Nature of Things in which he incorporated this atomistic
theory of Epicurus.
More recently the idea that life is a matter in motion and no more than that, that there
is nothing special about life that requires some special kinds of laws that are not present
in physics or as we might say in physics and chemistry, goes back to Descartes.
Descartes' mechanical philosophy of nature as we saw is totally committed to the idea
that everything in nature is an expression of matter in motion.
He left out as only one exception the human mind slash soul as something immaterial and
immaterial reality and therefore not subject to the laws of nature, not reducible to matter
in motion but living things he thought all animals were as far as he was concerned, the
expression he used was bet machine.
They were beast machines and therefore they were only machines and he saw no moral ethical
problems involved in for example vivisecting animals in order to understand them because
their screams and cries were really just the kind of thing you would get from a machine
that was poorly lubricated or that you were taking apart and as you tried to wrench a
stuck nut then it made a squealing noise, same thing.
And human beings were machines also, all aspects of the human body, of the processes
within us, respiration, digestion, reproduction, also were ultimately to be explained as matter
in motion, only the mind Descartes thought or he said, maybe he said it to avoid being
condemned as a heretic but he left room for the mind slash soul to exist independently
of this reduction of all of life to matter in motion.
18th century Cartesians were quite often much more rigorous than Descartes and they
began the speculation that the mind too is a product of the peculiar configuration of
matter that makes up the human brain and the nervous system and that the mind too is within
the framework of a mechanical philosophy of nature and we see the first theories of attempting
to correlate the structure of the brain with the mind in the late 18th and early 19th centuries
and in the 19th century this particular theme, the reduction of mind to brain and thus to
matter in motion so that even the mind comes within the purview of this what we now call
the molecular biological theory of life, expressed itself as the neurophysiological studies
where we began to study the nervous system in detail and how it produces the phenomena
that go on in the brain, the creation of the science of experimental psychology, the emergence
in the early 20th century of such schools of psychology as Pavlov's theory of reflex
action and John Watson's invention of behavioral psychology which in its strict sense reduces
mind so that it is within the framework of a mechanistic theory of nature and even Sigmund
Freud who believed that ultimately we would have a scientific theory of psychology which
meant that it would be rigorously materialistic and deterministic but in the absence of such
a theory then he developed his famous techniques in psychoanalysis so this idea even included
the mind by the late 19th and early 20th century meanwhile of course as we saw in the lecture
on the cell theory of life the introduction of the concept of the cell in the 1830s and
the acceptance that the cell was the fundamental unit of life led to the kind of cellular researches
that we talked about which were dominated by biologists who had a mechanistic interpretation
of the cell, the rival vitalistic view that there was something special about life that
was not reducible to physics and chemistry by the end of the 19th century was overwhelmed
by the studies of people we refer to just as Liebig and Hermann Helmholtz and others
who saw in the operation of the cell chemical problems that they saw chemical processes
unfolding and they analyzed these processes in terms of chemicals so that by the end of
the 19th century biology had become pervasively biochemistry that to do research at the most
fundamental into life at the most fundamental level to do research into life at the most
fundamental level was to be doing biochemistry or really to be doing the chemistry of living
things but those chemical reactions were not themselves alive this is a very good illustration
by the way of systems thinking the life is not a does is not to be found in the individual
molecules of that make up the chemical reactions associated with life life is a property of
the system when you put those chemical when you put those molecules together in an appropriate
mutually adapted way so that we understood the structure of the self we understood the
relationships then we would be able to recognize how we could put things together in order to
make life emerge as a system property at the level of the cell at the level of the organism
whatever this finds particularly powerful expression and reinforcement in Emil Fischer's
recognition early in the 20th century in the very beginning of the 20th century that that proteins
and enzymes enzymes are a special class of proteins that proteins and enzymes are nearly
combinations of amino acids that amino acids can be synthesized by any decent chemist in
the laboratory and if you string amino acids together then you get proteins and proteins at
the time were believed to be the fundamental basis of life so the idea that life is reducible
to physics and chemistry is a an old idea in a certain level on the other hand
molecular biology is a relatively new idea that is to say the term itself was only coined in the
late 1930s apparently first used by Warren Weaver who we saw in the lecture on information theory
played a significant role in in the development of biological science and also information
theory oddly enough in the in the United States but as an executive of the Rockefeller Foundation
responsible for giving out grants in biological science in the sciences in the 1930s Weaver
was a very very powerful influence in bringing physics and chemistry into a biological research
in in reinforcing physics and chemistry as the foundations of biological research and he coined
the term molecular biology to refer to the emergence within biological research of what
he saw as the most fundamental and most important feature of biological research namely to understand
the most fundamental biological processes using the concepts and the tools of physics and chemistry
but really molecular biology caught on in a big way only after the DNA period starting in 1953
with the discovery of the the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick one can see that there was a
tremendous increase in the attention that was given to molecular biology this was in the period in
which DNA was initially conceived to be so to speak the king within the life sphere that if we could
only understand DNA we would understand all of life that the DNA molecule was like the ultimate
royal authority dispensing all of the information necessary for an organism to be created
out of a fertilized egg and for all cellular processes to to operate hopefully they operate
correctly in which case the organism is is healthy so the the focus on DNA after 1953
reinforced a development that had been going on literally for centuries since Descartes especially
since the cell theory of life and in particular in the 1920s and 1930s when we see physics and
chemistry moving into biology in a big way and this movement is a very important one to understand
first of all one must i mentioned earlier that by that biology had become invaded and occupied or
if you don't like that language the focus of biological research had a major focus of biological
research by the end of the 19th century was biochemistry but what happened in the early 20th
century was that as quantum theory developed between especially 1912-1913 when Niels Bohr
postulated the quantum theory of of the atom through the the first phase of quantum theory
namely the formulation of quantum mechanics in 1925 even in that 13-year period we see that
in principle a recognition that in principle chemistry has been reduced to physics because
what is it that chemists study they study the interaction of atoms through their orbital
electrons through sharing orbital electrons that's what's responsible for for chemical reactions the
behavior the exchange of electrons between between two atoms is what forms a a molecule so since
quantum theory is about the behavior of orbital electrons in principle only in principle at this
time at that time in the 1920s and 30s and we can say that chemistry exists because quantum theory
is not sophisticated enough and we can't solve the extremely complex equations that quantum
theory would use to describe the actual behavior of multiple atoms interacting in under the conditions
in which chemical molecule molecules form but in principle chemistry has been is reduced to
physics so if biology has been in a certain at a certain level namely at its most fundamental
level reduced to chemistry then it has really been reduced to physics and then the Cartesian notion
that care that life is a form of matter in motion extremely complex motion is resurrected in a much
more sophisticated form within this framework of the intersection of biology physics and chemistry
which was increasingly recognized as such in the 1920s and 30s and what happened in the 1930s
was that physics instruments began to be used by chemists working in biological research so that
ideas of physics especially for example ideas borrowed from quantum physics and thermodynamics
became increasingly used by chemists as they studied biological processes at the molecular level
and these this is another illustration as we saw in an earlier lecture of how instruments matter
and how instruments interact with theory the x-ray crystalline crystallograph a machine that was
invented by physicists in order to use x-rays in order to explore certain concepts in in in
quantum physics and especially was recognized as being capable of revealing the structure of
chemical of atoms and the structure of molecules I'm sorry the relationship of atoms within molecules
in the mid 1920s physicists used the x-ray crystallographic techniques that would develop the
machines the hardware that was developed in order to study certain ideas in quantum theory
but the fact that x-ray crystallography could reveal structure which we now appreciate emerged
out of the 19th century as the key to understanding complex chemical reactions made chemists
want to apply x-ray crystallography within the study of molecular biological processes
understand the molecules by understanding their structure using x-ray crystallography
at the same time a physicist in sweden named Theo Svedberg invented a machine called the
ultra centrifuge which spins very very rapidly 100,000 rpm 200,000 rpm 300,000 rpm
Svedberg invented this machine in 1924 by 1926 he was using it to generate data and using it in
order to study the question of whether there were such things as very long molecules or whether
all molecules even the ones that seemed very long were really patched together out of little unit
smaller molecules that were linked together with weak bonds which is what most chemists
had thought at the time a chemist named Stottinger had argued that there were such things as
macromolecules very large molecules containing thousands and tens of thousands of and even
hundreds of thousands of atoms and that they were rigid that they had an integrity the macromolecule
was in fact a unit it wasn't just a built up out of lots of pieces like beads strung on a string
and where each bead was a relatively small molecule maybe of a couple of hundred atoms
that was the prevailing view and Svedberg's machine was able to show very quickly that in fact
macromolecules were real that there were such entities as macromolecules however it turns out
through the work of a German chemist named Hermann Mark who extended Stottinger's ideas
and showed that in fact the macromolecules are flexible they're not rigid the way that
the way that Stottinger thought they were starting to maybe overemphasize the rigidity in order to
in order to emphasize the integrity of the macromolecule that it had an integrity of its own
independent of the units out of which it was built up and Mark became one of the pioneers of
polymer chemistry extremely famous as a polymer chemist using the techniques of x-ray crystallography
and the ultracent refuge etc and and founding the discipline called polymer chemistry out of
which almost every plastics that we've got that we use emerges so an extremely important theory
in 1930 a young Linus Pauling visited Hermann Mark's laboratory Pauling was one of the first
to recognize and to emphasize the centrality of quantum theory to chemistry and in 1940 his
textbook on the on the nature of the chemical bond essentially established the rules for
using quantum theory in order to understand chemical chemical bonding so in 1930 Pauling
visited Mark's laboratory not long before Mark had to flee Nazi Germany and came and resettled
here in the United States and Pauling was deeply impressed by the way Mark was Mark's laboratory
used these instruments from physics x-ray crystallography for example and the ultracent
refuge and and when he came back to the United States Pauling became a kind of a machine for
generating grants to the Rockefeller Foundation for to buy these kinds of instruments in order
to do biological research through chemistry using these instruments from physics and of course
guided by his understanding of of quantum theory the man he had to get the money from
was Warren Weaver Weaver was deeply committed to getting physics into biological research and he
funded lots of laboratories around the United States to acquire these instruments plus the
newly invented after Pauling visited Mark in 1931 the electron microscope was first introduced
and getting electron microscopes into the hands of American biological researchers to getting x-ray
crystallography machines getting ultracent refuges as well as other techniques such as electrophoresis
and comatography which I'm not going to discuss which are the core techniques that were used in
order to understand in order to study the molecules and the molecular processes that are fundamental
to life phenomena and and Pauling succeeded well Weaver himself had a deep commitment to the
ultracentrifuge having given Svedberg the Svedberg a quarter of a million dollars to to create an
ultracentrifuge institute at his university in Sweden and and the return to America for that
quarter of a million dollars was that Svedberg not only gave to the Princeton biology department
of the latest model ultracentrifuge but kept them up to date as the machine kept being improved in
order for Princeton to be able to have a department that was at the cutting edge of biological research
as Weaver conceived what that research ought to be like now the an illustration of of how
chemists using these techniques from physics instruments from physics moved into biology in
important ways is reflected in for example the work of a very excellent woman biologist Dorothy
Crowfoot Hodgkins not associated with Hodgkin's disease that who who used x-ray crystallographic
technique in the early 1940s to discover the structure of penicillin she worked out the complete
molecular structure of the penicillin molecule then she worked out the complete molecular structure
of vitamin b12 which is what she wound up getting a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for
meanwhile Linus Pauling who was supported by grants from 1937 to 1951 in this area
and and funded his focused his research on using these physics techniques instruments
and concepts in his biochemical research made fundamental contributions to what Weaver had
called molecular biology in the early 1940s Pauling showed that the relationship between
antigens and antibodies between the antibodies created by our immune system and antigens that
enter into the bloodstream from outside the body that these out that this is a structural process
that that the relationship between antigen and antibody is a structural one the molecules lock
on to one another there is an issue here of molecular recognition how is it that an antibody
recognizes an antigen that it is capable of destroying how does that happen well Pauling
showed that this was a structural feature Emil Fisher I had said in an earlier lecture had
developed this idea of lock and key relationships between molecules that the antigen molecule the
antibody molecule are like a lock and a key the ones that fit together are the ones that act on
one another antibodies can destroy those antigens that they can lock on to so here we see a structure
feature that is fundamental to a fundamental life process so this is a clear example of how
molecular analysis in this case molecular structure is that a biological problem reduces to
a molecular biological problem which reduces to a problem in chemical structure and of course this
was made it is possible to analyze this through the use of the x-ray crystalline graph and other
techniques which chemists developed in many cases borrowing ideas and concepts and instruments from
the physics community in the late 1940s Pauling showed that sickle cell anemia is the result of a
of a structural deformation of red blood cells in which the electric charge is not uniformly
distributed around the red blood cell so instead of being disc shaped it's puckered or elongated
and this causes problems in the circulatory system because sometimes these cells cannot fit through
the capillaries and so the the tissues in the body are not sufficiently oxygenated they're not
getting enough oxygen Pauling showed that that this that this sickle cell anemia a very a very
important and debilitating illness is caused by a change in one amino acid in one particular
protein which we would say is produced by a particular gene so the gene misreads the gene
causes one particular protein in a long amino acid in a long chain for the protein that is
responsible for the shape of the red blood cell to to be out of order and as a result of we see
that the that these the red blood cell is misshapen and that's what that's what causes the disease
and nowadays we think that this was only partially true but that was a another powerful illustration
of how physics and chemistry are are are are are the linchpins of biological research then of
course Pauling at the beginning of the 1950s and 1951 went on to discover the alpha helix structure
the single-sanded single-stranded alpha helix structure of RNA molecules looking for the nucleic
acid that ever since Frederick Misher back in somewhere around the 1870s had I had suggested
that there was a nucleic acid there was an acid in the nucleus that was important for reproduction
for cell division and reproduction Pauling first picked on RNA and showed and used x-ray
crystallography to find the the structure of RNA as the alpha helix and was now studying DNA
when he was scooped by Watson and Crick in 1953 when they discovered using the x-ray crystallographic
data of of Rosalind Franklin and her collaborators were able to interpret that data and understand
that the data were telling us that the that the DNA molecule had a double helical structure
and in 1957 the last doubters as to whether DNA was really what we mean by a gene what or that
the genes what we mean by the genes are somehow in or on the DNA molecule were more or less
convinced by a beautiful experiment by two biologists named Meselson and Stahl who showed
that indeed they were able to show how the DNA molecule replicate replicates at which was
as speculated by Watson and Crick in 1953 that the two strands separate from one another they
sort of unzip in a systematic way they unzip and as they do so each strand forms a complementary
strand and then you now have two DNA molecules two double helixes and this process of course goes on
at every at every stage at which the DNA molecule reproduces so the the Meselson Stahl Meselson
Stahl experiment of 1957 really I think locked up the idea that DNA is the molecule to understand
and if you could understand that molecule you will understand life I think that the dominance
of molecular biology since the 1960s in biological research must be understood in relationship to
this reaction to the discovery of the structure of DNA we see that there's a long history leading
up to this it wasn't that all of a sudden in the 1950s and 60s people were saying that you know what
life is just a matter of matter in motion or that life can be explained at the level of of
physics and chemistry there is a long history here which I've give I've attempted to to give a
little bit of a a clue to in 1912 Jacques Loeb had written a book called the mechanical
conception of life that had a very strong influence on many biological and psychological
researchers Loeb being a very strict reductionist reducing life to physics and chemistry and that
idea continued to be influential long before the 1950s but what happened and especially from
since 1972 when Paul Berg and his collaborators introduced the the first successful recombinant
DNA techniques in which they took genes from a virus and a bacterium and and and couple them in a
functional way that that really unleashed the biotechnology industry which over the last
a few decades has fundamentally changed medicine and therefore is fundamentally affecting us and
will be even more fundamentally affecting us barring some calamitous implosion of western
civilization over the coming decades because of the continually growing understanding of the way that
molecules function the way that processes in the in the cell and in organs and and in organisms
interact in the way in ways that can be understood once we get down to the molecular level now of
course nowadays molecular biology is such a buzzword that if you if your result research is not in
molecular biology then that's bad so lots of research that is not in biology that is not
really within the framework of molecular biology as strictly understood is called that anyway and
and a number of biology departments at universities and colleges across the country
have renamed themselves to be the department of molecular biology or at a minimum have one of their
one of one of the uh uh a curricula that you can follow within the biological science department
would be a program attract in molecular biology that's practically a sine qua non nowadays to be
recognized as having a modern biology department the the the the impact of molecular biology on us
is much deeper than i think most of us realize when you when you start putting together all the
different ways in in which it has influenced the practice of of medicine we have molecular medicine
is the norm we have an increasing number of medications that are derived from the techniques
of manipulating of manipulating molecules at the level of the cell or lower or manipulating
dna so for example using bacteria that have been genetically altered to produce insulin
that that was in 1982 the food and drug administration approved the commercial production
of insulin using bacteria um genetically altered bacteria in in 1982 we are we have now a wide
range of human hormones that are produced by uh by bacteria and we have also learned in 1980
in 1980 the first transgenic plants and animals were created in which uh in which uh uh plants
and animals were genetically modified by by putting plants from one species together with
another in order to produce specific effects or to introduce viruses or bacteria bacterial
genes of a particular sort into plants and animals in order to improve the properties of the of the
plant as a whole so the whole genetically modified food industry and and in the case of transgenic
animals using animals to explore diseases especially human diseases much more accurately
by using animals to carry the disease or by using animals to produce substances that that that human
beings need and that previously had been synthesized in more in more expensive or complicated ways or
could not be successfully synthesized but now are produced by these animals because genes have been
inserted in them to allow them to do that so there are just so many ways in which besides the promise
of genetic engineering and stem cell research which are largely unfilled yet i mean almost totally
unfilled yet we do we have not been able to in a systematic way genetically engineer our bodies
so that they function better but we are clearly on track to to do that and the same thing is true
with the the potential impact of stem cell research if we can use these techniques in order to produce
tissues and organs in order to replace ones that are that have failed or that are in the process
of failing so molecular biology is an idea who's uh that that just stated from antiquity through the
17th century and has become a major transformational idea in the late 20th and now early 21st century
