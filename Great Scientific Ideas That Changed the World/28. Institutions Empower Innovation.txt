What we're trying to shed light on here is the emergence of techno science in the, especially
in the second half of the 19th century and increasingly in the 20th century as a force
in society, and in particular a force that has changed our lives by channeling, selectively
channeling scientific knowledge into society through technological innovations.
The American polymath, Herbert Simon, who is sometimes described as an economist in
part because he won the Nobel Memorial Award in Economics, but was more an organizational
theorist and contributed significantly to the mathematical theory of decision making
and also to artificial intelligence research, Herbert Simon in one of his books called The
Science of the Artificial, makes the comment that a plowed field is as artificial as a
highway, and that's correct, and it's a very powerful and interesting insight, especially
in the context of sometimes extreme environmental criticism of technology, a plowed field is
as unnatural as a highway is, as a computer is for that matter, but nevertheless, I have
tried in the previous lecture to suggest that something qualitative happened to technology
in the 19th century, that technology became qualitatively different, it became decisively
more artificial. Innovations were not now improving what existed already, not now enhancing
natural powers such as water power and wind power, but were introducing things that never
existed and never could exist, except through the insights that knowledge gave us to ways
that nature could be manipulated, so that I think that there is a profound qualitative
difference between the shop mechanical or optical telegraph and Marconi's radio waves.
It is true that both of them are artificial, but I think that that can blur a very important
distinction, and what I want to do in this lecture is focus on how it came to be that
techno science has become such a powerful force in driving social change. Invention
is episodic, you cannot so to speak rely on invention, if what you're concerned with,
if you're responding to invention as a source of power and prosperity, invention is episodic,
and individual entrepreneurship is much too opportunistic and self-centered to be an engine
of social change, of growth in wealth and in physical, political and military power,
that we associate with techno science. So what happened in the 19th century was not
just that there were lots of inventions at the tail end, the last half of the 18th century
and throughout the 19th century, not just that knowledge had reached the point where
we could use that knowledge to control nature in ways that had not been imagined in the
preceding centuries. What happened was that suddenly there was a perception that invention
and knowledge could be coupled in ways that would provide a true engine of growth, economic
growth for example, let's just focus on that. This perception is perhaps more important
than the individual inventions that provoked it. I'm thinking for example of Adam Smith's
The Wealth of Nations published in 1776, which in effect makes the argument, which makes
it seem almost obvious that economic prosperity is keyed to the most efficient implementation
of the new technologies of production that are being introduced initially in England
and then spread throughout the world. There was for decades in this country an ongoing
debate which began between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton on whether America
should be industrialized or whether it should be a fundamentally agricultural society. Jefferson
distrusted urbanization and industry, whereas Hamilton championed what were called manufacturers
and that the government needed to implement policies in order to encourage the growth
of the manufacturing industry here in the United States. For obvious reasons, the British
wanted to maintain a monopoly on these new technologies and to use the United States
even after independence as a source of raw material, import cotton for example from
the United States and then do all of the work on the cotton that added value to it in England
and then sell it as high priced finished goods back to the United States and to everybody
else that wanted to buy or that they could get to buy British cotton goods and the same
thing with woolen goods. What Hamilton argued was that the United States government needed
to introduce policies, obviously tariff is one of the first things you think of in this
connection, that encouraged people to develop industry here in the United States. Now this
debate lasted much longer than Jefferson and Hamilton's personal lives lasted and in
fact the South in the United States, the southern part of the United States through the Civil
War era right through the 19th century resisted the idea that its economy ought to be based
on industry rather than on agriculture and especially being key to cotton and tobacco
and in fact it was according to many historians, it was the disproportionate industrialization
of the North versus the South that made the outcome of the Civil War almost inevitable,
extraordinarily tragic and painful but almost inevitable. The idea that your economy should
be based on technology and industry is not an obvious one and it is not one that's a
no brainer, you do have to make a deliberate decision to do that and what made techno science
powerful was the recognition that we already see reflected in Adam Smith's book, Wealth
of Nations that we see reflected in Alexander Hamilton's report on manufacturers to the
U.S. Congress early in the life of the Republic and throughout the 19th century, ongoing recognition
that something new was happening in society and that in order to be able to get the maximum
benefit out of it, we had to create institutions that would encourage technological innovation,
that would encourage knowledge based innovation and channel that into society so we needed
to reform educational institutions, we needed to reform business institutions, we needed
to reform government institutions and in particular the relationship between government
and business and educational institutions which sounds like low on the totem pole but
it turns out that reforming educational institutions to make them congenial homes so to speak to
techno science is a critical factor in making techno science the kind of force that it
became in the 19th century and continues to be today. The French Revolution among its
many destructive activities, one of the constructive things that they did, one of a number of constructive
things that they did was the creation of the Ecole Polytechnique which is the first modern
engineering school that is to say it is the first engineering school that continues to
exist and very, very, very prominent in French civil affairs, an extraordinary number of
politically influential individuals who have been graduates of the Ecole Polytechnique.
I mentioned Henri Becquerel in the last lecture, he graduated the Ecole as his father did before
him and as his grandfather did before his father. The Ecole Polytechnique was created
in the 1790s to be the first engineering school in which the curriculum was based on mathematics
and physics and secondarily chemistry but especially mathematics and physics and the
laboratory and experimentation as opposed to what? As opposed to basing engineering education
on machine shop, apprenticeship and field experience, sea to the pants, learning how
to be a civil engineer by working on canals and building bridges and seeing how the masters
worked and acquiring that knowledge. This became a contentious debate throughout the
19th century in educational circles whether engineering education should be based on the
machine shop, apprenticeship and field experience or whether it should be based on book learning,
whether it should be based on mathematics and physics and chemistry and laboratory work
and experimentation but virtually no practical experience. Those are not necessarily exclusive
of one another but in fact that's the way it turned out. Now interestingly the British
who started the Industrial Revolution and who dominated the Industrial Revolution throughout
the 19th century beginning to lose way to Germany in the last third of the 19th century
and decisively so and then to America didn't buy into this educational reform largely for
social status reasons, did not accept the idea that engineering could be professionalized
that it was worthy so to speak of being considered a university education. Technical schools yes
but not really incorporated into the university curriculum. In fact it was great resistance
in England and the United States among our most elite institutions like Harvard and Yale
even to having degrees in science, degrees in physics for example and for decades Harvard
and Yale resisted bequest to create schools or colleges of science within the university
because it was felt that that was not consistent with what we understood a university education
to be but Germany especially and the United States eventually bought into this model in
England for example one of the, I mentioned one of the students of J.J. Thomson the man
who discovered the electron was Ernst Rutherford another one of his students was Francis Aston
who won the Nobel Prize for inventing the mass spectrometer working under J.J. Thomson
which was a very important scientific instrument for separating elements of different molecular
weight and separating and being able to study their properties. Thomson was supposed to
have been an engineer but in England at the time at the turn of the 20th century you had
to be an apprentice to become an engineer and his parents couldn't afford the fees for him to
become an, to be an apprentice to an engineer and he got a scholarship to go to college so he
went to college and studied chemistry and physics and eventually made physics his career and that
became the basis for his Nobel Prize. So this idea of educational reform is very important and
let me show you why it's important in the United States there was before the Civil War there was
almost no engineering education to speak of there were only a half a dozen institutions at any
given time that gave degrees in engineering significantly however beginning with West
Point at the very end of the of the 18th and beginning of 19th century West Point from the
beginning adopted the a cold politic model that engineering in America the military engineering
would be based on on mathematics and science and the laboratory there would be field work as
well but the core curriculum was mathematics physics and and laboratory work that knowledge was
the basis of engineering and the most American institutions most American engineering institutions
adopted this particular model and in 1862 in the middle of the war the the United States Congress
passed the Merrill Land Grant Act an act which had come before Congress several times in the 1850s
and had been and had been defeated largely by by Southern congressmen now that the Southern
congressmen were not there the Congress passed the Merrill Land Grant Act which among other things
gave states who created engineering colleges very substantial financial incentives especially
they gave them very large tracts of federally owned land as a gift if they would create a land
so-called land grant colleges and what's in at that time there were only six institutions in the
United States that gave degrees in engineering by the end of the century there were over a hundred
and what we have to think of is that this is an extraordinary phenomenon the United States the
number of engineers in the United States in 1860 is sometimes estimated to be somewhere between
one and three thousand between a thousand and three thousand people who made their livings as
engineers in the United States I incline more to the lower figure but it doesn't matter by the end
of the century you have tens of thousands of students enrolled in engineering colleges in the
United States this is a social phenomenon we have to ask well what's happening here and the pressure
to build more engineering colleges which continued into the 20th century so that the number eventually
doubled in the early 20th century that this is this this is now a social phenomenon what is
happening here what are these why are so many people going to study engineering well two things
have to happen first of all the institutions have to be created to allow them to study engineering
the means have to be available in order to study engineering so if you're going to have all of
those tens of thousands of students studying math and science and chemistry and laboratories you need
thousands of mathematicians physicists and chemists and and in order to give those courses to those
engineers but if you do that then you are de facto creating a community of people who make a living
doing mathematics doing physics doing chemistry and they have their own agendas in other words as
physicists they want to do physics they have to teach they have to teach engineering students
but they also have to teach the next generation of people who will teach physics to the engineering
students so inadvertently so to speak the community of research scientists in the United States grew
in parallel with at a slower rate grew in parallel with the enormous increase in the number of
engineers in the United States the number of engineers in the United States doubled every decade
from 1860 to 1960 after which the rate of increase slowed down but by the end of the 1980s
there were millions of engineers in America and it was the single largest profession for males
in the in the United States that is a significant social phenomenon and we have to see and we see
immediately what the answer is the reason why there was this tremendous increase in engineering
enrollment is because industry needed those people they needed engineers who had the mathematical
and the scientific and the laboratory experience in order to produce to build the factories
to operate the factories to produce the machinery and the innovations that would channel inventions
into into society that would support the the electrical appliance industry the generation
and distribution of electricity that would that would support radio and the aircraft industry
and the automobile industry etc it is it is it is the industrial reform the transformation of
industry in especially in the second half of the 19th century that pulled educational reform so
it's not one thing leading to the other there's a complex reciprocal relationship between the two
educational institution reform and and and reform of business and industry institutions
went uh went hand in hand the new kinds of technologies especially mass production technologies
that were introduced through such people as James Hargreaves and Richard Arkwright those
technologies of mass production led to new kinds of business models in the 19th century and those
new kinds of business models increased the scale of industry tremendously but made the
industry's new scale critically dependent on new technologies new technologies especially
for example of steam power and electricity and those new technologies required different kinds
of skills and knowledge than water and wind powered technologies required so there's a
positive feedback relationship between educational institution reform and and and business reform
i had referred earlier to the resistance of the american south to uh to industrialization
as the key to their economy because after all as the economy goes so goes the society you
can't change the economic you can't change the economic basis of the of a society without
changing the social relationships as well so if you shift from an agricultural society based on
tobacco and cotton primarily to an industrial society you change the nature of society the
people who are big in one at one era may not be big in the other era they may not be they may not
be prominent they may not be successful in the industrial era especially if they had inherited
the plantations that they that they operated now an example of this southern resistance is the
creation of the georgia institute of technology at the end of the 19th century where the uh the
there were advocates for creating it based on the a co-politique model as it had evolved
throughout the 19th century so based on math physics etc and then others were saying no if
you do this you're gonna you're gonna sneak in a kind of a trojan horse into southern culture
of of individuals who are going to be reinforcing industry in the south and we would we prefer
the machine shop apprenticeship of field work model and this was a battle that was actually
was a social and political battle that was fought over the creation of the georgia institute of
technology which initially was based on a modified version of the machine shop model
and then eventually flipped over to the scientific basis for engineering education
in the in the early 20th century schools like mit and the massachusetts institute of technology
and the california institute of technology which which was the new name for the through
through college of technology earlier in the 20th century were from the beginning based on
intense science training for engineers and along the way developing scientific research
departments of physics chemistry mathematics in which research was the order of the day
this idea that that the goal of the university is to generate new knowledge is a 19th century idea
the medieval university transmitted ancient knowledge but the new in the 19th century especially
at the end of the 19th century beginning i believe in with the a co-politique technique
then developed very strongly by the by german by the german institutions especially after
unification in 1865 and the creation of government funded research institutions
and then at the end of the 19th century in america the expectation that faculty at a university
will create new knowledge and that that's what so to speak their jobs are dependent on the whole
concept of publish or perish goes back in some simplistic sense to the 1890s with the creation
of the university of chicago where the expectation was that faculty will do research publish new
knowledge and that will be the basis of their uh their professional evaluation now the new business
models that pulled educational reform in this area creating whole new communities of scientists
mathematicians and and engineers um began to manifest themselves very early in the 19th century
frances lowell uh somewhere in the period 1810 to 1815 got the idea of building an integrated
factory in which raw material would come in one end for example cotton raw cotton would come in
one end and finished talico cloth would go out the would go out the other end and all of the
operations necessary for transforming the raw material into finished goods would take place
within the factory and he saw this as having tremendous advantages over the existing system
in which was so-called putting out system in which the raw cotton went to one group of workers who
cleaned it another group of workers somewhere else it was moved to who did the who did the
carding and another group of workers who did the spinning and another group of workers who did the
weaving and others who did the dying etc all of that would be done within the factory and there
would be tremendous efficiencies lowell thought now he died before the full realization of his of
his vision which uh and and he did not have any technical knowledge but he was he was gifted
in the know-how area uh led to the transformation of the merrimack river valley in the united
states into a major sentence set a major center of technology of textile production and uh and
technological innovation which became increasingly scientific as the factories needed to compete
and they had to push their costs down now the genius of the integrated factory is not immediately
obvious common sense suggests oh of course what a wonderful idea why didn't anyone think of this
before as a matter of fact the british using the old-fashioned putting out system which seems
hopelessly inefficient and time-consuming were able to sell calico cloth in the united states
with transportation for less than lowell's costs with the integrated fact the lowell mill cost with
with with the integrated factory and so the united states government yielded to political
pressure lobbying and put a tariff on the british cloth in order to give the american industry a
chance to develop the real genius of the integrated factory as was pointed out by the anglo-american
economist ronald koz and he got the Nobel prize in part for this economic law a law theorist and
economist koz pointed out that the genius of the integrated firm is that it reduces transaction costs
all of the costs associated with each different task that needs to be performed is a transaction
when time is valuable then the transaction costs become critical if time is valuable
then reducing transaction costs consistent with reducing time becomes a justification for the
integrated firm this has a whole different the integrated firm has a whole different character
it changed the economy dramatically instead of having lots of workers working primarily in their
home doing specific kinds of tasks on a piecework basis overwhelmingly the economy shifted to people
being employees in factories of larger and larger size because as these larger businesses
competed with one another costs needed to be driven down in order to retain profitability
and again in order to do that new inventions were necessary in technological innovation became
increasingly incorporated into the fabric of the economy we became increasingly dependent
on the innovation in order for businesses to be able to succeed in order to create new businesses
with the profits from the old businesses and and and this is this represents a kind of an addiction
an economic addiction no growth a society collapses the source of growth is per is is embedded in
these this process of technological innovation increasingly keyed increasingly keyed to scientific
knowledge the ability to use scientific knowledge and and inventions to create innovations to create
new kinds of products new kinds of products and services the next stage of development
of of the low vision of an integrated factory was the swift meatpacking company
which pioneered the modern industrial cooperation as a whole new kind of business that was vertically
integrated centrally administered and hierarchically organized something that was only possible
because the telegraph and the telephone were available so that managers who were in a central
headquarters could control what was going on in the various divisions which had presidents and
underneath the pred divisions there were subdivisions with all the way down to the factory floor
where there was a foreman so you had this military style managerial hierarchy and and these factories
the meatpacking company became hierarchy became vertically integrated in order to protect himself
protect himself against competitors swift got this initial idea which is relatively simple
you have all of these herds of beef out in the out in the west and they're collected in a couple
of cities like Sioux City in Chicago and but most of the population lives on the east coast
so if you ship these animals to the east coast to be slaughtered by local butcher shops that is
a major expense wouldn't it be nice if we could slaughter the animals right there where the animals
are collected for example Chicago major rail terminus we slaughter them there and then we ship
the finished beef to the butchers and we will get uh we'll be able to benefit because we're
shipping a finished good not a raw material well how can you do that the meat will spoil well we
can refrigerate it the whole concept of a refrigerated railroad car made sense after the
civil war because now for one thing we have a national transcontinental railroad which
was completed in 1869 and and swift got the idea of getting a box car that was refrigerated that
would keep the meat fresh until it reached the butcher shops of the east coast this turned out
to be more complicated than he thought but eventually he did subsidize the construction of
a small group of i think his initial order was for six rail cars that were mechanically
refrigerated they started off with ice that turned out to be a real problem but then fortunately for
him mechanical refrigeration was invented and the box cars became mechanically refrigerated
and and and and he started slaughtering animals in the uh in in chicago and shipping the dressed meat
to uh to the east coast but once you've invested so much in in rail cars you've got to have a
scale of business to get that investment back you can't just slaughter 10 cows or 100 cows a day
you have to slaughter large numbers of cows your competitors in order to compete against you may
try to interfere with your supply of cows so he bought up whole herds of cows and slaughtered them
so now he's got to sell huge quantities of meat of beef in order to keep the thing together you
also dealt with lambs and pigs i don't want to pick out cows single out cows uh when he gets to
the east coast the butchers don't want to buy his dressed beef they make their money from slaughtering
animals and selling the dressed beef at a at a much higher profit markup than they can get if
they sell his already dressed beef so he winds up having to open up his own chain of butcher stores
open up his own chain of butcher stores he has to start using the new mass circulation newspapers
to advertise to let people know that his meat is there and he's got to be able to prove that
it's fresh because his competitors are saying this meat is spoiled it's traveled all the way from
chicago or even worse from susa city iowa when you have whole herds being slaughtered you have
huge quantities of hides and hooves and horns and internal organs that you can't otherwise use so
you get into the dog food business you get into the leather business you get into the glue business
and so this swift actually pioneer i mean it sounds odd meat packing it was conceptually the highest
technology business of the late 19th century and it was immediately perceived by the great
entrepreneur entrepreneurs of the period to be the definitive model for creating a and a
brutally competitive machine that the model of the business was itself the the was itself the
machine and so we see the formation of companies like united states steel and dupont and west
and west and dupont was older but reorganized in the early 20th century and and westinghouse
and general electric and soon there and ford and general motors ford after all in the 1920s built
the river rouge plant which was an extreme example of raw materials come in the front door raw materials
like iron ore and and rubber raw rubber and and and materials for glass and outcomes completed
for automobiles it was probably the only fully integrated truly fully integrated automobile
plant that was ever made they made the glass inside they made the tires inside and and they
and they smelted the ore inside so the this model became crucial to american business and it meant
a tremendous consolidation and increase in the size of the business and as a result and and so
you can see how this pulls how this pulls educational institution reform in order to create
the millions of engineers that industry needs in order to keep this flow going the government
gets involved increasingly in world war one and then and then in world war two especially because
all of a sudden it becomes inescapable in spite of the resistance in the military that that science
and technology are critical to military power and science played a major role in world war one but
incomparably greater role in world war two uh vanavar bush is i think the correct pronunciation
is venevar but i'm gonna stick with vanavar uh vanavar bush and who had been the head of the
office of scientific research and development throughout world war two uh masterminding and
organizing the various projects that led to radar and atomic bomb and cheap penicillin
wrote a report in 1945 delivered to president truman that became the pattern for american
feedback governmental feedback into educational system reform and uh and industrial form reform
by federal subsidy of of of research and uh and development uh to the to the tune of tens of billions
of dollars eventually so these are the kinds of institutional reforms that made it possible for
techno science to become the driver of social ed change that it became
