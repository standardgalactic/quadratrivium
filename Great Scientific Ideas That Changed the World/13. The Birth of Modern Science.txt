The subject of this lecture is the invention of modern science.
So we've arrived at the 17th century, which is the locus of what is usually called the
scientific revolution, but I certainly hope that at this point we recognize that the emergence
of modern science, the recognizable emergence of modern science in the 17th century, was
much more of an evolutionary phenomenon than a revolutionary phenomenon.
It was not necessary that the scientific revolution emerged in the 17th century, as
far as anyone can tell.
It was not inevitable and had not been predicted, probably was not predictable, given the fact
that we might have predicted it in the late Roman Empire or in the 14th century.
It was not predictable that it would happen just then or in Western Europe.
But nevertheless, modern science clearly did not just drop down out of the sky, like some
deus ex machina in a Greek play, that modern science did not just suddenly appear out of
nowhere.
Once it appeared, we can see that it represents the integration, the synthesis of a lot of
pieces that had been around from the time of ancient Greece and Rome through the medieval
period, especially with the university context that I described, and all of the dynamism
of the Renaissance that we discussed in the previous lecture.
So that the pieces were all there, what happened in the 17th century is that a glue was added
to hold all of those pieces together, and that glue seems to be the idea of method.
And so there is in fact this, well, a typical characterization of the rise of modern science
is that it is the result of the discovery or invention of the scientific method.
And once people grasp the scientific method, then all of a sudden all of the available
tools came together in a way that generated the theories characteristic of the rise of
modern science, especially the work of people like Descartes and Galileo and Christian Huygens
or Huygens and Holland and Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, and then we march into
the 18th century, the 19th, 20th, and here we are, the heirs of the riches generated
by the scientific method.
Now I'm going to suggest that while in fact method was a critical factor in pulling together
all the pre-existing pieces that contribute to modern science, the Greek idea of knowledge,
the Greek idea of knowledge of nature, the Greek idea of mathematics being the language
of nature, the idea of techno-science as it arose in the Greco-Roman period, the medieval
university with its sort of revival of Greek and Roman natural philosophy with the focus
on experimentation, on the use of mathematics to describe natural phenomena, and with its
deep commitment to the idea that nature was a closed system and that all natural phenomena
had natural rather than supernatural explanations, and then the renaissance with its recovery
of ancient learning, especially the great mathematical texts of classical antiquity
which allowed European mathematics not to have to reinvent the number as it were, but
by inheriting Greek mathematics and Islamic algebraic mathematics that 16th century European
mathematicians were able to start from already a pretty high level and then that emerged
in the 17th century as an enormous flourishing of mathematics, providing tools for people
to apply mathematics to natural phenomena.
All of these pieces, not to mention the technology of the renaissance that I described two lectures
ago, all of that represent the pieces that I'm talking about, and method is the glue.
However, I think that the crucial thing to recognize is that there is no such thing as
the scientific method.
Method was central to 17th century natural philosophy that sort of morphed into what
we recognize as modern science, but there was no one method that all of the founders
of modern science used.
What is interesting and important is that a sensitivity to methodological issues was
the common denominator of the founders of modern science, and that's very consistent
with the focus that I've made since the beginning of this course on the idea of knowledge as
being central to the idea of science and now to the idea of modern science.
What the founders of modern science, the people that all historians point to as the founding
figures in modern science, what all of them were concerned about was this idea of knowledge
of nature, and the problem that we saw that Aristotle recognized, that the medieval university
recognized in the problem of universals, how can we have universal necessary and certain
knowledge of nature if our only access to nature is experience, and experience is particular
concrete and continually changing.
That becomes an explicit and self-conscious issue that the founders of modern science
wrestled with even as they insisted that as a matter of fact it was possible to have knowledge
of nature understanding now that it was what was behind experience, and this could not
have emerged without the recognition that science is, that what they were doing was
building on what the predecessors had done.
It was not only, it was not a fluke that Copernicus, for example, is perceived as one of the
leading contributors to the origin of modern science.
His idea of a moving earth was very important to the mindset of modern science, 1543, that's
16th century, that's not the 17th century revolution, scientific revolution, well but
you say it's not very precise, there were of course some outliers, but it wasn't a matter
of outliers, in the same year 1543, Andres Vesalius at that time in Padua, at the University
of Padua, transformed the study of human anatomy by publishing the first what we would call
scientific anatomy of the human body with beautiful illustrations and systematically
disassembling the human body from the skin down to the skeleton and revealing the entire
structure of the human body, this Vesalius who soon left the University of Padua because
of the fame that he accrued, initiated a line of inquiry and research at the University
of Padua that went on for at least a century or more because William Harvey of the British
physician who we give credit to for discovering the full circulation of the blood being pumped
around by the heart, or they didn't use exactly that language, in 1628, his book then he had
studied at the University of Padua, he specifically went to the University of Padua because that
was a place that was famous for what we would call scientific medical research and Vesalius's
students and their students made fundamental discoveries, in the period of 1543 on there
was an enormous growth in the body of biological and botanical, let's call it information,
I don't want to use the word knowledge loosely having made such a fuss about it, so the founders
of modern science were inheriting a great deal, they were building on a great deal to
call it a revolution, it's fundamentally misleading because it makes light of, it's as if well
we have to start all over again, and that's not the case, it was an evolution in which
a focus, a sensitivity to method and the idea of knowledge played a key role in allowing
people to integrate all of these pieces that were sort of ready, well maybe ready is unfair,
they were available, they were lying around so to speak, and could be pulled together
and were pulled together by the people who founded modern science, and so who are these
people and what were they doing? Well one of the standard figures to point to is Frances
Bacon, Frances Bacon is often called, especially by the British, the father of experimental
science or the father of the experimental method, Bacon was a lawyer by training and
eventually rose to become the position that we would call United States Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court in the court of King James, and from political intrigue he was
accused of corruption and was removed from office, although subsequently the penalty
was abated, it was a very substantial financial penalty, and that was just so to speak his
day job, his real vocation was he was a social and educational reformer as I mentioned before,
and in the area of what made him famous in science was his tremendous emphasis, I would
say his dedication to the idea that knowledge of nature was the key to social reform, and
in order to get knowledge of nature you needed to disseminate knowledge of science and technology
broadly in the British population, and that that would be the only reliable platform for
prosperity and security for Britain in the future. Now in order to do that Bacon claimed
we needed to reform the approach to the study of nature, that people had failed to generate
the kind of knowledge of nature that could give us power over nature, that could give
us control of natural phenomena, that would allow us to generate wealth and military power
for example, because they were still mired in the history of science and technology,
and incorrect ways of thinking, and so Bacon wrote a book, a short book called the New
Organon, Aristotle's logical texts focusing on deduction were called the Organon, which
means something like the instrument for reasoning, so it's an instrument for logic, it's an
instrument for reasoning, Bacon wrote a book called the New Organon, the New Instrument
for Reasoning, and in this book he argues very strongly that acquiring knowledge of
nature is really not that difficult, or it would not be as difficult as it seems to be,
you do not need geniuses to do it, if only you could control the imaginative and speculative
characteristics of the human mind, that the human mind is the single greatest obstacle
to acquiring knowledge of nature, as well as of course the only means we have available
to acquiring knowledge of nature, so what can we do? Well Bacon did two things, on the
one hand he first identified what he called, what were the problems, the problems with
the mind, and he identified what he called four idols of the mind, idols of the cave,
idols of the tribe, idols of the marketplace, and idols of the theater, these are various
kinds of prejudices that influence the way that we think, the way that we draw inferences
from experience, so for example there are certain things that are built into human nature,
such as favoring positive outcomes over negative outcomes, so when you look at the results
of experiments we tend to overestimate the outcomes that confirm our hypotheses and we
underestimate the, well there was something wrong with the equipment or it didn't work
quite right, or maybe we could drop that data out over there, there are prejudices that
derive from the nature of language which prejudice our thinking and the way that we reason, there
are prejudices that derive from our social interactions, the idols of the marketplace,
the society in which we grow up teaches us certain kinds of truths in quotation marks
and we accept those as truths and especially the ones, the theories that were taught at
the university or in the school at an earlier age and those that are called the idols of
the theater were taught philosophical systems that are really incorrect, what we really
need to do is wipe the slate clean, we need to recognize that we are loaded with misconceptions,
that we are loaded with emotional and intellectual prejudices that are getting the way of the
of approaching nature objectively as we might, as we would certainly say and now that was
the negative side of his book, the positive side of his book is now I'll tell you how
to get knowledge of nature, it is, he offers an essentially mechanical procedure, not
mechanical in the way of a machine, but a kind of conceptual machine, a conceptual
machine for acquiring knowledge of nature, you look at some phenomenon that concerns
you, he took for example heat, now please note that Bacon was not a scientist, did not
pretend to be a scientist, he was not a natural philosopher, he didn't do any, and he had
effectively no understanding of mathematics, so for him mathematics had nothing to do with
nature, he didn't know much in the way of mathematics, just what he had to learn in
school and he thought that the focus on mathematics kept people away from nature because of the
sort of mystical and abstract characteristics of Pythagorean and Platonic mathematical nature
philosophy that I've discussed in earlier lectures, so Bacon said that what we need
here is a mechanical procedure, you have a problem that interests you, let's take heat,
and that did interest him, now you collect all the data that you can, you collect data
with a completely neutral state of mind, without any prejudices whatsoever, you just collect
all the data that are relevant to the issue of heat, what is heat, that's the problem,
what is heat, and there were really two candidates for the answer to that question, one was that
heat was a thing which was given the name caloric, a weightless fluid that was contained
in everything and when something got hot that was because the caloric was escaping from
that thing and the other possibility is that heat is motion, that heat is simply somehow
the motion, what we would today call the kinetic energy of the particles of which matter is
made up, now of course since heat is, the caloric is invisible then we can detect it,
we can detect heat but we can't detect this weightless fluid, both of these solutions
refer to things which we do not experience and this is consistent with what I said right
from the beginning, that one of the fundamental features of science once it had absorbed this
platonic Aristotelian notion of knowledge as universal necessary and certain is that the
object of scientific knowledge cannot be experienced, it must be something behind experience that
is unexperiencable but that causes experience, so that experience is the effect of reality
and that the object of scientific knowledge on this view is reality, this is by the way
completely reflected in Copernicus' theory of the moving earth, we do not experience
that the earth is rotating on its axis, we do not experience that the earth is orbiting
around the sun, we do not experience for that matter that the entire solar system is orbiting
the center of the Milky Way and that the Milky Way itself is moving in the direction of the
constellation Virgo, we don't experience any of those things, we have to be shown or
told by scientists that this is the truth of the matter, so this is and remains a fundamental
feature of science, now so Bacon says collect all the data, then you start analyzing the
data, you look at the data and you sort of steep yourself in the data, you go over the
data and you make lists of the data, you put them in different categories until you start
seeing certain relationships, you start seeing certain relationships among the data, certain
patterns, oh look at that, this looks like a pattern, now we form a hypothesis, the hypothesis
suggests well if heat is caloric then such and such should be the case and so you do
an experiment to see if such and such is the case, if the experiment confirms the hypothesis
then you go back and you start collecting more data that's specifically relevant to
that hypothesis, focused on that hypothesis and you do more experiments and at a certain
point when you have gone through this cycle several times and the experiments continue
to confirm a continually refined hypothesis you announce that you have discovered a law
of nature, so this is a strictly inductive method, this is a strictly inductive method
and it is keyed to experiment, nevertheless Bacon believed and said that what the goal
of science is knowledge of natural phenomena, truth he said adapting an old Roman line,
truth is the daughter of time, you have to be patient, truth will emerge from the repeated
application of this method which even though it is based on induction through the confirmation
that comes from experiment, we can be confident that we are going to converge over time, no
one can expect to do it in their lifetime but we can expect to converge in time on a
true account of nature, it's knowledge that we're after not probability or opinion, however
in the short term we have to function on the basis of this induction based approach and
what will validate it is that the knowledge that we get will give us power over nature,
power to channel and transform natural phenomena to control them in ways that we want, the
fact that we can use nature in ways that we desire will show that we are the masters
of nature, although when he wanted to he used the term stewards, that man is also the steward
of nature, we shouldn't so to speak rape nature, we should learn how to use nature to get
what we want but in a way that is consistent with, let's, we would use the language today
of respecting nature, but there's no doubt that the politics of his rhetoric, his books
were dedicated to the English king was that we needed to, we needed to get power over
nature because we wanted to become rich and powerful and that the key to this is an induction
based experimental method for generating scientific knowledge, now this was enormously influential
the Royal Society which was founded just 40 years approximately after Bacon published
the New Organon, he was dead by that time but they looked to him, they identified him
as one of the founding, conceptual founding fathers of the Royal Society in the 1660s
now already people conscious that what we would call modern science has emerged, that
they are the leading edge of a new wave of natural philosophers who are fundamentally
different from natural philosophers in the past and are on a path that is going to achieve
new and great things and 20 some odd years later when Isaac Newton published the mathematical
principles of natural philosophy subsidized by the Royal Society of London that seemed
that vision was considered fully justified, now parallel to Bacon you have the figure
of Rene Descartes, Descartes was a somewhat younger philosopher than Bacon and a philosopher,
French by birth but he spent a great deal of his adult life living in Holland which
at that time in the early 17th century was quite famous in Europe for his religious
tolerance and although Descartes considered himself a loyal Catholic he was also very
much aware of the fact that you could get into deep trouble with the Inquisition in
a Catholic country if you published material that was perceived to be threatening or heretical,
of course the burning of Giordano Bruno which Descartes referred to a number of times in
1600 was evidence for that and the subsequent punishment of Galileo several years, some
years before Descartes died was further reinforcement that you needed to be careful so he was careful
by living in a Protestant country that had implemented sort of religious toleration laws.
So Descartes in especially in his books the discourse on method and the rules for the
direction of the mind Descartes emphasized that deduction is the only possible, deductive
reasoning is the only possible basis for science, for knowledge of nature because nothing
else gives you real knowledge. As far as he was concerned this Baconian emphasis on induction
was misguided, it was nearly one phase of doing science. Scientific reasoning needed
to be deductive, it needed to be logically based on deduction from first principles and
it is that that gives us knowledge, everything else is mere probability and opinion and Descartes
offered in the discourse on method and the rules for the direction of the mind a kind
of a handbook for deductive reasoning about natural phenomena. We get into the problems
I mentioned in the time of Aristotle and again in the medieval problem of the universals
how are we going to get these first principles and Descartes talked about intuition and innate
ideas and believed that we did have innate ideas that God had given us at birth so to
speak that were built into us as human beings, certain ways of thinking that were built into
us as human beings and certain specific ideas especially mathematical objects and that we
had certain intuitions that there was a power of seeing the truth of something that was
even more believable than the conclusion of a deductive argument that intuition was
even more powerful than deductive reasoning and I think one instance of this might be
his famous I think therefore I am seeing the necessary truth of that statement is some
kind of immediate intuition and we have to measure other conclusions that we reach logically
against the clarity of that intuition of seeing the truth of that and deduction can
do that for us but we apparently do have some other faculty and so Descartes who was an
important scientist and who was the founder of this mechanical philosophy of nature that
all natural phenomena can be explained in terms of matter and motion and nothing else
that no other forces are required except the contact forces of matter and motion this failed
by the end of the 17th century was perceived to be much too thin a philosophy but conceptually
it dominated science through the 19th century that at some level once you add appropriate
forces which Newton opened the way to then a materialistic determinism is the only possible
scientific version of natural phenomena that science means materialistic determinism so
Descartes launched that Descartes argued for that claimed it was the only possible approach
but the key was getting those first principles we had innate ideas we had intuition but
we also according to Descartes needed to use hypotheses we needed to sort of create hypotheses
from which we could deduce natural phenomena so if you created a hypothesis that was consistent
with the experience and allowed you to deduce experience then we could say that those hypotheses
have some probability of being true this is kind of a weird thing to say because how
can you miss probability and mix probability and certainty he himself recognized that this
was a serious methodological issue but there was no escaping the need to formulate some
hypotheses but he thought that the success of deduction verified validated making those
hypotheses so that in some sense they had to be true Newton reacted violently against
this whole method of reasoning and in his pre-kippia said I hypothesis non-fingo in
the latin version of course I feign no hypothesis actually I make no hypothesis hypothesis is
a dead end it's sterile he became radically anti-cartesian the older and more famous that
he got and Newton had his own approach based on the Archimedean method that Galileo had
made central to his approach to mathematical physics like Galileo Newton thought that Archimedes
showed that you could combine experimentation and deductive reasoning in a rigorous way
and that would reveal the true causes of natural phenomena that means it would reveal the truth
about the reality behind experience that is causing experience when we talk about the true
causes of natural phenomena he's saying we have experience experience on its face is
misleading it says that the sun is moving across the sky for example it says that the
earth is stable but the truth is that there is a cause for all of this and and that is
the task of the scientist to reveal the true cause of which experience is the effect now
in between Descartes and Newton who are typically singled out as the as the great rival methodologists
of the 17th century of the scientific revolution you have Galileo the figure of Galileo who
was popularly identified most closely with the dialogue concerning the two great world
systems his condemnation by by the inquisition and a subsequent trial and conviction and
the last eight years of his life lived under house arrest but in fact as a science as a
founding figure of modern science Galileo's fame really rests on a book called the discourses
concerning two new sciences which was written while he was under house arrest which was
published illegally from the point of view of the deal met that he made with the inquisition
when he was convicted he was not supposed to publish anymore on these subjects and was
published illegally in in Holland shortly before Galileo died and I just want to read
a brief passage at the beginning of this wonderful text which contains in fact of what what you
might consider the mature Galileo's mature scientific mature contributions to modern
science not belittling the telescope and the astronomy but if he had never done that this
would have made him one of the founding figures of modern science of the scientific revolution
the two sciences that he writes about are what we would call engineering mechanics he
does mathematical theory of strength of materials now I had referred in the early in an early
lecture to Domenico Fontana's wonderful exhibition of engineering scale by moving this 700,000
pound plus obelisk that was in the way of building St. Peter's Cathedral and and there
was a great deal of arithmetic calculation associated with designing the the framework
to be built around it the size of the pieces of wood that would be the timber that would
be necessary and the ropes how how strong the ropes had to be etc but Galileo made
a science out of these rude engineering calculations analogous to the way that Pythagoras made
mathematics into the deductive body of knowledge that we identify it with out of the previous
number know-how of the Babylonians in the Egyptians for example Galileo transformed
what you might call casual engineering calculation into a science of the strength of materials
and and and that became the basis for what developed over the next 200 plus years right
into the present as engineering mechanics but only really got that name in the in the
more recently anyway that's one science the other science is the new science of motion
of that Galileo introduced and which really becomes the basis of the motion of material
particles as treated by scientists from the early set from Galileo let's say 1640 all
the way up to the present so Galileo becomes the founder of mechanics at through this the
second half of this book and what he says and on the first day there's four days of
dialogues among the same interlocutors that you see in the dialogue concerning the two
great world systems the Galileo says that well he's speaking through a mouthpiece although
some of my conclusions have been reached by others I'm rephrasing it slightly first of
all by Aristotle these are not the most beautiful and what is more they had not been proven
in a rigid manner from fundamental principles now since I wish to convince you by demonstrative
reasoning rather than to persuade you by mere probabilities I shall suppose that you are
familiar with present-day mechanics so far as it is needed in our discussion now when
he gets to the second half of the book and he gives his new science of motion he actually
the book begins with definitions and axioms a la geometry and then he deduces from these
from these definitions and axioms the laws of the motion of particles including the famous
equation for a freely falling body s equal one half gt square that we consider one of
the great achievements of early 17th century science but as a matter of fact as I'm going
to be discussing in the next lecture this equation appears nowhere in Galileo's text
the focus here the idea of modern science is the idea of method
