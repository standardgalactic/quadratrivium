In the preceding three lectures, we've looked at the ideas of energy, fields, and relationships
as challenging the atomistic style of thinking, which is not just atomistic in the sense of
attributing explanatory power to things with fixed properties, but also fits into the broader
determinism of substance metaphysics, the materialistic determinism of modern science,
which sort of reached a peak in the 19th century, and then these process style forms of thought
associated with the attribution of reality, physical reality, because of their causal
efficacy, the fact that they act as causal agents to energy, fields, and relationships.
In this lecture, we're going to look at another facet of this challenge to the atomistic deterministic
style of thinking, and that's the idea of evolution.
The idea of evolution most famous, of course, as the Charles Darwin or Charles Darwin, Alfred
Russell Wallace theory of biological evolution by means of natural selection.
The idea of evolution is an extremely powerful idea, and it is a major intellectual innovation
in the context of 19th century science with its materialistic determinism, one of whose
corollaries, as we have seen, was that time is, in some ultimate sense, unreal.
That time doesn't really make a difference because the present is embedded in the past
the way the conclusion of a deductive argument is already implicit in its premises.
The idea of evolution entails is that time does make a difference, that time is the dimension
in which novelty appears in history, that while evolution is a lawful phenomenon, it
is not predictable because chance plays a critical role in the process called evolution.
At one level, the idea of evolution is a powerful intellectual conceptual innovation because
it requires us to take time seriously, and it is hardly a coincidence that the idea of
evolution is emerging concurrently with the idea in thermodynamics, the early 1850s.
We discussed how in the early 1850s Rudolph Clausius, through introducing the concept
of entropy, was really indicating, as we see in the second law of thermodynamics, that
there is such a thing as the arrow of time, an inference that William Thompson slash Lord
Kelvin explicitly drew a year or two after Clausius published his paper in which he identified
this concept entropy, which is the name for a number associated with all processes in
which energy is transformed, and the fact that entropy increases in all such processes
reflected in the second law of thermodynamics that he can only throw from a hotter body
to a colder body, required us to accept according to Kelvin that there is now an arrow of time,
does make a difference. As I said concurrently, in the Darwin Wallace theory of evolution,
time also makes a difference. So at one level, the idea of evolution is innovative, enforcing
us to take time more seriously than we had done so, also because it turns out, although
Darwin himself waffled on this point, that chance is a fundamental feature of biological
evolution, we'll be talking about that in some more detail, and that of course challenges
the notion of determinism, that the future is precisely implicit in the present as the
present was in the past, it's a kind of pre-formationism, and I think that in a really pretty way, the
real challenge to the atomistic style of thinking from the idea of evolution is that evolution
attributes the idea of evolution, attributes explanatory power to a process rather than
to things with fixed properties. Instead of claiming that the way to explain chemical
reactions is by identifying elements of matter with specific fixed properties that cause
them to combine with other elements in specific fixed proportions, the idea of evolution is
that the problem to be explained, namely the origin of species, the reason why life takes
the forms that it does with relative stability in the short run between parents and offspring,
but this multifarious divergence of many different forms of life and their relationships
with one another, trying to, the problem of the origin of species is much broader than
nearly the problem of the origin of species, it's really the problem of the multifariousness
of the forms of life that we find on the planet, then the explanation derives from a process,
it is the process that is called natural selection acting on continuous variability between parents
and offspring under selection pressure, the pressure coming from overpopulation as a fundamental
principle of nature that all organisms produce more offspring than can ultimately be provided
for in their environmental niche as we would now call it, and since there is, this generates
a struggle for survival, that forces a kind of adaptation process to take place, so there
is in fact a hierarchy of processes associated with the idea of evolution, the process of
natural selection acting on and entailing the process of adaptation to continually changing
environmental circumstances, they may be changing very slowly but they're always changing,
and underneath that the processes of sexual reproduction and cell division, which Darwin
was neither Darwin nor Wallace were familiar with in the 1850s and 60s yet, that was only
in the last decades of the 19th century as we saw in the lecture on the cell theory of
life and the gene theory of inheritance, and because the variability that all evolutionists
recognize as a fundamental feature of life, that individuals always vary to some degree
from their parents, that this variability creates a pool that struggle for survival and natural
selection act on so to speak, of causing this continual adaptation to changing environmental
circumstances which leads to the multifariousness of the life forms on the planet, these are
all processes, so there's a process of sexual reproduction which we now understand to a
considerable degree, certainly a heck of a lot better than Darwin and Wallace did, through
DNA that the process of sexual reproduction generates variability inevitably and also
on a random basis, that the process of cell division introduces possibilities for variability
so that there is always going to be variability because of the process of cell division and
then the processes of adaptation and natural selection, so this is another sense, the sense
of process is manifested in this explanation, it is a fundamentally process based theory
or idea for explaining a very complex natural phenomenon, so I referred earlier to the problem
that Darwin was addressing and so was Wallace and that was a problem of the origin of species,
it was a problem that biologists had been concerned with certainly from the closing
decades of the 18th century, the whole question of the constancy of species and the problem
of the origin of species reflects again, as we've seen in a number of lectures, the taxonomy
problem, the whole question of whether there is a way of describing nature that is natural,
that maps on to distinctions in nature that so to speak go beyond direct experience, so
for example you can't see a mammal, a mammal is the name that we give to a particular subset
of living forms, that those living forms that have certain characteristics we call mammals,
but you can't see a mammal, you can't see mammalhood as a category in nature and the
question is is that a real category in nature or is it the case that we have simply organized
creatures that seem to us to possess a certain set of properties and we have given that the
name mammal, but that in fact does not distinguish those creatures from other creatures who are
otherwise very similar to them and that's why the platypus when it was discovered in
Australia was so puzzling because it seemed to combine mammalian features with non mammalian
features and in fact initially a biologist in Europe who received these carcasses thought
that they were a hoax and that they had been stitched together, that the various body parts
had been stitched together cleverly in order to fool them because it violated the category
mammal by having the fundamental characteristics of a mammal, but then some characteristics
that were not possessed by a mammal that challenges the concept, the category mammal and challenging
a fundamental category like that challenges the whole process of giving names to natural
phenomena. You may remember that I referred earlier to Plato's charge to natural philosophers
that their job was to carve nature at its joints to make distinctions to give names to
those phenomena that are really there that map on to absolute characteristics of reality.
It wasn't a question of just making up useful categories, categories that work, categories
that help us organize material, but to carve nature at its joints so to speak. So let's
call that the realist or naturalist view of the taxonomy problem as opposed to the conventionalist
view which is that the names are useful to us but they're not absolute and I've referred
to this in a number of different ways. This problem, the taxonomy problem became an insistent
and highly controversial one already in the late 16th century as European botanists and
zoologists were overwhelmed by thousands and thousands of new species and genera of plants
and animals that the European voyages of discovery and exploration were bringing back
to Europe and now all of a sudden we need to organize them and I've referred before
to the fact that this pose, this challenge, is there a natural system of classification
that we need to discover, uncover and so we can categorize, we can identify genus and
species, for example, based on natural characteristics or are there only conventional ways of dealing
with this. If there are only conventional ways then there is no such thing as a species
and so the transmutation of species is not a traumatic thing, it's not a violation of
the natural order. It is only if you think that species are natural that that is a natural
classification that changing one species into another seems like a fundamentally impossible
thing to do because that is a natural distinction. One species and another species are fundamentally
distinct. There's a gulf between them that cannot be bridged by any kind of, let's say,
breeding experiment. In the 18th century I mentioned that Carl Linnaeus represented
in some sense the epitome of the naturalist view of classification based on organizing
plants and later animals, bisexual characteristics, but plants especially was his forte, but I
had mentioned that at the end of his life he had to acknowledge that his system of classification
was really not natural, it was not unique, it did not map onto the way plants really
were but that it was ultimately and sadly only conventional. This view is Darwin's view
because for Darwin, for Wallace and for all of the other people who we will shortly be
mentioning who address this question of the origin of species, it was obvious that there
really is no such thing as a species that all of the things that we call, all the categories
that we call species categories are really varieties that life forms are continually
changing under this process, this family of processes, co-related processes of sexual
reproduction, cell division, speaking now a little unachronistically in the middle of
the 19th century, cell division, sexual reproduction, natural selection, all of these processes
are continually changing each generation of living thing in small, sometimes almost always
subtle ways but over vast periods of time, it leads to a radiation of life forms that
each reflecting, each life form reflecting adaptation to a particular environment in
which it is able to flourish or at least to survive. So the origin of species question
is solved by saying that there is no such thing as a species that there are only varieties
but some varieties are more stable than others. Ordinary varieties, the varieties of dogs
and pigeons that we see around us for example, display tremendous variety and instability,
they easily so to speak reproduce in ways which show reversions back to parents and characteristics
of previous generations of dogs and pigeons. So varieties as we ordinarily experience them
by animal breeders for example and plant breeders are rich with variability but what
Darwin and Wallace were pointing out is that there is a form of variety which is stable
over long periods of time and so we think that it's eternal. There are people who think
that species are eternal and this is a misconception. The process by which life reproduces itself
in response to continually changing environmental circumstances is a process that guarantees
variability and that has a time structure to it that is so long compared to human consciousness
that changes that take place over millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years
even tens of thousands of years even for individuals is just so slow that we assume that what we're
seeing is constant. So what we have in the theory of evolution is a theory that strangely
requires taking very seriously individual variation, individual variability, the degree
to which each individual varies to some degree from their parent but the individual does not evolve.
The individual has is different from its parent, it's different from its siblings,
it's different from other animals or plants of its kind so to speak but the individual is exactly
what it is. What is it that evolves? It is again you have to step back and take a process view
ultimately what emerged in the in the 1920s and 30s was a need to take a population based view
of the process of evolution that what we see over time is that the distribution of genes
not available to Darwin but by the 1920s we had a mathematical description,
we had formulae that showed how a particular distribution of genes would spread through a
population if any of those genes gave any survival advantage or at all to the individuals that
possessed them the rate at which the genes would those genes would spread and so if there was a
mutation in a gene we can calculate how rapidly it would spread through a population giving their
reproduction rate and giving some understanding of the environmental pressures that they were
acting under and if a gene is harmful how quickly those the individuals that possess it will
so to speak die out of the population so the population the population changes its
character over time the distribution of genes and the expression of those genes changes over
long periods of time it's really a situation that's somewhat analogous to a motion picture
in a motion picture when you're when you're watching a motion picture nothing is changing
no thing is changing in the way that you see the process by which we see which makes us
insensitive to image changes that are less than approximately a tenth of a second apart
makes us respond to a series of slides that's a motion picture film is really a series of
stills of slides each one of which is only minutely different from the preceding one
but when they're shown quickly enough then we experience motion evolution is saying that well
because the picture of life and its reproduction is so slow we see constancy whereas if we could
see a time lapse photograph of the emergence of life on earth over the previous even over the
previous billion last billion years whereas instead of three and a half billion then we would see
this transmutation of species we would see the radiation of life forms we would see how
multifariousness emerged from from a from a single original life form at least from the
point of view of the later development of the darwin wallis theory of evolution darwin was very
careful uh saying that he thought that there were maybe four or five of of initial forms of
animals and maybe three or four initial forms of plants possibly there was only one initial life
form but he didn't press that point i think if you read between the lines you see that's what he
was getting at but he was being very cautious in his first major publication the on the origin of
species in in 1859 but others had preceded him in this because they saw the origin of species
question as just one example of a deeper question of the origin of life and that question became a
scientific question as we refer to in the cell theory of life lecture in the middle of the 18th
century and is associated with the names of george bouffant france lamarck in france dark
charles darwin's grandfather erasmus darwin among others who uh who argued that there was initially
one life form that then uh became diverse in the in the manner of in the form of its expression
because of in the case of lamarck and erasmus darwin certainly because of strictly mechanical
processes going on in nature without any uh need to refer to divine creation to any
providential intervention that an initial life form however that arose then generated all of the
different forms of plants and animals insects birds etc that we see on the earth um through strictly
mechanical processes most famously in the case of lamarck based on the use and disuse of its
organs by its own struggle for survival to acquire characteristics that it would allow that would
help it to survive to the age of reproduction and the the inheritance of acquired characteristics
which is a fundamental feature of lamarck's uh the lamarck's theory of evolution so this notion
that the origin of life is the basis for the origin of species once we have a theory of the
origin of life of the lamarckian erasmian bufonian sort then we see already that there is an internal
dynamism to to lie to to nature and at the level of living creatures that that makes it the case
that there is constant change going on here but it is the inverse of what happens when we see a
motion picture there we are fooled into seeing motion when there really is no motion in the
case of of the evolution of life forms we are seeing stability when there is really motion
because we're just not around here long enough in order to see the the slow flow think in terms of
for example you you've all heard this at some point and maybe found it believable or not the fact
that glass is really a super fluid that glass is a fluid and it flows but it flows very slowly
you can't look at a window and see how gravity is causing the material in the window the glass
to flow down the window but if you look back at medieval stained glass windows from seven eight
hundred years ago then we see very clearly that the top of the glass is much thinner than the
bottom of the glass the glass over 800 years has measurably flowed thickened at the bottom
which makes it very delicate to to repair or to replace those those those windows so the origin
of life question the whole idea where did this come from that life is unified well we've already
got the ingredients for the answer to this question I mentioned that at the end of the 18th beginning
of the 19th century this notion of the unity of nature became part of so to speak scientific
thinking in part through the romantic nature philosophers predominantly german and to some
extent french at the time who argued that there was a unity to all the forces in nature and that
that was one of the threads that was woven into the concept of energy but they also held that
there was a unity to all the life forces in nature and the all life forms that there was
originally one life form that everything that is is an expression of a fundamental underlying
life force just as all forms of energy are expressions specific expressions of a generic
form of energy which does not exist in its generic character only in its specific character
same thing is true of life forms so the romantic nature philosophers among them as the german
the german poet and intellectual and dramatist Gerta Gerta wrote a book on the what we would
say called the evolution of plants in which he identified the Orphe Lanza the the or the primordial
plant form that then radiated into all the different forms of plants that that we see on the planet
by a by a series of natural processes so in this context ever when we think of the origin of we
look at the origin of life question from roughly speaking 1750 1760 on it is not surprising that
the origin of species question acquired the kind of answer that we identify with Charles Darwin and
little unfairly not giving full enough credit to Alfred Russo Wallace so for example we we know
and Darwin was eventually forced to confront by his by his critics that an american naturalist who
lived in England named William Wells in 1813 had published an essay on what we would call evolution
by natural selection that was included that was referred to at length in a book by John Herschel
that we know that Darwin owned and Darwin had read carefully he was good friends with Herschel
and and very friendly with him so we know that he read that book and eventually and he did mention
he did acknowledge that he had read that book in 1831 a british um uh arboriculturist somebody who
who cultures trees and uh and was an expert on trees named Patrick Matthew wrote a book on
arbora culture especially trees adapted to use for the navy in the time before when the navy
was still using wooden ships and and and had lots of mass to carry the sails that they carried
Matthew had a very specific had a very explicit theory of evolution which is very Darwinian
in the sense that it refers to struggle for survival and something like natural selection
there's no question that that Matthew's idea was a what as Darwin himself acknowledged
prefigures uh Darwin's Darwin's thinking and and and in the 1840s a bestseller in Britain
an initially anonymous but the author was subsequently identified as Robert Chambers
called the vestiges of creation gave a kind of updated lamarckian theory of evolution
and thousands and thousands of copies of this book were sold primarily because religious leaders
opposed it and denounced it as scandalous perhaps and then in the 1850s 1858 uh Darwin and Wallace
both sort of announced their their a theory of evolution by natural selection Darwin after 24 years
came back from his five-year voyage with the Beagle in 1835 he left just about the same time
that Matthew published his monograph on on tree culture um the 24 years from 1835 to 1859 between
that and the the origin of species and Darwin had a massive amount of the entire origin of
species is is a small fraction of the total amount of notes he had accumulated there's no
comparison between the speculations of people like Wells and Matthew insightful speculations
and the arguments that uh that Darwin presented in the origin of species for the the claim that
species are really varieties and that there is no constancy in nature over long enough
periods of time life forms are continually adapting to changing environmental circumstances
changing uh competition uh for survival and um and they're able to do this because of the
continual chance variability that each organism possesses vis-a-vis uh its parents and Darwin
and Russell I would Russell Wallace who was down in uh who was in the South Pacific actually in
in Malaya as it was then called sending a short letter to Darwin only about eight or ten pages
long in which all of the elements of this theory are equally are equally present without the enormous
backing of uh that data that Darwin had assembled over the preceding 24 years but from Wallace's
point of view that data was irrelevant anyway because Darwin uh as as Matthew before him
focused very specifically on an analogy between artificial breeding and natural selection whereas
Wallace rejected that on the grounds that artificial breeders manipulate the struggle for survival
they eliminate the struggle for the natural struggle for survival and so he thought you could
not make a useful analogy between the struggle between artificial breeding and uh and the natural
selection basis for evolution he had his argument was so to speak a purer version based on the
distribution of plants and animals so biogeography as it's called as he observed it from the years
that he spent first in the brazilian jungle and then in in Malaya collecting specimens for
for rich uh uh british collectors of of plant rare plants and animals so the theory of evolution
contains within it a number of startling conceptual features not least of which
is the idea that chance plays an important role a fundamental role in the process that explains
the origin of species darwin as i said before waffled on this darwin tried to avoid claiming
explicitly that chance was behind the spontaneous variations what we would call mutations and he
never used the expression random mutations but by the 1860s and 70s physicists recognized that the
theory of evolution required assuming that chance plays a fundamental role and this is a is a deep
challenge to the the embedded determinism of of modern science of what science considers
rationality itself and we're going to be looking at how this was reflected in the rise of probabilistic
theories of uh in science in the next lecture
