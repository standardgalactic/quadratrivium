The subject of this lecture is the Atomic Theory of Matter.
And the story of the Atomic Theory of Matter is an outstanding illustration of a number
of themes that run through this course.
One of them, starting from the very first lecture, was that the story of science, the
history of science, is a history of ideas, not discoveries, because discoveries, I said
then, are sort of latent with ideas, are enabled by ideas that create the framework within
which a discovery is interpreted to be a discovery.
So no ideas, no discovery.
And the Atomic Theory of Matter is a good illustration of that point.
It is also an excellent illustration of the difference between an idea and a scientific
idea, between an idea even in philosophy, where philosophers attempt to give precision
to ordinary language ideas, and the difference between a scientific idea and a philosophical
idea is perhaps has a distinctive character, which is as different from a philosophical
idea as a philosophical idea is from an ordinary language, sort of common sense idea.
We've played with that a bit in the case of time.
And what I want to emphasize here is the role that definition plays.
Remember, I discussed Augustine's definition of time, Newton's definition of time.
Eventually, we will get to Einstein's redefinition of time.
But in the case of the story of the Atomic Theory of Matter, we will see how contingent
the scientific definitions are, that they change over time, that scientists will simply
redefine what an atom is, what space is, what time is, what matter is, what energy is in
order to fit new explanatory contexts.
So the idea of the atom is illustrative of the role that ideas play in enable us to make
sense of experience in ways that allow us to say we have discovered X, and it is also
illustrative of the role that definitions play in scientific ideas.
Now the atom is a good illustration of an idea rather than a discovery because the Atomic
Theory of Matter was not discovered.
The Atomic Theory of Matter was an idea that was applied, especially in the 19th century,
to first chemistry and then physics with increasing success.
It may come as a surprise to people that into the early 20th century, it was highly controversial
among physicists that atoms were real.
The claim that atoms were real was a highly controversial claim to make in physics into
the early 20th century, and we will come to understand why, but to appreciate that,
we need to look at the prehistory, so to speak, of the Atomic Theory of Matter.
The idea of the atom was, in fact, invented in ancient Greece as a response to good old
parminides, who on strictly logical, deductive grounds had argued that the ultimately real
must be changeless, that the real must be changeless.
It means atemporal, and one response to this, since experience shows us that things change
all the time, change is the fundamental problem of science, as I referred to it in an earlier
lecture.
A number of Greek philosophers came up with the idea that, oh, OK, parminides has a point.
Change is apparent and superficial.
The ultimate elements of reality are themselves changeless, they are atoms, they are units
of physical being, so to speak, and that all of the things that we experience as changing
are merely different configurations of these atoms, and when those atoms reconfigure themselves,
then our experience changes, the different configurations have different properties,
and so in a certain sense, yes, there is change, and we can explain it, but what we use to
explain it is something changeless, and so the concept of the atom was specifically invented,
it was not discovered by carefully observing natural phenomena, it was invented in response
to a philosophical problem posed by parminides, and I've been using parminides' name as
a synonym for a style of thinking, this substance style of thinking, that the reality is built
that experience is built up out of hidden elements of reality which are themselves changeless,
they are substances with fixed properties, and everything that we experience is built
up, Lego-like, out of these fundamental particles, in the case of atoms, that's what they were
supposed to be, they were, in a sense, Lego building blocks.
In ancient Greece, there were really two versions of this atomism, one by Annex Ageris, which
was that atoms came in many different forms, there were blood atoms and bone atoms, for
example, and hair atoms and fingernail atoms, and everything, every natural object contained
some atoms of almost every different type, and so for example, when you ate bread, your
body abstracted from the bread, the bone atoms that were in the bread, the blood atoms that
were in the bread, and that's the way you nourished yourself.
Annex Ageris' version of the atomism, and these atoms were changeless over time, they
could never change into anything else, they were permanent, was replaced really by Epicurus
who adopted a different theory of atomism out of Democritus, who also had a teacher
who taught him this, which was that at one level, all atoms are the same, they only differ
in size and shape, and they form different configurations which have all of the different,
we would call physical and chemical properties, and that we associate with nature, and Epicurus'
writings, especially as developed by the Roman poet Lucretius in a poem called On the Nature
of Things, which was translated by the Renaissance, humanists in the Renaissance, obviously during
the Renaissance, and became popular again because Epicurus, as I've mentioned before,
was anathema to the church, since he developed his atomic theory of nature explicitly to
teach people not to be afraid of death, since death is this kind of non-being, nothing survives
the dissolution of the atoms that make up our body, and which will now become configured
as grass and dirt, that was considered obviously a deep threat to the whole concept of spirituality
as interpreted in Christianity. The Renaissance humanists brought atomism into the Renaissance
by translating Lucretius' text as well as other atomistic texts from antiquity, including
some writings of Epicurus, and we find that by the 16th and certainly the 17th century,
a growing number of thinkers are adopting this atomic idea, find that atomism is a very
plausible theory of material nature. In particular, Galileo was an atomist. Robert Boyle, the
father of modern chemistry, as he is often described in history books, thought that atomism
made for an excellent conceptual framework within which to explain the behavior of gases,
and he was a pioneer in the study of the relationships among pressure, volume, and temperature, and
chemical combination, and a man who was today virtually unknown, but in the 17th century
was extremely well-known, Pierre Gassendi, who was a rival to Descartes, in that Descartes
was an anti-atomist. He believed that matter was continuously distributed through space,
was infinitely divisible, so there was no such thing as a smallest bit of matter. Gassendi
developed a physics in which matter was atomic. It was also a physics in which probability
played a significant part. He denied the notion of knowledge as universal, necessary, and certain,
which was fundamental to Descartes' philosophy of nature, and Isaac Newton was an atomist,
and a very important atomist. In one sense, one can say that he was the first scientist
who began to use atomism in order, as a scientific idea, functioning within the context of a
scientific explanation. Well, Galileo had done something like that, too, but much more
so in the case of Newton, and I want to read from one of the queries of Isaac Newton's,
at the end of Isaac Newton's 1704 work, Optics, to give you a flavor of the notion of atomism
in its pre, well, prehistoric is not the correct term, pre-modern sense, which we will see
really begins with John Dalton in the early 1800s. All things being considered Newton rights. It
seems probable to me that God, in the beginning, formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable,
movable particles of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties, and in such
proportion to space, as most conduced to the end for which he formed them, and that these primitive
particles, being solids, are incomparably harder than any porous bodies compounded of them,
even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces, no ordinary power being able to
divide what God himself made one in the first creation. And Newton writes in question 31,
have not the small particles of bodies, certain powers, virtues, or forces by which they acted
a distance not only upon the rays of light, but also upon one another for producing a great part
of the phenomena of nature, for it's well known that bodies act on one another by the attractions
of gravity, magnetism, and electricity, and these instances show the tenor and course of nature
and make it not improbable, but that there may be more attractive powers than these,
and Newton goes on to describe how chemical combination can be understood in terms of
certain selective powers that atoms have to be attracted to or not attracted to,
or positively repulsed by, other atoms in order to form what we would, what we would call molecules.
Now Newton also developed an atomic theory of light, not just an atomic theory of matter,
are not the rays of light, very small bodies emitted from shining substances,
so that for Newton, Newton was a thoroughgoing atomist at the physical level applying this
atomic hypothesis, although he would have hated the term hypothesis in this context,
the atomic hypothesis to matter, matter is made up of tiny impenetrable,
ultimately hard solid objects with fixed properties. Every atom is created by God and
cannot be destroyed in any natural process, only supernaturally if God chose to do so,
but nature cannot change any atoms, and that becomes a fundamental precept of 19th century
atomic theory, that atoms have this ultimate character, they cannot be reduced any further,
and they have no parts to them, they are solid, they are units, which is what the Greek word
Adam was supposed to convey, that they are units of reality, but they have, according to Newton,
in addition to size and shape and motion, they have innate properties, and he goes on later on
in this same text to justify, using this language, even though it sounds like Renaissance
magical nature philosophy, that atoms have the power to act on other atoms across empty space,
at a distance, electricity and magnetism and gravity are instances of this, he believes,
and all attempts by the Cartesians to come up with mechanical theories of electricity,
magnetism and gravity, that denied acting at a distance through empty space,
failed ultimately, and so what we see in the 18th century is a growing interest in
Newton's theory of atomism, atomic theory of matter, and acceptance of Newton's atomic theory
of light, that light is like tiny little bullets, and together with a Newton's great rival,
Gottfried Leibniz, who developed a metaphysical theory called the monadology, in which reality
is made up of ultimate units that act from the inside out, they do not truly interact with
any other unit, and so every unit of reality, every monad is kind of a dynamic atom, it's a
force center, and while Leibniz' metaphysics, his monadism, is not appropriately a scientific idea
for our purposes in this course, it exercised great influence on 18th century philosophy and science,
and in 1758, a Jesuit physicist named Roger Buskovich published a book that was a theory of
natural philosophy that blended Leibniz and Newton, and offered a theory of atoms as point
centers of force, he dropped the materiality of the atom, a la Newton, let them be point
particles, so to speak, a la Leibniz, and made them the centers of forces that dropped off as a
function of distance, and depending on the atom, different forces were associated with it, so you
could explain electricity, magnetism, and chemical combination, Buskovich thought, and Buskovich's
writing, Buskovich's book, was well known and was quite influential over the next 50 years or so.
The pivotal figure in the story of the atomic theory of matter is John Dalton, an English
scientist that we would call a physicist, and yet his most famous book is a new theory of
chemical philosophy, and analogous to Antoine Lavoisier, who 25 years earlier had precipitated
a revolution in chemistry, and Lavoisier too was a physicist, and there's a connection between
Lavoisier and Dalton, in that Dalton's work was, so to speak, built on the studies of Lavoisier
and Joseph Priestley, especially the studies of gases, and that there are different kinds of gases,
what we would call oxygen, carbon dioxide, and as these studies were extended by Henry Cavendish
at the end of the 18th to beginning of the 19th century in England, the recognition that the
atmosphere, the air that we breathe, is not an element, it's a compound, and it's made up of
primarily oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, and Dalton was interested in how these three
gases, with different, as we would call them, molecular weights, how they mix, how it comes
to be the case that they are thoroughly mixed in any breath of air that we inhale, mixed throughout
the lower atmosphere. And in the course of these studies, Dalton decided that the atomic theory
of matter, which he knew of through, obviously, knowing Newton, and knowing of Vascovich,
and Lavoisier's own work in chemistry, led him to the idea that matter came in the form of atoms,
and that all chemical reactions could be explained in terms of atoms, elements,
by supposing that matter had an elemental atomic character, there were oxygen atoms, carbon atoms,
nitrogen atoms, iron atoms, etc., and that each atom had a specific set of properties that were
associated with their chemical combination, so that oxygen combined with hydrogen, with carbon,
with nitrogen in very specific ways. So this is called the theory of fixed proportions, that
elements, the atoms of elements, combined with one another in fixed proportions. It was highly
controversial for the first half of the 19th century among chemists, because there were great
chemists in the early 19th century who held that this was not true, and that depending on the
circumstances of the reaction, the volumes of the different reactants, the temperature, the pressure,
that atoms would combine in different proportions, so you could be an atomist and not agree
that chemical reactions were fixed on the basis of fixed properties of the individual
atoms, but in time, Dalton's view prevailed, that the atom had fixed properties. Now it turns out,
chemists had to acknowledge that the same element could combine in different proportions
with different other elements, and that there was not one single combining proportion. Sulfur
is polyvalent, for example, and in combination with different other elements, it will display
a different combining proportion than it does in other cases. So it's not as simple as Dalton hoped
that it would be, but Dalton's book, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, in 1806-1807, he had worked
on it over a period of years, and it was published over a period of years, but let's use 1807,
becomes the sort of the founding document of modern atomic theory, and in the course of,
especially the middle of the 19th century, more and more chemists working with the atomic theory
became convinced that atoms were real, but most physicists, including very prominent physicists,
like Michael Faraday throughout his life, and Maxwell, the great founder of electromagnetic
theory in its modern form, waffled on the whole question of the reality of atoms, and some physicists
of prominence, Ernst Mach most notably, right into the early 20th century violently opposed the
idea of the reality of atoms, claiming that that was a very wonderful idea, but they were not
physically real, that it was an idea that we used to bind together many different experiences,
and to give plausible explanations to use these ideas to make predictions and to explain,
but they did not correspond to anything out there. He took very strong exception to that,
and he was very articulate, and he defended this view for decades. What made chemists believe
that atoms were real were, of course, their continuing study of reactions and realizing
that, in fact, elements did combine, typically, in very strict proportions, but as we will see
in a subsequent lecture, starting especially in the 1830s and 40s, a growing recognition
that the structural arrangement of atoms within a molecule determined the properties
of the molecule, that the same atoms arranged differently had different properties, and now
that suggests that these atoms are not just a convenient way of referring to bits of matter,
but they are actually real. So the discovery that the structural arrangement of atoms
makes a difference lends reality to atoms. In the middle of the century, really,
we can date it to 1860 and an international chemist conference in Karlsruhe in Germany,
where this notion that you've all encountered in high school chemistry or college chemistry,
if you took it Avogadro's number, which is an estimate of the number of atoms in a particular
in a particular volume of a gas or a liquid, that this number, that atoms are countable,
also, of course, lends them substantial reality. From 1860s on, the development of the kinetic
theory of gases, especially by James Clark Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, was assumed,
let's assume that gases are made up of atoms the way Dalton said, and he got started studying
gases, you remember, and that Avogadro has given us a clue as to how to count these,
and so we know how many we're dealing with. We can explain pressure and temperature, Maxwell
and Boltzmann claim, we can explain pressure and temperature by assuming that matter actually is
atomic, and Boltzmann himself was as vigorous a defender of the reality of atoms as Ernst Mach,
his nemesis in this regard, argued that this didn't prove that atoms were real,
only that it, assuming that atoms were real, made for very powerful scientific explanations.
So the development of the kinetic theory of gases lent reality to the atom, especially for
chemists. I mentioned at the end of the last lecture that physicists were driven to a statistical
interpretation of thermodynamics in order to undo the arrow of time, and Maxwell and Boltzmann
were associated with that, and in order to give this statistical interpretation, they needed
to argue that matter was atomic. If you assume that matter was atomic, then the statistical
interpretation of thermodynamics allowed you to say that the flow of heat from a hotter body
to a colder body, which is the second law of thermodynamics, is merely statistical. It is
not an absolute law of nature, and therefore the arrow of time is a statistical law, it is not an
absolute law, time is in principle reversible, it's just highly unlikely. The atom became
increasingly real for physicists, not specifically because of the kinetic theory of gases, it convinced
Boltzmann, but Maxwell waffled, and he was one of the co-founders of the theory, but in the last
decade or so of the 19th century, with the study of cathode rays, which had been discovered
in the 1880s when people started doing experiments with evacuated tubes, like incandescent light
bulbs of Edison's invention, and discovered that the cathode, that the heated element in such an
evacuated bulb tube, Crooks in England became associated with one style of these tubes in
which you had two plates, you had a plate that was connected to one side of the battery that got
heated, and then there was a plate connected to the other side of the battery, the anode, as we
call it, and that there were funny rays that moved from one to the other, and the study of these
rays in the 1890s led to the recognition that these rays were in fact streams of electrically
charged particles, a physicist named Jean Perrin, a French physicist named Jean Perrin, identified
these rays as being made up of a huge number of particles with negative charge, and in 1896,
1897, J.J. Thomson, who was the head of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University at the
time, announced the discovery, which is epical given our discussion of the atom, that in fact the
atom contains within it these tiny little particles with a fixed electric, negative electric charge
that were identified as electrons. The electron is much, much, much lighter than any atom, it's
approximately 1,1828th of the weight of a hydrogen atom, which is the lightest of all atoms,
and this is a shocking discovery. Remember what I said about Newton and the solidity of atoms?
Atoms were ultimate units, they didn't have parts, and now Thomson is telling us at the very close
of the 20th century, of the 19th century, that atoms have an internal structure, they contain
negatively charged bits, but they also contain positively charged bits because overall they're
neutral, so that raises the question, well, if atoms have an internal structure, well first of all
we have to redefine what we mean by an atom, but then we ask, how are these bits arranged?
How is it, what is the internal structure of the atom? And in 1904, Thomson proposed what has been
referred to as the pudding model of the atom, in which the positive charge, there's a solid sphere
of positively charged stuff, and embedded in it, like raisins in a pudding, are these tiny little
electrons, which are arranged in orbits based on the electrostatic forces between the positively
charged stuff and the negatively charged electrons, which repel one another, but are attracted to
the positively charged stuff. And the question was, how are these electrons arranged inside
the different atoms? Para came back with the explanation in terms of a primitive version of
what we now call the solar system model of the atom, but Para also did, picked up on work that
Einstein did in 1905 on the Brownian motion, the motion of tiny little particles suspended in a fluid
which moved jerkily, and which Einstein used to estimate the size of molecules which began
to convince physicists that electrons were, that atoms were real, because now we could
not only count them, but we could also use, we could also identify how big they are
in a way that physicists responded to. Paran extended that work, and in 1926 was given a
Nobel Prize for what even in the Nobel Prize was called, reinforcing the discontinuous theory
of matter. Atomism is a discontinuous theory of matter, contrary to Descartes. So even in 1926,
the atomic theory of matter was considered, was in a certain sense, something that was worth
giving a Nobel Prize for, because it was, it needed to be established for physicists that
these atoms were real. That prize award, by the way, mentioned that Para had in fact extended
Einstein's work, which in a certain sense first started convincing most physicists that these
atoms were real because you could calculate what their size was. It was in 1909, 1910 that Ernest
Rutherford, a student of, a former student of J.J. Thomson's, that Rutherford, with his graduate
students, Geiger and Marsden, formulated the, so to speak, modern version of the solar system
modern of the atom, in which we have the nucleus that is positively charged, the electrons rotate
around it, and the atom is about 98 plus percent empty space. What started with Dalton as a solid
atom 103 years later is now suddenly discovered to be 98 plus percent empty space, and that
turns out to be an underestimate of how empty the atom actually is. Nucleus made up of protons,
orbital electrons around it. In 1932, the neutron was discovered, was identified as
a particle that needed to be in the nucleus in order to explain a number of increasingly
puzzling phenomena, and so we now had a picture of the atom in which the nucleus was solidly
packed with neutrons and protons, and these orbital electrons surrounding it. In 1935,
it was discovered that the nucleus had an internal structure, was actually mostly empty space,
and that the protons and neutrons were arranged in shells, and nuclear physics began in Ernest.
Between 1935 and 1964, increasingly powerful atom-smashing instruments, particle accelerators,
revealed that there were over 200 elementary particles in nature, and that became quite
ridiculous, and the resolution of that situation, which restored the underlying concept of the
atom as a fundamental unit of physical reality, took the form of what is called quantum chromodynamics,
or quark theory, in which all ordinary matter is made up of either electrons which are not
reducible, they are a kind of atom, they cannot be broken down into anything smaller, and three
different kinds of quarks, they're all together six, but only three are required to make protons
and neutrons, and so the new atomic theory, so to speak, is that protons and neutrons are not
truly atomic, they are built up, they're compounds of quarks which cannot be broken down any further,
protons and neutrons turn out to be mostly empty space, because quarks are much, much smaller
than the protons and neutrons that they compose, and now we have a new atomic theory, so to speak,
but notice how the atom has been systematically redefined at every stage in order to serve
scientific explanation. Now, the context is quantum theory, the context of quantum
chromodynamics, you get that from the name, and quantum theory exacts a price, which is that the
atom also has a wave-like character, which seems to be an echo of Descartes' continuum theory,
and we'll be exploring this further in the next lectures.
