Our subject in this lecture is the idea of the university, which is conceptually and
chronologically a big jump from the last lecture when we were talking about the technology
infrastructure of ancient Rome and the rise of the idea of techno-science in the Greco-Roman
period.
Roman dominance, but most of the contributors to it, the truvius notwithstanding, were in
fact were Greek citizens of Rome, of the Roman Imperium.
From approximately the 5th century, well let's say with the collapse of the Roman Empire
beginning in the 5th century and until the 12th century, it used to be the case, it may
be politically incorrect today, but it used to be the case to call this the dark ages.
And this is the kind of comment that you get from intellectuals who are really saying nothing
of particular cultural or intellectual import happened during this approximately 700 years.
But as a matter of fact a great deal was happening in Western Europe at that time, physically
and politically in terms of dealing with population changes and invasions and conquests.
But it is true that not a good deal happened during this period of time that is relevant
to the idea of science or the transmission of Greco-Roman techno-scientific knowledge,
scientific knowledge, mathematical knowledge to the modern Western world.
It was in that sense a dark period which suddenly became illuminated in the, roughly
speaking the 12th century, well it started in the late 11th century, but it was the 12th
century when there was an explosion of cultural, social, political, economic dynamism in Western
Europe which has led some historians to call this the 12th century renaissance.
You could have called it the 12th century renaissance as well, but then that might have
been confusing when you referred to it because the term renaissance is most familiarly applied
to Europe and especially Italy in the period roughly from the 15th century through the,
into the 17th century.
So we don't want to use the term renaissance twice in that context.
So people call this the 12th century renaissance.
In both cases it means a rebirth.
Now we'll see later that the renaissance, properly speaking, was a deliberate attempt
to recapture the cultural excellence and the intellectual excellence of ancient Greece
and Rome.
The 12th century renaissance was not such a deliberate effort.
In fact what it means is that there was a rebirth of dynamism in Western Europe after
centuries of relative passivity.
Relative of course because the closer you look the more you see that things were happening
that were relevant to our story, but relatively speaking passivity and then all of a sudden
an explosion.
Now in this lecture I'm going to be talking about one product of that explosion and that
was the invention of the university, the idea of the university which had never existed
in Western culture before as it came to be institutionalized, as it came to be formalized.
There were schools of course and some of these schools were advanced in the sense that they
taught what we would consider college and even graduate level materials.
So even in ancient Babylon and in Egypt we know that there were schools for the priesthood,
that there were medical schools, that there were schools for teaching mathematics.
I've referred to a number of surviving papyri for example that were clearly intended to
be textbooks in ancient Greece starting at least from the time of Hippocrates in the
5th century BCE.
On the island of Kos there was a medical school that was a text based medical school
in addition to clinical practice that the teachings at Kos, at Hippocrates medical school
were text based.
There was a rival medical school in the city of Canitis which was primarily clinically
based and this led to debates which continued for centuries and in fact are still echoed
today about whether medical education, later I've referred to engineering education, should
be outcomes based or theory based.
Of course the people who prefer theory say that oh they're not two separate things.
That theory and outcomes need to be connected together but a strong argument has always
been made that people who have practical experience should not be discriminated against because
they don't have book learning and cannot give you a theory to explain why what they did
works.
This is particularly relevant in medicine, the history of medicine until the 20th century
and the rise of what we call scientific medicine was one in which physicians' reputations
were based overwhelmingly on outcomes, on what happened to their patients without much
concern about whether there was much of a foundation, a theoretical model that they
were using in treating their patients.
So Plato founded a school, I've referred already to the Pythagorean schools which went on for
centuries after the 5th century BCE, Plato founded a school called the Academy in Athens
and then his former student Aristotle who had been passed over for the leadership of
the Academy after Plato died and so Huff went off and set up his own school which came to
be called the Lyceum.
The Academy and the Lyceum both in Athens existed for almost a thousand years, continuously
training generation after generation of students until finally in the 6th century the schools
were closed down by the Roman Emperor Justinian because by that time Rome and culture had become
so Christianized that he felt it was intolerable to have schools teaching pagan philosophy
and so the schools of Plato and Aristotle had founded, the schools that Plato and Aristotle
had founded were closed approximately 900 years, a little over 900 years after they were founded
and those were what we would consider certainly college level schools.
So the idea of schools and of schools that trained people at a high level certainly preceded
the invention of the university and in Islam especially starting somewhere around the 9th
century, certainly by the 9th century there were increasingly sophisticated colleges that
not only taught the Quran and its interpretation but also taught what we would consider philosophy
and natural philosophy and law and literature especially poetry and music which were very
prominently and creatively pursued in the Islamic world.
There is an analog of all of this happening in China as well and by this time by the 7th
8th century India has developed an extraordinary competence especially in the branch of mathematics
that we came to call algebra and had schools for mathematical training that were in existence
in what in the West is called the Dark Ages.
The Catholic Church also had a school system, at a minimum they needed to educate people
to become priests and also in order to provide the basic civil service needs of the government
so there were local monastic schools which taught reading and writing to anyone who wanted
to send their children there to learn that and the fees were very modest and there were
larger cathedral schools, obviously regional schools that went up to the next level of
education and these were typically where you learned enough skills in reading and writing
and mathematics or arithmetic I should say so that you could provide certain functions
in the society which were very limited in the period in question.
I'm talking here roughly speaking from 500 to about a thousand.
There were law schools and medical schools in Salerno and Montpellier, Montpellier in
France and Salerno in Italy that were certainly in existence by the 10th century and especially
in the area of medicine were using knowledge that was transferred from the Islamic world
where medicine was pursued very aggressively but primarily using the text of the Greek
Galen who in the second century in the Roman Empire period developed a medical theory that
was as dominant in medicine until the 16th century as Ptolemy's theory in astronomy
was dominant until Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton in the 16th and 17th centuries.
So, but what happened in the 12th century was that the inflow of students into several
cathedral schools and into several of the leading professional schools for some reason,
some of which I'll talk about in the next lecture, increased to the extent that the
university was invented as a way of accommodating the demand for what's called a higher education
and in particular in two places of Bologna and Paris depending on whether you come from
one or the other city you think your city had the first university they've been arguing
about this for about 800 and some years now but at roughly the same time in the second
half of the 12th century both Paris and Bologna developed universities and the university idea
caught on extremely quickly and spread so that by 1400 there were dozens of universities
all over Western Europe extending from Oxford and Cambridge and England to Krakow in Poland
well that's or we're talking Central Europe now all the way to Central Europe but the
concentration was overwhelmingly in Western and Southern Europe the leading early universities
in addition to Paris and Bologna included Salamanca and Spain and Padua and Italy Cologne
in Germany and this is a very interesting social phenomenon the fact that the university
spread so quickly is a sign of the pressure from the social context to create these universities
to make these university once the idea of the university had been formulated and institutionalized
the university the medieval university which at a certain level has not changed all that
much right down to the present university of the medieval university was divided into
four faculties four clusters of professors who were who lectured in four different areas
there was the faculty of philosophy the faculty of medicine the faculty of law and the faculty
of theology now law medicine and theology are self-explanatory and they were in a certain
sense you know that they had they had they served specialized needs the philosophy faculty
was a grab bag and in fact until the 19th century when the university when the when the philosophy
faculty fragmented into what we recognize as the modern departments of physics chemistry
biology and then of course the liberal arts departments and the social science departments
it was the case that in the middle in the medieval university and until the 19th century if you were
not studying law medicine or theology you were studying what was broadly considered philosophy
it means that secular wisdom that's secular learning and the university is part of this
12th century renaissance this cultural dynamism was driven I am going to argue overwhelmingly
by secular values within a religious context without denying the the spiritual dominance
of the church at the time there was an upsurge of of social pressure to make life better
and one expression of this that is particularly that is particularly important to to modern to
understanding modern science and modern science's ability to change the world is the university
next lecture we're going to talking about technology and industry but now the university
because using this methodology of reverse engineering the ability of modern science to be
a driver of change in the world we see in the 19th century that the university became
a center for scientific research which it had not been for centuries before the 19th century
and in the 20th century this became increasingly the case so that today we take it for granted
that the university especially in the united states and western europe that the university is
a primary center for the generation of new knowledge where did the universe how did the
university come to be there in the 19th century to be able to play that role that's because the
idea of the university was invented in the 12th century and the university as a as an institution
was created at that time and its mission was secular to advance secular knowledge
the church recognized the potential threat that this represented and the and the inconsistency
with putting such a high value on secular knowledge compared to salvation for example
spiritual knowledge and salvation and the church regularly attempted to control to monitor and to
control what was going on in the medieval university but interestingly did not attempt to shut them
down and it may be that they were just socially politically and economically too important in
the centers each one of these universities on average universities had thousands of students
so that taken together dozens of of universities meant that there were by certainly by the 13th
century they were there were probably at least 100 000 students at the various universities all
over europe and they represented a very substantial revenue stream for the towns in which they were
concentrated and and they also represented a very important pool of resources of labor resources
because what was happening at the same time is of course the beginnings of the modern nation
states of europe the beginnings of england and france and italy and germany and uh and uh the
countries that became belgium and holland etc and to the extent that the civil governments became
increasingly large and challenged the notion that europe is basically uh organized under the
umbrella of the catholic church the pope's political claims were increasingly challenged
in the course of the middle in the course of the middle ages so those those governments needed
more civil servants and the universities turned out doctors lawyers and and civil servants of
of of all kinds in addition to educating large numbers of people who had a gift for and who enjoyed
studying philosophy and within philosophy natural philosophy what we understand by science so the
philosophy faculty was a fundamentally secular faculty everybody was religious all the pre all
of the professors were priests you could not become a professor if you were not uh for uh
ordained the church was quite sensitive to this and the society recognized that this was an issue
the uh the the degree structure in the university considerably emulates the uh the the structure
of certification for a guild so for example a bachelor's degree means that you have a certain
amount of of uh of knowledge analogous to an apprentice somebody who has who has served an
apprenticeship a master's degree in spite of the word master the word this apprenticeship means that
you are really analogous to a journeyman you are certified to have much more knowledge than a bachelor
but you're not ready yet to profess you can't be trusted to teach new material to teach interpretations
a doctor of philosophy the doctorate degree meant you were like a master in a guild so
the guild structure was you served an apprenticeship at a certain point your master decided that you
were competent in the basic skills so then you became a journeyman that's like having a that
that's like being a master's candidate in at the university a journeyman went around to different
masters and picked up more advanced skills did a project analogous to a master's thesis which was
not original but showed that they were good enough they were good enough to set up on their own and
then when they they when they produced a piece of original work when they made something that was
impressive in that particular gold in that particular guild so for example in the gold
smiths guild if you made a piece of gold jewelry jewelry that impressed the other masters then
they would give you the equivalent of your doc then you could become a master and you could set up
your own shop analogously once you had the doctorate then you could be trusted to lecture
and and it was much a character reference as an intellectual reference because once you're sitting
in front of hundreds of young students and interpreting let's say a literary text playdough
Aristotle well not playdough his texts were not known in the middle ages Aristotle or
interpreting a biblical text interpreting the song of songs you could do a lot of damage to
the minds and souls of the students so the having the the professorships were were held by people
who were ordained so i'm not suggesting here that that that the secular character of the
university was was a a reaction against religion it was an assertion of the autonomy of secular
and intellectual values together with religious values and this was very problematic for initially
for the church so i think that a theme that i want to explore here for a moment is the autonomy
of the intellectual vis-a-vis the spiritual this is a tension between reason and faith
in the context of a faith-based society so it's not a war between science and religion
in the sense that one rejects the values of the other within the framework of a faith-based
society in the 12th 13th 14th century there was an explicit tension between among those religious
intellectuals all of whom consider themselves to be loyal sons of the catholic church between
those religious individuals who also asserted the power of reason that intellectual endeavors
were legitimate now an expression of this of this tension is to be found in the relationship
between the philosopher peter abelard and the great churchman bernard of claire vote
bernard relatively unknown today outside of catholic circles was one of the most powerful
figures of the 12th century in part because he was he inherited the leadership i'm not inherited
he he became the head of the cistercian monastic movement and the cisterns who were found were
founded in the late 11th century wound up in the course of the middle ages building 742 monasteries
all over europe all of them built to a central plan adapted to the local environment of course but
built to a central plan and and almost all of them using water power very intensively so that
they were little industrial sites and and they did very well financially and most of them so he
was very powerful he was the head of a very successful and far-flung monastic monastic order
but he was also in his own right a prominent intellectual and very politically influential
in and papal circles bernard attacked peter abelard who was the most prominent philosophical
intellectual in paris on the eve of the creation of the university of paris attracting at least
hundreds and if we believe him thousands of students to his lectures on philosophy and theology
and bernard reacted against the claim that you could use reason as abelard claimed you could
even to explain the mysteries of the catholic church so in order to defend the integrity of
the faith bernard attacked this claim that reason was the power that human beings had to arrive at
truth not revelation not the word of god but the deductive consequences of the kinds of premises
that you get from reading philosophy abelard was steeped in the aristotelian tradition the text
of Aristotle were becoming available to the universe to the medieval university to the
medieval thinkers of the 12th century and eventually became the standard text of the
university 50 years after abelard the text of play dough for historical reasons were not available
for another 300 years so that for almost 400 years so that while they knew about play dough
and and had had some commentaries on play dough there were almost no platonic texts only a fragment
of one text called the time is which deals with the creation of the world according to Pythagorean
principles physical mathematical physical principles are none of the other platonic texts
were available until until the renaissance so abelard was defending an intellectual position
that through philosophy through deductive reasoning we can discover all the truths that
there are necessary to this including the truths of religion and bernard hounded abelard bringing him
to trial as a heretic over and over again for teaching such things for example as that ultimately
everybody goes to heaven nobody is condemned eternally to hell for teaching that human beings
by their own effort are capable of being good and so to speak getting out from under the thumb
of original sin and these were clearly doctrines that the catholic church needed to needed to oppose
and so bernard opposed peter and made his life quite a hell abelard also made his own life
held through his own efforts you may know the story of abelard and elwes but uh i don't want
to digress onto that the university emerges in the second half of the 12th century and it didn't
create the demand it was responding to a demand and the demand was for an institution that would
transmit secular learning that where people could study texts and study ideas and where did the
material come from it was overwhelmingly the textual material that came from Greece and Rome
had been generated back from the days of euclid and Aristotle and Ptolemy's theory the the standard
textbooks the standard subjects were logic astronomy mathematical theory of music euclid's
elements of geometry and roman law so that the roman law typically meant the roman law corpus the
so-called corpus juris civilis of the of justinians time same justinian that set that closed down
the pagan academies of Aristotle and Plato and in Athens that that collection of roman law together
with commentaries on that became the standard text not just for the law schools but they were
also also studied in the philosophy faculty but overwhelmingly the curriculum was based on the
study of texts from the greek period and from the greco-roman period because not much had been written
in the intervening period from about 400 until 1100 there were now in the 12th century actually
started a little earlier than that but in the 12th century there were now christian thinkers
who were who were doing philosophy and writing new books which came to be the subject matter
were incorporated into the curriculum and and increasingly it wasn't just a matter of mastering
greek learning it was also a matter of mastering the learning of the latest thinkers like peter
abbey lord for example and and lots and lots of others it is interesting to note that at the same
time in the same in this roughly speaking the same time period the 12th and 13th centuries
that the university was created in the in western europe that there was this
aggressive assertion of the power of reason in the in a faith-based community the power of
truth arrived at by reason and not only by revelation that this same phenomenon was also
taking place in islam and in judaism because roughly speaking well a generation after abbey lord
you have the avaroes and maimonides avaroes in the in the islamic world creating a rationalized
philosophically based version of islam and maimonides doing the same thing in judaism both of
those figures intensely controversial in their respective cultures condemned in their respective
cultures by pietists so so-called right-wingers as we would we would say today who recognize that
this attempt to put reason on a par with faith was fundamentally destructive of faith that's one
thing second it is important to recognize that the medieval university's teaching of philosophy
had to be based on the platonic Aristotelian notion that knowledge was deductive that was universal
necessary and certain and that we had to base knowing on deduction because only universal
necessary and certain knowledge had a right to stand up to truth by revelation if all you're
offering me is probabilities how can i put that on a par with what god has revealed with god's
revealed word if you're going to say that reason is capable of giving us a knowledge that is on a
par with revelation which even thomas equinus the pholong the so to speak official philosopher the
catholic church comes very close to saying what says then it's got to be knowledge it can't be
probability it's got to be now certainty and so the university philosophical curriculum
embodied this idea of knowledge and incorporated it not just in the teaching of philosophy but in
in the teaching of natural philosophy as well and we find of the the roots of 17th century
scientific revolution are already starting to to grow and spread in the context of the medieval
university with its secular orientation there are two points that i want to to raise here one to
remind you of the problem of universals which i talked about in an earlier lecture which immediately
became relevant because if we're going to claim we have that human reason can can achieve universal
necessary and certain knowledge then we've got to be able to know the truth of universals how can
the human mind know the truth of universals what is the logical status of universal statements
of a statement of the form all crows are black all humans are mortal what is the status how can
we possibly know the the the truth of a universal statement given that experience is always particular
and limited and the responses to this this was an incredibly controversial and lively thing that
people that people could have had talks if they were talk shows at the time they would have been
populated by people attacking each other because they took different positions on universals but
everyone agreed that the key to knowledge was universals you had to be able to establish the
truth of universals and these debates heavily influence which took place from roughly speaking
1100 to 1350 uh uh heavily influenced the methodology that was developed in the 17th century
that we will talk about as the methodology underlying the rise of modern science the second
point that i want to make is to call attention to the extent to which ideas that were subsequently
crucial to modern science became articulated and developed in the context of the medieval
university let me point out that historically it is not the case that the founders of modern science
were uh were university professors it's not like today where you sort of expect a serious
scientist to be have a university appointment and not to be working for an industrial corporation
although some do and especially those that used to have industrial research laboratories that
supported pure research like bell labs but that's pretty much gone by the wayside the
Galileo and Newton both had university professorships but Descartes didn't and Christian Huygens didn't
and and Spinoza didn't and Leibniz didn't just to mention four great figures in uh in the 17th
century that were played a major role in the creation of modern science the the point that I
want to make about the study of natural philosophy in the in middle ages is that the the i what was
what was made a principle of the philosophical study of nature science at the time was the
Aristotelian notion that nature is a closed system that natural phenomena can only be explained in
terms of other natural phenomena it is inappropriate it is not permitted to refer to supernatural
phenomena in order in order to explain natural phenomena the idea that is through experience
and experiment that didn't observe this very often but they at least claimed that it is only
experience and experiment that can justify claims to knowledge of nature and the idea that you've
got to use mathematics to you to uh in order to reveal the underlying structure and order of
natural phenomena which we recognize as an echo of Pythagoreanism these ideas uh will become uh
explicitly coupled to the rise of modern science in the late Renaissance and the 17th century
but meanwhile we need to turn to a collateral expression of the creation of the university
which we will do in the next lecture
