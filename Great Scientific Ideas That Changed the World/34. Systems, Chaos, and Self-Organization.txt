In the previous two lectures, we saw how a single term could refer to three very different
ideas.
In lecture 32, for example, we saw how the term computer can refer either to a human
being whose job it is to make mathematical calculations or to a machine that was designed
in order to make automatic mathematical calculations or to what we really mean by the computer,
that is to say a universal simulation machine as I tried to describe that.
In lecture 33, we saw how the term information is used routinely to refer to content, as
example, the content in a book, the information that you get from a book or a telephone message.
It is also refers to Claude Shannon's mathematical theory of communication, which has no reference
to content whatsoever, which is content neutral, content independent, and yet has become the
basis for a suite of powerful technologies that surround us and that we use every day.
And finally, the term information has become in physics over the last quarter century increasingly
promoted as a feature of reality, that in fact in the extreme that the universe is an information
structure.
In this lecture, I want to talk about one multifaceted complex idea that is referred to by three
different names.
So we have just the sort of the inverse of the phenomenon that we saw in the previous
two lectures.
The three different names are systems theory, chaos theory, which many of its students now
prefer to call complexity theory, and the theory of self-organizing systems.
These are really three facets of a single complex idea, their interrelated ideas, so that they
really correspond to one family or cluster of ideas, but there is no single name that
refers to them.
I'm going to refer to them very broadly as systems.
Be a system is the overarching idea.
All chaos theory requires that what is behaving chaotically be a system, and self-organizing
systems are obviously systems.
So not all systems are chaotic, not all systems are self-organizing, but the self-organization,
chaos or complexity, and the systems idea are all intimately interconnected, and they
have over the past 20 or 30 years become so fundamentally embedded in all of our scientific
and technological thinking.
It's so much integrated into our scientific theory construction and into the way we implement
technologies that it's hard to imagine today how it can have been an innovation to have
been thinking in terms of systems, but we'll appreciate that when we recognize the contrast
between systems thinking and the atomistic style of thinking that we have seen grew to
be so powerful a foundation for scientific theories across disciplines in the 19th and
early 20th century.
Systems thinking is almost the mirror image of atomistic thinking.
Systems thinking is sort of the convergence of process style thinking, of structure, the
idea of structure that we discussed that emerged in 19th century chemistry initially, and the
idea of relationships being physically real entities that have causal consequences.
Systems is an expression, the systems idea is an expression of process thinking, and it is
another illustration of recognizing the power of structure or form and relationships.
When we think of a system, we're thinking of a group of parts that are mutually adapted to
one another in relation to the functioning of that whole assembly of parts.
So there is a top down character to a system that is not present in atomistic style thinking,
which is bottom up thinking about nature.
In the case we've seen this so many times now, it's essentially the atomistic style of thinking
is essentially a Lego style of thinking that you build up reality out of fundamental units
that have fixed properties.
When you put them together, you can see how the properties of different pieces fit together
in order to generate the world as we understand it.
Each part can be studied in isolation from its relationships to any other part because
relationships as we saw in an earlier lecture were conceived to be in a sense accidental.
They were secondary phenomena.
The important thing is to identify, to make an inventory of all of the fundamental bits
in nature and their properties and then we will be able to synthesize nature out of those bits.
Systems thinking says, oh no, you can't do that because even though it looks like the parts in this system
are the same as the parts in that system, parts in a system must be analyzed only in relationship
to the way they fit into the whole.
To understand the system, you have to understand the functioning of the whole.
You can't start from the bottom and build your way up.
You have to know from the beginning what the function of this system is, how it operates,
how it's supposed to operate in order to understand whether the individual parts are properly designed,
properly functioning, have the proper relationship to one another.
So this conception of system is really a very different way of thinking about nature
and it turns out a very different way of thinking about technology than the atomistic style of thinking.
It is a kind of maturation of the process style of thinking that we saw began to emerge in the 19th century
with the ideas that we discussed, for example, of energy, of the field, of evolution as a process
and here we have, especially after World War II, this growing recognition that we really need to start recognizing
that nature is composed of systems and not composed of fundamental units that have been put together in any old way.
So systems are characterized when we have the sort of folk saying that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
That is the central characteristic of a system.
The system has characteristics, the system has properties that are not possessed by its parts.
The parts have properties and those parts interact with the other parts, but they do not have the properties that the system possesses.
This is, for example, present even in a simple molecule.
A simple molecule like sodium chloride has properties that neither sodium possesses nor chlorine possesses.
That's pretty obvious since chlorine is a toxic gas, sodium is a metal that reacts explosively with water
and yet when you put sodium chloride into your blood, which is mostly water, then it doesn't explode
and the gas that is chlorine does not bubble through your body and harm you.
So sodium chloride has properties that are not present and could not be predicted from sodium by itself, chlorine by itself.
If we jump to the other extreme and think of a molecule like DNA, DNA has properties that the individual molecules,
that submolecules that make up DNA, the sugars and the phosphates and the four bases that carry the genetic code, as we say,
they do not have properties that the entire DNA molecule has and that's quite interesting because it turns out,
and this is very typical for a system, the formal structure of the system is very important to the properties that the system displays.
So, for example, it is the sequence of the bases within the DNA molecule that determines whether the organism is going to be an ant or a sheep or a human being.
The bases are the same in the ant, the sheep and the human being, but the sequence, the relationships among the bases,
give the DNA molecule in an ant, in a sheep, in a human being different properties than they would otherwise have.
So that's a beautiful illustration of how structure, form, relationships are embedded in this idea of systems
which have distinctive properties not possessed by the individual elements.
Since I mentioned ants, think of an ant colony, an extraordinarily complex system in that, in a simple case,
the ant colony is made up of worker bees that live out their lives in the nest,
foraging worker ants that live out their lives inside the nest, forager ants that roam around bringing food back to the nest
and warrior ants that protect the nest and protect the foraging ants.
Now, if you go and every species of ant has a distinctive ratio among the warrior ants, the foraging ants and the worker ants,
this is a function of the individual species and so whatever proportion it is,
if you go into an ant colony and you scoop out a bunch of ants,
very disruptive and probably politically incorrect thing to do, if you do that within hours,
the ants start to reconfigure themselves to restore the appropriate proportion,
proportions among worker ants, foraging ants and warrior ants characteristic of that species.
Very, very interesting phenomenon since there is no central authority that is determining that.
Somehow the relationships among those ants are such that those relationships cause changes
in the embryological development and the physiological development of the ants
because the warrior ants are much bigger than the foraging ants
which are bigger than the worker ants that stay behind in the nest.
So here we have an ant colony, bees are another example of that of course,
any social creature like termites and of course like human beings is going to display systemic properties
that are not possessed by the individuals and those systemic properties, those so-called emergent properties.
You see the system has a holistic character, the system is not simply a collection of parts,
it has a character of its own, that's what holism refers to,
that displays properties that are distinctive only when the system is functioning properly
and those are called emergent properties, they only emerge at the level of the system.
Notice that nature is pervasively systemic, that all around us, now that we become alert to this idea,
we recognize that nature is pervasively systemic, that for example a cell is a collection of subsystems
that they are within the cell, just to sort of very, very briefly,
so you've got the nucleus is a subsystem, you've got the extra nuclear bodies like mitochondria,
the Krebs cycle that generates ATP that provides the energy for all cellular metabolic processes,
the Krebs cycle is a kind of a system within a subsystem within the cell,
so the cell is a collection of subsystems, this is sometimes referred to as the concept of modularity,
that there are modular subsystems that make up systems within nature
and Herbert Simon has given a very powerful argument of why from an evolutionary basis this makes a great deal of sense,
that evolution can explain why in fact nature has a hierarchical systemic character,
that it is made up of a hierarchy of systems, subsystems, subsystems and the basic units so to speak
are modules and sometimes modules within modules because the cell itself which is clearly a collection of these modules,
the DNA in the nucleus, the RNA, the ribosomes, I mentioned the mitochondria,
the Krebs cycle which is a relational structure rather than a single physical body,
a very complex series of reactions that has to take place with the atoms are interacting in mutually adapted ways
in order to wind up generating the ATP molecule, the ATP molecule by itself can be considered a submodule,
you can get dizzy from this, but the cell itself is a module within the tissue,
the tissue is a module within the organ, the organ is a module, a modular system within the total organism,
the organism, us for example, we are modules within our community,
the community of human beings is a module within the total environmental system that makes up the planet,
the planet itself we have begun to understand is a collection of interconnected systems,
collection maybe is not the wrong word, it's not sufficiently dynamic, that the planet itself is a system,
so for example plate tectonics theory has shown us again only since the 1960s that the crust of the earth,
the mantle underlying the crust, the liquid core surrounding the solid core,
that all of those elements, the solid core, the liquid core surrounding it, the mantle extending for thousands of miles
up to just below the surface of the earth and the crust that makes up the continent and the ocean beds
are all interconnected in dynamic ways, the welling up of mantle material pushes the ocean floor apart,
when the ocean floor hits the continents it goes down back into the mantle,
the mantle sinks down to the point where the mantle interacts with the liquid core and then shoots back up
and eventually forms new ocean floor in a cycle that takes about 100 million years between any piece of ocean floor
comes back to the ocean floor again, the oceans, the atmosphere and this plate tectonic theory of the earth
from the surface down to the core constitute a system so that we understand that a phenomenon like global warming
can only be understood in the context of this total system and of course one can recognize that the planet itself
is a subsystem within the solar system which is itself within the, you get the idea, the Milky Way
and you eventually build up to the entire universe, so this system idea, nature really is pervasively systemic
it has, at every level, we see that to really understand the, any feature of nature, we need to think of it
in terms of its systemic character, how, what relationships there are among the parts that we identify,
how those parts themselves constitute systems and how those parts are mutually adapted to one another
so that when you tinker with one part, you are not merely improving that part
you are changing perhaps the way it functions within the total system
and here's an interesting feature about systems that we're going to be pursuing in a moment
and that is artificial systems, for example, the, an automobile is a system of mutually adapted parts
the engine is one modular subsystem and within the engine one can think of the pistons and the cylinders and the valves, etc
in, in artificial systems the mutual adaptation of the parts is a reflection of deliberate design decisions
a designer who understood that the purpose of this car is to be a racing car
has deliberately designed the parts of the engine system, for example
so that they can function in the ways that a racing car engine needs to function
as opposed to the way that the parts of a family sedan needs to function, have its engine function
so, for example, tinkering with the valves of a family sedan engine
by simply replacing them with valves from a racing car is not going to improve the performance of the family sedan engine
because those valves are not properly adapted to, for example, the valve gear and to the pistons
and to the shape of the combustion chamber, etc
in nature this mutual adaptation of parts is not deliberate as far as we can tell
in fact it is the appearance of deliberate design decisions in nature
that has led to those people to believe in intelligent design
in the 19th century, George Cuvier at the very beginning of the 19th century
faced with the challenge of putting together fossil bones that had been dug up
and which he was presented as a national professor of zoology
that Cuvier developed this idea that the parts of an animal, the bones of an animal
are mutually adapted to one another and to the function of the animal as a whole
so, for example, if the animal is a predator animal
then it's going to have certain kinds of skeletal structure in order to be able to succeed
in hunting and killing its prey
if it's a prey animal there will be a different kind of relational structure among the bones
and using this principle, which he developed of course in more detail
he was able to start putting these bones together because they didn't come nicely packaged
you see when you dug them up they were just a mishmash of bones
and how do you know which one belongs to the victim and which one belongs to the predator
the Darwin Wallace theory of evolution has as its perhaps most distinctive character
an explanation of how you can have the appearance of design without a designer
and we talked about that when we talked about the theory of evolution
and that is what makes the theory of evolution objectionable to some
who don't want to give up the idea that there is a designer
but that is a powerful aspect of the theory of evolution that scientifically speaking
it explains design, the emergence of what looks like deliberate design decisions
let's call it randomly or I prefer spontaneously
and we'll talk about that when we get to self-organizing systems in a couple of minutes
now one of the kinds of systems in nature that displays this kind of
it's called a natural phenomenon that displays this kind of systemic character is weather
so we talk about weather systems but often don't think of what the term system means
in the context of talking about weather systems
so a hurricane is a weather system for example and it is clearly, it has a structure
it is stable over some period of time, at least days and sometimes a week or two
and the hurricane maintains itself as a distinctive kind of weather system
over long distances and fairly substantial periods of time
and it was in the analysis of weather that the second idea that I mentioned
the idea of chaos emerged in 1963 when a meteorologist named Edward Lawrence
was running what was then considered super-duper state-of-the-art computer models of the atmosphere
which is extremely difficult to model because of the complex interactions
very characteristic of a system if you approach it as a system
then very complex interactions of the factors that determine the weather
so humidity and atmospheric pressure and winds and surface temperatures
over the ocean, over the land, the sunlight, cloud cover, etc
and what Lawrence noticed was something that startled him and startled everyone else too
which was that his models, these computer models of the atmosphere
were exquisitely sensitive to the initial conditions that you put into the equations for the model
if he varied the initial conditions by as little as one one thousandth
if he changed something from one mile an hour to one mile and one thousandth of a mile an hour
if he changed the wind velocity then he could get a totally different weather pattern
in a few days later than if he had not modified it by one one thousandth
and this was astonishing because classically just as there is this kind of predilection in modern science
for the atomistic style of thinking there has been ever since the 17th century
a predilection for linear modeling in science
that is to say a linear assumption is that a small change in the input leads to a small change in the output
and the equations that scientists use have this or they strive to have this linear character
because linear equations are much easier to solve than nonlinear equations
linear behavior is much easier to model than nonlinear behavior
and within a broad range those models work
another predilection that we have seen again and again is the assumption that natural phenomena
are all in a sense striving to get to equilibrium
they want to settle down once and for all
and the combination of linearity and equilibrium is very distinctively characteristic of modern science
from the 17th century into the 20th century
but what Lorenz was saying was that there is a high degree of nonlinearity
of dynamism in atmospheric systems
that here is a system in which the output can change dramatically if there is a tiny change in the input
you may have heard of what's called the butterfly effect which he wrote about as a kind of a joke
but that a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil and it rains in New York
because even that tiny little change in air pressure caused by the fluttering of the butterfly's wings
this is not meant literally
can ramify and lead to a dramatically different weather pattern
several days later and thousands of miles away
now Lorenz's insight was picked up over the next 20 years approximately
but especially during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s
by a range of scientists, mathematicians, biologists, economists, physicists
and what they discovered was when they looked into the mathematics
they could find mathematical equations describing systems of this sort
that what emerged was while the behavior in these systems is not linear
it is not periodic, it does not follow a simple repeating pattern
it is not predictable in the traditional sense
we cannot predict where any given molecule of oxygen in the atmosphere is going to be three days later
nevertheless there's a kind of order that emerges
it's a new kind of order that emerges in these chaotic systems
now they're not truly chaotic because they do have a mathematical structure, a mathematical form
and they have a kind of order that is not traditional
but it does have an orderliness to it that is very marked
so for example you can use these equations to show how the branching of the lungs develops in the human body
lungs look sort of like an upside down tree stripped of its leaves
how the brain, how the neurons develop in the brain
spreading out within the embryo
how the huge number of neurons in the brain spreads out in a pattern
it's been applied to economic theory to modeling stock market fluctuations
it turns out that nature is rich with non-linear systems, chaotic systems
whose behavior has an order distinctive from the traditional deterministic order
that was characteristic of 17th, 18th, 19th century science
remember how we talked about statistical laws as what seemed like an oxymoron initially
but in fact we came to understand that statistical patterns could have a lawful character
even though they were not deterministic in the traditional sense
in chaos theory which as I said its proponents often prefer to call complexity theory
you can have systems where the relationships are such
that they are exquisitely sensitive to tiny variations in the values of the elements of that system
and as a result the behavior of the system, the large scale behavior of the system
can be very different than you had anticipated because you were either unaware of
or you had not thought that such a small change could ramify and have such a big change
not unlike to be a little facetious when congress writes up a bill with the best of intentions
and then three years later it turns out that there are totally unexpected consequences
because that small change in the wording of one law then was seen to have tremendous social
and political and economic consequences down the line
now the one feature of the weather system that brings chaos theory into the domain of self-organization
is that natural systems all self-organize, there's no one else to organize them
so for example a hurricane emerges spontaneously nobody said now it's time for a hurricane
let's do this and this and this in order to make the conditions for a hurricane right
a hurricane emerges is a structure, it's an orderly structure within the framework of chaos theory
it has the kind of order that the equations of chaos theory describe
that a hurricane is an orderly structure that emerges spontaneously
now in the 1960s and 70s the chemist Ilya Prigozhin had become a major champion of this idea of self-organization
as a fundamental feature of natural phenomena
and he showed that there are chemical systems in which basically all you have to do is mix the ingredients
stir them and peculiar stable structures will form all by themselves
some of them moderately complex for a simple chemical system
but then there are more complex chemical systems and then there are physical systems and biological systems
and I mentioned the atmosphere so where the structures are really complex
and are stable over long periods of time and they emerge spontaneously
now this is a really dramatic new focus in science because of course in the 19th century
with the rise of thermodynamics as we discussed in that lecture
the concept of entropy was that orderliness runs down over time
the expectation was that physical systems run down over time
that the idea that order can emerge spontaneously in nature requires a reconception
of what we mean by entropy and Prigozhin was very central to that
the reason why I call it a new focus in physics and not say a new invention is because
Prigozhin did not invent this idea he became the champion of it and he developed it scientifically
in a way that led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize
but in fact back in the early 1950s
John Holland and Arthur Samuel who at that time were working for IBM
began first to develop the idea of spontaneously emerging order
within computer models that they were developing
which came to be called genetic algorithms in the form of which John Holland was interested in them
and he then became a major figure within the complexity theory, self-organization theory school
there's an institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico called the Santa Fe Institute
which is devoted to these kinds of studies and he's a principal figure there
has been a principal figure there from the time it was started
Arthur Samuel was interested in writing a computer program that could learn
and he did and he wrote a computer program that in the 1950s became the world checkers champion
John Holland wrote computer programs that could display spontaneous learning
so this idea that order can emerge spontaneously out of the interactions
of relatively simple elements that observe simple rules of interaction
that you can be surprised to discover the kinds of order that emerge
and how stable these orderly structures can sometimes be
was a very powerful insight
but it really came to fruition in the 1970s and after
when there was this convergence of systems thinking
of chaos theory and of self-organization
now this is a profoundly new mindset for scientists
which has become so interwoven with our theories today
so interwoven with our expectation from the way we use technology
that while it's invisible to us it is in fact actively affecting such things as the internet
for example it is certainly central to dealing with an issue like global warming
we are much more sensitive today to the complexity of the environment as a system
the whole notion that the earth is a system at the level of the environment
and that global warming is a feature of the way we have changed elements
of the earth's environmental system
without thinking of the consequences on the functioning of the whole
all of these are illustrations of how systems thinking together with the recognition
that self-organization is a fundamental feature of nature
in fact the most marvelous expression of self-organization
is the formation of the human embryo
which again spontaneously emerges out of the kinds of interactions
nonlinear interactions that are characteristic of the fertilized egg
and its subsequent development
how do we deal with this recognition
how do we begin, well that's what science today increasingly
is attempting to model systems and systems behavior
understanding the logic of hierarchical system structures
which are characteristic of nature
of almost all natural phenomena
and also technological systems
that technological systems, the telephone system
the electrical grid network in the United States
the internet that I mentioned
these are complex systems
and now we're trying to understand them at the level of systems
and because the functionality of these systems is so fundamental to the way we live our lives
I suggest that this complex multifaceted idea of systems theory
complexity slash chaos theory and self-organization theory
is one of the greatest scientific ideas of all time
and it is an idea that is revolutionizing what we mean by scientific knowledge
