Welcome to lecture nine on the Newtonian Revolution.
The Newtonian Revolution because Newton's Principia mark not only a major event in the
history of western science, but mark the initiation of a revolution in western culture.
It is not merely a scientific event, it is a cultural phenomenon as well.
As natural philosophy, the simplest way to understand Newton's Principia is that it was
a mathematical demonstration of the Copernican hypothesis that the sun, not the earth, was
at the center of the solar system as proposed by Kepler.
The mechanism consistent with Kepler's three laws of planetary motion.
No one had demonstrated that hypothesis or Kepler's posing of that hypothesis.
Newton's Principia provide the mathematical proof of the hypothesis in the minds of Newton's
contemporaries.
Let's note several obvious things about the Principia for one doesn't want to miss the
forest for individual trees.
One it is a profoundly empirical work.
It both in its practice and in the theory of knowledge that Newton propounds in its pages.
It tells us that we learn about nature from the empirical study of nature.
That we are to proceed inductively framing generalizations that are tentative claims
of knowledge whose force lies in their confirmation by experiment and further observation and
that are always subject to correction to emendation by later knowledge and by later experiment.
They are Newton tells us to be held as true only for so long as inductive evidence continues
to support them.
Two Newton's Principia are mechanistic that is to say the goal of the Principia the model
of knowledge the explanation of phenomena that works that holds the Principia together
that there are laws of mechanics governing the behavior of matter in motion.
In that sense Newton's Principia are the ultimate overthrow of scholastic physics.
The goal of scholastic physics in the context of scholastic metaphysics of that essentialistic
and teleological worldview of which we have spoken is to understand above all with ever
greater particularity how the motion and behavior of every particular moving entity
behaving or acting entity in the world expresses its particular nature its particular perfections
in essence its particular purposes.
The goal of Newton's physics is to have the most general law supported by data and experiment
and demonstration the most general law that explains not every particular act and behavior
by the properties and purposes of particular entities but that seeks explanation in terms
of matter in general of math in general and in terms not of the purposeful motions of
any particular object but of laws of motion in general.
So in these foundations in notions of mathematical order empiricism and generality Newton offers
to the world a simple formula that as he will put it allows me to explain the system of
the world.
It is simply that there is a force of gravity by which m over m excuse me m times m one
over d two operates throughout the physical world meaning that there is a force that varies
proportionally to any two masses whatsoever wherever they are in the universe and inversely
according to the squares of the distances between those two bodies m m one over d two
d squared m m one over d squared explained all of the then known phenomena of celestial
motions by the supposition of that force of gravitation that is an astonishing scientific
achievement the mathematics the observation the patients behind that formulation is a
singular scientific achievement but it is a cultural phenomenon as well for that formulation
m m one over d squared makes the world seem ordered and lucid and it made the human mind
seem capable of understanding the very architecture and design of God in nature think of it that
law is the wisdom of God made manifest throughout the natural world contemporaneous reaction
to Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica immediately let us understand that we are dealing with
so much more than a scientific phenomena Edmund Haley the celebrated astronomer penned and
owed that was published as a preface to Newton's Principia it ends with the words nearer to
the gods no mortal may approach nearer to the gods no mortal may approach when Newton
died in the early 18th century the great English poet Alexander Pope wrote Newton's epitaph
and Newton is buried in West Minster Abbey at the center of English religious and political
life his epitaph as penned by Alexander Pope nature and nature's laws lay hid in night
God said let Newton be and all was light nature and nature's laws lay hidden night God said
let Newton be and all was light in the 1730s the great French Enlightenment philosopher
Voltaire writing his letters from England to the French nation and explaining to them
what Newton had done and why they should prefer Newton though English to Descartes though French
in physics wrote Descartes put us on the road to truth Newton took us to the end of
that journey in the early 19th century Napoleon called the greatest astronomer in France to
his court and said will there ever be another Newton the reply sire there can be only one
Newton because there was only one universe to discover if one thinks about those reactions
to Newton one understands with great force that this is not simply a work of science of physics
of astronomy that it changes the human species sense of how you know the world of what you can
know about the world about whether that world is incomprehensible and we are doomed to fatalistic
ignorance about its structure or whether we may understand with comprehension the universe in
which we find ourselves it changes the culture sense of the powers of the human mind and of the
lucidity of God's creation Isaac Newton could not have achieved what he achieved alone he was
dependent upon the astronomical observations of Tico Bray and so many he was dependent upon
the dynamics and mechanics of Galileo he was dependent upon Descartes mathematical formulations
and indeed upon the notion of linear rather than natural circular inertia of linear inertia that
he took from Descartes but his synthesis that we could specify a force of gravity that acted as
the centripetal force consistent with the law governing falling bodies that pulled the heavenly
bodies into the orbits that Kepler had described is one of the most extraordinary scientific
synthesis of the history of the human mind now there is a paradox in the enthusiastic reception
of Newton almost no one could understand him the mathematics were so complex no one knew the
calculus and following Newton's arguments in terms that were not derived from the calculus
that was a business beyond almost anyone's mind but the popularizers who did understand Newton and
the writers of prefaces to Newton's work increasingly made it clear to Europe that Newton
through a method of induction and mathematics had derived the force that acted as the centripetal
force like the chain attached to the pendulum that explained the planetary system the heavenly
system opened to our gaze and that was wholly consistent with the law of falling bodies and
wholly consistent with three laws of motion that accounted for physical phenomena think back
to the Aristotelian scholastic system the imperfect earth mutable changing chaotic the immutable
heavens one of the obvious accomplishments of Newtonian physics for the West and mine is that it
linked all terrestrial and celestial phenomena we did not live in two realities governed in two
different ways we were not part of two systems created by God we lived in one physical universe
governed by uniform laws of nature and those who could not follow Newton's explanations and
proofs could follow one thing and understand its implications with full force the predictions
that followed from Newton's Principia held they were true on the basis of the Principia you would
predict Kepler's orbits and those orbits were consistent with all observation you could predict
planetary and celestial motions you could predict the return of comets and no small part of what
made people fully understand the drama of what Newton had accomplished for the first time in
human history you could predict the tides because the tides were explicable in terms of the moon's
gravity Newton also produced a very dramatic moment for Western science in the confrontation
between Newtonian and Cartesian natural philosophers and physicists think about the Cartesian assault
upon scholastic physics for the Cartesians the world was a mechanism in which matter communicated
force to matter by touching it in space by laws of mechanics and dynamics the Cartesians thought
they had rid Western philosophy of the Aristotelian imputation of secret forces that couldn't be
observed but that acted to express the perfections or qualities of things those were known as dorm
excuse me those were known as occult forces you couldn't see them but you knew from behavior
that they operated the Cartesians were certain that they had mechanized and rationalized our
understanding of the world and rid us forever of the Aristotelian occult forces that seem to them
an anti science an anti reason an anti mechanism if you look at anti Aristotelians of the 17th
century who mock the Aristotelians anti Aristotelians who mock them think of the great French playwright
Molière's play Le Med Saint Malgré Louis the medical doctor in spite of himself he has to take
his doctoral examination and he is asked why does opium put someone to sleep and he answers
because of its dormative power and the doctors say learned learned and pass him for his final
and highest degree there are the Cartesians mocking the Aristotelians why does opium put
one to sleep because of its dormative power that's no knowledge at all let's understand the physiology
what does opium do to the nervous system how does matter affect matter take away occult forces
and talk about the communication by matter to matter well how do the Cartesians read Newton
why do the planets hold their orbits because of the power of attraction
why is the moon an ellipse because of its power of attraction action at a distance how could that be
for the Cartesians there must be solid matter between all the planets in the earth and they
too are Copernicans and there must be whirlpools vortices of matter set into motion by the rotation
of the planets by the rotation of the sun all of which bring about the solar system and we must
find the mechanisms by which matter directly touches matter and communicates force and what is
Newtonian gravity but an occult force action at a distance initially Newton wants to know
how does gravity communicate itself Newton wants to know from what properties of matter
is gravity derived but there are no answers there and Newton and the Newtonians make a virtue
out of necessity and change the nature and scope of western science forever it is not our job to
explain why nature is as it is it is not our way to explain even in what ways
forces come to be in the world it is the job of science to explain that a certain force exists
operates and accounts for phenomena but what is gravity newton is asked what does it come from
how does it communicate itself how do things affect each other at a distance
Newton answers known finger hypothesis I do not feign hypotheses absent knowledge I will not make
up a hypothesis I will admit ignorance I do not know why gravity should be I do not know how
gravity communicates from one body to another I know that it is a force that exists and operates
in nature and accounts for the phenomena and indeed Newton and the Newtonians find that many
other of their goals are fulfilled in this debate with the Cartesians if you think back
to Descartes system in which he derives the law of inertia as a necessity given God's fixed and
immutable will from God as perfect Descartes deduces God's immutability from God's immutability
Descartes deduces that he sets matter into motion that he must set matter into motion according
to the fixed laws of mechanics for the Newtonians the inexplicability of why forces should be in
nature simultaneously recognizes the limits of human knowledge the need to admit ignorance
absent data but it also underscores God's omnipotence and freedom one does not as Descartes did by
metaphysics deduce what God must have done in the creation much as in the Baconian vision
one examines the creation with a recognition of human ignorance and divine omnipotence
and sets out to understand what God actually has wrought in the world secondly Descartes excuse me
Newton Newton profoundly believes in the culture profoundly will believe with him that his system
of philosophy offers proofs of God empirically and inductively from nature and indeed these proofs
will sweep away the appeal of the purely rationalist Cartesian proofs Newton interestingly enough
assumes a static universe we are looking at what was created we are looking at the solar system as it
always has been and Newton from the principle of gravity infers that there ought to be a
gravitational collapse of the universe all matter attracting all matter into a gravitational
collapse of almost incalculable density why hasn't that occurred Newton asks it hasn't occurred
because God obviously placed each planet each star each bit of matter in the universe and at
exactly those velocities that prevent a gravitational collapse so that we have absolute
proof from nature that we live in a universe designed by supreme wisdom Cartesian science to
the contrary says that in order to have an explanation you must posit a set of laws that
show you how we got to the world that we observe Newton posits the solar system and system of
the heavens we observe Descartes wants a physics without void without vacuum matter touching matter
everywhere that will give us the evolution of the system that we observe well Newton
has proven powerful in terms of the substantive physics and action at a void but the Cartesian
vision of an ultimate cosmology an ultimate explanation of how we got from the beginning
to the world that we observe remains a very potent part of the Cartesian legacy in the western
scientific imagination the most dramatic of Newton's legacies to the culture beyond the science
was of course the sense that one could see through nature to nature's laws and to the
author of those laws a god who wisely and providentially had designed the world this meant
that nature was lawful and that nature was knowable it meant not only that god had not intended us
to see through a glass darkly that god had not intended us to wander helpless without
knowledge in the world in which we found ourselves but that indeed all knowledge was a piety
all knowledge was a touching of god the greatest part of that legacy was the sense bequeathed
to western science and western culture that there was order and clarity in the physical world
in which we found ourselves think again on alexander popes couplet and its acceptance by pious
england for it is truly remarkable nature and nature's laws lay hidden night god said let
newton be and all was light the great confidence in the method caught up in this achievement
made newton's principia a paradigmatic work that is to say believing in what had been achieved by
the method used in this book believing in the power and the prediction given by the conclusions
of this book one accepts the method that made possible that achievement so that newton's
principia gives extraordinary prestige and value to a view of knowledge based upon observation
induction the mathematician of motion quantitative not qualitative knowledge predictive value
and experiment it was what bacon had foreseen about method god did not intend us for ignorance
we now had a method with which to use our minds and for many surely the task now was to extend
that method to the whole of human knowledge thank you very much
