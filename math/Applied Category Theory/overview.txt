1. **Natural Transformations**: A natural transformation between two functors F and G relates the action of F on an object to the action of G on that object in a way that respects the structure of the category (morphisms).

2. **Category of Matrices**: This is a category where objects are natural numbers (representing matrix sizes) and morphisms are matrices with entries from some field, which represent linear transformations (column operations) on vectors of that size.

3. **Elementary Column Operations**: There are three types of elementary column operations:
   - Permuting two columns.
   - Multiplying a column by a scalar.
   - Adding a scalar multiple of one column to another.

4. **Composite of Column Operations**: The composite of two column operations can be represented by the product of the matrices that represent these operations. This follows from the fact that matrix multiplication naturally composes linear transformations.

5. **Innate Lemma (Illustrated with Matrices)**: Every natural transformation between two functors is represented by a matrix in the category of matrices, which can be found by right multiplying the representing matrices of both functors and taking their product.

6. **Non-Example**: Not every operation on matrices is a natural column operation. Appending a column of ones is not a natural column operation because it does not satisfy the naturality condition (right multiplication does not yield the intended result).

7. **Dedication**: The author learned about this example from Fred Linton, who encouraged him to collaborate with David Spivak and provided a motivating story that led to the creation of the author's textbook on category theory. This email exchange is dedicated to Fred Linton for his invaluable assistance and encouragement.
