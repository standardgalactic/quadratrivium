Checking Foundations of Physics @Harvard/Jacob Barandes - ＂A New Formulation of Quantum Theory＂.txt
1. The Bohmian approach to quantum mechanics involves a pilot wave that guides particles through configuration space, and this is mathematically represented by the density matrix which encodes both initial probabilities and the time evolution of the system.

2. The wave function (or wave functions) in the context of the Bohmian approach can be considered an auxiliary tool that is not necessarily a physical entity but serves as a convenient mathematical representation for predicting outcomes and understanding the dynamics of the system.

3. The density matrix, which includes the pilot wave information, plays a central role in the Bohmian interpretation and has a nomic (natural law) interpretation, reflecting the probabilities and evolution of a system within this framework.

4. The Bohmian approach can be applied to any physical system by using an appropriate level of coarse-graining, which allows for the modeling of continuous or discrete systems based on our current understanding of reality.

5. While the Bohmian approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding well-known quantum systems, challenges remain when considering systems whose configuration spaces do not admit probability measures, and further work is needed to address these cases.

6. In the context of cosmology and large-scale probabilistic reasoning, coarse-graining does not necessarily solve all issues, as the problematics are complex and our understanding incomplete.

7. The session concluded with an invitation to stay tuned for the next speaker, Wayne Mirvold, who will continue the discussion on related topics. Follow-up questions from the audience are welcome, and attendees were encouraged to reach out if they had any further inquiries.

Checking Foundations of Physics @Harvard/James Ladyman - ＂What is Ontic Structural Realism？＂.txt
1. The conversation revolves around the discussion of ontological structures and their necessity in understanding the world, with a focus on objectivity in modality.
2. James Ladyman distinguishes between two positions: one that posits an objective modal structure to the world (which he associates with Brian McLaughlin and John Dupré) and another that denies such objective modality (which he attributes to Philip Kitcher, influenced by Thomas Hull).
3. James argues for realism and the importance of recognizing that scientific theories are not just collections of statements but also have a structure that reflects aspects of reality, including modalities like causation.
4. The debate touches on the nature of individuals and how they are distinguished from one another, which is relevant to discussions of ontology and realism.
5. James points out that quantum mechanics introduces entangled states that defy classical intuitions about separability and locality, suggesting a need for a more nuanced understanding of the structure of reality.
6. Guido's question during the Q&A session challenges whether objective modality is strictly necessary and whether one can maintain a coherent understanding of the world without it, referencing the work of Steve French and Tim Wardlin.
7. The conversation highlights the philosophical differences between those who believe in an objective reality with inherent modal structures and those who are more skeptical about the objectivity of such structures, emphasizing the importance of causation for human's perspective.
8. James Ladyman suggests that Van Fraassen's position may be circular because it relies on raising certain regularities to the status of laws without grounding why these particular regularities should be elevated over others.
9. The discussion ends with a brief summary from James and appreciation for the audience's engagement before taking a break.
