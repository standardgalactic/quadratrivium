1. **Theorem Statement**: If `pn` is an algebraic set of polynomials in `n` variables, then the Boolean operations (cap, cup, and complement) applied to sets `p` and `q` within `pn` will result in another element within `pn`. In other words, `pn` is closed under these operations.

2. **Proof Sketch**: To prove that `pn` is closed under cap, cup, and complement (also known as meet, join, and compliment), we need to show that if `pb bar` and `qb bar` are elements of `pn`, then their combination (in this case, the intersection) `pcapqb bar` is also an element of `pn`.

3. **Detailed Explanation**:
   - Given two functions `pb bar` and `qb bar` in `pn`, we have polynomials `p` and `q` such that `pb bar = p(bn)` and `qb bar = q(bn)`.
   - The intersection of `p` and `q`, denoted as `pcapq`, is a polynomial that can be expressed as the intersection of `p` and `q`'s evaluations on `bn`.
   - Since `pn` is closed under cap (intersection), `pcapq` belongs to `pn`.
   - Therefore, `pb bar cap qb bar` (or `pcapqb bar`) also belongs to `pn`, proving that `pn` is closed under cap.
   - Similarly, by considering the union and complement of sets `p` and `q`, we can show that `pn` is also closed under cup (union) and compliment (set difference or negation).

4. **Conclusion**: The set `pn` is closed under all Boolean operations (cap, cup, and complement), which means that applying these operations to any two elements within `pn` will yield another element within the same set `pn`.

5. **Notational Reminder**: The notation `pb bar cap qb bar` represents the intersection of the sets `p` and `q` when evaluated on the set `bn`, and it is equivalent to applying the intersection operation between `pb bar` and `qb bar`.

6. **Importance of Understanding Notations**: It is crucial for students to understand the notations and the relationship between polynomials, sets, and Boolean operations to grasp the concepts discussed in the class.

7. **Closing**: The class ends with a reminder to review these results and notations, ensuring a clear understanding of the material, and wishing everyone a good day.
