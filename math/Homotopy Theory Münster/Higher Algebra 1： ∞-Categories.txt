Hey, in this video you can learn about infinity categories. This is part of a
series of lectures we're doing on stable infinity categories and higher
algebra and it's intended so it can be watched somehow independently of the
rest of our course on topological cyclic homology. Infinity categories as
pioneered by Jolial, Luri and others are somehow a generalization of both
categories and the homotopy theory of spaces and they turn out to be somehow
a natural home for all kinds of derived phenomena. So in this video we will be
talking about some of the basic notions and the infinity category of spaces
we will give a very rough overview and omit basically all of the proofs some of
which are very hard so we encourage you to check out some of the very good
literature on the subject which we will be which we will be linking down in
the description of the video.
I'm Achim Krause from Mathematics MÃ¼nster. Before we can discuss categories we
have to mention size issues which is that if you want to consider for example
the category of all sets the collection of objects can't itself be a set
because this leads to usual paradoxes like Russell's paradox. So there are
multiple different solutions out of that. The one we will go with here is so
called Groten-Dick universes. So what we will do is we will assume
Groten-Dick universe
U and Groten-Dick universe simply means that this is a set whose subsets or
whose elements themselves form a model of set of C. So they're closed under
everything you can do to sets, products, power sets and so on. And we will basically
study objects in this universe so we will call elements of you simply small sets
and analogously you can in terms of small sets define stuff like small topological
spaces, small can complexes, all of that. And this has the advantage that now the
set of all small sets is itself a set. It's not itself small so we will
call sets in general if they're not necessarily small large sets and so if
you take the collection of all small things typically you leave this universe
but you're still in the world of sets. And so for us categories will typically
have large object sets and also potentially large morphism sets.
This is a little different from the classical definition of categories where one
requires the morphism sets to be small in some sense but this is basically
another partial solution to these size issues which come up and it doesn't solve
all of these things. It turns out that if you're willing to assume existence of
universes then you don't get much benefit from thinking about small locally small categories.
And for example when we now write something like set we mean the category of small sets.
Think of this just as a convenient way to discuss away these size issues.
Yeah there's other solutions but this is one of the more convenient ones.
All right so we now can define what an infinity category is and
infinity categories are special kinds of simplificial sets. An infinity category
is a large simplificial set
C with the property that any diagram
like this where this is the standard n-simplex this is the i-horn the n-i-horn this means
that this consists of all the faces of the n-simplex except for the the i-th one the one
opposite to the i-th vertex. Any such diagram for i strictly between zero and n
admits such a dash arrow so we will we will think of this as a map filling the given horn in C
and recall the similarity to the definition of can complexes in can complexes we require
exactly this just for all i not excluding zero and n and so typically you refer to another way
to refer to these is as inner can complexes right because we require inner horns the ones
with index between zero and i to be fillable. All right that's already what an infinity category is
and a factor between two infinity categories is simply a map of simplificial sets
so that's surprisingly easy but as of now it's not obvious what this has to do with categories
so i will explain that after cleaning the board
so to begin with let's see how just ordinary categories are related to this so as an example
if we start with an ordinary category C
then
we define the nerve of C to be a simplificial set whose n-simplicies are simply given by the set of
factors
from n to C here n is the poset
of numbers from zero to n just the the regarded as a category
so an n-simplex is simply a diagram of objects C0 to Cn in C and a sequence of maps
and this is this is factorial in n so it defines a simplificial set faces and so on are explicitly
given in terms of dropping indices and forming composites sure you've seen that or can work it out
and it turns out this actually defines an infinity category so for this simplificial set
we have these inner horn fillers indeed we have them uniquely and furthermore turns out that
functors between the nerve of or maps functors in this sense so maps of simplificial sets between
the nerve of one category and the nerve of another category simply correspond to functors of these
categories this is a really good exercise so i'll give you some time to think about that and try to
work it out yourself so of course if we form the nerve of a category we can still recover
its objects and morphisms simply as the zero and one morphism the zero and one simplices
so inspired by this example we will now define for a general infinity category
that we will call C0 the set of objects and C1 the set of morphisms
note that it's not obvious at this point what composition of morphisms should be as of now
this is just two sets we can define in terms of an infinity category and note that if you have a
one simplex you can take its two boundaries which give you two objects so we will think of a one
simplex f as a morphism between a and b where a is the first vertex and b is
the second vertex right partial i denotes the boundary operator that drops the i-th vertex
and note that in addition to these boundaries we also have a degeneracy map from C0 to C1
you should think of this as assigning to each object the identity morphism at this object
there's one particular relation we have on morphisms which is that we have
two different morphisms with the same endpoints then we call them equivalent
if there exists a two simplex of the following form its faces are f, g and the identity at b
remember that means just the degenerate one simplex at b and yeah it's a two simplex so
we will write
the this homotopy this homotopic symbol and it turns out that this is actually
an equivalence relation on the set of morphisms with two given endpoints
also note that in the example we have considered so far in the nerve of a one category
this equivalence relation is actually discrete if you have two different
morphisms and their equivalent they're actually already equal
so far we're somehow seeing exactly the data of a category here at least in the example we've
considered so far so let's now move to a different example where this equivalence concept gives us
something interesting so
if c is already a tan complex then of course it's also an infinity category remember we're
requiring strictly less in the definition of an infinity category namely only fillers for
certain horns and not all of them so
in particular
for topological space x
sin of x is an infinity category and let's think for a second about what objects morphisms in
this equivalence relation mean here here objects are simply points of our topological space x
morphisms
are paths
in x and between their end the path gives you a morphism between its endpoints of course
and these identity morphisms are simply constant paths and finally this equivalence relation
corresponds to homotopy of paths relative to the endpoints
so in particular if you would pass to equivalence classes of morphisms
then what you would see here is exactly the fundamental group point of x
and so you should think in this world you you can think of sin of x as some kind of infinity
categorical version of the fundamental group point
so we will now have to discuss composition of morphisms and this is where this behaves a
little different from classical category theory because as you see already here composition
of paths is a subtle operation right there's different ways to compose paths
depending on how you choose to parameterize them and no matter how you do that you you run into
something that's not really associative only associative up to homotopy so let me explain
that after cleaning the board
so let's make the following definition
for morphisms f from a to b g from b to c in an infinity category
so just one simply sees that agree at the suitable vertex then
a composition
notably not v composition just a composition of f and g is a two simplex
sigma with
a b and c as its vertices and f and g as the one simply sees
and there's a third one simplex of course
let's call that h here right it's just the
the the third phase the middle phase of this simplex and in this situation we will write
h equivalent to g after f and notice that somehow so first of all existence whenever we
start with g and f existence of such a sigma is guaranteed by just the axioms of an infinity
category right we we just have to fill the the two one horn here and it's a little weird that
we're somehow not fixing a choice here but it turns out you can check that the h you get out
of this is still well defined up to this equivalence relation so in other words you choose two different
sigmas you get equivalent ages and so even though this maybe seems like a little kind of
defect we don't have a composition on the nose so this sounds a little weird just think of the
fact of ordinary category where for example co-products are also not baked into the structure
right the co-product of two objects is only well defined up to canonical isomorphism and
that's good enough to work with and it's even easier to work with than if you say endow your
category with the structure of a co-product function because then you have to think about
how associative is this and all that so this is kind of a consequential way to extend this also
to the structure of composition
and building on that
we will also define the notion of equivalences in an infinity category so f and a to b is
amorphism then we call f an equivalence
if there exists
a g in the in the opposite direction such that there are compositions like this
that somehow we can't find two simplices that show us that the identity at a is this composite and
the identity at b is this composite this is very similar to what it means to be an isomorphism
in an ordinary category just that we have this kind of weak composition that's only well defined up
to equivalence
so in terms of infinity categories we can also talk about functor categories between them
so let's see and d be just simplicial sets for a second
we'll see what happens if there are also infinity categories in the second but
for now they're just simplicial sets and we define
another simplicial set which we write fun cd with
insimplicies given by the set of maps from c cross delta n
to d and you'll notice this is precisely the usual definition of the
simplicial mapping space right for any two simplicial sets i have a simplicial set of maps
defined like this but we're calling it functor category here because its zero
simplices are simply functors if these are infinity categories and it turns out in fact
that under mild assumptions this is again an infinity category
and i'm saying mild here because you need a little less than what you would think you
don't need that c and d are infinity categories you just need that d is an infinity category
so
which shouldn't maybe surprise you because after all you can do all these
horn fillings and so on in the target but of course the the proof of this involves some
not trivial combinatorics
so if you think about what morphisms in this infinity category are the morphism
data from f to g is a functor c cross delta one which restricts
to f and g on c cross zero and c cross one
so we will call those natural transformations
and you can show this is analogous to usual category theory that being an equivalence
in here in this sense so that you find an inverse natural transformation
is equivalent to being object wise in equivalence so what does this mean this means that eta is an
equivalence in this functor category if and only if eta c is an equivalence in d
for all objects c and c and eta c of course just means that if if you take an object
in c then this map just gives you a single one simplex in d
we will now talk about equivalences between infinity categories
so a functor between two infinity categories c and d is called
equivalence
if there exists a functor g in the opposite direction and natural equivalences
between
f composed with g and the identity functor on d and g composed with f
and the identity functor on c
so if there is an equivalence between c and d
we will call them equivalent and sometimes simply write c equivalent d
so from from ordinary category you might be familiar with the very useful characterization
of equivalences in terms of being essentially surjective and fully faithful which is typically
much easier to check than explicitly writing down an inverse and natural transformations like this
and we will now want to develop the same kind of characterization in our world of infinity
categories however as of now we don't really have we first have to talk about a concept of
mapping spaces in order to make that precise
so for objects
a b and an infinity category c
we define
a
a simplicial set map in c from a to b
as the following pullback here we're putting fun delta one c
right the simplicial mapping space from delta one into c
and down here we have two maps of simplicial sets from this guy to c given by restricting to
the first vertex or the other vertex this gives us a map down to the product c cross c
and in that product we have a point simply given by the objects a and b
and this mapping space from a to b is defined as the pullback of simplicial sets here
in fact this is also true but not that easy to prove this is actually a calm complex
whenever c is an infinity category and something you can directly see from this though is that
the zero simplices in here are precisely morphisms in c with end point a and b so morphisms from a
to b and we have a one simplex between any two morphisms from a to b if and only if they're
equivalent that that uses a little bit that uses basically what goes into the fact that
equivalence between morphisms is an equivalence relation same side of argument but what this means
is that this is a calm complex whose pi zero
is simply the set of equivalence classes
of morphisms
a to b right so this is a sensible kind of mapping space
so in terms of these mapping spaces
we now call a functor f from c to d fully faithful
if the induced maps
from the mapping spaces in c for any pair of objects to the mapping spaces
in d for any pair of objects our
homotopy equivalences of calm complexes
so maybe one has to think a little bit for a second why this is natural but
obvious from from the definition basically and now note that this does imply
that you get bijections on sets of equivalence classes of morphisms
but we're requiring much much more here right we're not requiring that this is an isomorphism on
pi zero only but basically also on all higher homotopy groups so this is not something that
you can easily check just on morphisms as we talked about them so far this is somehow
much stronger condition
compared to that the definition of fully faithful is much more like you would expect
so sorry of essentially surjective is much more like you would expect right a functor
from c to d is essentially surjective
if for every
d in d we find c in c and an equivalence
class between d and f of c
right so so this is something that's just phrased in terms of equivalence classes of objects
and now in terms of these two definitions we do in fact get the result that
that you would hope for coming from usual categories namely that a functor
c to d is an equivalence of infinity categories in the sense that there is a
functor in the other direction and natural equivalences if and only
if f is fully faithful and essentially surjective
and this is hard to prove but kind of a foundational result about infinity categories
so another thing that we can kind of pull over from
usual category theory now is the notion of the full subcategory on a set of objects
so let s in c0 be some subset of objects then we define c s
as the following simplicial subset c s and c consists of all
simplicies with vertices in s and you can directly from the definitions check that
this is indeed an infinity category basically all the diagrams you need to consider
like somehow you get a horned filler in here and that automatically lives in here again
and also note here that somehow if we
do a variant of this construction
and we first pass or we first saturate s under equivalence of objects
i.e. we form a larger subset of objects consisting of all objects of c which are equivalent to
objects in s then we get a factor from the full subcategory on s to the full subcategory
on s bar right simply the inclusion and now this is obviously fully faithful and essentially
surjective essentially surjective is clear and fully faithful is basically because the pullbacks
that define mapping spaces if you write it out you see it's just the same simplicial set
and so from this result up here this is an equivalence so if you if you're interested
up to equivalence of categories then this is a move you can always do without changing things
we have previously seen composition of morphisms just of two individual morphisms we have now seen
that somehow we don't just have morphisms we really have these mapping spaces so we will
now revisit the notion of composition and see that it really gives us maps between mapping spaces
so to do that let's pick three objects a, b, c in an infinity category and now we define some kind
of triple mapping space map c, a, b, c where here we take
the mapping space from the two simplex into c here we take the map that comes from restricting
to the three vertices and down here we take the map that comes from the three given objects a, b, c
and again we form this kind of pullback so
if you recall how we defined composition of morphisms where we said that a composition
of g and f is given by a single two simplex then you might see where this is going here
we're setting up a space of two simplices in c with which sits at the three given objects
and so in fact
there's the following lemma
this guy is kan and
we have the following diagram where
we have
this space of two simplices at the vertices a, b, c in the middle and then we can restrict along
somehow the middle phase of our two simplex to get a map into the mapping space from a to c
as defined previously but we can also restrict to the other two
phases to get a map back to map
b, c cross map
a, b and it turns out this map is a homotopy equivalence of kan complexes
so this diagram is induced by
this diagram where here you include the inner horn and the other phase
and so you should think of this fact that this restriction map is an equivalence
this is restriction to this inner horn as some kind of
version of the horn filling property in families somehow so
the proof again uses is a little bit technical but
basically it follows somehow from the horn filling property in c
and so again we're somehow in the same situation as when we defined composition of two individual
morphisms where we said given two morphisms we can pick a composition there are multiple ways to
do so and then we can look at the final like the the the middle phase of the chosen composition
and say that is somehow a composition of our or the the composition up to equivalence of our
two morphisms and you see this being a homotopy equivalence really allows you to invert this map
just uniquely up to a homotopy so the choice of a homotopy inverse
s fits in through the following composition right we can go from
the left guy along s to this kind of space of chosen compositions and then we can further restrict
like this and we can call this map composition and for the moment let's index it by s because
somehow we've made a choice here but as it turns out given a map you find a unique
homotopy given a homotopy equivalence there's always a unique homotopy inverse up to homotopy
so this any two different choices of s here give homotopic composition maps
so that's a common theme in infinity categories that somehow sometimes you have to make choices but
if you if the definitions are chosen well then you can reduce somehow two choices being
contractible so in fact the the space of all homotopy inverses to this map you can show is
contractible this is a stronger version of saying that any two homotopy inverses are homotopic
and so this composition map is really unique in in a suitable way there's just not one preferred
choice for it and similarly in this language one can think of associativity as somehow there also
being a space of kind of chosen composition data for forward disease and then this somehow
parameterizes associativity
of this this composition map
and a nice thing to look into what or a nice thing to compare this to what's going on here
is so-called seagull categories where somehow you make spaces like this part of the data
to define categories weakly enriched in spaces the upshot is that we get something like that
for free out of just the datum of an infinity category of our single simplicial set c
so one one thing that people often say is that this data somehow defines
an enrichment in Khan complexes up to some kind of coherent homotopy right there's no
choice of this composition of these composition maps where this is strictly associative at least
a priori not
okay
so as a good exercise for this section it is you should examine
all the things we did in these examples so in particular in the example of the nerve
of a one category you can see that all of the things we defined sort of are just generalizations
of the usual notion if you apply them to the nerve of an infinity category of a one category you'll
see that they specialize to the usual version of these definitions in particular you can check
that the mapping spaces in the nerve of an in of of a one category are really
discreet and the composition map here is really ordinary composition
and it's also nice to examine what this map is exactly for the example of sing of a topological
space
up until now we have seen two kind of very different examples for infinity categories
we've seen ordinary one categories which somehow live inside this theory but in a somehow trivial
way all the mapping spaces are discreet and so on so this doesn't give more than just
the usual theory of one categories and on the other hand we've seen that can complexes give
infinity categories in fact ones where all the morphisms are invertible so you could call those
infinity group odds we will now see an example which is somehow of a different flavor with
interesting mapping spaces and non-invertible morphisms and that's the infinity category of
spaces for us spaces always means uh can complexes here so the objects will be can complexes
the morphisms will be maps of can complexes and then somehow equivalents of morphisms will
correspond to homotopy and you'll somehow see a lot of the homotopy theory in the mapping spaces
and so on this is somehow the foundation like the the fundamental example of an infinity category
very similar to how set is the fundamental example of a category for example just as
categories are enriched over sets right the the set every category comes with sets of morphisms
we've seen that every infinity category has mapping spaces which land in can complexes so in some
sense they're also enriched over can complexes or over the infinity category of spaces
so to define an infinity category with can complexes as objects we first recall
that
the we we can define a category of can complexes which is enriched in simple shell sets
right simply by having objects being can complexes and the enrichment given by
simplicial mapping spaces and in fact in this example this this example you one can check
that the mapping space between two can complexes is again a can complex so so this
is really the enrichment lens in can complexes
so how do we turn that into an actual infinity category where somehow we have built these
mapping spaces in well here's a construction
so if j is any finite non-empty
totally ordered set
then we will define a simplically enriched category
c of delta j which has objects simply given by the element of j
and then a simplicial set of maps from i to j for any for any elements i and j of j
simply as the nerve of the following partially ordered set
consists of all subsets of j where the minimum
of my subset is i and the maximum of my subset is j
and if you think if you think about it so if we identify j with just the set of numbers
from zero to n for some n then what is this poset well it consists of all the subsets
that land in the that lie in the interval between i and j and do contain both the end points
so as a poset you can work out that this really looks like a cube of dimension j minus i minus
one simply somehow where the coordinates of the cube index for each element strictly between i and
j whether it's in or not so the nerve of this is really a simplicial cube so maybe another good
exercise and the composition of morphisms in here is induced by union of the case
so this is functorial in j obviously so this defines some kind of cosimplicial object
and also if we look at this carefully what what have we achieved here well we've defined a
category with objects j and simplicial mapping spaces which are all contractible right they're
all cubes so they're weakly contractible so you should think of this as some kind of blown up version
of the uh of just the ordinary category you can get out of j with objects elements and morphisms
points right so
similar to how we defined the nerve of a one category previously we can now use these kind of
blown up versions of uh category of totally ordered poset categories to define some kind of
fancy version of of nerves of simplicial uh of uh simplically enriched categories
so let's just do that for this simplistically enriched category for now to see it in action
so we define a simplicial set
currently s
by saying that in-simplicies are given by the set of functors
of simplically enriched categories so that's functors compatible with the enrichment so
let me put a little simplicial set up here to indicate that from this thing
right now our ordered set is really the usual zero to n into the simplistically enriched category
can so what what what have we got here well zero simplices
it's going on there well del c of delta zero is just a category with one element with one
object and no non-trivial morphisms so this is really this these factors here are really
just giving us objects of kan so zero simplices are kan complexes similarly one simplices
well in the case of delta one this is really just two objects and morphisms from zero to one
given by a point so in that case it just recovers ordinary morphisms in here so here we get maps of
kan complexes and now here's the first interesting thing that happens and it's really worth working
out explicitly in terms of well checking what happens for delta two here so a two-simplex in here
consists of three objects x zero x one x two and maps f two f zero f one like this plus
a homotopy between f one and this composition
and now it turns out and again this is not easy to prove
that this s is in fact an infinity category
and
for any kan complexes x and y we have an equivalence
between the mapping space in that infinity category and the just
simplisher mapping space so home in this simplically enriched category kan
from x to y right this is a homotopy equivalence of kan complexes so we see that somehow up to
equivalence this really gives us an infinity category with the mapping spaces we wanted to
build in and in fact one can argue that these these are compatible with composition in a certain way
and so on so this is originally a due to joujal and we can say what's going on here a little bit more
generally namely
for an arbitrary simplically enriched category c
we can define
the simplicial or homotopy coherent nerve of c as a simplicial set like we did for kan complexes just
here so simplicially enriched functions of these c of delta n into our category and then
it turns out that
this is if c is enriched in kan complexes
then this nerve of c is an infinity category and we have equivalences
between the mapping spaces in this infinity category
and just the simplical home in our simplically enriched category
this is one of the most important source for examples of infinity categories because in many
cases you do have some notion of objects with spaces of maps between them and then you can
take this kind of nerve to end up in the world of infinity categories
all right thanks for watching so this concludes our first video on infinity categories there
will be more about co-limits and then stable infinity categories next
note that somehow we gave a very rough overview and omitted basically all the proofs some of which
are very technical and very difficult so i encourage you to check one of the many good
books on the topic for more details
