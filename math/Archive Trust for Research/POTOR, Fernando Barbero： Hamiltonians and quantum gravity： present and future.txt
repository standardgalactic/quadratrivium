So, my talk, even though the title suggests that the pieces are terrible for you,
the main message that I want to convey is that in order to study some of the systems that people are considering in this way,
is from a hundred percent perspective, the usual approach by lack is actually not the best way to proceed.
There are best methods.
They try to do what they want to do, but they have a different flavor, they are more geometric,
and this is not a matter of point of view or a matter of view or view on, but it is really a practical matter.
In many complete examples, there are some problems that you can avoid if you do these overhead methods,
instead of trying to copy the last algorithm.
So, this short summary of my talk, I will very quickly motivate while you are interested in the programs,
I will tell you something about single algorithm systems, in particular H,
three of the H series are single algorithm systems.
I will describe quite quickly what this other geometric method, which is actually quite how it works and what it is.
And then I will show you a couple of applications.
One of them is a very simple full theory that is based on the boundaries.
One of the contexts where these geometric methods are superior is the context of the theories in manifold boundaries.
And another application that I will discuss is really what you get from the host action,
which you can use to derive the asterisk information, how the host action has been studied from the point of view.
When we go through the analysis of the constraints there, it really gets very complicated.
So, at the end of the day, although you find the correct result, it is difficult to discern what you get.
But as if you use these overhead method, you can actually arrive at an equivalent form of constraints,
which is actually much, much nicer.
In fact, once you see that, you realize that there are other consumable ways to arrive at the same result, which are very suggestive.
So, you actually tell you how you can proceed that way for this particular example.
And also I will show you a new result that you get when you follow this path,
which is what we call the concise formulation for the Lorentz LGR.
This is a hundred-polyer formulation for Nihon, which is, of course, equivalent to what we have,
but it is much nicer in some respects.
And I will show you also that one of the things that you can get from that level is the hashtag formulation for Lorentz and Nihon.
At the end of my talk, I will say something about factual issues.
This is actually quite an interesting subject, but I don't have enough time to call it here.
But it may, in my belief, it may play a very role if you really want to advance in the use of Hamiltonian methods.
So, motivation by Hamiltonians.
There are several possible ways to organize field theories, but one of them, which is very traditional,
and which is very useful, is to rely on the classical fundamental formation of field theory.
From a point of view of mathematics, if you want, for the nice things of Hamiltonian mechanics
is that it has a very dangerous and geometric framework.
And in that sense, if you come from a total ability, then it's easy to think about Hamiltonian mechanics to take a geometric perspective.
In the case of singular Hamiltonian systems, which is the one subject of my talk,
if you use, as I said, if you use a geometric perspective, then things can be understood much, much better than if you use deluxe algorithms.
If you go to the book of the act, where he explains his methods, the language that he uses there is purely mechanical.
He's always talking about the mission, about the stability of constraints on evolution.
So, you know, the physical ideas that you use there are quite clear.
It has, I mean, from a joint perspective, it's actually very difficult to understand.
But you really have to think about it very carefully.
I mean some interesting instances that can actually be confused.
So, very quickly, then we will know how you get at the Hamiltonian foundation.
So, you have a field theory.
First of all, you want to discover a field theory.
You have to choose a space of it, which interprets as an infinite dimensional manifold.
And then you have to deal with infinite dimensional manifolds.
There are functional and easy issues that are relevant.
Because if you model, you have to model your manifold in some infinite functional space.
The images of the charts in infinite dimensional manifolds must be some kind of functional space where you have to specify or keep those some structure.
For example, if you want to have manifolds, you have to specify them all.
Because in infinite dimensions, you can have non-infinite manifolds.
But that's an infinite dimension.
So, somehow, when we do physics, we think that these functional things are superfluous in the sense of,
well, you will just work the kind of variety that we need to make sense of the field equations and that's it.
But this can be worked.
Depending on the kind of knowledge, for example, that we use for other technologies,
you may end up with something which can be easy to deal with or something which can be very complicated for mathematics.
Well, once we have chosen this non-dimensional space,
the way traditional way to produce mechanics is to go to the quantum model,
to define a real functional quantum model that you call the Lagrangian,
and you have to introduce a suitable space of paths over to write the action.
For example, standard choice is something like this.
So, the big paths that go from one configuration to another configuration are called Q1, Q2.
The paths start at time Q1, Q1, and then they end at time Q2, Q2.
And you have to learn some kind of a variety.
So, it's usually, I think, this will remind you that these functions are discursed,
at twice the functionality.
Now, with the help of the Lagrangian, you define a real functional space in this path space,
which is from the action, and you use that as an interval where you use the Lagrangian that you're going to use there.
And your dynamics is here by the stationary points of this action, which are given by the order of the equation.
Ah, very quickly.
How do you go from the Lagrangian to the quantum model?
Well, you have your configuration space, you can be either the quantum model or you can be the quantum model.
Ah, an important difference between the quantum model and the quantum model, as you all know,
is that in the case of the quantum model, there is a canonical syntactic form.
There is some structure there, the two forms there, but you can be interested in these,
the areas that you have in your quantum model.
There is no such thing in the quantum model, of course, but of course, you can put them in my hand,
or I've had these used for some circumstances, but in the case of the phase space, you have that.
Now, the first step to get a Hamiltonian is to define the momentum of rotation,
so often referred to this as the final derivative,
and this is a map from the quantum model to the quantum model that preserves the fibers.
To a point here in the fiber over cube in the quantum model,
you associate a point in the fiber also over cube in the quantum model.
Now, this guy there will be a corrector, so it's a dual object,
so you have to tell me how it acts on that post,
and this is how this works.
You take the events of that object, you just compute it as this derivative
and you have to respect this parameter at equal to zero,
and this will be the definition of this dual object.
Now, next step, once you're going to use this momentum,
you kind of find a function on the quantum model,
which is called the Ernie, this is a standard definition,
this is p-cube, I use the Arranian,
and a very important feature of this function is that if the Arranian is standing at the end,
it's easy to prove that this is constant in the parameter condition,
when you work on solutions of your Arranian conditions.
How about Arranian?
In three short steps, you can understand.
So, now, with the help of this fiber derivative and the energy,
you define a function and you have a function on the quantum model,
you call that a hamlet again.
Now, with the help of the canonical syntax,
the structure that you have there, and the exterior differential of a hamlet Arranian,
you define a hamlet Arranian vector field, I saw in this equation,
this is interior product of the field with a symphonic form,
and once you have this,
the integral curves of this vector field
project it onto the configuration space in the momentum.
Now, that is something important to point out here,
which is the fact that if you look at the definition of a quantum program,
you have here the inverse of this fiber grid.
So, it's not inverse in quantifying, there is no problem,
but what happens when this function here is not invertible,
but it's actually the definition of a singular quantum system,
so by definition it will be a singular Hamiltonian system,
which is one of which this fiber derivative is not an inverse.
Now, this may look like a complication,
but of course we know that singular Hamiltonian systems,
or Arranian systems,
offer many possibilities beyond those provided by granular systems,
and in fact, most of the field theories that are relevant for physics
are actually of these types,
so vector magnetism can be this alternative,
these are examples of these.
Game theories are particular examples of similar systems,
but there are others which are not game theories that are similar,
and actually we show you a simple example today.
These are in particular the type of systems
for which the arc algorithm was created by him,
and the point, as I have already said at the beginning of the talk,
the interaction, is that the arc method is really facing dynamical problems,
and relies heavily on the use of personal brackets.
Now, there are circumstances where this is not a problem,
but in some other circumstances we have to be careful,
and one of them, which is popular these days,
and very important, and one of the physical ones,
is the formulation of field theories in mind from good startups,
and actually there were several possible people at least,
precisely such types of systems.
So my claim here is that the best way to deal with these things
is to use the pure electromagnetic approach.
Of course this is an old idea,
like I have not invented this,
this actually comes from the late 70s,
and the method that we have found that it is much better
in new instances to deal with these systems
is what we call the PNH method, after containing western hints,
and I will just tell you what the main steps of this method are,
and we will try to justify almost pictorially
why it is, how it works,
and then I will show you the application of this.
So the steps of the following,
you start, of course, with Lagrangian,
you start in a bundle of sub-configuration space,
you compute the fiber derivative,
which gives you the definition of momentum,
but very often this fiber derivative is not,
but it is injective,
so the image is not the full phase space,
but just a subset,
which also very often is a samaripho.
So that's a nice space.
This samaripho is called the primary constrain samaripho.
Which in the language of the Lag,
he says that, well, sometimes we cannot write the momentum
in terms of velocities,
because there are some conditions,
indirect conditions involving velocities and momenta,
so these conditions is what I call primary constrain,
but for a more geometric picture,
it's actually the image of this fiber derivative,
which is Tokyo, right?
Now, the fact that if your fiber derivative is injective,
it will be actually a direction on this image,
so that the equation that you have to solve
in order to find a Hamiltonian
can actually be solved,
as long as you just restrict yourself
to this primary constrain samaripho.
So you cannot write,
you cannot immediately find a Hamiltonian
to find all the whole phase space,
but you can definitely find a Hamiltonian
on this primary constrain samaripho.
So by the way, that is one of the ingredients
of your profile.
Again, from the last perspective,
what he says is, well,
on this primary constrain samaripho,
you have a unique Hamiltonian,
but you don't know what happens,
you're not, so you may have many extensions of that,
but he actually considers a funnel of extensions
to really study the dynamics
and get consistency, okay?
Here, actually, we just care about
the value of a Hamiltonian
for the primary constrain samaripho,
and nothing else.
Now, another thing that we need
is to take the canonical two-form,
I don't know if you have an effect space,
and pull it back to the primary constrain samaripho.
And it will come back, come back,
as long as possible.
And now the really key step
in this method
is the following.
You have to find
the maximum, the biggest samaripho
of the two-forms,
contained in the primary constrain samaripho,
such that
first, these are the two-forms.
So this is
the definition of a Hamiltonian vector field.
So the difference is that now
I have the pull mark
of the primary constrain samaripho,
and in such a way
that the field that I find
as a solution to this
is standard
to this maximum samaripho.
So if I can
find such as a samaripho,
it's possible to prove
that this is not trigger,
it's not obvious, and it's not trigger,
I'm actually told for
took some time,
that if you consider the internal curves
of this vector field
of this samaripho,
then you will get some
that is strictly equivalent
to the Lagrangian analysis
of the system coming from the
Lagrangian equation.
Let me show you a picture
of what this
statement means.
So what you have to do is
to find the sum of the equation
for the Hamiltonian vector field
on the whole and zero,
the very kind of that is not possible.
The only thing that you can get
over an inclusion bar
defined by samsar-manipho,
that they are calling M1,
so totally something like this.
I always saw that equation
not on the whole and zero,
but that's in samsar-manipho.
Then what happens is that
even though those vectors,
all these vectors are under two and zero,
they are not under two and one everywhere.
So I have to look
for another samaripho,
this type of M1
which I am sending in this way,
that satisfies
the condition that
the solution that I found
is actually counter to that samaripho.
If I can prove that this is
the largest samaripho in samsar-manipho,
that is what I need in order
to discuss the dynamics of the system.
Comments on this level.
Of course,
there are some disadvantages
to that.
If you are interested in the dynamics,
how do you tell the dynamics then
it will give you something
that you want to react to,
that is actually practical terms
instead of to use it.
Of course, if you want to optimize,
you may have a problem because
even if the canonical
symphetic form is a very simple object,
the pullback of this symphetic form
to the primary samaripho
may actually be more complicated.
So in practical terms,
you may run into trouble.
So, this one must
take it back up.
It's also true that once you get
the constraints in this
G&H approach,
these are always equivalent.
They describe the same samaripho
that you get from Dirac's method.
So you can always backtrack and say
well, I have these constraints,
now I go back to the full phase space
and do the conversation as I would do it
by using Dirac's method.
But, it may not be
we are very courageous to
work with the pullback of this symphetic form.
Okay?
Now,
in order to understand
for example how constraints
appear in this setting,
you have to realize
that this pullback
is dynamically degenerate.
So, it may happen
that the solutions to these are already
if that is the case
that you have the G&H theory
and they are retrying us
in the solutions
to the algorithm of these.
It's actually G&H theory.
Okay?
Also, it may happen that
because this is in homogeneous,
actually in order to solve it
you need some extra conditions
on the image of the back of the earth.
So, that is the geology
of the second battle for strength
in this setting.
Here the dynamics.
This is a very important point
which seems trivial but
it actually has
important practical consequences.
The consistency of the dynamics
that usually Dirac's
phrases are saying that
well, I must show that
the constraints
are preserved
by the solution defined by the
token, things like that.
Here, it turns into
a question.
Yes?
Is it
finding this
submanifold and
solving the secondary constraints?
No.
It's not solving.
It's finding solutions.
No, you're not finding the solutions
to the secondary constraints.
You're actually finding the form
of the secondary constraints.
So, in that sense, it's not better
to solve the constraints.
It's actually a procedure.
The extra conditions
that tell you
what these submanifold are
are the secondary constraints.
Okay, but once we
determine the end,
did we restrict ourselves
to end only
or are we still working on some?
That depends on what we're going to do.
It is exactly as in an arcade.
So, if you manage
the final constraints,
and if you're covering up,
you may find some nice way
of prioritizing the final constraints
of Manifold and express everything
in terms of these three parameters.
That would be perfect, because that would give you
a complete description of the reviews.
Usually, you cannot do that.
And then you have two weeks
of constraints, as you would do
in the case of the arcade.
So, the final result, in that sense,
is exactly the same.
We're going to do this all again.
Okay?
Okay.
So, what I'm going to say is that
the fact that the consistency
can be understood
as just simple
tendency conditions
actually has some concrete consequences.
One of that is,
seems to be a silly one,
but when you deal with
complete examples, it's actually important.
It is that the computations are much shorter
and much less, so that is very good.
And the second one,
which is slightly more subtle,
but I think this is important,
is that you can actually
avoid the use of muscle brackets.
So, to check tendency,
muscle brackets play actually
no role whatsoever.
Now, if you have no problems
computing muscle brackets,
then it's fine, but if there are
some difficulties computing muscle brackets,
and this happens, for example,
if there is a boundary,
then this fact actually
will save you a lot of
suffering and problems.
And for me, you state this,
all these things, with a very
simple example, which is a following one.
Let's consider
a much less skinner field.
You find one on the table,
so you have a spatial manifold,
which is only natural, but has boundaries.
And then we introduce
boundary conditions,
which is homogenous boundary conditions,
in the following way.
Instead of
the same from the stock,
from the configuration variables,
are some scalar fields,
like vanishing and so on,
I will consider an arbitrary scalar fields
in this interval,
but then I will write an action
that will give me these
Dirichlet boundary conditions,
when I compute the variations,
when I compute the other variables.
This is going by the usual amount,
and then I add
an extra field,
to the time of working side,
and this total variable.
Now, when you compute variations,
so I have two scalar fields,
but you have to remember that this guy
is an arbitrary object that I
am using only to enforce
homogenous boundary conditions.
Now,
when you compute variations of these,
you can see
that you get
the wave condition in one dimension,
and you get these polar conditions.
It's very easy to see, because of course,
you can integrate this part here,
you will get the
the value of the product at 1 and at 0,
and if I think
of the image of
these fields at each point,
as independently as a field, of course,
the variation with respect to side 0,
will be in the condition 5 of 0 to 0,
and it's a similar thing
of the side.
So, in practice, the value
of this axillary field
at the boundary
is working as some
advantage to the product that enforce
these beautiful boundary conditions.
Okay? So this, that's what I want.
Now, an exercise,
an interesting exercise,
in fact, a challenge
is to try to
use the axillary method to solve this problem.
I will not go through details,
but I will tell you
why this is not so easy,
I will also treat now,
that is actually a minor difficulty
that we find when we try to do the computations,
and the difficulty is
that it comes from the fact that
sometimes you get such possible markets,
and you should look at them inside integrals,
so even, I mean,
if you take these as delta of x0,
it's sort of okay.
But then, in the same
formulas, you also get
obtain such as this.
And this is really a problem,
because if you write the possible markets,
these are going to define
if x is equal to y.
Now, the standard law
is that where,
this way of looking at possible markets
is a little bit too late,
we have to actually think
of a smear field,
and when there's smear,
there's no such problem.
But smear, that's a work by work here,
we have a laptop which is sitting
on the bottom of the seat.
When you integrate that, what do you get?
So it's not really well informed.
And actually, it doesn't help
to solve this problem here.
So it's a risk.
And actually, there are published papers
where people, there's lots of suggestions,
where people have tried
to apply the next lesson to Venus.
I cannot understand them.
They get the right result,
but probably because they knew it in the first.
You follow their reasoning,
and this means completely opaque
and probably wrong.
Now, what is the problem?
The problem is that
in this case I have a boundary,
and if I have a boundary,
you have to be able to
compute possible markets.
Now, one thing that one may say
in this example
such as this is that well,
of course, if you want to compute possible markets,
you must check, for example,
that your functions are differential
in the first place.
If they are not differential,
if they are not smooth enough,
then you will not be able to compute them,
and then maybe this is what happens.
Okay.
But then it so happens
that in the context of
gravitational theories, for example,
when you introduce boundaries,
people actually talk
about differentiability
with a meaning which
has anything to do with a standard
mathematical
sense, which is what I call
fresh air differential.
In particular, this happens in the context of
the study of gravity and the boundaries,
and you can see that boundary
times as regular data work
is a long time ago.
So, let me just address a little bit here
to say a few words about
differentiability, how well these problems come from,
and then we go back to
the example I showed you,
we use this scheme method.
Now, this is standard
differentiability,
definition of differentiability,
I assume that here in Poland,
we learn these schemes in kindergarten,
so I will not go through these,
but this is just a standard concept
that human use, for example,
to define differentiability
in multivariate calculus.
Now, of course, the differential
is a linear approximation,
linear continuous approximation
that satisfies this condition here.
It's easy to prove
what the World of Science places like these things.
The link, for example,
is triggered to
show that if you are completely
the differential of a linear, continuous
function, then it coincides with itself.
It's how you define differentiability, for example.
This is a very useful
concept, and there are many theories
that
if you insist on some
mathematical schemes for differential
something that you may need, for example,
to talk about the integrality
of these, that really rely
on this concept.
And this, of course, is a kind of differential
that you usually find a scheme of
a linear differential geometry,
which is a basic object in Hamiltonian
mechanics, as I showed before.
And in the context of the
Lagrangian equation of
computational theories,
there is another concept of differential.
Really, here, I call
together with some, or also
in Mexico, I call it
kina, so probably we can
follow it.
It appears, for example, in
Wallsburg, and it means
you give me a function
on some specific fields
defined on
a manifold with a boundary
this other concept
of differential, it means that
if I complete variations of that function
those variations don't
sort of stand, and can be
given in the following way.
When that happens
the
people say that this thing
is the
function of it.
But of course, if you think
of this, and you compare this definition
with the standard
for shared derivative, the differential
these things have very different
components, so you must be very careful
if you are leaving the fields
with boundaries.
And you have to compute, for example,
functional derivatives, and you have to
discuss the differential, really careful functions
because you want to compute some brackets
and things like that.
It is at least dangerous,
my impression is that
you will always make mistakes
to confuse, conflate
this type of definition
with what you
find by using the standard
fresher differential derivative concept.
So this is really
very important in the computation
of personal markets in theory.
And why is that so?
Because the kind of formula
that we usually have in our minds
when we want to compute personal markets
in theory, is something like this
that we actually get
by some
straightforward substitutions
from the standard formula that we get
from the context of mechanics,
but then, of course, you have to be careful
with what you put in here
and also you have to be careful
in the sense that, well,
these products here actually
look like two scalar products,
but then you know the context
correlation in a different way.
I will talk about that today,
but if you are interested,
I can give you some details about that.
So I will go back to my example.
The moral
of what I am trying to tell you
is that if you use this
G and H method,
you can avoid this
in this particular example.
You can avoid all these discussions
about how I have to compute
the functional derivatives and so on.
Precisely because
the consistency of my
internal formulation
consists really in checking that
some conditions are satisfied.
So you can avoid, in this case,
in the past few decades,
then when you go through the full
procedure,
you find the following.
We just described some for you
and there are some slightly
surprising things in there.
So you get a primary constraint
which is telling me that the momentum
can only be associated
with this auxiliary field
that I have introduced
to England and the
homogeneous miracle power conditions
are actually zero.
Of course, also this
must happen for every time,
so that means that the component
of the vector field that discusses
the dynamic associated with this
is also secure.
Now, despite the fact
that this is a scalar field
which is not against the Ray-Fan constraint,
it's a singular system,
I find a set of
second line constraints.
These are the first ones
are just the boundary connection.
That's okay, that's expected.
But then there are two infinite
powers of constraints
involving the
even derivatives of the
field at zero and at one
and also the even derivatives
of the momentum at zero and one.
These are
not so easy to
guess.
It is true that you go to the
mathematical literature
and the other graduate courses
on partial differential equations
of mathematicians know that these things
are there. They don't arrive at them
by using
the Hamiltonian method.
They do it in a different way, but this is not
if you want, for example,
Brexy's
book on factual analysis is applied
to partial differential equations
where he discusses the way of operation
in what possible dimensions.
He shows these things and he gets this thing
which is nice to find them
when you show it, when you're following
the procedure
and then there are these other
constraints that involve the value
of its
side field at zero and one.
And then the final thing
that you will get is the Hamiltonian
vector field.
The Hamiltonian vector field has components
associated with the field
phi, the momentum pi
associated to phi and then also the
field and momentum.
While then, one of these
part of these components
actually give you the way
of operation because
it should be there
and then there are some others that actually
just tell you what the dynamics of this
auxiliary field on the boundary is.
Okay? And of course
you see that there is no untryingness
in the components
of the Hamiltonian vector field, so
this is on the Hamiltonian field.
There is no untryingness
but it is a similar field
with constraints and these constraints
are these towers
that I have shown you there.
Now it's very nice
that it's a nice interpretation
of these. I will show you
so this is something that has
a meaning and
a simple way of
understanding that is a formula.
Consider now that you want
to construct
a solution of the word equation
for some initial data
which is this flat function here
and with zero velocities.
So I just take my initial value
of the scalar field as t
and the time the momentum is 0.
Okay?
Now a good way to get big solutions
in one plus one directions is using
this normal formula
in order to
copy the solution where you have to do
this formula. You have
a variable function
and then you extend it
to the left.
Now this function, this standard
function, you evaluate that x plus
t, say an x minus p
to add those things
and but first of all
the t is that it is a solution
to the equation
and second because this section
is odd, you always
guarantee that the boundary conditions
are satisfied.
So this part of the formula
you have to displace to the left
this standard function that I go
and you will be getting satisfied
things.
And an important comment is a formula.
This point here, it is a point
where the tension matches
the value of the initial function inside
if you want
that your solution is always
smooth, for example.
You must guarantee
that this tension is smooth
and you may have some doubt
with some variable.
Well, then
what happens is that these
conditions here, and the other
ones at the moment are
precisely the conditions that you need
to know that this
tension is smooth.
So these
secondary constraints that we find
are used in the VNH method
in this particular case, actually
finalizing the notation. These are
some conditions that you are
able to satisfy
in order to guarantee that the solution
inside the formula
is for this function.
So this also
shows in this very
simple example, but
this method, this VNH method
is actually quite powerful because
it's how it works beyond
what you would expect. Can say
something, for example, smoothness
of the solutions, which in principle
is not a kind of actual calculator
that you would expect to be
described as a constraint.
So
this is this thing.
So I will end
this part with some comments.
So these
infinite average constraints
is very difficult to find by
introducing the VNH method.
Some of the conditions know that they are better
and they can be found by using this way.
The important
is that it doesn't justify
a
practical thing.
Both constraints
can be obtained without
a calendar or a personal packet.
So if there is something difficult to
develop as it happens in this particular case,
you will have to worry.
So in some context,
you can actually avoid some issues
related to partial analysis that
I mentioned in the beginning here
if you use this method.
If you want to see particular examples,
you can
discuss this.
Now
talk about another application,
VNH method, and
a slightly different point of view
regarding the Hall's action.
So the Hall's action is one of
the basic actions
that you can use to
arrive at the partial
information of your activity,
real partial information.
So in some cases,
the results are correct.
The only complaint that I have about those
results is that
when they just get the last
batch of
partial constraints,
they get them in a very, very complicated form.
So it's something that's not
possible.
Whereas if you use the VNH method,
you can actually arrive
at a much lesser ratio
of the criminal version
Now, in this particular case,
actually
there is a neat way of
understanding what's going on
which somehow
there's a slightly different procedure
to get information for something
so we'll discuss it here to you.
So,
you can do the following thing.
You can take your
Hall's action, you can have the
finger corrections,
you perform, you will work,
actually in the space time, which has
the form sigma cross r,
so you get some financial money for
which I will take close, come back
with some money, and just
the product with a lot.
And then you, of course,
you can use a solution and perform
a three-percent position
to find the Lagrangian.
Once you find the Lagrangian, you can
find the file of the liberty,
you can find the final constraint, some money for
the ghetto Hamiltonian,
and then you can
perform that, so that
is exactly what I have described now.
And now you have
the following possibility.
You can go to the finger corrections,
which in this particular case
are very neat, because the action is
written in terms of differential forms
and I will describe you exactly for this one.
And then you can do the following thing.
You can take this equation,
some in the back, I'll give the sheets
to the foundation, that will give
you constraints, which should appear
only to the Hamiltonian analysis.
Actually, they do.
And you can use this
language method. And ultimately
you can first project
decorations in the direction
of the black hole field
defined by the pipe that we have here.
I will also show you how that works.
And then project them onto
the sheets of this manifold. By doing
that, you get the special of the
components of the Hamiltonian vector fields.
And once you have that,
you can actually see
the standard sequence that you need
in order to guarantee the consistency
of the algorithm. This holds.
And you can check in this case that it does.
So this is
something like a shortcut
to arrive at the same
foundation that you will get from the
DmH analysis. But it is
simple in the sense that I will show you
the complicated constraint,
something that
is the really difficult part
of the DmH analysis
is solved
magically.
So let me
understand this in more detail.
This is the host action.
The host action we find on this manifold.
Let's take my scope.
Here, the EI
are non-negative vectors.
So there are four more forms.
In this capital unit, it goes from 0 to 3.
You can
find also
the curvature,
an SO-13 collection.
So I am working with a radius of 8.
And this object here
is,
has this pressure.
And it is built in terms of the radius
of a very cheetah-steam model
of the DmH analysis.
So this is the host action.
Now,
when you compute a few equations,
this is what we get.
These equations are the same
that we get from the power of linear action.
Which is,
the actual work we just
brought here, the terms coming with
the DmH analysis parameter.
Now, there is a very
interesting observation that we are going to make here,
which is that these equations
are strictly equivalent to the solvents.
The second is the same.
As you can see, the first is simple.
It is not powered up in E,
but there is linear in E.
It is not
difficult to do this equivalence.
Actually, you don't know who
the first people
to realize that it was possible.
I definitely did that
in the paper by Katanevon collaborators.
You can,
the user says that this
is possible because
you can the number of equations that you have here
and you have here, the probability
that they are actually the same.
This has
interesting consequences
if you think in the terms that I just got before.
So, the suppose that I
take my money for my space time
is, of course, in other words,
naturally formulated by
hypersurfaces,
even in this sense.
Time
is time for this.
Now, of course, I can
define the way the scalar field
here, which is basically
given by the model of what I actually are.
And also, I can
find that there are some natural
products that I have here, which are those
for which this base
point that I here is just the same.
So, I have
components, of course,
which are parameterized by this function
that I have, of course, compute
the tandem vector that defines
a canonical vector field
which is associated with this
or the biomariable which I call
partial field. So, these are canonical
natural structures where I have
this structure in my space.
Okay? I consider
the inclusion of each of these sheets
into
the space of my model
and I define these objects.
So, you see, I
am projecting in the direction
of the inspector field and
pulling back with
by using this inclusion here. There is a type
of here, this, you know,
these two lines
are just functions
in every sheet of information
and these two are objects
which I am writing in.
I am not using the whole face and I am writing
them in here, but I,
in the rest of the talk, I will just
remove the whole face. So, these two
by several forms. Okay?
So, now,
suppose that we do what I
said before, that I take
the equations in this form,
in the second form,
in the first form, and I
pull them back onto the sheets
of information. If I do that,
I get these things
which I must
interpret as constraints.
So, these are, these
involve these three natural
objects which are still labeled
with these four
indices. Well,
indices going from 0
to 3. Okay?
So, I get these constraints
which are exactly what I get
if I'm coming up and using the
gear into the form.
And then, if I do the other thing,
I first take the equations,
I compute the interior column
with these vector fields, and then
pull them back onto the sheets of information,
I get these equations, which are actually
convolution equations. In fact,
for the first one, I can read exactly
what the component of the
120 vector field is
of E is. In the second
case, I have to solve this equation
because I have something to define
in the form or not, which is a very
difficult one. But, I've got cc
so you can do that.
And, you get that these
nice arbitrary, which is actually
what you expect.
And from here, you might need the
hand-to-hand vector fields for the primary
constraints, a manifold that
holds them to all the constraints
and discards the elements of the whole section.
This is straightforward, and this is
exactly what you would get if you
used the E in the truth.
Now, there is something 5 going on here
which is one of the
surpassing things of this
system, which is a follow-up.
When you look at the equations, if you remember,
I told you that
a number of equations here and here
in form dimensions is exactly the same.
No problem.
But, when I pull back,
if I pull back this condition,
then I get only
16 of these equations.
The count is very simple.
You have just to pick it up and
you see it exposes from 0, 2,
to 3.
But now these guys are
3, they are one-fourth in three dimensions.
So, they are three-dimensional
objects, not four-dimensional objects.
But the other thing, if I take the
criminal in form of equations, which
if you remember, we do equal to 0,
and I pull back those
onto the sheets of information,
I get 12 of them.
So, much more integral
because of these mathematical equations
between the equations
with a e here and before the e here.
When I pull back, I get
1,000 of these constraints.
This is very interesting, because
the extra constraints
actually correspond to some
tertiary constraints, which are very
difficult to deal with, both
in the act of
solving the G and H method,
where things are not really the same.
So, one of
the lessons that we learn from here
is that if your fear is written
in terms of nice things, but some
differential forms, and something
like this happens, that you can
how simply find a few equations
in this way, you
can actually guess
very, very quickly
some of the
secondary pressure constraints that
are used without
making a terminal F.
So, finally,
what do you get
if you follow this approach
or the G and H approach?
So, what you get is what we call the
concise formulation, and it can be
summarized in a few lines.
So, your frame space
which is actually a parameter
of frames on one form
is spanned by these contexts.
So, you can do more than that.
You can do these E's and these
formulas, components.
There is a dress-impacted form
which has this structure
where
this P
pencil appears,
and you can remember that it depends
on the invisible.
Now, the constraints help this form
and these are for
Lorenzian UR.
So, if you think of the constraints
in any formulation of UR,
that are real formulations of UR
that comes to your mind,
they are all more complicated than these.
Of course, in general mathematics
they are, but also you go
to the real aspect of formulations
there, the
Hamiltonian-Moscowic has a complicated
perception. This, here
in this setting, they are as simple
as they can be. These define
these constraints on one form
that I would like to ask you
about, that is
really on the other example.
This is a Hamiltonian
which punishes the end
and the Hamiltonian vector fields
are paid by some of these equations.
I can give you the specific form
that is not very limited
so I will do it here.
Now, an application
of this, this formulation
which is
very compact,
you can actually use for example
to the other aspect of formulation
and this is an interesting computation
and it's a good exercise
so I would like you to do it.
The procedure
can be summarizing on this slide
so what you have to do
to arrive at the aspect of formulations,
the real aspect of formulations, for Lorentz and gravity
is a formula. You
separately consider the i
counter i equal to 0
or counter i equal to 1 to 3
so these components
and introduce a time gauge
that you have
so you have to
take everything to
as a manifold of n
which is the 596th equation.
Now, from
this part of the constraints
we can use the equation
for the other components of this constraint here
this one
we have this other equation
another key step is the following.
You solve the first equation
for omega, you can write
omega in terms of the coefficient
and I am calling gamma, I am solving for this
in terms of e
and you plot for some of these
into this impacted form
together with the time gauge condition.
Well, do that
if I have exactly this expression
and from here you can do
of immediately
the change of values and do that
to the aspect of formulations.
This is the aspect of formulations
and this is the
effect of formulations in Final!
Actually, if you look at the скорce
the result
is this gamma,
which is independent of gamma
we can look at gamma
that is the boundary
that comes from this
to the zero.
Here, in fact, even though this
above았�,
actually this is in the boundary
Now, once you have these variables, you plug them here, in this same equation, you get a large node,
and if you plug them here, you get the vector constraint, and you have a terminal constraint for the real case,
which as you know has an added complicated structure.
So, I will finish with a couple of slides.
First one, there are some points about this concise formulation.
So, you can get these by using G and H method.
The problem with that, it's complicated.
If you look at the papers, in particular this one, you will see that it's not trivial.
There is this funny way of arriving at the same thing by looking at the field equations.
My advice is that, I mean, for simple theories, it's actually interesting to look at the equations.
You have to see if you can get some information about some constraints
that may appear as secondary differentiated constraints and may be difficult to get.
An interesting comment, which I still don't know what the physical meaning is, is the following.
In the emissive parameter, it only appears here.
But, when you pull back the disinfected form to M,
to the final consensual manifold where the dynamics happens,
the emissive parameter disappears.
So, that's our house against that, well, if you quantize,
if you manage to quantize in this space,
then in this parameter, they appear in the conversation,
but if you could really work in the final consensual manifold,
then the final emissive parameter should not appear.
So, there is something that I don't understand.
So, one thing that I would like to tell you is that
I think that this consize formation is very nice and very very simple.
It's structurally the simplest thing that we can think of.
It works, you can do that.
There is a computation.
So, an interesting problem is to see what I'm using for conversation.
I understand that this is not easy because this is not a canonical synthetic form,
but actually a more complicated synthetic form.
It has to generate that.
And then, finalized life, right in the face,
I mentioned several types of functional issues.
So, those are important.
Actually, we're working on some of these,
and we know that they may play an interesting role.
The generic comment that we can actually do for every field theory
is that the details of functional spaces may be better.
And not only for a mathematical leader,
but also to do some critical corrections.
These genetic methods that I have shown you
are sensitive enough to say something about these things.
In particular, for example, how the smoothness of society
is shown in the case of hysteria,
but also other things.
If you are at full, and you work with life spaces,
for example, solid spaces,
you can actually avoid the use of disadvantages,
which may not be useful,
for example, to understand boundary theory.
And it is not a good question that,
for example, regularization procedures in these spaces
can be understood from a different aspect.
And finally, I think that this is not as a mathematical leader,
but may have some practical consequences.
And I finish here. Thank you.
APPLAUSE
First, comments.
I think this is the right result.
And I was wondering, for the last comments that you made,
about the concept from the notion that
I stole one free item.
So this might be a little basic,
but could it be also the same in the case of there,
as a whole, pre-complexified?
I mean, the computations would be the same.
So if you complexify, you don't see that
there are significant changes.
And even, I do not know those also in the Euclidean case,
clear Euclidean case.
So from one of you of what you get,
and these geometric procedures,
I don't think that there would be a significant difference.
I would admit to the conflict,
but my guess is I think it's not.
I think it's true.
Thank you.
Does the approach allow generalization
to the attention-hiding form?
And if it were to reduce this human's way
of generalizing the hashtag
of formulation to higher dimensions,
or you could maybe propose something different from that.
Okay, so do you mean if I take the whole structure, for example?
No.
I mean, it should be a problem how to generalize the whole structure.
Okay, I think you kind of know the whole structure.
So it is miracle that the field equations
can really be simplified to this D and D0 form,
as far as I know, only works in four dimensions.
So you go to higher dimensions,
of course, you take an action,
you go to higher dimensions,
you can always use either the Ratz method
or the G and H method, and find the constraints.
And actually, once you know
that some tertiary constraints can be simplified
in the case of non-degenerate tetrax,
or phyphels, how do you call them, phyphelins?
Then actually, that may tell you
how to proceed to medialyver the single formation.
So that's probably the case.
But this trick may not work
or may work in a different way.
So you may be able to simplify the equations
in different dimensions to get something
which may not be of the single form, the E or the 0,
but may be simple enough to give you
extra constraints when you use this
pull-back process that I described.
Okay?
Thank you.
Well, let us thank the speakers.
