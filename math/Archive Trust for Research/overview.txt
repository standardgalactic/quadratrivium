Checking Archive Trust for Research/POTOR, Fernando Barbero： Hamiltonians and quantum gravity： present and future.txt
 Certainly! The discussion revolved around the concept of quantization and the simplification of field equations in higher dimensions. The speaker emphasized the structural simplicity of the consize formation in four dimensions, which is a computationally tractable model for understanding physical phenomena. They highlighted that the details of functional spaces can lead to critical corrections and influence the smoothness of society, as seen in cases like hysteria.

The speaker also mentioned that regularization procedures in these spaces might be understood differently and suggested that the approach they presented could potentially be generalized to higher dimensions, although this might require different methods than those used in four dimensions. They pointed out that the simplification of field equations to the D and D0 form seems to work uniquely well in four dimensions, but the methods might be adapted for other dimensionalities to derive constraints and simplify equations further.

The speaker addressed a comment about whether complexification would significantly alter the computations or the geometric procedures involved, and they expressed confidence that the essential results would remain the same, both in the Lorentzian and Euclidean cases.

In summary, the conversation touched on the relationship between dimensionality, quantization, and the simplification of field theories, as well as the potential practical consequences of these mathematical explorations. The speaker's work suggests that there may be a deeper understanding to be gained by examining functional spaces and their implications for physical models.
