 The explanation you provided delves into an alternative number system based on a base-3 (ternary) representation rather than the familiar base-10 (decimal) system we use for integers and real numbers. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Base-3 Representation**: Instead of using 0-9, this system uses 0-2 to represent powers of three. For example, the number seventeen in base three is written as "101" (one hundred three).

2. **Distance on the Number Line**: In this system, the distance between numbers is defined differently than in the decimal system. If the first n digits of two numbers are the same, the distance between them is determined by 1/3 raised to the power of n. This means that numbers with more identical leading digits are closer together.

3. **Completion**: Filling all gaps on this new number line is called completion. This process generates what are referred to as "free attic numbers."

4. **Paedic Well Model**: To visualize the free attic numbers, a model called a "paedic well" is used. It consists of an infinite series of nested wells and walls of height one, with each level of wells and walls being one order of magnitude smaller than the previous. The number line is formed at the bottom of these wells.

5. **Numbering the Paedic Well**: Each infinitely small well corresponds to a digit in the base-3 number system. A number is placed in the well corresponding to its first digit, and subsequent digits are represented by smaller wells within.

6. **Measuring Distance**: The distance between any two numbers on this number line is determined by the height of the tallest tower (wall) between them.

7. **Balls as Open Sets**: To represent open sets, such as balls, in the paedic well model, one selects a center point and a radius. Imagining water filling to the level of the radius creates the set of points within the ball on the number line.

8. **Properties of Balls**: In this system, every point in a ball is effectively its center. Two balls can contain the same points but have different radii. If two balls intersect, one must be entirely contained within the other.

9. **Applications**: The paedic numbers and their visualization are powerful tools in number theory and have potential applications in fields like quantum gravity and cosmological inflation.

The paedic well model provides a fascinating alternative to our conventional understanding of numbers and their representation on a number line, offering a unique perspective on the concept of distance and continuity.
