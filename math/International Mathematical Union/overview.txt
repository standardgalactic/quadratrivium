Checking International Mathematical Union/Ana Caraianiï¼š The cohomology of Shimura varieties with torsion coefficients and applications.txt
1. The discussion began with clarifications about certain results and conjectures in the field of modularity of elliptic curves over totally real fields and modularity over CM fields or quadratic extensions of totally real fields.

2. Anna Pronk's work involves proving modularity for elliptic curves over certain extensions of number fields, specifically those where the lifting character is a principal series to avoid dealing with Drinfeld modules. This avoidance is important because it simplifies the problem and allows for easier handling of the comology in Drinfeld spaces.

3. Anna's work assumes that the group G is unitary and mentions that a student is working on generalizing these results to more generic groups by using a semi-perversity result from geometric insights into the fibers of the period domain for toroidal compactifications, combined with techniques from Koshikawa.

4. The work is currently focused on Shimura varieties of type A at primes that split completely, where locally the group is just GLN. However, there's optimism that these results can be extended to other groups with the help of techniques developed by Koshikawa and others.

5. Anna clarified the distinction between potentially modular and modular curves. For certain imaginary quadratic fields, all elliptic curves are modular, especially those with a large image modulo 3 or 5 in the case of Gaussian numbers.

6. The audience was encouraged to continue discussions on any aspect of Anna's talk on the ICM discord channel after the event.

7. The talk concluded with gratitude from Anna Pronk for the opportunity to speak at the ICM and thanks to everyone who attended or will watch the recording. The interaction and questions from the audience are always valuable and enrich the experience for all participants, including the speaker.
