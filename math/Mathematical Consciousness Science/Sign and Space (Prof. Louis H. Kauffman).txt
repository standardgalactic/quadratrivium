Welcome. You are about to view a recorded talk from the online seminar series
Progress and Visions in the Scientific Study of the Mind-Matter Relation held in 2018.
The seminars aim to bring together researchers from around the globe
with a background in mathematics or physics who are interested in the
scientific study of consciousness and the mind-matter relation. While each
seminar session consists of a talk and a discussion the latter is not recorded
and the following video will only contain the talk. We hope you enjoy it.
For further information please visit mind-matter-relation.org.
Okay so now let's actually start with the session. So I don't really have to say much
about Lu since many of you know him anyway. For those who don't know him I'm just going to say
some words. So first of all most important thing is he's a mathematician. He's currently an
emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
And his primary work has been and still is on knot theory and its connection to other parts
of mathematics. For example the statistical mechanics to quantum theory to algebra or
to combinatorics. He has also done a lot of research in cybernetics and in foundations
of mathematics and foundations of physics. And his current work still focuses on knot theory
but it also focuses on foundations of quantum physics and on quantum computing.
And most important for our interest it focuses on the understanding of form,
eigenform and reflexive dynamics. So I'm sure some of you have already come across this when
being interested in the scientific study of the mind-matter relation and others will probably
see this at some point. Lu has won many awards and I'm just not going to list them because they
are too many for a short introduction. And he's the author of four books on knot theory as well
as the editor of a journal and the book series focusing on this part of mathematics. His mathematics
achievements have been crowned by him becoming a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2014
and today we're going to have a talk by Lu on the topic sign in space. And with this I can just say
thank you very much Lu for joining us today and for agreeing to give a talk and I would just
pass the virtual microphone over to you at this point. Please go ahead.
Thank you, Johannes. It's a pleasure to be able to talk here. You should be looking at my first
slide which is entitled Sign in Space and it contains some characteristics of the form of
this discussion because I like cartoons and drawings and I like to illustrate ideas by using
geometrical drawings and to use mathematics in a metaphorical way through those drawings.
And what you're looking at here is a well-known Escher print and as you see it consists in
a Mobius strip which has been cut down the middle. That's the largest slit going all the way around
and there are also some decorative cuts. I won't speak about the decorative cuts but
you will notice that it is a three-half twisted Mobius strip which has been cut down the middle
and you'll also notice that it is a knot. It is a knotted band and that is a wonderful fact about
a three-half twisted Mobius band which if you have never done it with a strip of paper you should
do it because it's quite remarkable to see the knot appear in the topological form of the band
after you make the cut. I also illustrate a Mobius band because there are many epistemological
issues that can be illustrated with Mobius bands. For example, in this cut Mobius band there appeared
locally to be two edges in the gap but those edges are actually all part of one edge of the resulting
cut band. So it's two locally and one globally and this idea that something might
delicately or subtly vary between being multiple or single is part of the theme that I want to play
with. So let's go to the next slide. As I said I like cartoons so this is one that I happened to
enjoy. I won't make a comment on it except of course I think none of us believe in the homunculus
but this is a rabbit homunculus and I rather like him. And then there is the matter of what
brings forth the impression of consciousness or mind from a simple drawing, something I'm curious
about for a long time and this is an example. And some of the themes are here as well because
on the one hand the disc has been cut into two halves but then each half seems to be in and of
itself a face but then the entire disc can also be thought of as a face and you tend to shift your
attention among these parts in the form of the distinction that you make. Here's the Mobius strip
again. An ordinary quarter I mean one half turn twisted Mobius band with as you know one edge and
one side and then many people have gotten fascinated with the Mobius band and made sculptures in relation
to it or paintings. And I wanted to just insert just a little bit of topological mathematics here
in relation to the Mobius band that I happen to like I'm proving something here in these arrows
which are going around. If you start in the lower left you see a handle attached to a Mobius band
and both ends of the handle are locally next to one another and on the same local side
of the Mobius band. So the one can think of this as a torus has interacted with a Mobius band.
I wrote Sharp for the interaction and it's sometimes called connected sum but let's just say
that the torus interacted with the Mobius band but then in this sequence of events one of the
handle ends starts walking along the Mobius band moving continuously and ends up going all the way
around the Mobius band and back to the beginning at the end as you go up around and come down on
the lower right. And now what has happened is that the handle is locally attached again
doesn't need the rest of the Mobius band to be described but it's attached in a funny way namely
one end of the handle is attached on one local side of the Mobius band and the other end of the
handle is attached on the opposite side of the local Mobius band. If we were to do a little more
with Mobius bands and Klein bottles and so on I would explain to you but I shant with images here
that what has happened on the right hand lower side is that a Klein bottle has interacted with
the Mobius band and that by using the Mobius band as a catalyst we have effectively turned
a torus into a Klein bottle. It's a bit of the topology of the Mobius band. The Mobius band
has a way of controverting a distinction when you go all the way around it. In this case it
controverts the distinction between the torus and the Klein bottle, a fact of surface topology.
Well that contraversion leads one to make a cartoon about logic. Here is Epimentides paradox of the
liar. The fictional speaker Epimentides is a Cretan reportedly stated the Cretans are always
liars or to say it formally in sentences L is identical to not L which is of course not quite
the same as saying I lie but coming close to it and the formalism I'm aware of this always
that whenever you shift the formalism a little bit and make it a little more symbolic you have
a tendency to lose some part of the meaning but we can take it as a kind of cartoon of the
liar paradox that it says that L is equal to not L and then the knot could be regarded as the going
through the twist and then in the Mobius band L becomes equal to not L by the fact that we're
twisted and connected back around through the Mobius band but of course in the topology there
is no paradox it's only in the interpretation that there's a paradox in fact in the topology
there is the flexibility and motion and ability to work with the Mobius band that makes it a
mathematical object of study and not a paradox at all and the same could be true of paradoxes
if you take them in the right way so from the point of view of logic the liar is in an imaginary
state that is neither true nor false from the point of view of topology the liar has the shape
of a Mobius band and again the boundary of the Mobius band is one and yet it is also two depending
on how you look. Here I'm shifting into a practical problem that is related to the Mobius band
I think you might find the number of shifts that I make into little sidelines
curious and maybe a little unnerving I don't intend to confuse you with these digressions
but I think they're interesting so here's the here's the engineering problem which you may know
design a switching circuit that can control a single light from an arbitrary number of locations
now this can be analyzed by Boolean algebra but I wanted to show you a kind of non-dual solution
that is the invention discovery of a cyberneticist named Ricardo Uribe he saw how to see the solution
to this problem at once maybe I give you a moment to think about the problem but not enough time I'm
not enough time I'm afraid here's his solution you make a switch which either at which has
two lines going in two two connecting lines and two connecting lines going out and the switch has
two states either the lines are crossed over and where they cross over they do not meet I've drawn
it as a crossover but they're not supposed to meet the electrical current could run from the top
to the lower top left to the lower right in the crossover switch and from the lower left to the
top upper right without interfering with itself so the two states are crossed or uncrossed and
as you see if we made a Mobius band and use the wire along the edge of the Mobius band why then the
light would be on where the ends of the light and its power source grapple the two local sides of
the Mobius band but if it was an ordinary band then the light would not be on because there would
be no conductance from one edge to from one loop to the out there so then the solution to the problem
can be to put as many switches as you like along a band uh where the band that really has only the
edges and and then you see that if you have an odd number of switches in the crossed position the
light will be on and if you have an even number of switches in the cross position then the light
will be off and if you change any one switch you will go from parity even to parity odd or parity
odd to parity even and this satisfies the problem in an elegant and simple way it's actually quite
interesting to do the Boolean analysis and find where this solution lives there it lives there
but you might miss it if you're just doing algebra. Now I want to talk about a book and the ideas
related to that book Laws of Form by G. Spencer Brown and I didn't mention in the slideshow that
many of these ideas are implicit and even explicitly but with a slightly different
formalism in the work of Charles Sanders Purse uh earlier than Spencer Brown but Spencer Brown wrote
a very concise and beautiful book uh related to this and I don't know that he knew about Purse's
word so here's a quote or two the what we're talking about is the idea of a distinction
and the act of making a distinction and what kind of mathematical formalism could arise
as close to the notion of distinction as possible so the first quote is we take as given
the idea of distinction and the idea of indication and that one cannot make an indication without
drawing a distinction and we take therefore the form of distinction for the form the first
sentence I think is um easy to understand and the second one is um in its form self-referential
we take the form of distinction for the form but it's a way of uh encapsulating the question
and an answer to what is form and then below that I've drawn a simple distinction of
circle in the plane but for whom and what is this a distinction uh it uh it could be regarded as an
objective distinction by those who are familiar with circles um but for a given person who drew
the circle or who is observing the circle it becomes the awareness of the distinction between
the inside and the outside of that circle so that's the beginning and the circle makes a distinction
in the plane and I put makes in quotes because it doesn't make the distinction you make the distinction
we make a distinction in the plane by drawing a circle the circle and the observer arise together
in the act of perceiving the circle and in that sense that circle this observer and the
distinction that arises are one this is a kind of our one which is like the center core line in
the Mobius band is one and yet it is two if you perturb it a little bit it is the one of connection
and another thing that Spencer Brown wrote in his book is the form we take to exist arises from
framing nothing uh and I like to illustrate this uh in various ways uh in my slides I say we could
stop now in the sense that I've told you everything um but I think some of this needs unpacking and
relating about the purpose of this talk is to look at how by starting in unity we can make
an imaginary complexity and how that's related to the original unity
every discrimination is inherently a process and the structure of our world as a whole
comes from the relationships whose exploration constitutes that world it is a reflexive domain
there is no place to hide in a reflexive domain no fundamental particle no irreducible object
or building block any given entity requires its properties through its relationships with everything
else the talk will trace how a mathematics of distinction arises from the process of
discrimination and how that language understood rightly as an opportunity to join as well as
to divide can aid in the movement between duality and non-duality and the purpose of
the talk is to express this language and invite your participation in it and to present the
possibility that many things are involved in this journey so let's look at set theory in the light
of the form we take to exist arises from framing nothing and you will see what I mean in a moment
let me cartoon the empty set by an empty circle and I will cartoon then the set whose member is
an empty set by a circle inside a circle and the set whose members are zero and one calling the
first two sets zero and one the set whose members are zero and one is thereby the circle surrounding
a circle and circle within a circle and you'll notice I'm not using commas here we can discriminate
the members of these simple sets without having to use commas so then the one the basic principle
for set theory is that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same members
and then you have a basic theorem that there's only one empty set
on the proof suppose you had two sets that were both empty well then they must be equal
because they have the same members none and on the other hand zero is not equal to one because
zero has no members whereas one has a member namely zero remember one here and this is the
beginning of multiplicity started from framing nothing in the context of elementary set theory
these principles generate multiplicities of any size you care to you just keep on going in the
same way empty set set whose members empty set set whose members are zero and one now you form two
then you form the set whose members are zero one and two and you argue on the basis of the
principle of equality that the three is different from zero one and two and so on so it's quite
startling when you begin to think about it how how finite multiplicities and then taking it further
infinite multiplicities rise just out of the notion that you can always form a set you can frame
whatever you've built and form a set consisting in them and as you know there are some paradoxes
in this brew but those are the basic ideas here's three
so i want to think about an initial act of distinction for the distinction to be distinct
there must be a difference between the sides and i'm looking at simple clear distinctions like
drawing a circle in the plane you can think of ones uh that are uh subtler perhaps let us call
one side marked and the other side unmarked and i've indicated that by putting an m on one side
and nothing on the other side and so the distinction is a circle and why should i use an m i'm trying
to be as economical as possible i could let the circle itself stand for it's marked outside
and if i did that then the circle has a name tag in its own form uh in this case the cartoon and uh
and the object of that cartoon are identical except in size and place and the tag and the
name of the tag can be confused so now we have two circles and one of them is regarded as the
name of the other or if they are of equal size and indistinguishable in other ways each could be
regarded as the name of the other and so i don't really need the name tag not in the conventions
of drawing in a plane to know that i have a circle and there is an outside or an inside so i have
a movement which says i do not have to call that name twice because the circle calls its own name
just by being there and i can call the name of the circle with something which has the same form
as the circle and so i get two circles could be identified with a single circle the value of the
call of a name made again is the value of the call we're beginning to evolve a formalism here
not set theoretic uh but using the same cartoons of circles as containers as we did for sets
so this is one rule in the system we're evolving the value of a call made again is the value of
a call two circles next to one another can be replaced by a single circle or vice versa
so far we focused on the distinction as locations of its sides and their names
but i also shall think of the mark the circle the distinction as a transformation
from the state indicated on its inside to the state indicated on the outside
that is if you have a distinction it certainly can be thought of as a transformation it's
implicit in the situation that if i think of the distinction between say myself and world
then i add in my speaking the notion of traveling from self to world or from world to self
or from self to other and other to self once there's a distinction there is the possibility
of moving across from one side of that distinction to another i almost said across the boundary but
we are cartooning distinctions as though they had perceptible boundaries and you will notice
that that's an extra distinction the boundary
so i have crossing from the inside is the outside or crossing from the unmarked is the marked
or crossing from the marked is the unmarked
and now i want to be economical again and so let's go back to cross from the unmarked state
well that's how i'm interpreting the circle on the left there's nothing inside it's unmarked
and this is the same as what we called the mark state the circle itself
designating its outside and so this equation which looks like one identical is equal to another
has become interpreted as dynamical on the left and in the form of naming on the right
and they are compatible with one another in the formalism that we are evolving
and then i have cross from the marked state is unmarked
and if i write that literally i have that two concentric circles could cancel one another
to nothing the value of the cross you made again is not the value of the crossing
and that's the second part of the formalism two circles that are concentric to one another
can cancel and so we end up with a formalism of circles circles that are drawn but do not
necessarily intersect one do not intersect one another like the set theoretic circles but now
we're not interpreting in terms of sets and two next two empty circles next to one another can
cancel down to one condensed to one and two concentric circles with the innermost empty
disappear or appear so for example and and now we're operating the formalism
i have a collection of circles here a nest and the two concentric circles down inside can vanish
and now again now i have two concentric circles on the right and they vanish once i've seen them as
two concentric circles i redrew it and i end up with one single circle a marked state so i would
say that the end of the on the left is marked that's the beginning of the formalism i won't
change it too much from now on but but this formalism is coming just from thinking about
how a distinction might be imaged in this way and and you see that i can perform operations on
the formalism if i wish so in this slide i have in the middle of the slide written a circle around
a and i've called it not a because it it indeed is not a in the world that we've been constructing
just now if a was marked it would be a single circle and a circle around a circle vanishes it
and it becomes not marked so a circle around marked is not marked and a circle around not marked
is marked so the not interchange is marked and unmarked or a single circle and blank space
so i could return to the lyre paradox in this formalism and write l equals l circle and then
if l was marked then it becomes that l is unmarked and if l is unmarked it becomes that l is marked
and how would we solve l equals l with a circle around it
the equation l equals l with a circle around it has a somewhat different sense than
l equals not l which is back a slide never mind it's too far back but once we've translated
into this geometric language this cartoon language then you think that l seems to be sitting inside
its own indicational space in the inner space so it becomes a form of self-reference
we think of the circle as having to do with observation it's a fixed point for putting a
circle around it and maybe a recursion so all those views about about the lyre paradox are
coming out of of playing with this language in this way so i want to use that as an excuse
to digress in the direction of recursion and self-reference i could also have drawn a picture
but i think i didn't put it in this slideshow of an infinite nest of circles going down forever
and then if you put one more circle around it it wouldn't change it geometrically
here's a cartoon that i like in the form of a photograph
and now we're thinking about self-reference and perception
of course you may have different thoughts than i about this picture but it is a nice
a nice discussion that the photographer has created for us because this device is photographing
a part of its own connection to the world and showing us the image it isn't actually showing
itself the image because it doesn't have that much structure
but of course you could imagine machinery that's able to make discriminations in the world
and if the machinery could make a good body of discriminations then it could begin to make
discriminations about its own in a relationship with the world and then such machinery may appear
conscious to us eventually another cartoon i like the regress the infinite nest of circles here
and in all these cases there's this theme of the form reandering its own
educational space as we had l equals l with a circle around it or this stylized form where
the mark is set to a point into its own inner space and if it i did have the nest of circles
if the mark points into its inner space you could imagine an infinite nest purely spatial
of marks and then when you put one more mark around it it will be the same up to the usual
idea of shifting an infinite set or you could think of it as going on in time and in time
it will build first a mark then a mark within a mark and a mark within that and so on building
that way and then i think something i did not put in this slide is that if this square is
if this square satisfies the rules of our formal system with circles then the first one is marked
and the next one is unmarked because two circles make nothing and the next one is marked because
the two inner circles cancel and you're just left with a mark and the next one is unmarked
and so in time if evaluated this reandering form oscillates between being marked and unmarked
like that plus minus plus minus plus and minus and you can even think of some mathematical
objects like the square root of minus one as being in the form of such a discrete oscillation
i point this out to you for the sake of connecting to other things if i write i is equal to minus
one over i and wonder whether i could be real i could try i equals one but then minus one over
one is minus one and if i try minus one then i get one so i squared equals minus one that's the
form of the liar paradox but of course we understand how to keep it from being a paradox
in many ways and in fact it leads to um entire field of mathematics and many connections with
many other things so a paradox might find its right context
on encountering re-entering and reflexive structures we leave the simple dualities for
a complex world and once this sort of pattern sets in it is a challenge to go back to the beginning
this is a cartoon due to john wheeler the physicist about going back to the beginning
this is wheelers u for universe and the universe is observing itself and it is observing
near the big bang which is over there on the right hand part of the letter you see the big
bang has occurred to create the letter the letter the letter is expanding up into the observer on
the left um and wheeler like to talk about this cartoon uh because uh it is a quantum paradox
in quantum theory a phenomenon in in the classical interpretation of quantum theory
in the kopenhagen interpretation of quantum theory a phenomenon is a not a real phenomenon
until it is actual until there's actually an observation a phenomenon becomes actual upon
observation and it's not as only regarded as in the possible uh before an observation is made
so what about the universe itself the universe presumably emerges from the big bang and grows
and eventually becomes possible for it to observe itself and what was the status of the universe
before the observation occurred it was entirely in the possible according to the classical
quantum mechanics but you might find that a little disturbing
and of course there are much subtler aspects of self-reference that we can't easily speak about
now i'm shifting into some statements and then i'll go back to playing with mathematics again
one can be aware of one's own thoughts
an organism produces itself through its own productions
in an environment a market is composed of individuals whose actions influence the market
just as the actions of the market influence these individuals
the participant is an observer but not an objective observer there is no objective observer
there is no objective observer
i flicked i flicked something on my screen how are you guys doing i haven't been watching you
no no we're good but i i flicked to the the the rogues gallery here for a moment by okay and
of course you didn't see that right no there's no objective observer and yet objects repeat
ability a whole world of actions and a reality to be explored arise in this reflexive domain
another escher drawing there now here's a mathematical one which i like
we'll spend a few minutes on this one i like this very much this is about describing describing
and if i said well why don't you think about the theme of describing describing and how that works
how recursively we are acting on our own language and and always always acting on our own language
and acting on our concepts with our concepts and so on you could think of lots of examples
that have nothing to do with mathematics or that have a lot to do with mathematics but
one of the purest examples of describing describing is is a as a gadget that was
um invented or found by john conway i think conway denies that he
discovered this uh sequence but um he certainly analyzed it more deeply than anyone before
it's a puzzle um i'm i'm going to begin with one entity star and and just the language
of the numbers one two three okay and i'm going to be describing describing in relation to star
i begin with star and i say one star and i write it down in my language one star now i describe that
one one one star then i describe that three ones one star and then i describe that one three two
ones one star so you see the you see how this goes right um i'm i'm always scribing into my very
small language of one two three and star uh the result of the previous description
so i get a sequence of numbers if you like i have a star at the end you could start with
a number for star if you wished um and this goes on forever and uh and the patterns are quite
complex and in fact uh if you look at this uh chart here uh you see one one one star and go down
three and you see an extension of one one one star to one one one three one two two one one star
and then you go down three and you see an extension of that and this is in fact of the case uh and you
might have to do a little puzzling to convince yourself of this that as you go down three any
time in this sequence you get an extension of what you had three above so that means that you
could start with the triple one for example and turn it into an infinite sequence by just looking
at this extension that goes on forever and then below it the next one an infinite sequence and
the next one an infinite sequence and you obtain three sequences such that b describes a it does
look at b i'll read b while you look at a look at a i'll read b three ones one three two ones
three twos one one one three three ones two threes two ones three threes and so on
i i think i got off by one three ones one three one one two twos two ones one three yeah okay right
it's working so b describes a c describes b and a describes c so it goes round into three
three and a triplet each of them describing the other like the baromian rings which i've drawn
in the middle the link such that each one uh surrounds one of the others in a triplet
and in the case of the baromian rings you need all three of them if you were to remove one of
them the other two would fall apart i don't know what removing one of these would mean
so this is an example of um how describing describing which is part of what we do all
the time in thought and language um is incredibly powerful uh and if you apply it to even the simplest
mathematical situations gives rise to mysterious and enormous kinds of complexity it's something to
think about uh even this situation with the so-called audioactive sequence is hard to fathom fully
here's the baromian rings a larger picture of them you will notice that blue surrounds green
green surrounds red and red surrounds blue so it goes round in a three like that um the link the
rings are linked uh and uh it takes some work to prove mathematically that the rings are linked
it isn't quite enough to say that each one surrounds the other to be convinced mathematically
that they are linked they are a three-fold relation um that is you need all three of them in order for
the relationship to occur uh it isn't binary anymore um uh i'm now digressing into a little bit
of non-theory as we head in towards the end of this talk um here is uh trefoil knot and um and and
here it's linked with itself um and how it's linked with itself is also kind of mysterious
um you make a knot by making a loop in a rope and then you bring the end of the rope down through
the loop in order to lock it and you have to do it in the right way and then attach the ends together
and you end up with this topological entity a trefoil knot which won't go away without breaking
or cutting it i've indicated something else that i won't go into in the talk except to mention it
i've indicated a way to understand the topology of the trefoil knot by making a certain kind of
distinction in this case it's a three-fold distinction i have drawn i have colored one of the arcs green
one of the arcs blue and one of the arcs red the arcs go from under crossing to under crossing
red you'll notice starts at under goes across and ends at under blue starts at another under
and goes across and ends at under and so with green and if you start if you take as a rule
that you shall have three colors at a crossing or else only one you could imagine red red red at
a crossing that's a rule for a game to play in in drawing other pictures of the knot then you will
find that the three nests the three colored nests persists no matter what you do to the knot
and it is that three nests persisting that can be used to verify or come to the conclusion that
the trefoil knot could never be changed into an unknot for an unknot as an unknoted single
circle would have only one color by the rules of this game another way of thinking about the knots
is as forms they're independent of the substrate that they care that carries them i could have a
knot on hemp or a knot on cotton and i could have cotton turning into hemp and slide the knot along
and it would still have the same form but it would have a different substrate so this is related to
that dictum from a while back that the that we take the form of distinction for the form the knot
is an example of a of a pattern which is independent of the substrate on which it lives and yet you
wouldn't have a knot if you didn't have some substrate in order to support it and in mathematics
we support it with mathematical substrates of various kinds curves in space um but in in the
world you may support it with a rope or some field that is knotted lots of possibilities
uh i am uh going to skip some things here um but i'll give you a little look see at them while i do
them too quickly uh i like to play with the formalism of the knots and turn it into a kind of set
theory where an underline is a member of the overline it's very simple and then we can do
cartooning of set theory using knot diagrams and you see that in such cartoons you would have
self membership because a line could curl around like that and be a member of itself and you can
also have mutuality where a goes under b and b goes under a and that's a link uh and you have sets
that are mutually creating each other in that way so you have a a different model of set theory
coming out of this form of cartooning but you also have the old counting as well zero is the empty
set it has nobody going under it one is the set which has only zero going under it two is the set
which has zero and one going under it and three the set which has zero one and two going under it
and so on um or you could think about another paradox russell's paradox a is a member of a
in the left but topologically i removed the self membership and a is not a member of a
so you have an equal opportunity uh attitude towards self membership in this knot set theory
like that um but now i want to talk about as we are coming towards the end i want to talk about
uh some relationships with ideas about particles so here's spencer brown's mark again this time
written as a right angle bracket instead of a circle that's the way he liked to write it and
it interacts with itself in the two ways either producing nothing crossover cross equals nothing
or producing itself mark next to mark is equal to mark but now i want to think of it as a kind
of elementary particle that has two ways of interacting with itself it can interact with
itself to annihilate itself and become nothing it is its own antiparticle or it can interact with
itself to produce itself condense to itself if you made a particle diagram interaction picture
cartoon it would look like this p interacts with p to produce p or p interacts with p to produce
star where star is the um unmarked particle the nothing and um back to circles it would be the
same um but if you think of circles interacting uh then you can imagine these interactions in a
geometrical way as well um i could have two circles which are forming a surface by going
through a saddle point and they become one um and if you slowed that down slice by slice in the
world line of the two circles interacting in the form of a of a saddle surface on the left
you would see two circles coming together sharing a bit of boundary cancelling the bit of boundary
and becoming one um or you could think of two circles going through a saddle point and becoming a
single circle and the single circle disappears or you could think of two concentric circles
where the outer concentric the outer circle comes eventually just into contact with the
inner circle and they do each other in um and that looks like another surface a kind of a vase
with an inner vase so you can make geometrical pictures of these particle interactions and a
particle that interacts with itself to either produce itself or annihilate itself is called
a myerana particle a tori myerana conjectured the existence of such particles that are their
own antiparticles in the 1930s he thought perhaps the neutrino or it has been thought that the
neutrino might be a myerana particle um but then more recently um myerana particles have been um
understood as uh so-called quasi particles in collectivities of electrons and uh it is also
the case that mathematically and I won't do it in the talk one can think of the electron as a kind
of composite of two myerana particles and so the idea of myerana particle is um quite interesting
these days and the mark as a formalism is a logical particle with these properties
and uh I wanted to show you some kinds of a couple of things about such particles um
so I have pp can decompose I mean can compose as it were into either p or nothing right so I
could write this as an equation uh p interacting with p equals p plus star where the plus now
means or really but it's written in an arithmetical way or and I say this reflects the golden mean and
the fibonacci numbers this is for your amusement interacting p with itself I let p interact with
itself and I get p plus star I let it interact one more time and you see I get p and p and star and
p but star and p is p and p and p is p and star and together that collects up to two p's and a star
and you do it one more time you get three p's and two stars five p's and three stars eight p's and
three star eight p's and five stars misprint 13 p's and eight stars and so on you generate the
fibonacci numbers uh the equation if you thought of it as an equation numerically of p squared equals
p plus one corresponds to the proportions of a golden rectangle you could divide by
p and you would get that that i divided by p is p minus i divided by i and those that
corresponds to the proportions of the rectangle you're looking below where you can think of i
as the vertical length sorry not labeled and p is the horizontal length and the ratio of the
horizontal length to the vertical length is p that's the uh proportion of the large rectangle
but being golden means that the smaller rectangle obtained by cutting a square from the larger
has the same proportions and the uh proportions of that are smaller to larger i to p is the same
as smaller to larger in the in the rectangle on the right the rectangle on the right is p minus i
we removed i and divided by i so you have the equation i is to p as p minus i is to i one
um and that's the same as p squared equals p plus one and the solution to that quadratic is one
plus the square root of five over two the golden ratio so um so the uh self-interacting particle
that produces itself or else nothing uh is closely related to the geometry of the golden
rectangle into the fibonacci numbers and this looks like recreational math related to the
first distinction from one side but on the other hand this primitive fibonacci particle
takes part in mathematical physics models that can be used for universal topological computation
and for studying certain topological problems the actuality of such applications depends upon
emerging physics of um the way electrons behave in cold plates and in the way electrons may behave
in nanowires and other things like this but what you see here is that the boundary between the most
elementary mathematics and that elementary mathematics is right next to the question of
what is the relationship between our mathematics and and ourselves and our mind and our ability
to discriminate and the mathematics is directly related to discrimination and distinction on the
one hand and ends up being related to um some of the most interesting emerging physics at the same
time so uh there's a lot to think about here in that regard um i think given the amount of time we
have that this is a good place to stop rather than go on and show you more slides
