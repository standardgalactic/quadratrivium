Checking Self-Dual Universe/[Podcast] Jonathan Gorard on compositionality, multicomputation, ontology and functoriality (part 1).txt
1. Jonathan's talk revolved around the idea of finding a deep relationship between syntax and semantics within the context of multi-way systems, with a particular focus on how this can be applied to various fields such as physics, computation, and chemistry.
   
2. He discussed the concept of an infinity category limit, which is a mathematical abstraction that could potentially reconcile syntax and semantics into a unified framework where they are functorially equivalent. This means that at this abstract level, the syntax (structure) of a system directly maps to its semantic interpretation (meaning).

3. Jonathan proposed that causality is closely linked to semantics in these systems. His hypothesis suggests that causal structures within a multi-way system can be derived from its syntax, and vice versa, implying a one-to-one correspondence between the two.

4. He mentioned a project aimed at cataloging various notions of causal semantics across different scientific domains and encoding them within algebraic frameworks like concurrent processes, petri nets, and sigma nets. The goal is to develop a unified compositional semantics that can be applied to construct possible causal structures consistent with given multi-way systems.

5. Jonathan emphasized the potential of the center's resources to advance this research and to create formalisms that allow us to computationally map from syntax to semantics in a more concrete way.

6. The conversation also touched on applications in systems biology, which Jonathan finds very exciting due to the complexity and multi-way nature of biological data and processes.

7. At the end of his talk, Jonathan expressed his enthusiasm for the ongoing discussions and potential collaborations within the center, and he was open to staying for further conversation after the recording concluded.

In essence, Jonathan is working towards a unified mathematical framework that can describe the relationship between syntax (the form or structure) and semantics (the meaning or interpretation) in complex systems, with an emphasis on the interplay of causality within this framework. This research has broad implications for various scientific disciplines, including physics, computation, and chemistry, as well as potentially transformative applications in fields like systems biology.
