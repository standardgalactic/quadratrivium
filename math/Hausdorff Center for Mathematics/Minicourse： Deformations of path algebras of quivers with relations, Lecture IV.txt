Okay, so the last talk will be about applications to geometry, and we've seen a number of examples
of path algebras of quivers with relations and their deformations, and these path algebras
of quivers of relations also appear in the context of algebraic geometry.
So if we have an algebraic variety X over a field of characteristic zero algebraically
closed, then X sometimes admits what's called a tilting bundle, and that means that the
bundle sort of generates the derived category of X, and it has no higher self-extensions,
and it's also a compact object, and in this case the tilting bundle T induces a derived
equivalence between the derived category of X and the derived category of A, where
A is the endomorphism algebra of the tilting bundle, and so this endomorphism algebra can
be written as path algebra of a quiver with relations, and so this derived equivalence
actually lifts to an equivalence of DG categories, and so in particular it also induces an isomorphism
under Hochschild homologies, and so actually this is not just an isomorphism of not just
an isomorphism of vector spaces of the Hochschild homologies, but actually this is an isomorphism
of B infinity algebras in the category of B infinity algebras, and so in particular the
deformation theory of sort of several related objects are equivalent, and so this is worked
by Keller and Lohan Vandenberg, and so we have sort of two sides here, one is the sort
of geometric side here on the left, and one is a more algebraic side, and so here we have
deformations of the abelian category of core in chiefs as abelian category on the left
here, and here we have and look at the structure sheath and look at deformations as a twisted
pre-sheath, so these two types of deformations are actually equivalent, and actually we can also
restrict the structure sheath to an affine open cover which is closed under intersections,
and this gives a diagram of commutative algebras in this case, and so the deformations of this
diagram of algebras, this was also studied by Gastonhaber Schach, so you can look at
associative deformations of this diagram of algebras, this point of view is also equivalent
to the other ones, and from this diagram algebra you can also define, sorry from this diagram
of algebras you can define an associative algebra which is called the diagram algebra also introduced
by Gastonhaber Schach, and this again is an equivalence of deformations, and so on the
right hand side here we have the abelian category of modules, here finitely generated modules for
example, and the deformations of this abelian category are equivalent to deformations of
AS associative algebra, okay, and now in the context of the previous slides A it could be the
endomorphism algebra of a tilting bundle which you can write as a quiver, it's path algebra of
a quiver with relations, and so that's this part here, and actually in this picture there's another
part where path algebras of quivers with relations appear, and that's this part down here, so the
diagram algebra can also be written as the path algebra of a quiver with relations, and so this
allows us to relate sort of algebraic deformations of kq mod i now also to geometry and try to
understand what this means on the on the geometric side, okay, and so to get a feel of what sort of
things one should look at from the point of view of geometry is that we look at the Hochschild
homology which is the sort of first order deformations up to equivalence, and if x is smooth
then we have a decomposition theorem called the Hochschild-Kostan-Rosenberg theorem, and this
gives an isomorphism as follows, so we have the second Hochschild homology of the the variety,
and this now decomposes into into three summands, and the first summand here these are sections of
the second exterior power of the tangent bundle, because I didn't know tilting bundle by t here
I called tangent bundle theta, and so these global sections are just global bi-vector fields,
and when you do the formal deformation theory this will correspond to quantizations of some
Poisson structures, and so the second summand here h1 of the tangent bundle is also known to
control the deformations as a variety, and then the third third summand here corresponds to so
called twists, and so trying to interpret this in terms of the of the diagram we can we can have
a diagram of algebras you get by restricting the structure sheath to an affine open, affine open
cover, and then on each open set you have a commutative algebra, the algebra of regular functions
on this on this open set, and you can do a deformation of this algebra here, right, and this
will in general be a non commutative deformation, so if you if you look here at the at the second
part you can look at the formations of of the variety itself, and so this will in terms of the
diagram this will not change the commutativity of the algebras on the open sets, but it will deform
how how they sort of fit together, so you can think of it as as changing the gluing of these
open sets, and then the sheath condition says that there's a commutative diagram so restricting
from one set to smaller sets to the intersection should commute, so it should be the identity but
you can also deform this, so this is this twist part here, okay, and now if x is smooth and
affine, then the higher sheath homology vanishes, and so we only have the term h0 here, and so
deformations in this case correspond to quantizations of some Poisson structure,
and so in particular if x is just the affine n-space, then these two points of view coincide
because the diagram algebra is yeah coincides with the endomorphism algebra of the tilting
bundle which is just the the trivial bundle of the structure sheath on an, and so as we've seen
probably in all of the talks up to now this we can write as a path algebra of a quiver with
relations by choosing one vertex and then and loops at this vertex, and so for this we have a nice
reduction system where xj xi gets reduced to xixj for j bigger than i, so this is the reduction
system here, and this satisfies the diamond condition for this ideal here, and then we
have the set of first entries which are the elements we replace in the reductions, okay,
and as soon as n is bigger or equal to 3 we also have overlaps, and so the overlaps look like this
xk xj xi where k is bigger than j is bigger than i, and so in this case deformations may also be
obstructed, okay, and so now if we take a closer look of what this means on an we can have a
bi-vector field which is of the following form, so here eta as a bi-vector field and eta ij's,
they are just functions, so polynomial coefficients, and then you have a wedge of these two tangent
vectors, and given such a bi-vector field we can directly associate an element in
hom ks to a, so this was sort of this this term in the in the complex you get from this
resolution of the associated to a reduction system, so this was the same degree as the
second Hochschild homology, okay, and then we can send xj xi, we just send it to the coefficient
of this of this bi-vector, and now we also introduce a formal variable h bar,
so this is now as an element in here, and for this we have a l infinity structure,
and we can look at the Mao Carton equation, and so eta is a Poisson structure, so bi-vector field
could or could not satisfy the Jacobi identity, and it does if and only if for these overlaps
the Mao Carton equation holds modulo h bar cubed,
so again here we look at the overlaps with k, it's bigger than j, it's bigger than i,
and then we look at associativity of these overlaps, and if if this equation
which is equivalent to the Mao Carton equation, this equation holds to all orders,
then star g, this combinatorial star product that we saw in the last two lectures,
this is a deformation quantization of this Poisson structure, okay, so here,
what it says here, so if it's a Mao Carton element, then this is a quantization,
and right this equation we can sort of check by hand,
and in particular on A2 there are no overlaps, so this combinatorial star product can quantize any
Poisson structure, and on A3 not all Poisson structures are Mao Carton elements straight away,
so if you put them, here we sort of put the Poisson structure in in degree one in h bar,
and if you compute these equations to a higher order sometimes it's not satisfied at order h bar
cubed, maybe, but so on on A3 there's a classification of quadratic Poisson structures,
and sort of 14 families of Poisson structures, and I think about half of them
satisfy this Mao Carton equation, so for at least for those you could get a quantization
of those Poisson structures sort of out of the box, yes, and in general you may have to add higher
terms to g here, which is only degree one, you can try to add higher terms to make sure that it
becomes a Mao Carton element, and yeah this can also be done sometimes, but we don't yet have a
complete algorithm to do this for any Poisson structure, okay,
and so I, yeah let me let me mention also Concevage's formula, which he used to to prove his
formality theorem, which I mentioned in the in the second talk, and so this formula is as follows,
so if you have two two functions a and b, you can look at the Concevage star product,
just defined as follows, so you define a number of sort of a set of graphs, which are called admissible
graphs, and the graphs sort of have one Poisson structure at the top, and then two arrows coming
out of them that correspond to partial derivatives of the of the target,
and so I've drawn sort of one of these graphs here, so here you would have the function a,
you here would have the function b, then here you sort of have the Poisson structure
at a maybe sitting at one of these upper vertices, and then each arrow corresponds to a
derivation of the target here with some labeling, and so there's a description of how to associate
to such a graph, how to associate a bideferential operator, so this is this
b lambda here, this is a bideferential operator acting on a and b, which will sit
sort of in the graph at these two vertices at the bottom, and then there's a coefficient here,
so this is the so-called weight or a Concevage weight of this graph, and
now this is defined by embedding this graph into the upper half plane, and then using
hyperbolic geometry there to get some angle form for each edge in the graph, and then
wedging them and integrating over the configuration space of points, you get
a real number, and this is the weight of this graph, and this enters here as a coefficient,
and so these weights are sort of a bit mysterious, maybe they're related to some
motivic integrals and have recently been shown to be sort of multiple zeta values,
and the reason I mention this here is that there's also a sort of similar graphical calculus for this
for the star product, this combinatorial star product we defined, star g, and so the formula
looks very similar, and so here a star gb is a sum over graphs here, and then there's some
bideferential operator c pi, so here pi is also a graph, and actually it's the pair of a graph that
appears in Concevage's formula, but the first entry will always be a graph without oriented cycles,
so in Concevage's picture construction you can have a sort of graph that looks like this maybe,
and then there's an oriented cycle, and so these we do not get from reductions, but we do get
some extra data we have to associate to the graph, which is a linear order of the incoming
edges at each vertex, and so here you have two incoming edges, and so they can either be ordered
in the way I've drawn here or ordered in the other way, okay, and so if this is a,
if you have a Mao Carton element for this L infinity algebra pqr tensor h bar,
then this graphical formula already gives a quantization, a formula for the quantization of
the Poisson structure corresponding to g1, and so g1 will be a Poisson structure,
right, and as was mentioned in the in the last talk,
there's a question whether this star product maybe converges,
and yeah, Concevage conjectures that his star product converges for quadratic Poisson structures
on a small neighborhood of zero, and then he sort of writes that he expects that this
to be true, so if you take y star x with his star product, Concevage star product,
then you should get something like exponential of h bar xy, but because of the coefficients that
appear in the formula here, these weights, actually this is not so easy to prove,
okay, and now we can also of course, we have no overlaps, and for on A2 we have no overlaps,
so we can also give a different star product using this combinatorial star product, and in this case
we should choose g of yx, sending yx to xy h bar, because again we take the coefficient function
of the bi-vector and put it here, and yes, and in this case, if we try to compute
the star product through two monomials, then we basically only have to have to reorder
these, because the rule is we write them together, and then we start interchanging them by doing
reductions, and sometimes replacing them by the old commutativity relations, and sometimes using
this element g instead, okay, and then we get sort of explicit formula at least for this Poisson
structure on A2, yes, and for two polynomials A and B, this is then also polynomial in h bar,
and so particularly you can also evaluate this for all h bar.
Okay, so yeah, let me also move on to the part where we discuss things which are not affine,
and so if x is a variety which is not affine, then if it admits a tilting bundle, then this gives a
very sort of compact description of the of the deformations of the category of
quarry and sheaves, for example, of the diagram algebra, sorry, of the diagram of algebras, and
right, and the sort of the classical example of a variety with a tilting bundle is pn,
and p1 does not have any any deformations, so the first example with deformations would be p2,
and here we have a tilting bundle o plus o1 plus o2,
and so it has three direct summands, and these direct summands correspond to three vertices here,
and then you have three arrows from o to o1, and then also three arrows from o1 to o2,
and then they satisfy something like commutativity relations,
because essentially the maps are given by multiplying by one of the homogeneous coordinates,
and yeah, so these are like commutativity relations, but now they're sort of spread out
along the along this acyclic quiver, right, and this path algebra modulo this ideal of relations
is the anamorphism algebra of the tilting bundle, and now we can try to understand the
the deformations, and so if we're given the reduction system, the set s of first entries,
is this xj yi with i smaller than j, and now we can look at the elements in HOM from ks to a,
so we should look at the three elements in s, and now we have exactly,
so there are nine paths of length two, so for example this one here, and then this one,
this one, and so on, and three of them are reducible, and six of them are irreducible,
and now we can use g and map to any linear combination of the irreducible ones,
and so yeah, if we consider g given as follows with 10 coefficients lambda 1 up to lambda 10,
then this actually gives these are core cycles that give a basis of the of the Hochschild
cosmology, so otherwise we would also have sort of terms here, so there are eight terms missing,
HOM ks to a is actually an 18 dimensional, but the cosmology is only 10 dimensional, so we've
yeah, we don't need to consider those because they will be, the definitions will be equivalent
if we add those co-bondries, okay, and the Mao Katou equation is empty, it's no equation because
no overlaps, and so we immediately get that we can change, modify the ideal like this,
and we get a 10 dimensional family of definitions, all of the algebras in the family will be 15
dimensional like the original algebra, now we can try to understand what this means in terms of
geometry, so there's an explicit isomorphism induced by tilting between the Hochschild
cosmology of this algebra a, which is the endomorphism algebra of the tilting bundle,
and the Hochschild cosmology of p2, which by the Hochschild-Kostan-Rosenberg theorem is
it's the global bi-vector fields on p2, and so this is also just the isomorphic to the global
sections of O3, and so here you have cubic homogeneous polynomials, okay, and so under this
isomorphism, G is sent to the, so G is defined on the previous page here, G is sent to the
cubic polynomial eta, which you get by multiplying each of the
terms by some other linear monomial, and then just setting x, the x is equal to the y's, x i
equals to y i, and then we get the cubic polynomial in x,
and x 0, x 1, x 2, which are the homogeneous coordinates of p2, and so locally this means
that if you look at the sort of standard open set here, locally you get this picture,
so here eta was the cubic polynomial, and now we can de-homogenize that,
and so this again is a cubic polynomial, but now in these local, in these two local coordinates.
Okay, so this is the bi-vector field,
and so this gives a description of the deformation theory of
the abelian category of quaring sheaves on p2,
but it's not true that a variety always admits a tilting bundle,
so then we can look at this diagram algebra, which I mentioned on the second slide,
and what you do is you can take an affine open cover, and then you can restrict the
structure sheave to this open cover, and then you somehow build all this information into one big
associative algebra, and so
if you write this as the path algebra of a quiver relations, then it looks like this,
so here are maybe the open sets of pn, and then there are the single intersections,
and then the double intersections, and here at the end would be the intersection of all the open sets,
and then on each open set you sort of write the algebra of
local functions as path algebra of a quiver with one vertex and loops,
and so this gives you a big quiver like this, and then you have for the diagram algebra you
have three types of relations, one which looks like commutativity of the restriction morphisms,
and the other sort of relates the coordinates on one chart to the coordinates on another chart,
and then here you have the commutativity relations, and then maybe also relations coming from a
given by some homogeneous polynomial if you cut out a variety in projective space,
so the statement of this proposition is that if you have a projective variety which you've
embedded into pn and you can take the standard open cover of pn and restrict it to this variety x,
and then the diagram algebra of x is actually the path algebra of this sort of complicated
quiver with these types of relations, okay, and in particular one can check that there's also
a non commutative Kruppner basis for this ideal here giving a reduction system satisfying the
diamond condition, okay, and yeah, so the reduction system looks like if you,
basically the idea is to use a nice order on the intersection here and then make sure that
everything is compatible in all directions, okay, so this gives a nice reduction system so we can
also describe the definitions of this path algebra of quiver with relations which is
definitions of the diagram algebra, and so as you can see from the picture this diagram
algebra is much bigger than you want maybe, but yeah maybe this is all you can get in some
in some situations, but one advantage the diagram algebra has that it's sort of
very closely related to the geometry, right, so I said that these vertices here basically have the
algebra on an affine open, algebra of regular functions an affine open, so in this sense it is
more geometric, and so in the case of p2 we can take a look at the diagram algebra, and so here I
want to choose a Poisson structure corresponding to this cubic polynomial, and the diagram algebra
now looks like this, and so this quiver with the relations as in the proposition,
and so now here are sort of the affine open sets, so this is u0, u1, u2, and here would be like the
intersection of u0 and u1, and under deformation you can check that for this particular Poisson
structure what it does to this algebra here is that it deforms the commutative polynomial ring
and two variables to sort of a quantum polynomial ring, and so the same happens
on this vertex, and the same happens at this vertex, and so you can give
deformation of the whole diagram algebra for p2, and now it looks like a non-commutative
projective plane which is glued from three affine quantum planes, okay,
okay, so this was trying to compare the
diagram algebra and the algebra that you get from the endomorphism algebra of a tilting bundle,
but here for p2 we only had one type of deformation because all of them sort of corresponded to
quantizations of some Poisson structure, because p2 doesn't have any commutative
deformations and also so no twists, and so now I want to, for the rest of the talk I will
focus on this family of examples which have both commutative and non-commutative deformations
geometrically, and so these are the resolutions of the 1 over k11 surface singularity,
so if we take a cyclic group of order k, so gamma cyclic group of order k, we can let it act on c2
by this, so here's a 2 by 2 matrix diagonal entries omega, omega, and here omega is a
primitive kth root of unity, and so maybe if this is not 1 1, but 1 n, we could also consider
this case more generally, but let me talk about this case, so c2 mod gamma is then
a toric singular affine variety, which is the 1 over k11 singularity,
and this has a resolution, a geometric resolution, a minimal resolution, which you can
so get from toric geometry, so the original singular fan was this here, then you can add
an array here, and then you get sort of two cones in the fan,
and then the resolution is a quasi-projective variety,
which is isomorphic to the total space of o minus k on p1.
Okay, and now we have a tilting bundle on p1, the valence and tilting bundle on p1,
you can check that the pullback of this bundle to this bigger space
is also a tilting bundle on the bigger space on the resolution,
and so the resolution is derived equivalent to this algebra a here, so here we have two direct
summons, o and o1 on the resolution, so we have two vertices here, and then you can sort of see
the p1 here, which are the two arrows in the in the one direction, so this here would be the
the morphism algebra of a tilting bundle on p1, but now you also have maps from
on the bigger space and the resolution, you also have maps from o1 to o again,
like here, there's exactly, exactly k of them, and they also satisfy some
some some relations, and so you should caution by this ideal of relations, and I've again marked
marked which entries I want to be in the first entry of the reduction system,
and which in the second, so here the blue ones will be the s's and the greens the f s's,
and right, and so this this is the reduction system then that satisfies the diamond condition,
so we can do this whole procedure of trying to find deformations by changing this ideal
in a way that gives gives a nice deformation,
okay, so I should maybe also mention that for k equals 2, this is this is the
pre-projective algebra of extended Dinkin diagram a1 that was mentioned in the last talk,
okay, yes, so I should also point out that this a is actually what's called a reconstruction
algebra that was introduced by by Weems to to describe the sort of non-commutative resolutions of
these of these singularities, and so yeah this reconstruction algebras are defined in more
generality again, but for this algebra for this type of singularity, the algebra on the previous
slide is exactly the reconstruction algebra, and now we can compute the second Hochschild
homology of this algebra to see what kind of deformations we might expect, and as I said
now there are two summands here, so one summand here corresponds to the Poisson structures
on the on the resolution, so these should be some sort of geometrically non-commutative
deformations, and the second entry, the second summand here corresponds to commutative deformations,
and so this is a finite dimensional vector space of dimension k minus 1,
and this here is actually infinite dimensional over over c, over the field,
but it's finitely generated as a as a module of global functions on the resolution, which is also
the functions on the on the singularity, okay, so you can prove this either geometrically using
Czech homology, maybe also use the Toric methods, or again also via the reduction systems
from the algebra a, and as in the case of p2, the isomorphism given by by tilting
allows us to relate
cosycles for for this description via reduction systems to sort of cosycles
on the on the geometric side of the calculation via Czech homology, for example,
and and also correspondingly the deformations you obtain from these
from these cosycles when they are unobstructed,
you can interpret them then geometrically, so you have algebraic
deformations of of this algebra a, and they they have sort of two types
which correspond to commutative deformations on the geometric side or to some sort of quantizations
of Poisson structures, and so for the commutative deformations these turn out to be
and correspond to to pbw deformations
which were studied by Crawley-Bovey and Holland, the paper on on pre-projective algebras, and then
Carmasen also studied these
and a bit more generality of these these one over k one n singularities,
and so just to to give an idea again what what we should expect is that
if gamma is in sl2c then the in the resolution admits a symplectic structure so for one over k
one one that means that k should be equal to two so one over two one one this is admits a symplectic
structure and for k bigger equal to three this will not admit a symplectic structure anymore
because then this is not an element in sorry the group gamma is not in sl2c anymore
and
yeah the pbw deformations of of this algebra a that we're trying to describe the pbw deformations
correspond to commutative deformations of the resolution as well as quantizations of the
symplectic structure so somehow the pbw deformations in this case when we are in sl2
we also get something that geometrically we would expect to be non commutative
okay and so for this one over k one one singularity we can again choose co cycles
which i now call alpha one up to k minus one it should be here sorry k
minus one from hom cs to a
and so we choose the co cycles to correspond to a basis of of these
of this summons in the hochschild constant Rosenberg decomposition
and and then we can see that that the associated element g here is now a more cotton element
of this l infinity algebra pqr and now we've tensored with with this ideal because we have
k minus one so this is the maximal ideal of the polynomial of a formal power series in these k
minus one coordinates and yeah and it turns out that under this choice these this element g
gives a formal deformation um which also admits an algebraization as we saw in the last talk
and the reason is that this is a pbw deformation in this case and so here we've added on uh or we
subtract here um e zero tj and so e zero is a shorter path than x zero yj
and so since sense a path of length two to a path of length zero um and all elements of s
and so it satisfies this this condition strictly smaller on the path length and we get an algebraization
and then if we evaluate this algebraic uh algebraized um deformation at some
some constants we obtain a malcator element of the of the non-formal l infinity algebra
and the associated algebra to this is then morita equivalent to its center
uh whenever lambda is non-zero and what do we get um we get a commutative deformation of the
of the of the singularity yeah which is also a commutative deformation of the of the resolution
in fact so if you deform the resolution in this case uh you start with a quasi-projective
variety which is not affine but as soon as you deform in any commutative direction you get an
affine variety and the functions on this affine variety is exactly these are the commutative
definitions of the singularity um right and then we can also look at uh at the non-commutative
deformations and so when for this um one sorry one over k one one singularity again if k is
bigger or equal to three then um an associated cyclic group is not in not a subgroup of sl2c
but only subgroup of gl2c and now we can choose um um three co-cycles corresponding to the generators
of of the of the Poisson structures so i said this was a infinite dimensional but it's a module
over the global functions and we can choose generators also on the side of the of the
deformations of the reduction systems and so when we do this um we see that this is again
a Mao Carton element so here now we have three formal variables corresponding to these
three three generators we use three formal variables t0 t1 t2
and this is a Mao Carton element of of this l infinity algebra
and in fact if we if we throw out either beta zero or beta two then the order condition that
was mentioned in the in the last talk um also it allows us to to give a
an algebraization of of the associated formal deformation um in this case
and so the the point is that the g takes a path of length two here um but maps it to a path of length
two so it does not satisfy this this strictly lower condition but it satisfies the sort of admissible
order um condition that it's smaller with respect to to some order you can choose on the paths
and so then also the reductions become finite so the star the formal star product actually
is just a finite sum in this case and yeah and you have this uh this result that this this algebraic
family gives a family of deformations corresponding to to some degenerate Poisson
degenerate Poisson structures on the on the resolution okay so um
yeah i will close with mentioning sort of one one observation here which is that if you if you
have a if you have a quiver you can look at modular space of quiver representations
um for some stability condition and some dimension vector
and so uh karmazin has shown that uh that a variety um x which admits a tilting bundle
can actually be recovered as the modular space of of uh semi-stable representations of
of this quiver with relations and so the quiver with relations is the one that's associated to
to the tilting bundle t um yeah and so this m here is the modular space of semi-stable
representations and so for so if you choose the dimension vector and the stability condition
correctly you can recover um the variety and um yeah and he also showed in a different
paper i think that um that the tilting bundle actually lifts to a commutative
deformation of of x um yeah so let let me say what what you then get in case of the
one over k one one singularity so you have you can you can find that when you deform
the ideal corresponding to a commutative deformation so here i lambda is uh
it's a it's a deformation of the ideal um that or a deformation of the of the algebra that
corresponds to a commutative deformation commutative direction um that's a lambda here
is in h1 of the tangent um then you have this isomorphism that the that the fibers of this
family are actually um the deformations of the of the resolution so the resolution deforms
and then you can um check that the modular space uh for the fit for some some dimension
vector and stability condition is isomorphic to to the deformation
and um what's also interesting is that uh that in the non commutative case
you can deform the algebra non commutatively so you change the ideal um change the ideal in this way
here and uh when you evaluate this you get again an algebra of uh the same the same basis
and the the modular space for the same dimension vector and same stability condition now it doesn't
give uh uh well it still gives a a commutative variety because the modular spaces is a quasi
projective variety and this variety is actually exactly the the degeneracy locus of the Poisson
structure that you use to deform this um ideal yeah in order to to make to make sense of the
statement we sort of used the uh the existence of an algebraization which allowed us to to get an
actual algebra here with an actual ideal which is an actual deformation of the algebra
okay and um yeah let me just uh also mention that when when uh
when the resolution admits a symplectic structure then the symplectic structure is not
generated and indeed the modular space for this um for the same uh stability condition
and the same dimension vector is is empty in this case
yeah so this is sort of an uh an example of what what sort of thing can happen if you
if you fix um fix the
the the quiver and the dimension vector and the stability but you vary the relations in the quiver
because um yeah so usually one can look at like variation of stability structures and understand
what what happens in this case but uh yeah so this is an example of what can happen
when you vary the vary the relations in the quiver what happens to the modular space of
quiver representations
okay and um this concludes the last talk thank you very much for making it to the end of the last talk
