Okay, so in the first talk I talked about reduction systems and said that this will
help us describe definitions of associative algebras by basically by giving a choice of
a k basis of the algebra and then in this talk I'm going to explain how to use this point
of view to give an explicit description of the of the deformed algebra and also the conditions
you have to impose in order to change the ideal or change the reduction system in a
way that that gives gives actually a deformation and doesn't drop in dimension okay and so
underlying this this description is this theory of L infinity algebras which control
which control deformation problems and so this sort of goes back to philosophy I think first
formulated by Deline in a in a letter to Goldman and Nelson and this philosophy says that in
characteristic zero any deformation problem is controlled by some d g l algebra and so this
means that given some deformation function this deformation function is isomorphic to
to the deformation function you can associate to some to some d g l algebra
here and so sort of more recently and this has become a theorem
phrased in the context of the language of infinity categories and so the theorem is by
lary and pritam says that in characteristic zero there's an equivalence of infinity categories
between the category of formal modulite problems and the infinity category of d g l algebras
and sort of on this on this side of the d g l algebras also sit d g l algebras up to homotopy
and so these are l infinity algebras
and yeah then you you can hope to find a an l infinity algebra d g l algebra that controls
your deformation problem and but this this is not this is not unique so if you have two
l infinity quasi isomorphic d g l algebras or l infinity algebras then the associated
deformation function are factors are actually isomorphic and so one famous example
where this point of view was sort of used and especially the point of view of l infinity algebras
was that was in conservatist proof of his formality theorem and so so the result that he was able
to prove using this is that every Poisson structure admits a deformation quantization
and and so in the context of these Poisson structures and star products there were actually
two d g l a's so here maybe g and g prime where d g l algebras and on the one side
the Mao Carton elements that were the Poisson structures and on the other side there were
there were sort of associative deformations
of a certain type which which are star products and and then he was able to show that that the
deformation functions that there's a l infinity quasi isomorphism between these two d g l algebras
to show that the deformation functions isomorphic and then this statement follows from this okay
and so yeah just sort of sort of the general heuristic of why these higher structures appear
is that in general if you try to if you have some algebraic structure and you try to introduce a
parameter that somehow is meant to deform the this algebraic structure
and by adding on some term
this will in general not be not satisfy the the properties you would like to preserve under
deformation and and so if you just add on a first order term sometimes you have to add
higher terms and to correct
yeah so sort of some correction terms and so for example here if we start with the associative
multiplication on on some associative algebra and then we add a first order term mu 1 t
then we can check that this this new element here and defines an associative
multiplication up to first order if and only if d mu 1 is 1 so if it's a Hochschild
a co-cycle but then this term is usually or sometimes not associative at higher order
and so so that the general principle is somehow that that the first order deformations
you only need the information of a suitable co-chain complex
and so if you try to do deformations over say kt over over t squared
then you only you only need d as we saw here but if you try to do higher order deformations
to see if you can extend this to a higher orders you will start to need more more brackets and so
if you have a ggle algebra that controls the deformation problem you only need the second
bracket and then you you're happy but sometimes maybe the complex you have is is nice and small
like you're going to have using the complex that comes from from a reduction system but
actually you need many higher brackets to to make to make it work and so for formal
deformations you usually want a dgle algebra if you can but but sometimes it's more convenient
to work with an l infinity algebra and then you get higher brackets as well
okay so let me just put up the the definition so an l infinity algebra consists of a of a
graded graded vector space here with a unary bracket so d d takes one one element and and
then some higher brackets and so here the the degree of the higher brackets should be two minus n
and these are supposed to satisfy some conditions so the first one is d square equal zero so that
makes this into a co-chain complex and in the second condition is is like a Leibniz rule
between the differential and the the binary bracket and then the next identity is
it's like a Jacobi identity so if this is a dgle algebra then then the Jacobi identity holds
and on the right side there would be zero but in an l infinity algebra there may be
homotopy correction terms and so these always involve like two brackets
but now we can so on the left we have two binary brackets in each term and here now we
take a unary bracket and a ternary bracket in each term and all the all the possible terms
and there's some signs um okay then there's also uh at higher uh there's um yeah the higher
identities which involve the higher brackets so these you have to satisfy some additional identities
but if you've seen an infinity algebras maybe then then it's very it's like analogous to to this
okay and like i said if if the higher brackets are zero for all for ternary and up
then g is called a dgle algebra and then actually this here gives gives the Jacobi identity
okay and so um we have higher structure on the Hochschild coaching complex
and this is the so-called Gessenhaber bracket and so if you have a multi-linear map
um f f and g uh of that have m plus one and m plus one inputs then you can define this
this Gessenhaber circle product f circle g by inserting the output of g
so you do g first and then insert the output into all the inputs all the possible inputs
and then you sum over those with a sign there's a sign here and then from the circle product you can
define the Gessenhaber bracket um as the commutator graded commutator of of these elements
and uh yeah so sometimes people use different conventions but here i've written m and n because
this f is in degree m plus one Hochschild degree m plus one okay and then the
the the theorem that Gessenhaber proved was in the context of definitions of the associated
algebras and so first thing is that this h of a i call it is the dgle algebra
um where you have the shifted Hochschild complex you shift it by one so that then the shifted one
f has degree uh what have degree m so this is also what appears here and then there's the Hochschild
differential d and then the the Gessenhaber bracket which is which is of degree zero then
okay so this is a dgle algebra and this structure um actually uh can be used to to to study the
deformation theory and the reason is that um that the bilinear map um defines an associative
multiplication if and only if the Gessenhaber bracket of of mu with itself is zero
so from the definition here you can see that mu bracket mu is actually this mu circle mu
and then plus mu circle mu again uh because of because of the sign here because they have both
degree one in this case because they take two inputs and then this is a minus one so this
becomes plus here and then mu circle mu has now now a minus one here and so this is exactly the
associative multiplication um defined by mu and so this is an element uh in hom a tensor three
to a and so if this is zero then then this is associative because this is exactly the condition
that a b c should equal um a b c okay
okay so now uh let's look at uh at a formal formal one-parameter deformation
so if you have an associative algebra a then um you can try to extend or add on higher terms
uh possibly infinitely many higher terms um to make the the formal um formal thing an
associative uh deformation so by this i mean uh so a double brackets t
as underlying vector space so you tensor the vector space underlying a you tensor it with k t
the formal power series and then um you use uh this multiplication mu t and you want this to be
associative and then you call it a formal one-parameter deformation and so this is uh
this is associative so then this is a deformation if and only if um this term you've added on so
mu tilde i i denoted it so this is mu one t and then there's a term in t squared and so on
if and only if uh this satisfies this equation here so d mu tilde plus a half
mu tilde mu tilde uh is zero and so um this just follows by sort of multiplying out
the brackets so here was associative if and only if new t mu t is zero but then you can rewrite this
you can multiply this out and then you get the term uh mu with mu which is zero because
mu itself was associative and then um yeah then you you have to observe that this bracket here
bracket with a with an original mu actually defines the Hochschild differential d
and then you divide by two and you get this equation here
okay and this equation is called the the Mao Karton equation for um dj li algebra
and so here uh we've taken uh the Hochschild-Gerstenhaber dj li algebra and tensored with this
this ideal so this is the maximal ideal in um in the formal power series string
so like this and um the generalization to an L infinity algebra is that you uh that you take
um take higher and higher brackets like this and so in this context the the equation
have to to sort of think about uh when this equation makes sense at all because it's an
infinite sum um but if you work with formal deformations then this infinite sum uh converges
in the the addict topology so at each power of t there's only finitely many terms because
whenever you have single x you uh you get the power of you get single at least a single power of t
okay
yeah just um just to point out again so if you only do first order deformations
then the Mao Karton equation actually reads uh d mu 1 equals 0 so mu 1 should be a Hochschild
tuco cycle um and and then there's also a notion of equivalence of deformations
and so you say to first order deformations are equivalent if um if there exists a map
phi here which is of the following form so it looks like identity plus phi 1 of t
and phi 1 is an element from from a to a such that if you take if you take the
the associative the first order deformation associated to mu 1 tilde you call it star tilde
and and the one to mu 1 you call star
then you can send send them uh yes you use phi on on a and then you use the one multiplication
and then you undo phi by using phi inverse and if you then get the other multiplication then you
say the equivalent it turns out that um that this equivalence is given exactly by co-boundaries so
in this sense the second Hochschild homology sort of controls the deformations of associative
algebra because the first order term is a it's a tuco cycle and the equivalent up to two co-boundaries
okay and so now um I will uh go back to to the resolution that um I talked about in the first
talk and so if you have a if you have an associative algebra a which you've written as k q mod i where q is
some quiver with relations and you have a reduction system satisfying the diamond condition for for
this ideal uh then we get we get this um this resolution from chouhi and solotar p and then
there's a retract there's a retract between p and and the Hochschild co-chain or yeah the
Hochschild co-chain complex or the reduced normalized Hochschild co-chain complex and then
we can use the construction used in the homotopy transfer theorem to transfer the the
higher structure that's that's on this uh complex here and this can be transferred to to the smaller
complex and what you get is the structure of an l infinity algebra and so we call this p
p q r and uh as underlying uh co-chain complex it has this um this this uh co-chain complex
coming from from the chouhi solotar resolution and and then it has an infinite number of higher
brackets and so these brackets can be defined using um using the the comparison maps here of the
between these two these two co-chain complex and also the also the homotopy h
and so the if you have a if you have n elements g 1 up to g n then you can define the the bracket
uh as uh as a sum over over trees and so at each um at each leaf you put uh one of the g i's
and then um uh well you use sorry you use uh you use the comparison morphism to to send
these over from from p to c and then you put them at the leaves of the tree and then you
uh you use the bracket and then you use the homotopy h and um and you do this again and again
and after using the last bracket you you use f again to go back so it's f again to go back
to the complex and then this defines defines uh an l infinity algebra with these uh with these
brackets okay and uh yeah and the statement also gives that that this g uh g upper dot here
actually extends to an l infinity quasi isomorphism
between this new l infinity algebra structure on on this on this complex p and um and the
hochschild uh the hochschild gerstenhaber uh digitally algebra
okay and then by the general um theory uh by um of of defamation theory via l infinity or
digitally algebras um you get that on the right you you have this defamation function which controls
defamations of the associative algebra structure on on a and this defamation function is actually
isomorphic to the one uh that you can define from uh from this l infinity algebra
and uh yeah and on the left hand side um one can one can check that actually this um this controls
the sort of uh defamations of the reduction system you know yeah so if you try to to to
interpret what what this means or to mark a toy element there is then then it looks like
what should be a formal defamation of the reduction system okay so how is this defamation
function uh defined then um so given any l infinity algebra or digitally algebra g
you take you take a certain uh functor here mcg and then you're quotient out by
um homotopy or gauge equivalence and so mcg is this functor that takes takes a local complete
netherian k algebra or maybe artinian algebra so b with some maximal ideal m and uh and it
sends this to the set of marocaton elements so that means the elements which live in g1 tensor m
and that satisfy the marocaton equation okay so for example here x we said could be something
like mu 1 t plus mu 2 t squared and so on
and um yes and the homotopy equivalence of marocaton elements can be defined as follows so you have
somehow your tensor first um with something like a simplicial differential forms on the on the unit
interval and um yeah actually this is a commutative dg algebra with um with one parameter which i've
called um t maybe this was not a good idea because this should be yeah let's we call this tau d tau
because t was already the parameter of the deformation okay um and you want to look at
marocaton elements of this of this bigger uh this new l infinity algebra and um such that
when you evaluate tau at zero and at one you get two uh two different marocaton elements of the
original algebra g okay um right and so now we have this uh the structure that maybe looks uh at
first side maybe looks a bit complicated because you have these infinitely many brackets and l
infinity algebra sort of looks scary uh but actually it turns out that there's a nice uh
nice sort of hands-on way to compute um marocaton or to check the marocaton equation for this l
infinity algebra and so this is uh what i'm going to explain next and then uh soon we will see in
example and hopefully then um at least by then uh yeah it becomes more more more clear that this is
this is something very practical okay so the the idea is that um given given uh
quotient of a path algebra um with a reduction system are satisfying the diamond condition for
the ideal uh
we can actually view uh view this this the second entries here fs um we can view them as coming
from uh from a k q zero by module map uh f so that goes from ks to a to the algebra
and so here we said this isomorphism sort of comes from the from the diamond lemma
from this diamond condition
and these you can view as elements in k q okay and so then you can sort of set fs to be
uh sigma of f of s so f is now now this function and it sends an element in s to to the algebra a
and then you can use the section a to k q which is a section of the projection
and um and so the reduction the original reduction system looks like this
and now you can try to deform it to this where you add on this extra term gs
and so g is also like f itself is also an element here okay
and um yes and in order to to uh describe this this criterion for for uh checking whether an
element satisfies the mal carton equation for this l infinity algebra uh let me define this
um following uh following bilinear operation so um let g be an element here and now we tensor
we work in the formal setting where we tensor with with the maximal ideal so this could be
this could be just tensor with t so that um that t sorry for example g is could look like g1 t
plus g2 t squared and so on
and um yes and then uh this this bilinear operation star g is defined as follows you
take the old product and then you take a a sum over star g case uh with b
and the idea here is that um this captures precisely the reductions using uh rg instead of
r where rg was if i go back rg was this um
um uh this sort of modified reduction system here okay and uh and so more precisely you say this
a star g k b um is uh is the sum of all the terms uh you obtain by performing
rightmost reductions on uh sigma a sigma b so you can take two elements in a you lift them
to the path algebra k q and then you just concatenate them and then you use reductions
over and over again and um but now you use reductions inside the new reduction system so rg
and then at each step you sort of have a get a sum and you can um yeah so you can start with a
path p for example and then uh performing one reduction means you you um you use f or g you
um you replace uh you replace s here either by fs or by gs and then you take the sum
and so you get a diagram like this where you can either use this uh reduction the old reduction
again and again or you can use uh these reductions using g okay and then you get sort of a infinite
um expression like this but if you sort of stay on the left and always use f then uh you know this
process will stop um because the old reduction system was reduction finite and reduction unique
and then you can use like g once and then just keep using fs or you can use g maybe at the
beginning many times um and uh yeah and this this process will stop at each finite power of t
you only get finitely many terms and so this will probably become clearer in the example which is
about to come up after the slide so let me just uh um say the statement first which is
uh if you have such an element in uh home ks to a tensor m so g it's an element like this
then this g satisfies the the marocato equation of this um l infinity algebra p q r tensor m
if and only if
uh for every element in s3 and so you should remind you what this was so these were the overlaps
and so it looked like if you have a have a path then maybe an element in s here as a sub path
and then another element in s as a sub path so for each overlap
you could uh you have the the following conditions so w1 star g so associativity of this
new bilinear operation that we called star g and so in this case here
um so this this would be like w1 and then
and this overlap here is is w2 and then this last bit here would be w3 okay
and um right and something similar also holds in the in the non-formal case if you require that
that this star g k0 for k large enough and so so if this expression makes sense at all
then uh then it gives you a marocato element and it always makes sense in the formal context
okay and uh yes in this case this star g actually also defines an associative multiplication
on on the on the either on the old vector space uh a or if you tensor by a formal
power series ring for example then then then this is also associative on this
formal power series ring okay and uh yeah and so this this um
the star g operation is actually essentially what you get by using by using the higher
terms in the in the comparison morphism where this is
um yeah this is sort of part of the l infinity quasi isomorphism between the
um between this uh between the
algebra and p q r and and h of a
okay
yes and so for the rest of the talk i will just go to one explicit example which i think shows
well how you can use this point of view to compute compute examples and compute
definitions whenever you have written an algebra as the path algebra of a quiver with relations
okay and so this example is an example of a brogy algebra and
there's a there's a paper by um mazor chuk and stroppe and they found that the
the regular blocks of so-called finitely generated uh hospital weight sln modules
are equivalent to the category of finite dimensional modules over the defamation of this
this algebra so the defamation here sort of naturally appears and then you can ask
uh or you maybe you want to know um what this defamation looks like and so um yeah so this
brogy algebra has uh has a number of vertices and um and uh and arrows between these always
two cycles between them and then uh yeah you have these relations um like if you go uh right
twice this is zero if you're left uh twice this is also zero or and if you do a loop on the right
then this is the same as doing a loop on the left okay so let me uh describe the
definitions of the sort of small dimensional case and so I just take three vertices and
the four arrows that you can see and um
um
yes and uh in order to describe the defamation theory we said we should
work with a reduction system and so the reduction system here
we can try to guess from the ideal so the first guess would be just to choose
uh choose the the relations here a1 a2 should map to zero so this was one of the relations
b2 b1 was the other relation and then we had the relation um here a2 b2 minus b1 a1
and then we say okay maybe we want to reduce this one here to to this one and so we write this in
the first entry and this the other term in the second entry
and we all almost get what we want so we we see that our tilde is reduction finite that's good
the ideal it generates or the differences of the entries ideal
uh um yeah it generates the ideal we're looking for but it's actually not reduction unique
and so there are two overlaps so the diamond lemma told us that um that reduction uniqueness
you only have to check reduction uniqueness on the on the overlaps
and so here we have an overlap between a2 here overlaps with a2 here and so we have this overlap
of a1 a2 b2 and and if we replace a1 a2 by zero in the reduction system we get zero
and on the right hand side we get a1 b1 a1 and this is uh not yet zero and similarly on the
other side we get a2 b2 b1 this is an overlap um yeah on the on the one side we get zero and on
the other side we get b1 a1 b1 and so then we add we add these uh to the reduction system
and then we can check um this now satisfies the diamond condition because uh that resolved the
old overlaps and the new overlaps that have that have appeared the following so a1 b1 a1 a2
and on both sides they always resolve to zero so this is um this is now a reduction system that's
reduction unique and it still uh generates the same ideal
okay so now we have our uh reduction system and uh then we can look at this set s of first entries
and this has uh now five elements
and right and now um the the diamond lemma gives us an explicit k basis of the algebra right so
um we have three item buttons at the vertices e1 e2 e3 we have the four arrows uh the two a's
and two b's and then um we have three irreducible paths of length two and the other path of length
two that doesn't appear there is uh a2 b2 right because this this gets reduced to b1 a1
okay and so we get uh 10 elements so the algebra is 10 dimensional
and now we had uh five elements in s so when we look at an element uh g and
home ks to a bimodule morphism we now should uh look at um
yeah so we want to send it to to a so we uh look at parallel irreducible paths
and so a1 b1 a1 here right it does this because a1 b1 then a1 again and so this is the only path
that's uh parallel to this which is also irreducible is a1 so now we can um send it to some multiple
of a1 and similarly for b1 a1 b1 and send it to multiple of b1 and here actually there are no
no paths which are irreducible and parallel to a1 a2 and here we have again two parallel paths
one is the so this is the loop that does this between these two vertices
and so either we can stay at the left vertex or we can uh do this so these are
uh e2 and b1 a1
um right and so uh we have um four four possible paths here so we have four
uh coefficients and so as a k vector space this home ks to a is four dimensional
with these coordinates and so here you can see that um that if you try to sort of use the
this approach um by looking at all uh all bilinear maps from a to a and then figuring out which of
those are are maybe associative then you would have to look at home a tensor a to a which is
thousand dimensional in this case so it's tensor over k okay and uh yeah here we just have to look
at something sort of four dimensional okay and now now we would like to determine conditions
on on these uh four uh coefficients to define a defamation of a and we can use the criterion
right and uh and the criterion says that that should satisfy associativity
on the on the overlaps and so here in this s set s we have we have overlaps that i've
marked here and so there are six overlaps and so we should check six equations
and um yeah and just uh you can look at the first equation and so
a1 b1 star a1 so there wasn't there was an overlap here so this is an element in s
element in s they overlap in a1 and so the a1 sort of sits here on this side and on this
side in the middle and right and now we would like to compute this star g now what do we do
we use we use the two paths yeah a1 b1 and a1 to to calculate this here we write them next to
each other and then uh for star g zero we don't use g at all we just use the old reduction
and so on a1 b1 a1 this was just sent to zero the old reduction system so maybe i can show this
again here a1 b1 a1 sent to zero okay and now um we can also use g and so this is the next term
here a1 b1 star g1 with a1 is which means we use g1s and now we said um if we use g1s then we
should send a1 b1 a1 to lambda times a1 and so this is this term here and you can check
that star g2 is zero and the higher ones as well okay and now we've we've sort of calculated the
first bracket here and the result is just this lambda times a1 and so now we calculated the
second star so lambda one a1 star star g with a2 this we don't use g at all means we just use the
old relation on a1 a2 there was zero but also the new relation with g this is also zero here so
actually this this now also becomes zero because the definition of g we said there's no parallel path
no path which is irreducible and parallel to a1 a2 so we cannot deform it and then on the right
hand side we also get this a1 star a2 this also gives zero okay and then there's a second
a second example which if you go through it carefully then
um yeah then you will find that this time you actually get a condition so maybe let's do this
quickly so again we don't use g uh means for um yeah so on the left hand side we have zero because
we just calculated a1 star a2 so this is zero but on the right hand side we now should first
calculate a2 b2 so when we don't use g just use the old relation and which sends a2 b2 to b1 a1
okay we we can also use g once and then we get we get this term here and when we've used
g once then we find it's already irreducible and then just get this term here and so we have
two terms in star g because
yeah because star g was sort of the sum over the ones star gk right so we should sum these
um
sum these so there's there's two terms we now need to compute just the first one with a1 so this a1
here and so the first equation
um gives gives this condition lambda a1 and the second uh the second term here
when you start by a1 from the left you get these terms so then you collect them all together
so I've marked them sort of in red here and the left hand side was zero so this is the condition
that's imposed by this by the second equation so we get the condition
that mu plus lambda into 1 plus mu prime should be zero and like this one also gets
one further condition and that is that lambda should equal lambda prime
okay and so this uh this is sort of the end of the computation
of the of the Mao Carton with the equations imposed by the Mao Carton equation
and uh and now we should maybe make sense of this and um yeah and we
uh so one one thing we can do is we just use we just view lambda and mu as constants and
then we get a two-dimensional family because mu because mu is sort of determined by by lambda and
mu prime and lambda prime is also determined by lambda so sort of get a nice um family
of algebras if we we choose lambda and mu prime freely but if we want to do this in the in the
formal context you can also talk about the equivalence of Mao Carton elements and then
lambda should actually be viewed as a as an element in this ideal t and so lambda is
like a formal power series maybe and then you can find um that for for general power
series now lambda and and mu and mu prime we can we can kill mu prime uh like this so um
general Mao Carton element here is actually equivalent to to this Mao Carton element
and here we just need the first order term of lambda and so this is the condition
get from the Mao Carton equation and then this mu prime which was also free choice
we can kill this
okay and so what we get is that um that we have a formal formal deformation
which is sort of one-dimensional uh in fact it also admits an algebraization because the
the star product um is defined is not not a formal product anymore if we just have t here
and so it's it's defined also if we just tensor by uh by k t polynomial ring in one variable
and we get a one-dimensional family of ten-dimensional algebras and these are the
definitions of this um brow tree algebra and so the the computation I've done here for
um for a three um but if you just replace like one and two by i and i plus one then this is
exactly the same computation and so yeah so in this way you get the definitions of a a n minus one
okay so let me in the last two minutes let me just um summarize oh yeah maybe I can say this
again that the that the star star g uh is now an explicit expression which you can write down as a
some sort of multiplication table if you like um so here I mean like b two star e one is zero
and then so these is gray entries where the old multiplications and now you've changed them
here in these spots it's not zero anymore
right and so for lambda equals zero you get the old um brow tree algebra and for lambda some constant
you get a definition of it okay and so I'll just end with a with a short summary of what sort of
what happened um so if you're given uh an algebra a which is path algebra of the quiver
with relations you can compute a reduction system r satisfying the diamond condition
um and if you if the computation uh maybe it's more convenient uh somebody has computed a
non-commutative quibbner basis you can just use use this uh and then once you have a reduction system
you get this uh johi solotar resolution um which is a much smaller resolution
than the than the bar resolution and then you can take uh uh yeah study definitions of a
associative uh definitions of a just in terms of definitions of the of the reduction system
and the way you can do this is to look at the mal carton equation for the l infinity
algebra structure on this um on this complex p that we get by homotopy transfer
and to check to check this um you just sort of follow some combinatorial rule
which is checking associativity of this new star product on the overlaps okay and once you've
checked that this is true then this actually gives the same the very same formula gives an
associative uh product on on all of uh of the yeah of the formal deformation or of the original
algebra and this is then yeah the deformation okay uh i will stop here thank you
