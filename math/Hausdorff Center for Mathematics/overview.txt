1. **Original Setup**: We start with a path algebra \(kQ\) where \(Q\) is a quiver with relations, which we denote as an algebra \(A\).

2. **Reduction System**: Using a reduction system \(R\) satisfying the diamond condition, we can compute a non-commutative quiver Gröbner basis for \(A\). This reduction system allows us to simplify elements in \(A\).

3. **Johannson-Solotar Resolution**: With the reduction system, we obtain a smaller resolution called the Johannson-Solotar resolution of \(A\), which is an explicit complex (a sequence of modules and homomorphisms) computing the global homological properties of \(A\).

4. **Mao-Cartan Equation for L∞ Algebra**: We consider a deformation of \(A\) by introducing formal variables \(t\) and considering an L∞ algebra structure on a complex \(p\) obtained via homotopy transfer. The Mao-Cartan equation is a condition ensuring that the product defined by this L∞ structure is associative.

5. **Deformation and Associativity**: By checking the Mao-Cartan equation, we ensure that the star product (the new product after deformation) on \(A\) is associative. This leads to a one-dimensional family of associative algebras arising from the original \(A\).

6. **Brown-Gordon Algebra**: For a specific choice of parameters in the deformation, we obtain the Brown-Gordon algebra, which is a particular example of this family of algebras.

7. **Summary of Computation**: We have computed the explicit form of the star product for a three-term relation in \(A\). By replacing the indices \(1\) and \(2\) with \(i\) and \(i+1\), we obtain the general case for an \(n-1\) relation. This computation gives us a multiplication table for the new associative algebra structure.

8. **Conclusion**: The Mao-Cartan equation allows us to deform the original algebra \(A\) into a new family of algebras by using the reduction system and the star product defined through the L∞ algebra structure. This process is useful for studying deformations and resolutions of non-commutative algebras, particularly when a quiver Gröbner basis or a reduction system is available.

The talk concludes with the emphasis on the importance of checking associativity through the Mao-Cartan equation to ensure that the new product is indeed associative, thus yielding an associative algebra after deformation.

1. The talk focused on deformations of resolutions of singularities within the context of L∞ algebras and their associated formal deformations. Specifically, it discussed how one can use the generators of a Mao-Cartan element to create an algebraic family of deformations that correspond to degenerate Poisson structures on the resolution.

2. The Mao-Cartan element g takes paths of length two in the resolved space and maps them to paths of length two, satisfying an admissible order condition but not the strictly lower one. This allows for the finite description of the star product, which is a formal deformation product.

3. Karmazin's work shows that a variety admitting a tilting bundle can be recovered as the modular space of semi-stable representations of a quiver with relations associated to that tilting bundle. This suggests a connection between the geometry of varieties and the representation theory of quivers.

4. For the A1 singularity, the one-parameter deformation of the ideal corresponding to a commutative deformation can be shown to yield isomorphic fibers to the deformation of the resolution. This means that the deformation of the algebra leads to a deformation of the resolution space.

5. In the non-commutative case, one can also deform the algebra itself, changing the ideal in a specific way. This approach still results in an algebra with the same basis, and the modular space for the same dimension vector and stability condition remains commutative because it is a quasi-projective variety.

6. If the resolution admits a symplectic structure, this structure is not generated by the deformation process, and the modular space for the same stability condition and dimension vector associated with the deformed ideal is empty in this case. This example illustrates how varying the relations in a quiver can affect the modular space of quiver representations.

In summary, the talk provided insights into the interplay between deformations of singularities, L∞ algebras, and modular spaces of quiver representations, highlighting the rich connections between these areas in algebraic geometry and representation theory.

1. The talk begins by highlighting a general approach to defining a star product for quiver relations, which can be applied to any algebra with a picture model and a deduction system that satisfies the diamond condition and the length condition.

2. The star product is defined for elements in the algebra, and it involves considering paths in the quiver and associating polynomial functions G_S to these paths. The absolute value of FS in the star product indicates the maximum length of the path FS.

3. It is assumed that G_S are polynomials for each S, which is a natural condition to ensure that the star product results in rational functions with coefficients in T, where T is a commutative ring.

4. An example is provided to illustrate how the star product can be computed, specifically for the product A * B * C, where A and B are elements of the algebra and C is an element of T. In this case, only one rational function arises from the unidusable paths, and the product AB * C is non-zero, while AB' * C is zero (the apostrophe indicates reversal of the path).

5. If A is finite dimensional, then due to there being only a finite number of unidusable paths, the star product is convergent on a neighborhood of zero. This is because the number of rational functions (or their poles) that appear in the star product is finite.

6. The results presented are motivated by questions regarding the convergence of the conservative star product for positive persistent homology structures. These will be discussed further in the next talk.

7. The ongoing work aims to explore the convergence properties of the star product in the case of infinite dimensional algebras, potentially proving that the number of rational functions appearing is finite or that the poles (if not the number of rational functions) are finite.

8. The speaker concludes by thanking the audience for their attention and expresses the intention to further investigate the star product in the context of infinite dimensional algebras.

1. **Background on Periodic Automorphic Descents (PAD):** The study of periodic automorphic descents is a generalization of classical automorphic forms to include periodic structures, which are analogous to the symmetric spaces in the classical setting but now with a finite group acting periodically. These PAD forms are associated with locally symmetric spaces over a finite field and have applications in number theory and algebraic geometry.

2. **Homological Perspective:** The relationship between the homology of these periodic spaces (mod P homology) and the actual functions (PAD forms) is studied using a tool called PAD Koch series, which is analogous to Hochschild-Serre spectral sequences in the classical setting. This allows one to compare the mod P homology with the full homology associated with Cuspidal Ununary Submodules (CUS) forms.

3. **Perfectoid Spaces:** A key object of study is perfectoid spaces, which are a certain type of space that can be seen as a periodic analogue of symmetric spaces. These spaces have properties that make it possible to relate the mod P homology with simpler chain complexes constructed from the values of PAD forms on open subsets.

4. **Periodic Analog of Embedding into Compact Dual:** In the classical setting, symmetric spaces are embedded into compact dual varieties. In the periodic case, a similar embedding into a classical compact variety is considered. This embedding plays a crucial role in constructing the chain complex that computes the mod P homology associated with PAD forms.

5. **Approximation by Global Cusp Forms:** The PAD forms, which are initially defined mod P, need to be approximated by global cusp forms of characteristic zero to connect with classical number theory and algebraic geometry. This is achieved through a sophisticated period map that respects the symmetries and properties of these forms.

6. **Symmetry and Automorphism Groups:** The spaces under consideration must have a high degree of symmetry because they are acted upon by arithmetic groups, which require symmetric spaces to quotient. A highly symmetric space provides the necessary framework for the action of these groups.

7. **Conjectures and Directions:** While the work on PAD and the methods used to study them are distinct from other conjectures in number theory and algebraic geometry, understanding these structures can provide deep insights into the torsion classes and the interplay between different arithmetic contexts.

In summary, the discussion revolves around the intricate relationship between periodic automorphic descents, their associated homology, and how they relate to global cusp forms through the lens of perfectoid spaces and a sophisticated period map. The symmetry inherent in these spaces is crucial for the action of arithmetic groups and for constructing the necessary complexes to study these objects.
