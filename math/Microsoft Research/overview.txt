1. **Distillable Entanglement**: For pure bipartite states, the concept of distillable entanglement is well-understood due to the Bennett-Bernstein theorem, which states that any two-party state can be converted into a specific form (a convex combination of EPR pairs) without changing the distillable entanglement. However, for operational purposes, the most suitable entanglement measure might differ depending on the application, such as metrology.

2. **Entanglement Measures**: In multi-partite systems (three or more parties), entanglement measures become much more complex and are not as well understood. The tensor calculus involved makes these problems mathematically challenging.

3. **Entanglement Entropy in Quantum Gravity**: In the context of quantum gravity, entropy calculations often rely on the naive entanglement entropy. While this quantity does not have a fully operational interpretation, it seems to capture some aspects of entanglement scaling. The total entropy and the distillable entanglement can sometimes look similar as functions of certain parameters, suggesting a potential connection.

4. **Operational Interpretation of Entropy**: In quantum gravity, the entanglement entropy calculated naively appears to be related to both classical entropy and useful entanglement measures. However, the exact operational interpretation remains an open question in the community.

5. **Historical Context**: The speaker suggests that the technology to calculate entanglement in quantum gravity using the framework they presented could have been applied 15 years ago, given the foundational papers available at the time. The speaker is puzzled as to why this particular topic was chosen for a plenary talk by the program committee.

6. **Acknowledgments and Appreciation**: The speaker thanks Frank Arntzen for his excellent talk and announces that all speakers at the conference will receive QIP 2017 T-shirts as a token of appreciation.

Checking Microsoft Research/Riemannian manifolds, kernels and learning.txt
1. **Shape Manifold vs. Shape Space**: A shape manifold is a mathematical structure that represents the space of shapes within a higher-dimensional space without being constrained by the way it's embedded. It allows for intrinsic metrics and distances that are meaningful on the manifold itself, rather than distances in the ambient space.

2. **Vector Space Issues**: Working in vector spaces can be problematic when dealing with manifolds because operations like averaging or clustering in a vector space may not yield elements that are valid on the manifold (e.g., finding the center of a cluster in rotation space will not result in another rotation).

3. **Intrinsic Metrics**: Manifold-based methods use intrinsic metrics to measure distances, which are more meaningful for understanding the relationships between shapes or data points on the manifold.

4. **Clustering and Categorization**: The approach allows for distinguishing between different categories of objects, such as different types of leaves (maple vs. beach leaves) or different representations of human faces in ancient sculptures. The granularity of the clustering depends on how the classifier is trained.

5. **Experimental Evidence**: Experiments have shown that this approach can effectively distinguish between different shapes and categories, even when those shapes are similar.

6. **Application to Ships**: The method can be applied to compare ships across different categories and can distinguish between ships based on their design or age, as demonstrated in experiments.

7. **Acknowledgment**: Thanks were given to Richard for his insights and contributions to the discussion on shape manifolds and their applications in computer vision.
