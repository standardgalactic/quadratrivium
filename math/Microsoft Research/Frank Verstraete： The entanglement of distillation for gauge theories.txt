Okay, so welcome, everyone, to the actual academic part of this afternoon's session,
the second plenary talk.
For those of you who don't know me, I'm Andrew Doherty from the University of Sydney, and
it's a real pleasure to introduce today, Frank Vistrada, who's going to tell us about
entanglement and gauge theories.
So thanks a lot.
It's a great honor to be able to give this plenary talk, although I have to say that
most of the work of what I will talk was certainly done by the two people here, Karl van Akkulijn
and Volker Schultz, but unfortunately they couldn't come, so I will present this, and
I will kind of do this a little bit from the historical perspective.
So I will go back to the way quantum information theory was done 15, 20 years ago, where everybody
was talking about entanglement, and I think this is still probably, from my point of view,
one of the real kind of things that will stay from quantum information independent on whether
quantum computers will be there or not.
Somehow the way of looking at many body systems and looking at somehow complicated problems
like gauge theories from the point of view of qubits, from the point of view of entanglement
theory has opened up lots of new kind of extremely interesting insights and also possibilities
to understand somehow the basic, the biggest problems in physics, and the biggest problems
in physics are always to do with interacting many body systems.
So the outline of my talk is, first of all, I will explain a little bit what gauge theories
are because I guess most of you are not familiar with this at all.
I will kind of talk a little bit about entanglement in the presence of global symmetries and super
selection rules, and basically it will become clear when I explain this that all the work
on gauge theories could have been done already 15 years ago.
All the tools were there, but people were just not asking the questions, and somehow the
question of understanding entanglement in gauge theories really only popped up a few years
ago when people in quantum gravity and string theory started being very interested somehow
in this whole field of quantum information because indeed they had problems, they didn't
understand their geometry.
The problems that John gave a beautiful talk about yesterday somehow led to questions like
what is entanglement, how do we even define it in a gauge theory, and you see that in
gauge theories somehow there's some new ways of having to define, you have to define your
Hilbert space in an unconventional way, and that's what, of course, will be the meat of
the talk.
I'm going to talk about somehow how you define entanglement in gauge theories and give some
examples.
Okay, so what is a gauge theory?
So the physicist way of understanding fundamental Hamiltonian's or Lagrangian's of nature, like
the standard model, it's actually completely based on the principle of gauging.
So the way physicists work, or especially high energy physicists, they start from typically
a non-interacting theory of matter, for example the Dirac equation, some relativistic kind
of one body, one particle equation, with a global symmetry.
And a global symmetry for physicists could be something like u1, which means that actually
the charge is conserved.
So this is, u1 is nothing more than actually there's an integer conserved, which is the
total number of charge.
So you have a very simple non-interacting theory with a global symmetry.
And then the whole idea of gauge theories is that you want to lift somehow this global
symmetry to a local symmetry by introducing new degrees of freedom that can absorb somehow
these local transformations such that your global symmetry becomes local, but you have
to introduce new degrees of freedom for that.
Again, in the context of QED, quantum electrodynamics, you have to introduce photons and couple those
somehow new degrees of freedom to somehow the old ones, the non-interacting ones.
And then this way somehow you get some kind of global symmetries that are local.
And you of course have to define then also some dynamics for this new degrees of freedom
that you introduced.
So if this all seems somehow too abstract, I will give examples later in terms of qubits
and it will all kind of become very tangible.
But anyway, so once you do this, you do this kind of whole procedure of coupling, introducing
gauge degrees of freedom.
You get a new theory that is typically interacting and this is typically a very hard theory to
deal with.
But this is how people understand all the fundamental Hamiltonians in nature or the fundamental interactions
in nature.
So that's how people came up with this standard model that actually is like, you start with
global symmetries and then kind of make them local by introducing new gauge degrees of
freedom.
Okay, so these gauge theories were originally introduced by Weil with the goal of reconsolating
electromagnetism and a relativity theory.
And then later on somehow people, especially people like Pauli, realized that this is an
extremely powerful way also of understanding the connection between quantum and relativity
theory.
And the main conceptual idea that I already talked about is that global symmetries should
actually have a local counterpart exactly because of this relativity theory.
And this relativity theory you want somehow not, should not be possible that a charge
suddenly disappears from Earth and appears on the moon.
Because this doesn't violate somehow the global symmetry, but there's clearly something
wrong there.
This should violate relativity theory.
And that's why you want to lift really this global symmetry to something local.
You want to forbid this.
So you want to really kind of introduce these new degrees of freedom somehow.
And there's a systematic way of doing this.
I will kind of try to explain this.
But somehow there's some kind of a main departure from the usual many body physics or the physics
that we all know in terms of qubits if you start kind of doing this and introducing these
gauge degrees of freedom.
Namely that the Hilbert space for locally distinct regions is not anymore a tensor product.
So you lose basically a tensor product structure because we'll impose some symmetries on all
the possible operations that you have to do.
And these symmetries are actually kind of local, but somehow nevertheless act on many
sites.
Okay?
So we need really to modify the theory of entanglement.
And that's really the difficulty that people were having when they wanted to define entanglement
in gauge theories.
But there's other kind of very exciting new kind of phenomena that appear when you kind
of talk about gauge theories that are actually very important and have to do with topological
order.
Namely that there's something very famous that's the Ilitzur's theorem, which is very easy
to prove, which basically tells you that gauge symmetries can never be spontaneously
broke.
And you will see that this is actually responsible for the fact that indeed if you will have
the tory code that the tory code has actually topological order.
Because it cannot just spontaneously break, cannot get some magnitude.
You kind of have to, if there's a phase transition in the tory code, it has to be topological
of nature.
Okay?
So let me make these things a little bit more tangible by talking about qubits.
So you start with a simple non-interacting ising space.
That's what I say.
You start with matter.
Okay?
The matter or these kind of yellow, these yellow spheres here on this square lattice.
And I just define my Hamiltonian to be minus the sum over the sigma x i's, okay?
Which is the most trivial Hamiltonian you can imagine.
The ground state is a product state, so this is clearly a non-interacting Hamiltonian.
And the Hamiltonian has a global symmetry, maybe the product of all sigma x's.
If you do the sigma x on all sides, well, obviously this is a symmetry of that Hamiltonian.
Okay?
So what was the second step we had to do?
Now we have to introduce somehow gauge degrees of freedom such that this global symmetry
becomes local.
So how do we do this?
Well, we had this square lattice somehow with all the spheres sitting on the vertices.
Now on the edges in between the spheres, we'll kind of introduce these new degrees
of freedom.
These will be like the photons.
These are kind of also just simple qubits.
So there's some kind of extra qubits in between, on any, every edge we put an extra qubit.
And we basically make this local, this global symmetry local by imposing that every kind
of star.
So here, for example, in this case, you have these five kinds, you have these four blue
qubits, and you have this one of these original qubits.
You impose that x, so the sigma x acting on all these five qubits, so x, x, x, x, x acting
on that state is equal to somehow itself.
So this, you impose, you define basically your Hilbert space as saying, I only allow
states for which somehow x, so this x tensor, the product of five x's for every of these
vertex terms acting on my state has to be equal to itself.
So this is what is written here somehow for all i's, so this for every vertex ui times
psi has to be equal to somehow itself.
And this is how you define the Hilbert space.
So your Hilbert space is a subspace of the full space of all your qubits.
You have kind of no matter qubits, these yellow ones, you have photon qubits or gauge qubits,
these are the blue ones, but somehow the physical Hilbert space is a subspace of the whole thing.
And that's the key basically of having a gauge theory.
A gauge theory tells you that actually not the full Hilbert space is accessible, only
the part somehow that satisfies these symmetries.
And just as a small remark, for example, the original global symmetry is just obtained
by indeed taking the product of all these u's, because if need, if you kind of take
the u's, this x that is here is acting out from the left, from the right, this kind of
squares and this kind of equal to identity.
So this is called the z2 gauge theory and it will not become much more complicated on
that for this talk, but of course somehow you can do this for these much more complicated
symmetries that I talked about and it's effectively the same ID.
So what was the next step?
So now we have kind of already, we have introduced somehow we had our matter qubits, now we have
our gauge qubits, but now we have to introduce some dynamics.
We have to kind of give some dynamics, some Hamiltonian kind of terms to this gauge qubits.
So what we do is now introduce some plaquette terms.
So we have these four kind of blue qubits, these photons and we want to kind of introduce
some new Hamiltonian, some term of the Hamiltonian that will choose some preferred kind of direction
out of these or give some dynamics.
So what you would do is like, you would like to flip, for example, all these qubits and
what you have to do is of course this, you have to do this in such a way that this Hamiltonian
term that you introduce commutes of course with all these gauge degrees of freedom because
you don't want to leave somehow the subspace that you defined.
And the easiest term that you can imagine that would indeed kind of do something non-trivial
on these qubits on a plaquette that commutes with somehow these five qubit x constraints
is actually a product of all z's.
So this is basically flipping all the spins, so typically in gauge theories people kind
of work in the x basis and if you kind of have all these things in the x and you act
with signal z you kind of go from a plus to a minus state.
And that's exactly what this kind of term do, this is like giving dynamics to your gauge
degrees of freedom.
And that means that your total Hamiltonian is now basically the original one that just
acted on somehow your matter fields, now you have also the kind of the new ones that kind
of does act purely on the gauge fields and you also have a gauge condition on the vertigo.
So basically these things are completely uncoupled but somehow of course they are coupled because
somehow your physical Hilbert space kind of intertwines these both of these degrees
of freedom.
You have really the matter and somehow the gauge degrees of freedom, somehow this condition
always has to be satisfied.
And that's in some sense the whole story, that's how gauge theories and actually the
standard model can be kind of really made up in such a way.
Of course this is a bit simplified because it's in a lattice, you have to do these things
in the continuum but nevertheless somehow the whole story is not much more complicated
than that, that's what gauge theories are about.
So comments that are very important for the rest of this talk, of course the only physical
observables or the only physical operations that you will be able to implement on such
a kind of a system are the ones that commute with the gauge symmetry.
So this gives you a limitation, you cannot implement any unity you want on this system,
now what you have to do has to kind of really satisfy this gauge constraints or the gauge
symmetry.
And this gives you limitations in what you will be able to do and that's why somehow
this whole definition of entanglement is much less trivial than you would think originally
because you cannot do any kind of operation that you want.
So the other kind of thing is this illicit theorem which excludes somehow the possibility
of having a local order parameter.
So that means that actually if you kind of start adding other terms that commute with
your gauge constraints, so for example a z, z, z term or somehow purely kind of some
x term on the gauge photons, somehow indeed you will be able to drive your system out of
your topological phase or out of this kind of zero coupling phase and somehow you will
have a phase transition but it will be a topological phase transition because somehow local order
parameters are not allowed in such a setting.
Okay so and as a last remark this gauging procedure that we just discussed is actually
called the minimal coupling prescription and this can be done for any global symmetry but
somehow from the point of view of, if you're interested from the point of view of what
quantum states somehow of course all these things are typically done in the Lagrangian
or somehow not typically done in the Hamiltonian way but in the recent paper we realized that
actually this whole procedure can also be equally well defined just on states.
So I have a quantum state defined just on my matter fields and now you say let me kind
of define an isometry that lifts this thing that is defined just on my matter to something
with matter and gauge fields in such a way that my global symmetry becomes local and
there's indeed a very simple isometry, there's a very simple systematic procedure of implementing
all these steps by acting with one big isometry on your state such that somehow you start with
only these yellow spheres and you end up with these yellow and these blue spheres and that's
why it's an isometry of course you enlarge your Hilbert space but nevertheless the content
of these two things is very similar.
Okay so probably most of you are familiar with the Torre codes and are wondering now what
is somehow the connection with what I said and the Torre code okay so and the Torre code
of course there's no matter fields okay so there's only somehow all your qubits are living
on the edges and you're probably the natural question what does this have to do because
the Torre code is clearly not a gauge theory because I can allow everything I allow for
all my qubits all my operations everything that I can do and indeed there's a very simple
way of converting this Z2 gauge theory to the Torre code by acting with a very low depth
quantum circuit on top of the Z2 gauge theory so what we'll do is basically act with a C
knot a controlled knot gate from every kind of gauge photon or every blue kind of sphere
to every yellow sphere and you do control knots and because they are all controlled by the
blue things they all commute with each other and if you do this you see that basically
this gauge condition that you had the sigma x acting on these five things okay there was
a sigma x acting on these five qubits is actually kind of transformed into just a purely local
sigma x acting on this middle guy okay and vice versa of course okay because it's a unitary
somehow the product of the C knots is just a unitary and so you convert every kind of
sigma x term to the product of these five and vice versa which means that after acting
with this low depth quantum circuit on your kind of Z2 gauge theory what you get is basically
the Torre code the ground state of the Torre code or the Torre code Hamiltonian plus the
gauge condition which is now is just saying that all the matter fields are in the plus
state okay because somehow the gauge condition which was originally on the five qubits is
now acting on one qubit you're just saying that is in the plus state and this is the
meaning of the Torre code so the Torre code is in some sense a low depth quantum circuit
acting on a system with matter and gauge fields and of course all the physics now of the
Torre code can be understood starting from this gauge theory and that's also how you
can of course understand that this is topological and all these kind of things but it's really
the same theory as this topological theory but anyway this is just as a kind of as a
remark this is not the way we want to look at this so we really want to look at the Torre
code not in this way but we want to look at the Torre code as being a theory with matter
and kind of and photons and then having some non-trivial gauge constraints that act on
these five qubits because that's the setting that the that many of the physical theories
that we care about actually working okay so let me kind of summarize this this first part
fundamental theories of nature or gauge theories or many of them of course physical the physical
Hilbert space does not have a tensor product structure anymore but it's defined somehow
and a subspace of one with a tensor product structure and all physical substance states
have to satisfy this gauge constraint so this is like a limitation all operations also have
to commute with this thing so that means that there's some kind of an extensive amount of
super selection rules that emerge everything you have to do has to commute with all the
possible kind of gauge symmetries okay that means that all physical observers unitaries
Hamiltonians have to commute with these and therefore you have to kind of now start building
a resource theory of entanglement where you can only do things that commute with these
things and that's that's the whole problem how to address this okay so you know let me
kind of now go back a step so to take a step back and go back to the research that we and
many other people are actually also in the audience there's many people that worked on
these kind of things people talk 15 years ago many of us kind of started thinking about
entanglement in the presence of global symmetries and super selection rules okay and this is
so so what somehow this business about about entanglement and gauge theories could actually
have been done 15 years ago because there's not much technical novelty above what I will
talk about super selection rule but just that people did not ask these questions back there
okay so so entanglement theory is of course and I don't really have to kind of sell this
to all of you you all know that somehow the really interesting part of quantum information
theory stems from somehow the subtle interplay between the large Hilbert space but also of
course if you start kind of having communication begin the limitation of allowed quantum operations
we have some notion of locality and then of course there's resources that allow you to
overcome those limitations and the theory of entanglement is really the resource theory
that's when you are faced with the limitations of local operations and classical communication
that's that's the resource that allows you to overcome just being able to do local things
but if you have entanglement you can actually do anything you want globally by teleporting
and all these kind of things and I'm just repeating I'm sure all of you know this very well but
somehow there's a beautiful theorem and and and this is really the most important kind of
theorem in the theory of entanglement that dates back to Bennett Benstein Popesco and Schumacher
in 96 where they basically completely classified somehow the resource of pure state entanglement
bipartite entanglement somehow they said well if I have two states and they have the same
entanglement entropy then actually there's kind of a systematic way of converting one into the
other one and vice versa so there's only one number that you need to quantify somehow the
usefulness of a state or the amount of entanglement that you can use and that's indeed this entanglement
entropy okay so entanglement for mixed states is actually much more complicated to deal with
okay so if you have a mixed state a bipartite mixed state so you have a mixture of pure states here
then actually there are much more but there's certainly two very natural entanglement measures
with an operational meaning so on the one hand there's the entanglement cost is basically how
much entanglement do I need to prepare this how many how many EPR states do I need to prepare
these states using LOCC and on the other hand there's also the entanglement distillation
and this is actually the one that we're really concerned with this is the one we're interested
because that's a useful one if I give you many copies of some kind of a state row how many EPR
states can I distill from that by just doing local operations and classical communication
again there's kind of very natural definitions for these things and then of course there's also
the definition of separability somehow a state is separable even only if it can be written as a
mixture of product states okay so these are kind of really the very standard things that all of you
certainly know in the theory of entanglement but you will see that actually these notions will
have to be changed now if you have super selection rules so there's kind of subtle differences not
anymore because somehow you can write your state as a product of separable states that you will
actually be able to make some state locally if you have super selection rules in general this is
not true so if you have a state that's separable you can actually prepare it with local operation
like classical communication but somehow if you have some limitations on what you can do that's
not necessarily true anymore okay so well in general somehow this entanglement distillation is smaller
than the entanglement cost but for pure states all these things coincide and but there's somehow
other kind of cases where you have inequality and this is actually important for the rest of the
talk to come it will turn out that this is exactly the case that will kind of pop up here in this
in the case of super selection rules or also with these gates to you is namely that somehow what you
have a mixture of states so you have like a mixed state and it's a mixture of kind of states but
there's a classical label that basically tells both sides which mixture which part of the mixture
you have so there's kind of a label alpha here that basically tells you well this is psi a psi a i b
and you just measure this classical label and then you can distill all the entanglement then for
this kind of case the entanglement distillation is actually equal to the entanglement cost
is equal somehow to the average entanglement entropy of all these kind of states
okay so what happens now when somehow with the operational definition of entanglement if there's
extra restrictions on the operation that we can implement because that's exactly what we are concerned
with and you don't really have to go to high-energy physics or this kind of a standard model to
encounter this even people doing experiments in atomic physics actually are faced with very clear
such kind of of limitations because all the physical operations they have to do have to
commute with a particle number that's actually a very non-trivial condition no that you cannot
just do anything you want now you what you do has to consider the particle number because
they don't have the huge enough energies to to to kind of have particle creation and not okay so
so this is one kind of super selection rule this is exactly you want super selection rule
but somehow the interesting thing from quantum information theory itself is that if something
is bad actually we turn it into something good no because we say well if there's something you
cannot do that means that there must be a new resource that allows you to overcome that limitation
okay and that is exactly somehow well for example it's entanglement in this case it will be some
kind of fluctuations of particle number anyway people were very concerned about with questions
like that 15 years ago no so it's starting with zanardi then actually also kind of Bartlett also
our chairman was kind of working on this there's many people that that asked kind of these questions
how to how what what indeed how do we have to change the theory of entanglement in this setup
and let me kind of give you our point of view somehow the point of view that somehow we developed in
well in 2003 and 2004 with Ignacio Ciroc and and Norbert Schuch okay so let me kind of give
a very simple example so let's consider a simple system of two qubits okay and let's assume that
the super selection rule is the particle number okay and I'm working somehow in the in the computational
basis so it means that my super selection rule is that everything I do have to come has to commute
basically with with with sigma z okay so with the tensor product of of the sigma z's okay and so
now we have a bipartite state and you say well let me kind of just do local operation and of
course locally no I have to commute with really the with the local sigma z okay because that's
the super selection rule that's the particle number that I cannot kind of off a chain so that
means that locally the only operations you can do are basically diagonal okay like a diagonal in
the sigma z basis and now you somehow consider states of that form so it's a row somehow this
state is indeed has the symmetry it has the symmetry of the global symmetry of your super
selection rule it's kind of wow you see this is all these elements are zero because if they would
not be zero it would not commute with the super selection rule but let's consider a state like
that or more specifically this state where somehow all the kind of elements here are equal to one
so this is clearly an operator there's an auto obvious state that is allowed giving a super
selection rules and this state is clearly separable okay everybody that knows the ppt
criteria and immediately see that this state is separable but now you start thinking can I actually
create this state locally is there a way that I can create this state locally when somehow I have
to satisfy this super selection rule and what you start seeing is that any kind of decomposition
of this state in terms of separable states so in terms in terms of product states any mix if you
want to write this state as a mixture of product states all these product states actually involve
local superpositions local violations of the super selection rule and in these somehow it means
this state can actually not be created locally so even somehow if you have super selection or even
this state is separable it's not kind of a local state there is something like non-local in that
state okay so there's a new resort there's something new type of new locality that
that arises if somehow you have super selection rules and then the general framework for these
kind of things is actually that a super selection rule decomposes a Hilbert space into a direct
sum of projectors okay so we have your Hilbert space there's a direct sum of projectors and
there's a very simple well somehow any state has of your so any state that
that you give if I give you a state row and you're only allowed to do operations that
commute with your super selection rules it turns out that this state has to be completely
indistinguishable from one that you depolarize in that basis so even if your original state
is a pure state okay after kind of applying this depolarization somehow you get a new state
and these two states are completely equivalent if you're only allowed to do local operations
like classical communication okay and obviously if you do this depolarization on that previous
state here this kind of two off diagonal elements with vanish would become zero and that's why of
course this is then just equal to the maximum mixed state which is obviously kind of um yeah
obviously separable okay so and you can easily prove the converse also is that a state can be
prepared using local operations and classical communication and super selection rules even
only if somehow a row is equal to row till okay so you can start building from how your whole theory
there and then also seeing well what what what what what can I do with this no because I know
have kind of something that I cannot do so so all the people in quantum information have this
cryptographic kind of of of of of of intuition immediately well if there's something that I
cannot do I should be should be useful and it is somehow these super selection rules are actually
useful now so you can for example create these states okay I have a bipartite state zero one
plus minus one zero it's kind of indeed satisfied it has one particle there because it has charge one
but somehow by local operations and classical communication I will never ever be able to
detect whether it's a plus or minus one so this is kind of a perfect state for data hiding okay
because if I can just give you this state and I can only measure it in the the signal z basis
well I don't have access to this kind of thing but now you ask what is there is is there also a
resource that allows me to overcome this and indeed somehow there is the resource that allows
you to overcome this if I would just give you one of these psi pluses and I tell you that this psi
plus and you take the tensor product now of these two states you will see that by doing some measurement
that is local I will be able to get some information about whether it's a plus or a minus okay and
that's how you can start building now the whole theory of resources and so further and somehow
there is this what what we did with Norbert Schuch in his in his PhD thesis somehow we we looked at
this kind of global super selection rules and then we see that there's actually a new resource
that is called the super selection induced variance and then basically we were able to
generalize this fundamental theorem of entanglement to the case when you also have super selection
rules so we say well I can convert one state into the other one if and only if somehow the
entanglement entropy of the two matches and additionally somehow this new measure indeed
is equal okay but that's basically all I wanted to say about the super selection rules and the
you one kind of thing so again so this is along the lines of all these other papers also that I
sketched or kind of that I gave references before okay so just for kind of completeness and certainly
also for what we'll tell later somehow you can now repeat this whole story for something like
SPT phase because this is exactly so this the previous story was about you one symmetry now
let's assume that we have a big conness matter system and this is a symmetry protected phase okay
so it means that actually all the operation all the physical operation that I have to do
have to commute with some kind of global symmetry okay that's exactly what these SPT phases do I
don't know so most of you have probably already heard of these topological insulators and all
this this is exactly somehow the setting of such systems so now you can just repeat this whole
story you can just literally kind of do all the steps that we said we have kind of a global state
has kind of a global symmetry all my observables have to commute with these kind of things how
do I quantify the amount of entanglement that I can extract or what is the useful entanglement that
I have in such a conness matter system if I would divide it in a and b and I want somehow to have
entanglement between a and b how would I measure the amount of entanglement well somehow in general
you kind of take some e-reps of your group of your of uh and then denote the charge in region a by
some number that you will charge by r star and so further and then somehow you can go through the
whole story and at the end you see that indeed your local reduced density matrix of this kind of
region a is basically somehow a mixture somehow is a tensor product of just this classical label
times somehow tensor a state that is mixed and the whole thing is of course that somehow this
classical this this r thing that the label the charge that kind of indeed just tells you what
somehow your symmetry is this is basically the charge of your super this is basically the label
of your e-rep somehow this is a classical label and this is not useful this is purely classical
kind of information this is purely classical entropy all the useful entropy will actually be
in somehow the remaining part and you continue doing this so we have this kind of reduced density
matrix um so obviously because somehow you have this tensor product structure the entanglement
entropy kind of just separates into two parts and turns out that the second one is actually the only
useful one this this thing you cannot change because this is exactly you can only do diagonal
operations on this first kind of part on this on this part you cannot change this r label because
if you would change it you would kind of do something that violates your global symmetry you
would violate somehow your symmetry on your region that you are acting on so you are not allowed to
change r and therefore you cannot somehow this entropy is useless and indeed somehow the entanglement
entropy or the distillable entanglement of such a state is therefore just somehow the average
of the entanglement entropy of this kind of part that is remaining you will see that actually um
we will be able to now kind of repeat this whole story for gauge theories and get exactly
the same formulas okay so that's what we will do now let's plan to kind of understand entanglement
in gauge theory so so again somehow this question has actually been addressed many many times in
this field of energy physics and quantum gravity and and and string theory so starting with papers
of polycarp and collaborators and many especially also the papers of casini there have been lots
and lots of confusions of how to define entanglement in these gauge theories because somehow the tensor
product structure is not there no so there's something like the it's it's difficult to define
what if you have entanglement normally it's very easy no because you have a tensor product structure
you can do everything here and there but now somehow the tensor product structure is not
clear anymore because the the gauge conditions overlap the regions that you're acting on okay
and therefore it's not so easy and that's why there's lots of confusion about um about these things
okay so let's go back to this z2 gauge to you know where we had our vertices we had our photons
let's try to see how we would define the entanglement here so um I have an extensive number of a
super selection rules that's the difference that's the only difference with the previous
stories but the previous story we just had one global symmetry and we could do everything that
commutes now we have actually look we have an extensive amount of super selection rules that's
actually the way of understanding a gauge theory it's nothing more than that so so that means on
every kind of of these of these of these vertices somehow what I have to do has to commute with
all somehow these x's you see if you divide somehow your system in two pieces the only difficulty
will be exactly on this border now so so I I kind of have for example I have to act here
and what I have to do locally on this region here has to commute with somehow all the gauge
conditions there that means that if you kind of take this a bigger picture here take this kind
of three guys here all the operations you do on this qubit basically have to commute with the gauge
conditions on these five qubits but of course there's only one operator this is a product of sigma x's
that means that the only thing you can do here is basically measure that qubit in the sigma x basis
and that's exactly what you will do so you will have to kind of depolarize basically both sides
by measuring somehow these charges that kind of act exactly on the border or exactly lying on the
border between the two regions you will have to measure them okay because that's the classical
information you cannot access these degrees of freedom and then somehow look at somehow the
remaining states what comes out of this okay so let me kind of show this so what you do is you
have the system know what you kind of do is just measure basically all these all these charges or
of course you can just kind of write this down in the reduced density matrix and you will see that
this reduced density matrix is exactly of the same kind as we talked about before and and then
somehow you will see that by doing this on this z2 gauge theory that actually there's no entanglement
whatsoever okay which means that actually in the historic code there's no entanglement all the
entanglement that is there in the historic code is purely there to accommodate for the gauge degrees
of freedom for the gauge conditions but somehow the useful entanglement somehow the entanglement
that that you would be able to extract by doing operations that's actually completely zero and
indeed somehow this is because if you if you look at this kind of whole system this z2 gauge theory
is like a superposition of all possible loops and if you measure somehow the charges in between
you basically cut the loops but if you kind of know what the loops are you don't need any more
information to construct basically the left hand side or the right hand side they are completely
disentangled so they become completely separable when you kind of measure somehow
some qubits along some line in the middle this completely disentangles the left from the right
and therefore indeed this entanglement is completely zero okay so let's let's kind of now
generalize this a bit to the general setting somehow or the general setting of a lattice gauge
theory so typically somehow you have of course much more complicated symmetries now you have
kind of symmetries that that are not a billion ends or further but somehow the whole setting is the
same I have a state I have some kind of gauge conditions I have some kind of these conditions
that cross the border now somehow we have these charges but there's some kind of extra labels
there's irreps there's kind of multiplicities we just measure somehow well it's it's it's
it's really kind of a bit technical but it's exactly the same steps as I presented before you
just have to measure these charges because you cannot do anything with them anyway because
somehow what you have to do has to commute with them and by kind of repeating the whole story
at the end what you get is somehow that this entanglement entropy for the distillable entanglement
so that your local reduced density matrix or the entropy of your local reduced density matrix
consists of two parts the first part that is completely classical and has to do basically
with somehow these charges that you cannot deal with just like in the super selection kind of
of setting but then also we have somehow the average entropy of everything that remains and
this part is exactly somehow the distillable entanglement okay so this is indeed somehow this
is the the amount of useful entanglement that you will be able to extract from your from your state
okay so let me give some more examples like this z2 lattice gauge theory which was basically the
toricode well the distillable entanglement is zero you would think oh but maybe let me kind of go to
a more complicated model let me go to this double semion string net okay which is like more complicated
more interesting it turns out that the entanglement of distillation is also zero there like for exactly
the same reason if you kind of this is so the double semium model is actually very similar to
the toricode it's just a superposition of all possible loops but somehow with a minus sign
depending on whether you have an even or a not number of loops but somehow you still have to
measure your charges and if you measure your charges in the middle this completely disentangles
the left from the right part and therefore you get separable states and that's zero actually for any
pure abelian lattice gauge theory at zero coupling the somehow entanglement of distillation is always
zero but for non-abelian theories it's actually non-zero this is kind of a non-trivial it's not
not so trivial that this is true but this is really because somehow if you have a non-abelian
theory somehow there's many number of inequivalent ways that representations can fuse to the scalar
one and somehow you cannot this this information is not available locally if you measure the charges
there's still some superpositions that are kind of remaining there and this is kind of the remaining
entanglement that is there in this system okay so let me give some kind of a slight alternative
viewpoint on why this entanglement of distillation is zero in this gauge theories okay and this I
think this is probably the easiest way of explaining this to people in quantum information theory
it's really to go back to this gauging procedure that I talked about so so what I said is that in
some sense this whole gauging somehow or the toricote you can start from a product state and then
just apply a very simple isometry to this product state to get somehow this toricote in the z2 or
the z2 gauge theory okay it was like an isometry that I apply this this is this whole gauging
procedure is nothing more kind of than this but the result is somehow if you first apply
this isometry g let's call it g and then you kind of apply indeed this measurement of the charges
okay so you first apply g on this product state and then p somehow this thing factorizes for a
brilliant theories you can immediately see that actually very simple exercise to show that this
factorize and of course if the original theory somehow if the original state that you started
with was a product state then applying somehow first the gauging map and then measuring these charges
on somehow the border in between of course somehow will somehow not give you an entanglement
because somehow this factorizes this kind of gives a tensor product structure and this is actually
the best certainly the easiest way of understanding all these all these spt and topological phases
this is exactly somehow the connection between all these spt so these global symmetries this is
here the situation of a global super selection rule this is kind of the situation of a local
super selection rule spt phases versus topological phases this is exactly somehow always the same
story and this is how you can really merge all these viewpoints okay so let me kind of try to
go to a little bit kind of more complicated model while this is there's a typo here so this is a
perturbed z2 gauge theory so you just put some magnetic field okay so let's take the z2 gauge
theory this this story code but act add some kind of non-trivial kind of term in the hamiltonian
that kind of perturbs it away from this fixed one so this is the torque code would be somehow
if this magnetic fields are all kind of completely zero or you're completely in this point and the
distributed entanglement was zero turns out that somehow if you kind of only act somehow with
something on the gauge on the on the gauge photons you kind of put some some some magnetic field on
the gauge photons the distributed entanglement is still zero so this red line remains zero there's
still no distributed entanglement somehow but if somehow from the moment you act with some
some magnetic field in the z direction somehow well you have to translate of course this thing to
this gauge language there's immediately somehow some non-trivial distilable entanglement popping up
somehow including somehow this topological entanglement entropy term that was derived from
in this very famous paper of of kitayev and preskel somehow what you see is that indeed somehow this
distilable entanglement from a moment you act some some okay for a moment you have some non-trivial
correlation length you immediately have some non-trivial topological kind of you have immediately
some non-trivial distilable entanglement and indeed the constant correction to this completely
matches what you expect so this is the universal part basically this is the universal part that
would remain if you would kind of really redo the right scaling and put the lattice go to the
continuum and all this this is the only part somehow that is that would be universal and and
survive and this would survive somehow everywhere in this and this de-confined kind of place so this
what people in high energy physicals de-confined is actually what we call somehow topological
and everything that is confined is actually trivial this is the trivial phase and indeed
somehow this correction is kind of non-zero here and somehow it's zero in this other kind of
correction okay so let's let's go to more complicated models okay so and let's do the same thing in
1D so so there's an extremely interesting model if you want to really understand the real physical
model and you want to understand somehow what this entanglement engaged you is somehow the first
thing to look at is actually the Schwinger model the Schwinger model is basically QED in one dimension
okay so the simultaneous a bit complicated but it's very similar to somehow the way you obtain
this is exactly by gauging a very trivial kind of ising type of Hamiltonian now it's again somehow
the sigmas or the original matter fields and then you introduce some new gauge degrees of freedom
this would be like the electric field this would be like the conjugate variables you write down
this Hamiltonian this is QED in in in one dimension and this is actually a very interesting theory
because it has confinement it has the whole kind of study okay so you can calculate somehow the
ground state entanglement okay so you can really kind of put this on a computer use this whole
machinery of matrix product states tensor networks tensor further find the ground state of this thing
as a function of somehow x so so you have to say this x is of course the lattice parameter so you
put this on the lattice but then you want to kind of go to the continuum and the continuum would be
obtained if kind of this parameter x goes to infinity and you're interested indeed somehow in
all the quantities what happens how do you somehow all the properties like the entanglement and
everything scale if somehow this x goes to infinity okay so and you can plot somehow this
entanglement entropy from the cut by looking at the schmidt numbers and so further as a function
of one over square root of x and you see that indeed it has very nice divergences and all these
kind of things but this is completely understood and completely under control now the interesting
thing that happens in fields you is of course the vacuum is completely uninterested the vacuum
is somehow the absolute nothingness no there's nothing there this is so you to see something
interesting you have to put something on top of the vacuum and therefore you have to subtract
basically this infinite entanglement or this infinite kind of quantities to see something useful
okay so so that's what somehow we did somehow what we did is kind of force two charges to be
sitting here at the distance of this is like a distance of five from each other well this is
arbitrary of course but somehow you put two charges at the distance five to each other and
kind of really pin them down there okay and then calculate the ground state if this happens if
I have two fixed charges there in this kind of one-dimensional QED how does the entanglement
entropy kind of change as a function of the distance and what you see is that if they're close
to each other and indeed the entanglement entropy in between them is actually pretty large but if
you kind of start taking them out of each other these two charges then certainly this excess of
entanglement entropy over this kind of of normal entanglement entropy that's when without charges
actually goes to zero and that's exactly somehow what confinement is now if you take two charges far
enough from each other you will kind of kind of creation of pairs and anti-particles and they
will completely screen somehow these two charges and in between it's like there's nothing there so
that's exactly somehow the phenomenon of confinement now you take two particles take them far enough
from each other at some point somehow the string in between has so much energy that somehow it's
more beneficial to create particles anti-particles and you screen these two things and it's like these
two particles I don't see each other anymore okay so so let me show this movie about maybe I should
indeed have oh you cannot see this movie well anyway it's a beautiful movie
and what where you can see basically what happens if you take two of these charges
you take the charges five and take them out of each other and see how the entanglement changes as
a function of somehow the distance and what you see is that somehow the first it's very large and
then suddenly at some point it jumps okay and then another time it jumps and it's always when
somehow a new kind of particle anti particle is created that this thing jumps and you see this whole
well but you cannot see it I don't know why you cannot see it anyway this is um um this is the
situation somehow when you do the same for fractional charges somehow what happens in the
case of fractional charges it's actually much more interesting is that that of course you cannot
screen fractional charges and even somehow if you so this is when they are close to each other you
take two kind of 4.5 charge take them off from each other so here somehow you see that there's
already kind of one screening then there's two screenings three and so further but somehow even
if they are very far from each other somehow in this case this halve charge cannot be screened
and therefore the entanglement the excess of entanglement entropy or of this tillable entanglement
is still there so you can really start kind of looking at all these problems this was something
that was completely impossible to do with any other methods no to try to understand what is the
entanglement what are the correlations what are how does it kind of affect the ground state
entanglement and all this by so and and the stringer models these are actually very complicated
models but using all these tools of entanglement here you can now really have a beautiful picture
of how somehow entanglement kind of plays a role in all these processes so again this was
another movie that you cannot see I think I have to probably stop anyway but somehow as a last
remark I was saying that there was lots of confusions okay so there were lots of confusions
in this whole kind of quantum gravity community about what is the right definition of entanglement
now if I have a gauge theory and certainly somehow one of the cases where they were looking at is
three plus one three you want gauge theories okay so you have a this is in three plus one
that makes you have some kind of a sphere and you have entanglement there and you want to define
what is the entanglement entropy and somehow there were like lots of papers and some of these
papers kind of re obtained that the entanglement entropy somehow the universal term of c was
like minus 31 over 90 other papers obtained that it was minus 16 divided by 90 and people
really had no clue what this was about okay so now recently somehow sony and trivedi kind of really
calculated actually the distillable entanglement and the normal the total entanglement for this
kind of halting it's a very complicated calculation it's like a calculation of 30 pages but what a
at the end so is that indeed somehow this is the complete entropy and actually this minus 16
over 90 is obtained when you calculate the distillable entanglement so this is kind of
really kind of giving us a resolution of this paradox it really tells you now this what this
calculated with using these conventions and these kind of rules is actually the distillable
entanglement the useful one the one that is actually has an operational meaning while what
the other people calculated was actually the global kind of things which is indeed
also an interesting measure but is not kind of a measure of that doesn't have an operational
meaning so anyway so I have to conclude here so I think well gauge series are or everywhere
somehow in physics and somehow if you have somehow these gauge series you have to kind of start
thinking about super selection rules and this really kind of change the game of concerning
entanglement entropy now so you have you have to kind of start looking at entanglement as resource
theory you have new limitation on what you can do locally you have kind of these gauge constraints
and somehow then the entanglement always splits in somehow a purely classical part and a distillable
part and the last one is actually the one that we would say is useful and has an operational
meaning okay so we calculated this entanglement entropy for several theories also away from this
limit but anyway I would say that somehow this is I think this is a very interesting approach okay
this is the way that I start learning about gauge series and it's an extremely interesting
approach to do this from this point of view of entanglement onto from the point of view of
wave function because that's certainly not the way that typically this this approach is certainly
not the standard way that people in high-ency physics take so thanks for your attention
so thanks very much and I'm sure there are many questions for Frank
so if you have a question could you raise your hand and there are volunteers with
microphones so I see in the back is it someone right in the here over here just right in the
right in the middle sir I think your all calculation is based on the particularly
representation of the gauge theory Hilbert space where you represent the Hilbert space as a subspace of
tensor product hyperspace where the case constraints is just satisfied but I could take
a other representation of the gauge theory the hyperspace and for instance if I could take a
question space in that case calculation detail might be different but I guess the operational
the meaningful quantity should should remain the same is this statement obvious
um I don't know probably but then then then my next question would be why did you chose
that particular representation um well this is certainly the one that that comes naturally if
you if you start if you try to simulate these systems now if you kind of really have some
way of putting a continuous theory on the lattice then somehow this is actually called the the
suskind go good representation and this is a very natural way of putting gauge theories or kind of
quantum field theories on the lattice and you will always kind of put such a such a representation so
I've we actually have not really talked about about this other kind of quotient representation
that you're talking about but somehow I guess that operationally this this this should all kind of be
very very similar and and of course these different ways that these quantum gravity people have
calculated have to do with but indeed these different notions now and that's that's and it's
it's uh certainly in this other kind of ways it's not clear what you actually precisely do no it's
it's it's not clear it's it's yeah there there's there's um certainly I would say that the way we
did it is like the very natural way this is the standard way so maybe indeed this this this quotient
way that you're talking about might also be a useful way of looking at it but uh this I don't know
so here in the middle of that just just by the main
half right there
yes I have a question about uh this notion of distillable entanglement which as I understand
it is just sort of the question of how many bell pairs can I get out of this state if I try
is it obvious that a bell pair is always the best or most natural yard stick for entanglement
or is there a case where there might be some other useful resource state that I could make
that is somehow sort of escapes that description yeah so so what is um so if you have if you talk
about pure states then it's clear that it doesn't really matter what yard stick you use because
they are this because of this fundamental theorem of uh of Bernstein and of Bennett and company
you know but uh but of course if you if you're really concerned about about about an operational
meaning then you might actually want entanglement for metrology or something and then indeed the
the EPR state is certainly not or the bell state is not naturally the natural one there's there might
be much better states for doing for using a metrology than this one but that's a kind of a
different question so so within this kind of very rigid setting of having pure state entanglement
it doesn't it really doesn't matter what kind of yard stick you use um also of course when you start
the question that you might ask what how do you generalize this to to to to multi-parted entanglement
when i have not just kind of a bi-parted setting with a tri-parted setting well there everything
is completely open people still don't understand at all somehow how to uh how to convert kind of
let's say w states to g and z states and actually these kind of questions are um or or mathematically
very um um difficult and also very relevant they would have lots of so these are all kind of of
questions about so why why can we do everything for bi-parted states it's really because it's just
linear algebra but if you have like three-parted states or four-parted say this is all kind of
tensor calculus and this is much much harder that's why we cannot do almost anything there thank you
perfect yes
so in many of the applications of entanglement entropy and quantum gravity people the quantity
that ends up being relevant uh seemingly is just the naively calculated uh entanglement entropy
not without any operational uh interpretation but do you know what the operational interpretation
of that naive quantity would be well it's a sum of this classical entropy and the the useful
entropy but indeed it turns out that if you well i showed this on this some of this picture it turns
out that that that they are very much related typically so if you kind of have the total entropy
or the distillery entanglement and you kind of look at them they look very similar as a function
of your quantity so so indeed it it might well be that it somehow to get some intuition of how
things scale or how better in time you have more or less entanglement when you change some parameters
that this is like um that this is more tonic and if one increases the other one increases and vice
versa so so but i don't yeah we don't really understand this so this was um so so again so
i'm not saying that somehow what we did here was um uh was very deep okay i'm just saying this is
like a very natural question that that's here for more community we should have saw no we have
entanglement entanglement from more point of view is operational people in this community of quantum
gravity want to calculate entanglement so let's just do it so actually all the the technology
or somehow the formulas that i have here we could exactly have done exactly we could have done all
these calculations 15 years ago once we have all this in this series of papers like 15 years ago
everybody was writing about super selection rules it could have been done there there's
nothing really new but nevertheless i think it's a it's an interesting result and i'm actually
very puzzled why the program committee chose this as a plenary talk
after that endorsement of the program committee so whom we are all very grateful for their hard
work um i would like to thank frank for his excellent talk uh and um all speakers are receiving
these um uh qip 2017 uh t-shirts so frank you thank you very much
