Checking APCTP/[2023 APCTP Spring Colloquium] Determinism all the way ï½œ Prof. Gerard 't Hooft.txt
1. **Cellular Automaton vs. Classical Mechanics**: The cellular automaton that Professor Gerald is discussing is not bound by Newton's laws or any other specific classical mechanics principles. It is an arbitrary system with its own evolution law, which can be described by a matrix of ones and zeros. This matrix captures the state transitions of the system without necessarily adhering to classical physical laws.

2. **Quantization**: The quantization Professor Gerald is performing does not involve applying quantum mechanics to a classical system (like quantizing the orbits in a planetary system). Instead, he is using quantum notation and concepts to describe the evolution of the cellular automaton. He emphasizes that this is not a standard quantization procedure but rather a different approach where the matrix U captures the probabilistic nature of the transitions between states.

3. **Hamilton-Jacobi Equation**: Professor Gerald mentioned the Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a starting point for his model, where one equation is significant and leads to conserved quantities like an omega frequency. However, he is not using the Hamilton-Jacobi principle to quantize his system; he is applying quantum concepts directly to the evolution law of the cellular automaton.

4. **Evolution Law**: The evolution law in Professor Gerald's cellular automaton model provides a clear prediction for the next state without any uncertainty, unlike classical mechanics where probabilities are involved. This evolution law is described by a matrix that specifies the transitions from one state to another.

5. **Closing Remarks**: The colloquium was wrapped up with thanks to Professor Gerald for his presentation and to Mira for organizing the event. It concluded with expressions of appreciation and well-wishes from the audience and the speaker.
