Processing Overview for Bootstrap Collaboration

Checking Bootstrap Collaboration/Bootstrap Zoominar 55, Joan Elias Miró (Oct 19, 2022), ＂Bridging Positivity and S-Matrix Bootstrap＂.txt
 The discussion revolved around different approaches to bounding the Higgs mass from below using various constraints and methods in the context of effective field theory (EFT) and unitarity. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Dual Bounds**: There are two main approaches to finding bounds on the Higgs mass—the primal approach, which directly imposes constraints like positivity, analyticity, and unitarity (PATU) on the EFT, and the dual approach, which uses the crossing symmetry and constrains the partial wave amplitudes indirectly. The dual approach was shown to already provide a robust bound even with minimal constraints (only using the leading crossing constraint and a square approximation for the unitarity circle).

2. **Constraints**: The discussion mentioned that by adding more spins, full unitarity, and electric charges to the dual approach, one expects to obtain tighter bounds. Additionally, preliminary results from running the dual problem with two-sided bounds on the imaginary part and the AR cuts' bounded imaginary part were mentioned, indicating that even with these limited constraints, rigorous bounds can be obtained.

3. **Limit Comparison**: The distinction was made between different limits one might consider in EFT. For example, taking the coupling constant to zero versus considering a weakly coupled theory (like the pion theory with large N). The former doesn't necessarily imply that higher-dimensional operators vanish, whereas in the latter, all interactions beyond a certain order can be neglected if they are small.

4. **Physical Assumptions**: The importance of physical assumptions such as the entire theory being weakly coupled was discussed. These assumptions can significantly affect the bounds obtained and the interpretations of the results.

5. **Numerics**: Numerical results have been obtained using both the primal and dual methods, with the dual approach already providing rigorous bounds by exploiting low-energy constraints and the AR cuts. The full potential of the dual method is expected to be realized by incorporating additional constraints.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the complexity of bounding the Higgs mass from below using EFT and underscored the interplay between different constraints and the importance of physically motivated assumptions in obtaining robust bounds.
