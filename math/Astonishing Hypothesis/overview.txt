1. **Information Quantification**: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) quantifies information about the past (cause information) and the future (effect information) based on the current state of a system's mechanisms. It compares unconstrained probability distributions with conditional probability distributions given the present state of a mechanism.

2. **Cause Information**: This represents our knowledge about the past states of a system that led to its current state, especially for a mechanism that is in a particular state (e.g., mechanism X1 being on).

3. **Effect Information**: This represents our knowledge about the future states that can result from the current state of a mechanism. It is the reverse of cause information, looking forward instead of back.

4. **Cause-Effect Information**: The minimum between cause information and effect information reflects the bottleneck of information flow at a given moment.

5. **Integration Quantification**: IIT assesses integration by examining the impact of removing connections within the system. It uses a process called statistical noising, where each connection is temporally disconnected, and its absence is evaluated to determine if there was any integration happening through that connection.

6. **Minimum Information Partition (MIP)**: The smallest change observed in the system's probability distributions after removing a connection indicates the level of integration present before removal. This MIP becomes the measure of integrated information or small phi at that moment.

7. **Cause-Effect Integrated Information**: By applying the same principles to subsets of the system, we can compute the integrated information for larger parts, potentially leading to the entire brain. The minimum between past and future integrated information provides a measure of the system's cause-effect structure at that moment.

8. **Application to Consciousness**: IIT proposes that the level of integrated information in a neural system could be related to the emergence of consciousness, suggesting a potential link between brain activity and subjective experience.

In essence, IIT offers a mathematical framework for understanding how complex systems like the brain can give rise to something as profound as consciousness by quantifying the integration of information within these systems.

1. **Color Perception**: Our color perception is based on the activation of three types of cone receptors in the retina, which respond to different wavelengths of light (red, green, and blue). This linear response to the light spectrum is transformed into a two-dimensional perceptual space due to color opponency, where we have opposing pairs: red-green and yellow-blue.

2. **Color Space**: The result of this process is a two-dimensional color space (like the CIELUV or CIEXYZ models), which can be visualized as a circle, representing all possible colors we can perceive. This circle is actually a slice through a three-dimensional color space, where each point has unique distances to all other points in the space.

3. **Psychophysics**: Psychophysicists measure these distances between colors psychophysically and find that they are not uniform across the color space. This means that the perceived distance between two colors is not equivalent to the distance between those same colors viewed as a different hue.

4. **Yoneda Lemma**: The work of Nao Tukia and Yato Saigo showed that the relations (or distances) between colors uniquely define each color's position in the color space, similar to how the yoneda lemma states that objects are defined by their relations rather than their intrinsic properties.

5. **Implications**: This has significant implications for understanding color perception and challenges the idea of an "inverted spectrum," where all colors would be perceived in reverse (e.g., what we perceive as red would be perceived as green in an inverted spectrum). It's mathematically impossible to have a different intrinsic spectrum but the same relational structure of color distances, according to the yoneda lemma.

6. **Abstract Theory**: Alexander Grothendieck's quote emphasizes the importance of abstracting away from concrete problems to develop general theories that can later provide solutions to those original problems, just as understanding the abstract relations in color perception can illuminate how we perceive colors concretely.
