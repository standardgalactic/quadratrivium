Checking The Abel Prize/Mikhail Gromov： Powerspace and the bulk problem.txt
1. **Function Continuation and Transcendental Functions**: The speaker is discussing a class of well-organized creatures (mathematical objects) that are not rational but are transcendental functions. These functions are distinguished by certain properties and if they are simply connected, they belong to a remarkable class. The speaker is questioning the nature of these functions and their analytic continuation.

2. **Products and Varieties**: The speaker mentions a product of varieties where each factor is defined by a polynomial equation. If we consider the projective space as the variable x, and the polynomial is generic of degree b, we get a non-singular algebraic variety for each n (a fixed number) and d (the degree of the polynomial). The speaker is interested in the poncare polynomial associated with these varieties and how they combine to form a function in two complex variables, which depends on n, d, and the block size i.

3. **Poncare Polynomial and Infinity Sum**: For each n, there is a poncare polynomial. By raising this polynomial to the powers of n and d and then summing these up (infinity n in the presentation), we get a function that depends on two numbers, d and n. The speaker wonders about the nature of this function and whether it has an analytic continuation.

4. **Combinatorial Complexity**: The speaker notes that even though the mathematical description of these quantities is simple, computations become highly complex combinatorially. Advanced techniques are needed to organize these calculations. This complexity arises even when considering the simplest aspects of a multi-particle system.

5. **Graph and Algebraic Variety**: The speaker introduces a graph with variables at each node, connected by a chain of algebraic equations. The same equation is repeated along the chain. The speaker is interested in understanding how the topology evolves with the number of terms in the chain (which grows exponentially). The first term is relatively easy to compute, and it seems to dominate, but it's unclear how this development continues as n increases.

In summary, the speaker is exploring the properties of certain mathematical functions that arise from products of algebraic varieties and grappling with the complexity of their combinatorial nature. These functions are of interest in understanding multi-particle systems and may require sophisticated techniques for analysis.

Checking The Abel Prize/Robert Langlands： On the Geometric Theory.txt
1. **The Problem:** The goal is to understand the geometric Lang-Lenz program, which involves classifying eigenvalues of automorphic forms on elliptic curves with respect to the Galois group. This is a generalization of the ATIA classification for GL2.

2. **The Solution Sketch:**
   - The solution involves constructing a bungee, a certain kind of double covering of an elliptic curve, which relates the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators to representations of the Galois group.
   - This bungee is a two-dimensional analogue of the one-dimensional construction in the ATIA classification.
   - The connection on this double covering descends to a connection on the original elliptic curve, which corresponds to the HECA operators (Hecke operators for automorphic forms on elliptic curves).

3. **The Galois Group Connection:**
   - The Galois group in question is a two-dimensional representation of the Automorphic Galois group induced from a one-dimensional representation on the double covering.
   - This Galois group is related to, but not exactly, Tiabat's group. It accounts for the restrictions and modifications needed at a more number-theoretical level.

4. **The Physical Context:**
   - While the Yang-Mills equations are traditionally of physical origin, in this context, they serve as a mathematical tool to construct the bungee and understand the geometric Lang-Lenz program.
   - The physical interest of the Yang-Mills equations in this case is secondary to their mathematical utility.

5. **The Question:** The speaker asks if there's more beyond the complete mathematical theory they've described, possibly with additional physical implications or other applications.

6. **The Challenge:** The construction and analysis of the bungee for arbitrary G over an arbitrary Riemann surface are complex and require a deep understanding of geometry, singularities, and various number-theoretic concepts like the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

7. **The Invitation:** The speaker invites anyone interested in tackling this problem to explore it further, suggesting that it could be a worthwhile endeavor for young mathematicians.

In summary, the speaker has outlined a mathematical framework based on geometric constructions and representations of the Galois group that classifies eigenvalues of automorphic forms on elliptic curves. This framework is inspired by the ATIA classification but extends it to two dimensions and applies it to a more general setting. The speaker is curious if there are further implications or extensions of this mathematical theory that could have physical significance or other applications beyond its current geometric and number-theoretic scope.
