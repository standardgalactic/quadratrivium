Checking Rotman Institute of Philosophy/Markus Müller： Exact operational interpretation of the free energy without the thermodynamic limit.txt
1. The correlation between particles or states matters depending on the context or the task you want to accomplish with the system. If you're using a heat engine and it puts marbles on a shelf, whether you care about the correlations depends on your purpose, such as deciding between oatmeal and cake for breakfast in a way that keeps things random and varied.

2. In classical mechanics, you can track the probabilities of different system configurations without needing to consider quantum effects or entanglement. The example of breakfast choices illustrates this point.

3. In the context of Guantan systems (quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom), the problem of correlations and thermalization is much more complex. There are open questions about whether it's even possible to manipulate these systems in a controlled way, especially when considering the thermodynamics of free energy.

4. The theorem Marcus mentioned shows that for classical systems with finite dimensions, you can create heat engines that work in both directions (maximal work extraction and refrigeration), but this may not directly translate to quantum Guantan systems due to their inherent complexity and the challenge of controlling infinite-dimensional spaces.

5. The discussion highlights the importance of understanding the context and the nature of the system (classical or quantum, finite or infinite dimensions) when considering thermodynamic processes and correlations between states.
