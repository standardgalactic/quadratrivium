1. **Probability and Reality**: Probabilities are not states of the world but tools for reasoning with incomplete information. They reflect our beliefs or degrees of belief about the truth of propositions, not actual states of reality. Physics and economics both use probabilistic reasoning, but physics sometimes lacks the humility about modeling that economics does.

2. **Identifying X vs. Defining X**: There's a distinction between identifying something based on what it does (criterion) and defining what it is. In the example given, Mary is identified by her action of cutting a cake, but her definition as 'Mary' is independent of that action.

3. **Criteria for Updating Beliefs**: When updating beliefs, one uses prior probabilities and new information to arrive at a posterior probability. The term 'information' is used as a convenient label for the constraints or data that lead to these updates, similar to how 'temperature' is a labeled parameter in statistical mechanics.

4. **Value of Information**: The value of information can be quantified by how it changes one's beliefs or decisions. In decision theory, preferences are described using utility functions, and information that leads to better decisions (higher utility) is valuable.

5. **Automatic Accounting for Information in Decision Theory**: If you have a well-defined set of preferences and a utility function, the decision theory framework automatically accounts for the value of new information as it updates beliefs and decides on actions accordingly.

In summary, probabilities are tools for reasoning about our beliefs, not direct measures of reality. The distinction between identifying and defining entities is important, especially when considering what 'information' represents in decision-making processes. The value of information is determined by its impact on decisions and beliefs, which can be quantified using utility functions within the framework of decision theory.
