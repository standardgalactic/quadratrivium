1. **Consistency and Multiverses**: The challenge posed to proponents of the extreme multiverse view is that it seems unable to make coherent statements about the consistency of statements like the Axiom of Determinacy (ADR) or Gödel's Projective Determinacy (PD). This is because, in a multiverse framework where many different universes or models might exist, there isn't a clear way to assert the consistency of such statements across all possible models.

2. **The PD Frame**: The PD frame is a specific large cardinal axiom in set theory. It is known that its consistency cannot be proven within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), which is the standard framework for mathematical set theory. However, some mathematicians are willing to assert that the PD frame is consistent because they believe it to be true, based on supporting evidence like the structure theory of determinacy.

3. **The Riemann Hypothesis**: The Riemann Hypothesis is a famous unsolved problem in number theory with a similar status to the consistency of large cardinal axioms. Unlike the PD frame, there isn't a community of mathematicians who assert its truth without proof. The Millennium Prize Problems initiative also reflects this difference, as it offers a prize for a correct proof (either affirmative or negative) but not just for an assertion of its truth.

4. **The Sociological Proof**: The difference in how the PD frame and the Riemann Hypothesis are treated is highlighted by the rules of the Millennium Prize Problems, which reward a proof rather than an unsubstantiated claim of resolution.

5. **The Philosophical Implication**: The willingness to assert the consistency of the PD frame, despite its non-provability within ZFC, suggests that there is something unique about set theory and the way large cardinal axioms are viewed by mathematicians. This contrasts with the multiverse view, which struggles to make definitive statements on such matters due to its pluralistic nature.

6. **The Evolution of Understanding**: Over time, as more evidence has been gathered and theories have been refined (like the structure theory of determinacy), mathematicians have become more confident in asserting the consistency of ADR and other related large cardinal axioms.

In summary, the speaker argues that the multiverse view, particularly its extreme form, cannot account for the kind of certainty or confidence that mathematicians have in the consistency of statements like PD within set theory. This is because the multiverse view does not provide a clear framework for making such declarations across all possible models or universes. In contrast, within set theory, there is a basis for asserting the consistency of PD and related axioms, despite the fact that such consistency cannot be proven within ZFC.
