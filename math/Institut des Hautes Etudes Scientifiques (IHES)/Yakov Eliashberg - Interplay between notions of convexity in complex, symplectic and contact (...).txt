Thank you very much. I prepared some slides, but I probably will skip most of them and just talk,
but I maybe use some of them. Okay, so as I already explained, there is the following kind of
fundamental notion of convexity in complex geometry, which we call j-convexity, of course,
is classically called pseudoconvexity. And this is a differential geometric notion,
and it means, like, for instance, one of interpretations that you take a hypersurface
in complex manifold, or say, for instance, NCN, and it is
a mean normal curvature in any complex direction, tangent complex direction is positive.
So it's kind of like what is the essence of this property that it invariant under
by holomorphism. So it's kind of much more, in some sense, invariant than usual geometric
convexity, which only invariant under affine transformation. So then it was, as I was started
by, so it was introduced by Livy in the beginning of 20th century. And it kind of was understood
that it related to too many notions of convexity in like known convexity in complex geometry.
And this is what is called polynomial rational holomorphic convexity. So let me just briefly
remind you. So if you have, for instance, just let's restrict to the case of CN,
you have a compact set, then you can define it polynomial HAL. So you consider all kinds of
points which you cannot separate from this given compact set by modulus of complex polynomial.
So then there is a, you can also have a rational HAL. This is the same just in terms of rational function.
And you can also define holomorphic HAL and holomorphic convex HAL. But this is,
you need to say holomorphic HAL in what? Because this holomorphic function is not defined on the
course here. And then respectfully, if you have this notion of polynomial convexity,
rational convexity, and holomorphic convexity is slightly kind of more tricky to define. So you
say that open set, you define all first that open set is holomorphically convex. If for every
compact subset, it's holomorphic HAL of this compact subset in this open set is compact.
And compact set is called holomorphically convex if it have a like fundamental system of
holomorphically convex neighbor. So this is a really kind of like fundamental notion of
in complex analysis. For instance, equivalently, they can be reformulated in terms of approximation
property in terms of approximation by polynomial rational function, homomorphic, etc.
And what is this kind of discovery and vision of Levy is that what he
proved that holomorphically convex domain is always should be convex. There is some kind
of nuances is strict convexity or weak should be convexity. It's a big deal in complex analysis.
And there are the kind of things much kind of a lot of extremely deep question about this,
but I'm kind of ignoring this. That's not important. So mostly I just think
speak about strict convexity in this in this talk. And but sometimes I'm not so precise,
something's true for big should be convex for strict. So that so we just prove that
holomorphic convexity implies should be convexity. And he kind of conjectured that converse is true.
And this was called Levy problem. And for domain in CNN, it was settled by Oka, who proved that
strictly should be convex domain and CNN is holomorphically convex. And then it required
like many year development, including people and kind of culminating in ground to
upgrade it to weekly should be convex domain and also to other manifold, but I'm not not
kind of going into this direction. So there's also kind of like characterization by by Oka
that should be convex domain is a so how you characterize now polynomial convexity. So
there is a theorem of Oka that so if you have a domain, so if it's polynomial convex, it's
kind of automatically should be convex, it has a should be convex boundary. And the condition
that it is a polynomial convex means that this, this, so it's a sub level set of kind of like
locally defined, therefore, duty sub-harmonic function, but condition that it polynomial convex
that this function extend to the whole CNN. And it doesn't matter how it extend to the whole CNN
because there is a construction of taking maximum duty sub-harmonic function. So whichever extension
it, it has, you can take some kind of function extremely fast growing in CNN at infinity and
therefore take a maximum and then you can make your plural sub-harmonic functions have a prescribed
behavior at infinity whatever. But your domain are bounded. What? Your domain are bounded domains
or not? Yeah, domain are bounded. I can talk about you. Okay. Yes, yes. I can talk about compact
domain. Yes, yes. Okay. So, yeah, so the domain of course not so great. The domain I always think
about bounded domain compact domain. Okay. So, so this is a, and since there is a much more recent
characterization of rational convexity also in terms of the differential kind of geometric
condition, it says that should a convex domain is rationally convex, even only if you can find,
you just locally define, define it by locally this plural sub-harmonic function and this form
corresponding form dcp, which kind of symplectic form on the, on this domain extend to the whole
CNN. You don't require functional extent, but you require the symplectic form extend as
color form, which means that it can form compatible with standard complex structure. So that means
that there exists a positive definite Hermitian form for which this form is imaginary part.
So, yes. And so,
okay, so I, as I said, that's kind of like, I would be kind of switching back and forth,
but we, this guy, we prefer to use this notion of J, let's like turning J convexity
instead of plural sub-harmonicity and to the convexity, just first of all, because like sometimes
it's useful to change, to change complex structure and also you can talk about this in the non-integrable
J context, but okay, but that is of course not important. Okay, so as already
explained in, in his talk, I think the really crucial, crucial,
the crucial kind of like issue here that all this notion that okay, so essentially this is
geometric notion of pseudo convexity or J convexity is tightly related to some
notion of convexity in symplectic and contact geometry. So, what do we have in, in the,
in the case of, of this blue-pruice harmonic function? So, you can, as we said, we already
can take this form omega phi is minus ddc phi, so this is a symplectic form, so it's kind of already
first indication of some symplectic connection, then we can take a gradient, gradient of this
function phi with respect to this Hermitian metric, which is a like real part corresponding to,
to this Hermitian form and then this vector field turns out to be Liouville field, so let's call
it x phi and this, this is a Liouville, Liouville field for omega phi and Liouville field for omega
phi just means that the derivative of x phi of omega phi of x phi is equal to omega phi, so that
this field is, so if you take a flow of this vector field, then it just rescale, rescale
our symplectic form. So, this is one thing, then also as a, as a chi, chi already said,
chi already said that when you take a, for instance, more far critical point of blue-pruice
harmonic function, then its stable manifold is automatically, let's have an index less than n
and a stable manifold of them are either tropics of manifold, so kind of like in critical dimension
they are Lagrangian and then it, it follows that the whole, like for instance, if you have a,
this pseudo convex domain, then you can, yeah, so, so level set automatically because
you have this transverse to them, to level set transverse Liouville vector field, then that means
that if you consider corresponding, so if you take a form, which is a, in this case kind of you
contract all x, x phi with omega phi and of course you just get this minus dc phi form, then this form
is a, it's a primitive, so this is a, so this form lambda phi and the, this is a primitive form for
omega phi and this form is contact on this sub-manifold, so the level set or pseudo convex
hyper surfaces are contact manifold and what also follows that this minus flow of the gradient
vector field retracts the domain to its Morse complex, which is therefore some isotropic complex,
some kind of singular Lagrangian you can think about this.
So maybe let me also say here, there is a, in, in the case,
in, in the case of contact geometry, at some moment, moment we, we, we wrote with Misha some paper
called a convex symplectic manifold, like emphasizing this property, so and essentially
kind of what we are saying that this, if you have a hyper surface in, in symplectic manifold,
that symplectic convexity means that existence of transverse Liouville vector field, which is kind
of, as I say, the same as saying that this is a, like what is called contact type hyper surface,
so this is a, and we also introduce this notion in contact context, so the contact manifold is
kind of like, okay, so the contact manifold
literally is manifold with non-integral hyper plane distribution, so in, in this complex context
this hyper surface together with field, pseudo convex hyper surface together with field
of complex tangent hyper plane, but it's also can be always thought there is a construction
of simpletization and which give us symplectic manifold with r plus action and our contact
manifold is kind of like transverse slice of the symplectic manifold and in some sense any notion
in contact geometry is just can be reformulated in terms of the symplectic geometry, but just
repeating this word is r plus invariant or equivalent. For instance, we can also take
in contact manifold, you can take these cones and ask when such cones are symplecticly convex,
so that means that when you have this Liouville vector field, like again invariant or equivalent
with respect to r plus action and which is transverse to it and in pure contact term that
means that this is a hyper surface in contact manifold which is a mid-transverse contact vector field
and just again, okay, so I'll come to this notion later on because there was some
interesting recent development. Okay, so you have this, this is an important kind of picture
that you have a critical point and you have a stable manifold and suppose in critical dimension
this is some Lagrangian and there is a level set and this level set is a contact manifold
and intersection of this level set with a stable manifold is a Ligendrian sphere.
So you have, so you get this Morse handle body picture when you have this,
where attaching sphere are Ligendrian or in smaller dimension isotropic and
then this core of handles are Lagrangian disk or isotropic disk and the essence of this kind
of like Obama's theorem which I mentioned is that this, there is some kind of geometric shape
which allows you to surround, surround this table manifold by arbitrary close,
by arbitrary close pseudoconase hyper surface. So we have a kind of like better proof of this
in our book, this slide and so you see here, so the, as I said, pseudoconvexity means that there
exist positive, positive, positive curvature, mean curvature in complex direction and because it's
Lagrangian it's kind of totally real and in fact that's only what is important here,
it's totally real and therefore you have a lot of positive curvature for this small sphere
and here you can of course can have some negative curvature but this all this negative
curvature is compensated by this positive curvature and I think this is a little bit
similar to all this positive scalar curvature construction of Gromov and Lawson
that you can surround it and but the most subtle point is here because here when you need to
approximate you get a lot of negative curvature but turns out that kind of this is a kind of some
subtle inequality you have to solve differential but it turns out that you can kind of surround it
in such a way that to keep mean positive curvature here so that's how this theorem is proved together
with some H principle in terms of yeah so so the whole thing the whole this theorem says okay so
there exists this corresponding notion of like which we call Weinstein manifold and this
Weinstein manifold is pure symplectic creature and then you would like to reconstruct this
Weinstein manifold into Stein manifold and for this you need to solve this geometric surrounding lemma
and and that's what how you prove it but existence of and so this reduction working in dimension and
equal to or greater completely relevant but this there is a second step how to construct
the corresponding Weinstein manifold and then that's where there's all this rigidity in symplectic
rigidity in dimension to appear and disappear in high dimension
okay so that's essentially already said yeah so so now now there is a the following kind of observation
of Kai and myself which we wrote that turns out that if you try to construct for instance
rationally convex domain then the difference is just the following that in the
in the
in the Stein case the surrounding works if you attach totally real sub manifold a
long legend and some manifold and it's efficient this to have a totally real but if you want to get
the result you want to keep rational convexity then this handle need to be not just totally real
but like range if you if you can build your already for instance you have a you already
build some rationally rationally convex domain and you manage to you have some legend and you
manage to attach attach this disk necessary as a Lagrangian disk then you you can do the same
surrounding and the same surrounding turns out to preserve preserve rational convexity
this possibility of extending this killer form to see him as I told
Yasha Yasha you did not write Lagrangian in your in your proposition there yeah
if double is the rush
if totally real if Russian ah yeah so this is a yes yes yes this is Lagrangian yeah thank you very much
so it's amazing to somebody to see what I'm doing yes
okay so so so what did yes so so now now now the the whole question
how to work how to exploit this so then come all this domain of H principles
so if we have a if we have a
just so so suppose you just have a for instance domain domain in in cn and it has a
homotopy type of half dimensional complex and you want to make it into kind of Stein domain
it should be convex domain then what what what you need you just need to every disk
realize as a totally real disk with Legendrian boundary and then there is a kind of like standard
old Gromov principle about like some Legendrian submanifold some construction and and there is
again Gromov principle about totally real submanifold in totally real embedding
and using this you can construct this Stein domain but in order to construct this Lagrangian disk
this is extremely subtle because there is a it's completely non-true that for instance you have a
say you have plenty of examples that you have a Legendrian and you can attach totally real disk
but you but Lagrangian disk with this Legendrian boundary does not exist for instance if you take
a Legendrian and not and it but always bound this Lagrangian disk in a but in c2 in R4 such
Lagrangian disk does not exist because this would contradict so-called the Bennington inequality
but what turns out and this is again related to the theory of this loose Legendrian node
if Legendrian node is loose then what we proved with the Murphy then such Lagrangian disk then
there is a kind of H principle for for Lagrangian disk as well with this loose Legendrian boundary
and therefore because in dimension beginning from six you can kind of do this realization via
this flexible construction with this Legendrian attaching attaching spheres then you can
also realize construction of rationally convex domain and that's what we
yeah so so okay so so there's a claim is if if if if there is a
symplectic embedding of this domain then there is a rationally convex and what I said if w is
flexible then the symplectic embedding is automatically exist and therefore that's what
we proved with high therefore you can in dimension in dimension beginning from six there is no
constraint on realization of like other topological constraint besides this
homotopy type of half dimension to to construct rationally convex domain in dimension four
there are plenty of other constraints so yeah I just want to skip all this very fast because
I want to go to completely different subject so maybe maybe let me kind of formulate this
as a theorem and what I already formulated formulated that number one that in dimension
greater than two you have a kind of H principle for construction rationally convex domain and
polynomial convexity you see there is a the following obvious condition for polynomial
convexity namely n dimension homology should be trivial and also I can check this
torsion and minus one dimensional homology should be trivial and this is just because
by this characterization of ochre polynomial convexity means that possibility of extent
defining plural subarmonic function to aren and that means that if it's already have a non-trivial
n-dimensional homology then just by attaching only end demand handle of dimension of index
no more than n you cannot kill them and so this is a kind of it's easy to show that this condition
condition is necessary and what we prove that it's also sufficient
so what is kind of like interesting about this notion notion of polynomial convexity
that it's strangely there is a kind of enormous number of open problems in this area which kind
of sound a little bit a little bit as a they sound a little bit like
corresponding symplectic problem but kind of looks differently for instance suppose you have a ball
and there is a kind of like
symplectic question which started from Misha and then kind of it was a exploited load called
symplectic packing so you have some other balls symplectic balls and kind of you try to pack
symplectic by symplectic embedding there and there is a kind of very similar question of
polynomial convexity by polynomial convexity of configuration of balls so for instance if you
have a what you can prove that if you take a if you take a two balls that is very not so trivial but
easy to prove that it is a polynomial convex to prove it for three balls this is already already
hard but it's a kind of theorem of calling and for n balls it's completely an open question
and you can kind of ask how kind of like you take a take a for instance round ball
and you want to put kind of many other balls inside where when it's so how many balls you can
take there so they that's a polynomial convex okay
so maybe I already talked about flexible manifold so maybe let me kind of
I think I'll skip all this what I want to plan to talk about about Legendre notes about Legendre
and caps I think maybe it doesn't make sense maybe I only mentioned one thing that's this kind of
theorem so in dimension two so in dimension two in in dimension two there are plenty of constraints
so for instance already Kai mentioned that like you can prove that like you take a s2 cross d2
this you cannot realize it as a as a as a style manifold as a as a style domain so this is a
actually the in the proof is not trivial it's kind of like so to prove that s2 cross d2 cannot
be realized as a as a style domain it's relatively easy this kind of again follows from essentially
kind of Gromov theorem corresponding about r4 but like to prove that s2 cross r2 does not
admit Stein's structure requires cyberquit in Syria otherwise there is no other known proof so
but for for rational convexity also there are some kind of additional constraints for instance there is
a work of Nemirovsky-Zigl who completely classified what are this bundle over two dimensional surfaces
which could be realized as a rationally convex domain in s2 and so the answer is the following so
let's say d0 Kai e denotes the d2 bundle of oriental sources earlier than dc Kai and normal
earlier number e and the same is non-orientable case and this is the full classification so that's
the old domain which can can be embedded and what is interesting that in this list
there is a exactly two domain which are not which can be realized so most of the other domain can
which are not in this list cannot be realized even as a pseudo convex domain but there are exactly two
which can be realized as a pseudo convex domain but cannot be realized as a rationally convex
domain and this is a contingent bundle of Klein bottle and the the other one is a tubular neighborhood
of a projected plane with one singular point kind of called Whitney umbrella point
so what I what else now switch so how much time I have I have about 25 minutes or something like
this yes correctly okay so I would like to speak the the the all remaining time about
contact convexity to this contact convexity there was a some recent development about this by by
Honda onek and so and I was kind of like involved to try to understand what was going on and I still
not quite understand what was going on but but I think it's a pretty amazing story
so let me so so this will be like pure or simplistic journey or contact journey
it probably has some meaning complex geometric meaning again as I said this can be this contact
convexity can be interpreted as a symplectic convexity of corn and respect respectively
you can talk about pseudo convex commons you can consider like since you have a conical domain
and you want just to understand understand what pseudo convexity means for them so that's okay
but I will not go into this relations but but instead instead I kind of like just concentrate
so again original definition is that domain is contact domain is convex as we defined within
the our paper this is the growth that and the main is convex so you have a say contact manifold
of dimension 2 and plus one and in this contact manifold you have a some hyper surface to n
dimensional and this two dimensional hyper surface is a convex if it admits transverse
contact vector field so that mean the flow along this vector field preserve context
so then this condition is in fact can be like slightly restated in the following that
you can always find contact form so because there's a context structure there and you can in fact
find the local a long hyper surface or extendable to the whole space
contact contact contact vector field all always extendable because you can cut
every way extendable and it's not the same as the swivel to the structure no
it's not transverse to there yes it is of course there is a what is called if you have a contact
form there is a what is called rib vector field which is transverse kind of orthogonal to contact
structure and then it is of course contact but as you'll see contact could be tangent to contact
structure yeah so this condition that invariant just means that you can pick
always contact form which can be written as follows it's just some function on the surface
times like let's denote by t this is a flow coordinate along this vector field like transverse
coordinate and then lambda is again some some one form on sigma and x is again point on sigma
so you can always write a contact form locally in this form and there is a some set let's call it
maybe v inside sigma which is zero of this f and geometrically it's precisely mean where
our contact structure is tangent to to the d of d t direction to our contact vector field so and
this f of course divide this into part and what is kind of easy to check that the contact condition
means that that df is not zero along along along b which means that by implicit function theorem
that that this v is always regular submanifold and this regular submanifold so that mean and the
space of transverse contact vector field the the the is a convex space so the linear convex
linear combination of convex vector field and convex vector field so so therefore
this you can know it's contractible space and because it's always regular that means that
up to isotope up to isotope is this v is kind of unique it's called a jiru call it dividing set
so there is a following object always on on any on yeah and notice the another thing that
now you can away on on sigma minus v you can just divide our form alpha by f and then you get form
d t plus lambda over f and now contact condition for for this one just means that d lambda over f
d lambda over f is symplectic form so that means that dividing set
split our hypersurface into liuville manifold into symplectic manifold with fixed symplectic form
with fixed primitive and if you look at the vector field you can take a vector field
z which is kind of dual dual to this lambda lambda to this form lambda over f with respect to
sorry you you you take anyway you take a dual with respect to this symplectic form
vector field dual to lambda over f then turns out it says we get this liuville vector field and
what you get that this liuville you can check that this vector field automatically automatically
that belongs to what is called characteristic flowation on any on any hypersurface and contact
manifold there exists one dimension of flowation with singularity and you know you I think you
more familiar that you have a hypersurface in symplectic manifold then it has this kind of
Hamiltonian flow along this you can think about this as a level set of Hamiltonian and therefore
there is some one-dimensional flowation which is like kernel of symplectic form this hypersurface
but in terms of my conical interpretation if you take a any hypersurface and contact manifold
and consider characteristic flowation there then this characteristic flowation is also like
invariant with respect to scaling and therefore it projects to one-dimensional flowation on contact
manifold this singularity a singularity correspond to completely vertical fiber
and therefore you have a some singular flowation which is a kind of called characteristic flowation
and it turns out that this characteristic flowation is precisely directed by liuville field of this
and this dividing set dividing set turns out to transverse to characteristic flowation
so in other words we get the following picture so
so we get this our conical hypersurface has this dividing set
which is a co-dimension two contexts of manifold and it split the sigma into part one i call sigma
plus sigma minus which are liuville domain with this contact boundary so you have a two kind of like
in what we called in previous sense like the pseudo convex domain in complex case
we have this two liuville domain with pseudo convex boundary and the boundary has the same
contact structure so they do not fit to to symmetric manifold they're kind of like
they should be sold that they kind of come come to this boundary from the same side
yes it's any contact any convex hypersurface any any convex hypersurface in contact manifold
give you this so it's inherent in homogeneous read this special hypersurface
what you're saying so it's inherently non-homogeneous there is a distinguished hypersurface
why distinguished hypersurface no when you say read this hypersurface it's not unique or what
ah there's this v v is unique up to either so there's a characteristic flowation
and you can kind of move this by isotope it transfers to this relation but no more
yes give you some asymmetry so it's some some fundamental asymmetric concept
of this convexity why asymmetry what why because you know just because it is some direction it's not
just it's looks a little so you cannot be homogeneous right under some
so that it gives you cannot have contact group acting transitive on this hypersurface
it's different contactly different from point to point or what no but but of course of course
yeah sir can you have a contact it's a little bit paradoxical right usually convexity is
everywhere the same there is no preferred direction preferred nothing and here is some
preferred something
it's very counter-intuitive yes
okay let's see it can let me go a little bit further
but I can like maybe like partially will answer what you want okay so
so what
let's let's consider consider example of this so so so essentially like and and converse
is in fact also true if you take a if you take any two you will domain
with the same with the same uh contact boundary you take a two-level domain for instance the same
reveal domain and double it or any two other say differently we'll domain with the same contact
boundary and then you glue them together and then you can always find canonically
context structure on the neighborhood for which this is the convex hypersurface
so you will domain sometimes are Weinstein domains in particular have homotopy type of
half-dimensional things and in this case I will say that this is a Weinstein convex and in fact
in this case this convexity can be characterized Weinstein convexity in the following intrinsic
way you can say that this hypersurface as a Weinstein convex if characteristic relation
can be directed by vector field which is gradient like for some function you can find find some
function which is ripono function which is kind of such that characteristic relation is
transferred to its levels and plus one extra condition there is a this critical point they
are of two type there are positive point where orientation of contact plane canonical orientation
inside this orientation of hypersurface and negative and you and like you want to if you
are in this characteristic relation such that say positive point of minimum correspond to minimum
then some positive point minimum then you not allow kind of like what jiru called retrograt connection
gradient trajectory gradient trajectory connecting positive point with like in in wrong direction
with negative direction with negative point so okay so like prototypical example prototypical
example you take a round sphere in R3 and the characteristic relation kind of look like this
and of course it admits this kind of height function as our ripono function and of course
it admits kind of standard transverse contact vector field but for instance if you take a if
you take a torus if you take a torus with say contact structure dz plus r square d phi
and take some torus of radius r then this torus is kind of opposite to convex so characteristic
relation is just spiral and it's pretty obvious that you cannot find any dividing set here you
cannot find anything which would divide it into two halves kind of like but there exists the following
kind of interesting observations so let's take the torus and characteristic relation
is given by some monodromy some diffeomorphism of circle
and this is a in this particular example this is a diffeomorphism of rotation but suppose
I slightly perturbed I slightly perturbed this my diffeomorphism so instead of being kind of
rotation this is a graph of kind of my diffeomorphism I perturbed so it has a like
finitely many non-degenerate periodic orbit so so the characteristic relations are becoming
like this so you get some orbit which are attracting orbit and some orbit some repelling
orbit together this general picture and then in this case it becoming immediately convex
because this dividing set we can choose you can take for instance attracting orbit and surround them
well who is convex it's structure convex or hypersurface convex
hypersurface convex there's two dimensional torus there's two dimensional torus was not convex
but now this this torus after slight perturbation when the characteristic relation
becoming kind of general type like no no no have a kind of genetic in the in the sense that
this has a rational rotation number with isolated zeros then then you can okay
so and the theorem of jiru which he proved in in a that any two dimensional surface by
c infinity perturbation becoming convex this is the example of it so
so question what kind of what is the convexity in high dimension what it kind of like go beyond
dimension three so it is absolutely kind of like was up to this work of hondu huang essentially
nothing not pretty easy to prove that by see you can have example by c infinity perturbation
you cannot make it convex and even by c1 deformation you can make it you cannot make
it convex and what hondu huang proved that any hypersurface
any hypersurface in contact manifold any hypersurface in the contact manifold
any meaning closed any closed yes any closed any closed maybe
orientable orientable okay orientable hypersurface any closed orientable hypersurface
uh can be can be made can be can be made
contactly convex and even Weinstein convex kind of in stronger sense Weinstein convex
by a c0 isotope
so you can see you are approximated by convex domain so let me kind of tell you that this is a
kind of like absolutely fantastic claim let me so let me just
so in particular this is a corollary take any take any for manifold
take any for manifold m or signal still take any for manifold 10 then
it can be it can be presented
it can be presented as a union as a sigma equal sigma plus
union sigma minus where
where sigma sigma plus minus are like Stein domain if you wish or Weinstein domain Stein domain
with the same contact boundary
how much you limit this limit they sell the composition so I think just do do do
alternate the composition it's not possible for for arbitrary decomposition you take a
more functional device and to be less than more than one one half right so always the
compose manifold into such things which but which is Stein right but you cannot make
look at this yes but but you see like in dimension four especially in dimension four it's extremely
difficult it's not true that any like like two-dimensional type something is a Stein domain
like for instance as to cross the two I see and moreover you want them to make them Stein domain
with the same contact boundary I understand there is a following kind of phenomenon so
so there is this contact boundary and there is some kind of like rigidity that usually usually
first of all not every context three manifold admits like Stein feeling symplectic feeling
and if it's admit symplectic feeling it's kind of usually pretty unique so it's kind of not
not not kind of many such things exist of course
if you were from dimension four voice that very special what about next dimension
yeah I'll go to next one but let me first finish this one but but but but so so in particular
in in particular but what kind of importance that it's true in force so it kind of complete
each principle which it does not know anything special about dimension four okay and and so
so in particular what what what what follows follows that like you take a and moreover
you can put what follows from that that this decomposition as a kind of like as many such
decomposition as different context structure at least so in many cases there is an infinite
in many of such decomposition and so so in particular like you take a s4 so of course
you can present as four as a union of two poles this is it but can you invent any other and from
the theorem there exists it follows there exists a three I think infinitely many but at least three
more I can prove that exists and but I don't know any single example of this so how to do this
because it's a you need to find context manifold with two different feeling and the following
amazing property when then glue them together there's two different feeling they give you s4
okay so but but but but now but even kind of more surprising thing so what we kind of we
we ask one question but this is a soft proof right this is a complete proof it's a just a
H it's a completely it's like like explain the type type of truth okay and as a so it's kind of
twisted you create as much twisting to make it kind of as soft as you can but then you can't see
anything yes yes yes yes yes so can you estimate the number of cells
so the number some would be very big is there a priori bound
of number of which cells of the composition you have number of cells because you have two
standard manifold they have number of cells how much of each half yeah can you I I think
yeah I I cannot estimate but kind of the more number the more hard yes I understand
to make the composition of s4 into extremely complicated style manifold which give you it
will give it completely even more incredible if you can do that okay well I understand the more
I do the the better approximation than we have but just I want the how is the metaphoric
anyways the proof I'll just tell you proof of course not proof but kind of like some
idea of this complexity maybe in interesting invariant by how much you can how complicated
should be yeah so so okay yeah so the proof kind of like the what they do is is what never
work in simplex geometry there's something which kind of like in all other situation what people
do that it's always fail but extremely strangely it works so okay so we start with characteristic
relation and what was here's the idea and then I even say something even more strange but
so the stat characteristic relation which kind of very complicated for instance you or maybe you
start with characteristic relation for this one you take a say take a three crosses one
with this kind of standard the characteristic relation which is just the spiral over whole
vibration and you want to you want to make it into convex so what you do with all what always
people in the dynamical system do they install plugs they put some kind of small cut and now I
want to have a some C0 deformation of the small piece to create some critical point inside and
to have this property that somehow I arranged that all trajectory are being attracted by some of this
critical point and so what you arrange that every trajectory you create so many critical point
that all trajectory are originate and end at some critical points so none one escape so again I repeat
that it's expected geometry usually when you do this some trajectory always escape but they manage
that they not escape and therefore then after that it's already easy to construct after some
perturbations small perturbations the infinity to construct the Lybunov function yes but what is
even more amazing the what we proved that is back in their construction so and so we do that
and you get this kind of like so this the compositions that dividing set kind of each
construct kind of fantastically complicated that's like almost piano curve on your on your
manifold but then what we what we proved that in fact what when you constructed it you can take
this all this critical point you created in pairs and you can cancel them without touching the
dividing set so that means that all this creation of critical point was completely unnecessary
what we did is just the following thing we make the cut and we just re-glued we have one very
particular you can write an explicit formula contactomorphism of of a transverse ball and you
just re-glued your characteristic relation inside the ball using this contactomorphism which is
identity on the boundary and you do it on many many kind of small transverse balls
and after that after that you you get convexity in particular in this case of a three crosses one
again the convex hyper surface convex decomposition is again some monodromy
affiliation is just given by monodromy of contactomorphism of a three so that means
there is some kind of strange theory of convex contactomorphism of of a three for instance
some of those whose suspension give you convex surface so in dimension one this is a precisely
diffeomorph with a circle generic diffeomorphism is rational rotation number what this in dimension
three i have no idea so i think my time expires sorry i stop here
