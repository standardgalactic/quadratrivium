Checking Yegor Bryukhov/Vaughan Pratt's talk at The Constructive in Logic and Applications 2012.txt
 The discussion revolved around the foundational concepts in mathematics and how different mathematical structures relate to each other. Arthur Hades, a mathematician known for his unconventional approach to teaching and his insights into the structure of mathematics, was referenced as someone who advised against delving into certain areas of math due to their complexity, yet his own work simplified these concepts significantly.

The conversation touched upon the hierarchy of mathematical structures, including but not limited to:

1. **Groups**: A fundamental structure in algebra, consisting of a set with a single operation that combines any two elements to produce another element in the set, under certain conditions.

2. **Billion groups**: An extension or generalization of groups that includes additional structures and operations, which are more complex and less commonly studied.

3. **Rings**: A algebraic structure with a similar composition operation as groups but with two operations: addition and multiplication, and they don't necessarily distribute over each other in the usual way.

4. **Boolean algebras**: A mathematical structure that can be seen as a simplification of rings, particularly when considering set theory.

5. **Sets**: The most basic structure, which can be thought of as collections of objects. In the context of groups, sets are defined as geodesic spaces satisfying a certain property (x, y = x).

6. **Category theory**: A branch of mathematics that provides a unifying framework for understanding and comparing different kinds of mathematical structures.

7. **Ring theory**: The study of rings, which can be seen as generalizations of more concrete algebraic structures like groups and sets.

8. **Abelianization**: The process of turning a group into an abelian (commutative) group by considering equivalence classes of elements under the group operation.

9. **Opposite category**: A construction in category theory that reverses the arrows of all the morphisms in a given category, effectively changing the direction of the relationships between objects.

The discussion also highlighted the importance of intuition and understanding these foundational concepts to appreciate the broader landscape of mathematics. Arthur Hades' approach to simplifying complex mathematical structures is presented as an example of how one might improve upon existing knowledge over time.

Finally, the question was raised whether this talk could be seen as a special case of categorizing mathematical subjects, to which the answer was affirmativeâ€”it is indeed an attempt to organize and understand the vast array of mathematical concepts in a more coherent and accessible manner.
