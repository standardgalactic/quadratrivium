1. **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**: These are statistical models that describe a system with unobserved ("hidden") states, observed outputs, and transitions between states that influence the outputs.

2. **Component Parts of HMMs**:
   - **Transition Probabilities**: The likelihood of transitioning from one state to another at each time step.
   - **Emission Probabilities**: The probability of observing an output given a particular state.

3. **Forward-Backward Inference**: A technique used to calculate the posterior probabilities of states at each time step, given the observed outputs. This is part of the E-step in the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for HMMs.

4. **Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm**: An iterative method for finding maximum likelihood estimation for parameters in statistical models where some data are missing. The Baum-Welch algorithm is a specific application of EM to train HMMs.

5. **Baum-Welch Algorithm**: A specialized version of the EM algorithm tailored for training HMMs, which includes:
   - **E-step**: Computes the expected values of the hidden states using forward-backward inference.
   - **M-step**: Updates the model parameters (transition probabilities, emission probabilities) to maximize the expected log likelihood of the observed data. This is typically done by setting the derivatives of the expected log likelihood with respect to the parameters to zero and solving for those parameters.

6. **Learning Parameters in HMMs**: The model parameters are estimated by iterating over the E-step and M-step until convergence is achieved or a set number of iterations has been reached.
   - **Initialization**: Can be done randomly, using expert knowledge, or based on simpler models.
   - **Updating Parameters**: Typically involves setting derivatives to zero and solving for the parameters (e.g., transition probabilities, emission probabilities, initial state probabilities).
   - **Termination**: Convergence is determined either by the change in log likelihood between iterations falling below a threshold or after a fixed number of iterations.

In summary, HMMs are used to model systems with hidden states and observed outputs, and the Baum-Welch algorithm provides a method for learning the parameters of an HMM from data using the EM framework. The forward-backward algorithm is central to this process, as it allows us to compute expectations of hidden states that are necessary for updating the model parameters in the M-step.
