 It seems like you're referencing a complex and multilingual set of ideas, potentially related to data analysis, societal issues, journalism, and political processes. Here's an attempt to summarize the key points from the text you provided:

1. The discussion starts with a reference to a "big temperature" and a "Khaj-Away" moment, which might imply a shift towards a more serious or critical analysis.

2. There is mention of deploying resources for research using specific versions (like f2.00 4.00) and the absence of advanced tools like computers or large datasets.

3. The text touches upon the importance of understanding climate systems and the societal implications of data division regarding words.

4. Journalism, particularly focusing on time and societal changes, is highlighted as an area of interest. There's a nod to Ricardo Marcan's work in this context.

5. The text delves into a discussion about the representation of different regions and voices, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity.

6. A mention of "Shoko kì Par easternima" suggests a connection to Eastern philosophies or cultural references.

7. The text contrasts the need for humility and acknowledgment that no one has all the answers, with the assertion that "Tres is ama transforms, Not a punctuon." This could imply a deeper understanding of transformation processes.

8. There's a reference to a geopolitical situation involving a peninsula and a crane pizza, which might be a metaphor for a specific regional issue.

9. The text discusses personal dissatisfaction and the heating up of emotions in a political context, leading to elections. It notes the challenge of deciding what to vote for without consensus.

10. Finally, there's an emphasis on the uncertainty of predicting future events, as seen in the Seoul elections, which remains an "unkNOW" to illustrate unpredictability.

The text is rich with references and ideas that seem to be building towards a discussion about the interplay between data analysis, societal change, and political decision-making processes. It's a complex narrative that combines various elements in a way that might require further context or clarification to fully understand.
