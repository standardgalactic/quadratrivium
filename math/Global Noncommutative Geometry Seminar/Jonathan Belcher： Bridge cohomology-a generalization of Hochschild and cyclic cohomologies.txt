Welcome everyone to our seminar today.
So our speaker is Jonathan Belker
from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
So John will tell us about the bridge cohomology
or generalization of Hawkshaw and the second cohomology.
So please.
So thank you guys for inviting me to this.
I was taking it back for just a second when I first joined,
I guess, how animals felt like I may have made it too easily
because I'm starting off very general.
And after seeing some of the audience,
we got, of course, everyone's quite familiar
with the Hawkshield encyclical cohomology,
but it looks like we had a few graduate students to find.
So I kind of geared the first half of this talk
as an introduction of why we should care about
Hawkshield encyclical cohomology.
Most of you are likely to recognize
at least one of the strengths.
So I want to start off,
we start off with the Durham Homology.
So we let them be a compact manifold without boundary,
and we look at the space of K currents,
which consists of all linear continuous functionals
on the Durham complex.
So for any currents and any K form,
we denote the pairing in the usual way,
and we often denote it as an integral.
So an integral over this current
or under this current of the K form.
And so, of course, we get a complex out of this
with the differential essentially dual
to the exterior derivative differential on this complex.
So one sort of special case of currents
that we like to look at is for any K form,
excuse me, for any N minus K form,
we get a current, a K current,
where we can simply integrate over the entire manifold
just essentially integrating against the form
that we want to define this current by.
So we just take a wedge product
between any differential form
and our sort of defining form for this current.
And in particular, if we start with a closed form,
then the current itself is closed.
And so what we want to do is,
well, maybe generalize this,
if we're looking at instead of smooth functions
on a manifold, in non-commutative terms,
we really like to think of any algebra,
any non-commutative algebra as some sort of geometric object
or some sort of ring of functions
or an algebra of functions
on some sort of non-commutative manifold.
So to generalize this,
we take a look at just by noticing that any K current
defines a K plus one multilinear functional,
simply by defining its action on the functional
via the standard integral.
And so what we do with Hoke-Shield Co-Homology
is start by looking at these modules,
these modules of multilinear functionals
and then try to add some structure
to recover this geometric structure
of the ROM currents and the ROM forms, differential forms.
So we have our standard complexes.
So our Hoke-Shield and Bar complexes
are given by the forms of multilinear functionals
on an algebra A.
And we have our boundary maps given by this formula.
So our B prime, we just sort of collapse consecutive terms
and add the alternating sum.
And then we have the Hoke-Shield differential B
where we also add this wrap around term.
Sorry, let me get my phone out
just so I can keep track of time here.
So for any algebra A, not necessarily,
you know we have the Bar Co-Homology,
which is just gonna be the homology of the Bar complex.
So the one with the B prime differential.
And then our Hoke-Shield Co-Homology
is the Co-Homology of the complex with the B differential.
We have chain maps between these two complexes.
One minus lambda is the cyclic operator essentially
that's gonna take us from our Hoke-Shield complex
to our Bar complex.
And then we have this normalization operator
back from the Bar complex to our Hoke-Shield complex.
And this lambda map is the cyclic operator.
So it just permutes all the inputs in a cyclic way.
And of course with a minus sign to denote the sign
depending on the degree that we're in.
Normalization operator, we're essentially just summing up
all cyclic permutations for whatever degree.
And nicely enough, so when our ground ring
of our algebra contains Q,
that the sequence between these complexes
is consecutive one minus lambda to N
and jumping back and forth between the Hoke-Shield
and Bar complexes, it's contractible.
So this is gonna play a bit of a role later on
with some of the generalizations we come up with.
So denoting the contracting homotopies,
H-E is gonna be our even complex.
So we kind of think of the CN starting in degree zero,
degree one, degree two, at least horizontal degrees.
And so our E's are gonna be our evens
from the Hoke-Shield complex to the Bar complex.
Our odds, our H-O is going to be from the Bar complex
back to the Hoke-Shield complex.
And essentially a polynomial in lambda
that gives us a nice contracting homotopy.
So getting into cyclic homology,
we define the con complex as given as the kernel
of one minus lambda.
So of course we have one minus lambda mapping
from our Hoke-Shield to our Bar complex.
And so since this is the cyclic operator,
it permutes things just by one cycle.
If we're looking at the kernel of that,
it's essentially going to give us
the set of multilinear functionals
that are invariant under that operator.
In other words, whose cyclic permutations
don't affect the value of that functional.
And we define the cyclic homology
as the homology of that complex.
Another way we can construct the cyclic complexes
through the cyclic by complex.
Oh, looks like I've got a superscript there accidentally.
So it's just CCA and essentially what we're doing
is just looking at this alternating, sorry that.
Q that should be in there.
It's a cool by complex out of that.
And then the co-homology of the total complex
also computes the whole complex.
Also computes the cyclic complex.
So let me know if I start cutting out
or sound a little robotic.
I'm getting some signs on my end
that the internet's a little unstable.
Unfortunately, I think this past week or so,
the internet's been a little shaky.
It's been moving weeks.
So there's a bunch more people coming back to the city.
And I think the internet load is getting a lot higher.
So let me know if I need to stop or pause or repeat anything.
And hopefully I'll maintain connection.
Hopefully I won't drop or anything like that.
So we've got a long exact sequence
that relates cyclic co-homology and Hochschild co-homology
given by the Geisen Con sequence.
And it's given by essentially these maps.
We'll define these maps a little more rigorously later.
Just kind of know for the moment
that this is fairly important sequence.
It is in some sense kind of like a myerbid torus sequence
for Hochschild and cyclic co-homology.
And it gives us a lot of computational tools.
So I is induced by the inclusion.
This B is given as follows and S one minus lambda.
S didn't mention, but it's just a degree one
sort of contraction essentially or not a contraction,
but you take a cyclic functional
and essentially you just stick a one in
for the first argument.
And so it'll drop it down to an N minus one functional.
And then this capital S is induced by the cup product.
This is Khan's periodicity map.
And we'll talk about this a little bit later
because part of this project and part of generalizing
what my initial constructions were for my PhD thesis.
I've been generalized a little bit to triangular categories,
triangulated categories.
And we needed to redefine ass
was kind of a big piece of this.
So some of the geometric results.
So why do we care about Hochschild and cyclic co-homology?
We started with our example of currents.
And so we essentially get exactly what we want.
So if we actually have our algebra
be our algebra of smooth functions,
which we'll get to in a second, we get what we want.
So kind of before that in non-communitive terms
when we develop this notion of currents,
we call them cycles really.
It is just a close graded trace on the universal algebra.
And so the following are equivalent.
This is a result like Khan.
For any n plus one multilinear functional,
then we can define it as,
there's an n dimensional cycle on the algebra,
on the universal algebra from A, excuse me,
define as follows.
And of course, we can also exist close graded trace
on the universal algebra of forms on A
that coincides with this multilinear functional.
And of course, the key result here is that
the multilinear functional is a cycle
under our boundary operator, under our Hochschild
boundary operator, and it is cyclic.
So it vanishes under the cyclic operator.
And if our algebra is an algebra of smooth functions
on a manifold, we recover this notion of a
of Diron currents of our Hochschild,
or excuse me, our Diron homology.
So for any, let me see where I'm at.
So for any multilinear functional,
we can essentially define the current in the canonical way
and the pairing between them matches up with
with what we want in our Hochschild homology.
Likewise, the boundary operator on our Diron currents
coincides with the differential.
So this, that the guys in consequences is an exact couple.
And if you look at the differential induced
of that exact couple, it's I compose B.
So that differential corresponds
with the Diron boundary differential.
And likewise, in our cyclic homology,
we essentially get the k-th cyclic homology
is close to the Diron homology.
We have sort of the kernel of the boundary operator.
And then we have these sort of two periodic
lower degree terms of Diron homology on the manifold.
Other things we get, so we have pairings
between the k3, the k0 and k1 groups of the algebra
with the even cyclic homology
and the on cyclic homology respectively.
And this is done through the churn characters,
which we haven't worked out yet
for what we're doing in bridge homology,
but I think we're on very much the right track.
And I'll explain a bit more about that at the end.
So the churn characters, of course,
from k3 usually land in Diron homology, Diron homology.
And so they should naturally pair with this guy.
If we want to think of this as then hook shield homology,
in terms of Diron co-homology of how those kind of line up,
we should get like a natural pairing on the algebras.
It's kind of how you want to think about that.
So of course, what we want to do,
the original motivating question for our constructions are,
well, we want to be able to apply these results
to a manifold with boundary,
especially in terms of these integrals, right?
Because a big part of these integral constructions
and these maps that we get from hook shield and cyclic homology
rely heavily on Stokes theorem, as we kind of see here.
So if we have a manifold of dimension m
and an n minus k current,
or an n minus k current that we define a form,
or excuse me, a current half of,
then it's not necessarily closed if we have a boundary.
And just doing a basic computation,
using Stokes theorem to kind of shuffle around the differential,
or excuse me, using integration by parts
to shuffle around the differential,
and then Stokes theorem here
to kind of change the derivative there.
And what we see is that we're kind of left
with something that looks like a current
or a graded trace on the boundary.
And then likewise, if we're talking about this
in non-commutative terms,
then what this means is that the closed graded trace
defined by this n minus k form
ends up not being quite cyclic.
So let me know if any of that was too fast
if you guys can kind of see the steps.
I know some of the algebra gets a little technical to look at.
And so what we see that is we lose this notion of cyclicity
when we don't have an empty boundary.
And so if we kind of think of this functional itself,
this trace on the boundary itself as a functional,
then really what we arrive at is,
well, if we have a boundary on our manifold
in terms of Hokeshield and cyclic homology,
we're looking at a class of Hokeshield functionals
that don't vanish under this cyclic operator,
but they sort of descend to another functional on the boundary.
So in non-commutative terms,
we can kind of generalize this
that this is exactly what we're looking for.
If we have two algebras of functions
where we want to think of one algebra
as just the algebra of smooth functions
and then the other algebra is like the algebra
of perhaps Whitney functions on the manifold,
there's a surjective map between the two of them.
And really what we're looking for now
is a class of Hokeshield functionals
that we're looking for.
So this is a class of Hokeshield functionals
that sort of descend to this other algebra
so that one minus lambda is a pullback of another form
or another functional.
And so this is how we define our constructions this way.
We can actually sort of realize
that this concept as a pullback
of Hokeshield complex is in that we've introduced.
So we define this bridge complex as a pullback
of the given diagram.
So of course we have our Hokeshield complex
and the one minus lambda map to the bar complex.
And then we can also include the bar complex on B
into the bar complex on A.
And so the pullback, of course, naturally then define
sort of a pair of functional
such that one minus lambda phi, the pullback of psi.
We get a nice differential out of that.
And then if we have the surjective map
between the algebras, then the pullback is an objective.
And so we don't necessarily need this sort of lower coordinate
to keep track of since it's going to be
uniquely determined.
But we want to generalize this eventually.
So we will try to generalize it to a case
where we don't necessarily have a surjective map
between algebras.
Some basic constructions before that, though,
we've got a category.
So we can essentially define as 1k
as surjective unical k-algebra homomorphism.
So of course we take surjective map between algebras
A to B and a surjective map between algebras X and Y
and what is the map between them?
Well, it's just going to be a pair of maps
that makes the diagram commute.
So formulating this in the category
or formulating this category gives us a way
of formulating bridge co-homology as a functor.
So that way we can extend this to non-unit algebras.
So we do have a monoidal category
and of course our unit is just the identity
on the ground ring and we have the canonical inclusion.
So our objects now we're looking at maps between algebras
is what we're defining as our objects
and we're starting off in the unital case
so unital maps between algebras.
So just a special note is that, well,
if we actually look at sort of our degenerate cases
of these maps between algebras,
the identity on any algebra,
well, the bridge co-homology as it's defined
simply recovers our hoaxial co-homology
or hoaxial complex
and the bridge complex on the zero algebra
then sort of descends to our cyclic complex.
So this is kind of where the bridge comes in
and this bridge co-homology,
it sits sort of in between these hoaxial complexes
and cyclic complexes
and if we have some sort of ascending chain of ideals
of our algebra
then we essentially kind of get this stepwise bridge
based off of our bridge functor.
So this construction was kind of along the lines,
it generalized this con complex
where we're looking at, in some sense,
one minus lambda acting on cyclic functional.
Another way we can construct this
is if we look at that full by complex,
the cc complex that we introduced,
we can also define our bridge complex.
Oh, so I guess before that,
one more thing before that is,
to extend this to nonunital algebras,
we do this in the natural way,
since we have it defined as a functor
from a unital category,
how do we define it on a nonunital category?
Well, we just simply adjoin a unit to the algebras
and we'll get a canonical morphism based off of that
and then we simply look at the kernel
into the unital object in that category.
So to define this as like a full cyclic by complex,
so of course we need to introduce a little bit
of the relative Hokeshield complex
and relative cohomology.
And that's done in the usual way
where we simply look,
we have a surjective map between algebras A to A mod I
and of course we denote C of A comma I
as the relative complex of those two
and of course the cohomology of that
is the Hokeshield cohomology.
And so the by complex,
we essentially do the same thing that we did
with the cyclic by complex
of alternating these 1 minus lambda and n
except in the first degree instead of
keeping the chain complexes in A,
we just send to the relative complexes
and this will give us a bridge by complex.
The total cohomology of this,
it computes the same thing essentially
and we can show that
when our ground ring contains Q,
that the total complex of this by complex
computes the same thing as our previous construction.
So this one's a little bit more general.
It applies more often
when we're working in different ground rings
and we don't have Q in our ground ring.
So it looks like this,
excuse me, I keep naming that as Q
or yeah, this label as Q should be an N there.
I need to fix some of these
but those will be the same.
So what we want to do actually now
is generalize these constructions a little bit.
These work very well for our initial computations
but if we want to apply it
to a non-surjective map between algebras,
then things become a little tricky
and a lot of the computational tools
like these guys and con sequences
that we want to come up with
take a little bit of work
kind of chugging through some of these complexes
and actually I left out a slide on this complex.
So this works primarily for unital algebras.
There are notions of reduced and normalized complexes
which get really complicated.
These help us recover the comology
or the correct complexes
that will give us the comology
when an algebra is non-unital.
So we kind of gave the factorial construction
if we wanted the actual complexes
that will help us compute that.
We can do sort of following the work of Lode
and all the constructions
that people have come up with previously
but it results in essentially extending each column
into a bi-complex itself.
So you get these really big,
kind of nasty looking tricomplexes
and it gets really technical and hard to compute.
So one of the things we can take advantage of
is the natural setting for a lot of this
is into a setting of triangulated categories
especially since we're looking at maps between algebras
well that gives us natural maps between complexes
and if we're just looking at a natural map
between complexes,
easy questions to ask are
how does the cone construction
start to come into play?
So we kind of naturally start to sit in these
triangulated categories
and one of the problems we ran into
is that sort of reconciling these complexes
and making sure that
they all are computing the same thing.
Some of the tools we used to do that
are a little difficult.
So I was mentioning earlier
that this cons periodicity map
it's induced by a cup product
which is rather difficult to compute.
So what it's done is that the Hoekschild
cohomology of the ground ring
has essentially one generator
and it's essentially just a form that acts
that gives one on the identity of the algebra
and it's when we compute the cup product
that's induced from the wedge product
on differential forms
on the universal space of differential forms
and computing that gets really technical.
So you're essentially just
you kind of create a bunch of permutations
then you have to project onto the right spaces
and then recover these functionals
like if I'm mapping an n functional
to an n plus one functional
it gets really technical to compute.
But if we actually look at those full bi complexes
the periodicity map is actually really easy
it's just a shift.
So since the columns were too periodic
we can essentially just take the bi complex
shift it over by two and then include it back into itself
and this induces the same map
on cohomology.
So we kind of want to work with this kind of map
since it's much more
it's a little easier to work with
just these chain complexes
without having to appeal
to the universal differential forms
and sort of chugging through
all of those computations.
So the idea is
for any cyclic element
we want to
really what we want to do is come up with a map
of degree minus one minus one.
So let me jump ahead just one slide
and make sure for this.
I'm trying to scroll down but
looks like most of that's on there.
So our cyclic elements naturally sit in our
Hokeshield complex
and if it's well known that the periodicity map
at least on cycles
so if it was a cyclic cycle
cyclic Hokeshield cycle it means it's
boundary is zero
and of course it's going to vanish under one minus
lambda.
What we can do
for the periodicity map
is usually we pull it back one
by the
inverse
or by the homotopy inverse
I guess I should say
since the one minus lambda n sequence
is contractable
then we hit it with a boundary
then we pull it back again
with that contracting homotopy
and hit it with the opposite boundary
so that's fairly well known
but it only works on cycles
it really only works on
cycles
when it vanishes under the boundary
and if we want to extend it
into triangulated categories
we really need a map that's well defined
on all cyclic cycles
so the idea is to just well
take a look at the other path
to get us to where we need to go
and essentially sum these two paths
so of course
starting with a cyclic chain
because it vanishes
here we can pull it back
we can contract the homotopy
we can also hit it with a boundary
and then
hit it with a boundary and pull it back there
take the sum
and that's kind of the first step here
and then from that point
we essentially do the same thing
and the key thing
was recognizing that
when we do take that sum
that element we end up with here
now vanishes
when I move it forward
end map
and so because that vanishes as a sum
we can apply the
contracting homotopy
and pull it back
as well as split it and hit it with a boundary
and do the same thing
and so what we end up with
is a very nice formulation of this
periodicity map that actually works well
on these
con complexes
so everyone see that
let me know if I go too fast
or if it gets a little too technical
so of course
the subscripts and superscripts
are a little cluttered there
just a quick check of
what I do with that
is a cyclic element
it's a cyclic operator
it's zero so it does take cyclic elements
two cyclic elements
as we want
so really what's going on here
if we sort of define these contracting homotopies
as like their inverses
so this HE it's really like an inverse
and then on the odd columns
it's really like one minus lambda inverse
oops sorry I clicked there
then
the B map
that we had
we often define this B inverse
as
this guy here
so normally B inverse
was defined as
the map that goes
back one
up one and then back one
which is well defined on
cycles
when they vanish under the
differential
but if it's not
a cycle
then we again have to take a sum in this first
box and then we just pull it back
to this position here
so that's what I'm defining
as my B inverse
and under that construction
we kind of have a nice very nice simplification
of this periodicity map
sorry I keep clicking
where I want to point out
just from teaching this somewhere
I want to
how I taught my summer classes
I used to click and drag a lot
to kind of highlight the things I was doing
it doesn't work well in a presentation
so on
on Hoekschild cycles
on Hoekschild or excuse me
cyclical homology
this is kind of our traditional
formulation of periodicity map
and we can now
it's kind of a nice just
a formulating that and it'll work
now on the chain
level of change without having to appeal
to cycles in the homology
so how do we define bridge complexes
now with this language of
triangulated categories
we take a look at the mapping cones that arise
so of course we have a
homomorphism between algebra
not necessarily surjective
we do want to start off with
k containing q
and then now we can
compute the mapping cone
of the combination of the inclusion
and this periodicity map
it's a little more
precisely we have a mapping cone
here
and then
standard mapping cones construction
gives us this guy as our differential
and of course you got to pay attention
because this is a minus two
standard mapping cone adds one
but it's still one less than the A
degrees
and computing the
co-homology of this gives us our bridge
co-homology
which takes some work
we'll kind of state the proof of this
here in a second at the end of this
because we have a lot more constructions to come up with
our alternative
construction so if we wanted to do that
essentially same mapping cone
construction now on the cyclic
by complexes
so I denote this just
toad B and toad A this is the total
complex of the cc complex
so this is toad cc of B
just to save myself a little writing there
so if we take the full cyclic by complexes
compute the total complex of those
we again get a
periodicity map
which I denote as st
and again if we just compute the mapping cone
of the inclusion
of our B algebra into our A
algebra
along with the periodicity map
we again get
bridge complex
so those two everyone should kind of
recognize should be isomorphic
this one's not a pretty difficult one
since we know that the cyclic complexes
and the total complexes
of the cyclic by complexes
are quasi isomorphic
this sort of
less side of the diagram was pretty easy
and it was really dependent
on this S map redefining this
S map really helped us
prove that
that less side of the box commutes
and then getting
inducing the map on
the mapping cones
was much more straightforward
and so of course
that follows directly from the
five lemma that this IMA
is going to be
a quasi isomorphism
let's see
hang on I think I might have skipped one little thing
of course the other thing we could have done
so we could have started with these
CC complexes
compute the mapping cone of the inclusion
first so
the inclusion by a shift of two is essentially
the periodicity operator
compute the mapping cone first
then compute the total complex
then compute the co-homology
so these mapping cones
and these mapping cone
I guess you can call it functor
and these total complex functor kind of commute
that just helps us kind of show
that all of these complexes are quasi isomorphic
so if you take a look at those
two constructions from the full cyclic
by complexes
they essentially give you the same complex
just up to a permutation
you have to permute the
permute the columns of everything
and it'll work out
so those three pretty clear
to be quasi isomorphic
and then the first half we essentially
show that these two were quasi isomorphic
this so kind of ignore the RB
the RB is
what we would have to do to our
bridge complex
the first bridge complex I constructed
by the pullback if we wanted to generalize it
to non-unitural algebras
we essentially just have to add an extra column
to these complexes
which is essentially what that two stands for
so this sort of two column
by complex
and we show those two are
quasi isomorphic
there's just kind of one complex in between
that we use by taking the kernel
of like the first couple rows
that maps
into both of those complex very easily
and you can show that all of those are
quasi isomorphic
so
so
these are the guys in consequences
the first one's very easy
if we simply just take
our construction
so let me jump back a little bit
if we look at
sort of the stop line or even this line
well what's going to happen when we take
co-homology I should have this sequence
of s i's our inclusion
this projection ends up being
our B map
and so
the middle one is of course
our bridge complex
and so we nicely get
that sequence
two and three actually follow from
the octahedral axiom
so in triangulated categories this is
essentially the octahedral axiom
it says that if we have
two triangles so x y
to z prime
and essentially a triangle like
y to g or y to z
to y prime
then we can
construct this diagram
and it essentially tells
us that well this triangle is
distinguished this triangle is
distinguished and this triangle is
distinguished and because of that
this column here
actually ends up being this bottom row
also ends up being
a distinguished triangle
so let me see so it looks like
we've got some time here
maybe I can kind of just briefly
write out
how we can get those
other two
guys in con sequences
so if we
let me change my screen
here
there we go so you guys
can all see my paper here
so we essentially start off
with our I'll just do this with our
cyclic con complex
and of course we have our map
as our inclusion
into
our cyclic complex
with A
and we take our mapping cone
on that guy
to get a distinguished triangle
sorry for running out of space
here on the right
see is that focused as well
let me pin my video up
so that's our first distinguished triangle
and then the second one
see lambda B
minus 2
we essentially want to use
the periodicity map
because we're looking at
the composition
of our inclusion and then the
periodicity map
on A
so this gives us
our
actually I will write it as
a little more properly
because these two maps
the inclusion and the periodicity map
they commute so I can either do
inclusion first periodicity map on A
or the other sequence
which I'll kind of just leave
the construction up to you guys
follows essentially the same line
of switching which order we do
so if you replace this guy
and do the periodicity map on B first
then include it to A
do the same process
and via the octahedral axiom
a nice new
exact triangle
and then a guys in con sequence
so what do we get
we get our mapping cone here
of S sigma
and then
we've got to fill in the rest of the triangle here
the rest of the diagram
so this guy here
actually I will write as
C lambda A
the image
of C lambda A
of course the degrees
sorry minus two
let's see I'm running out of space
C lambda A
of course this is why it chose to give a slide talk
drawing diagrams
is not very time efficient
with the number of diagrams
you get in Hope Shield to click homology
okay so then the bottom row
is essentially just
this third column here
of our mapping cones
this is
let's see what is this guy
this is yeah
then M sigma
minus one
then
yeah
let's see did I do that right
or did I mess it up
so we've got C lambda into that guy
into MS
ah no sorry
that one should have been
C lambda A mod
S of C lambda A again
and then the mapping cone
up one degree so minus one
for that mapping cone there
and so
this bottom try or bottom
bottom
triangle is a distinguished triangle
and then so of course taking
homology on this gives us
this
remaining sequence
so of course this guy if we
compute homology this middle one gives us
our
bridge co-homology this guy
following by the
standard SBI sequence is actually going to be
quasi isomorphic to
just the
hoaxial co-homology on A
and then this guy here is actually
the relative
co-homology and actually I'm going to write it
as HHAB kind of
a different notation for relative co-homology
it's a little bit more general because
when we have a non-surjective map
from A to B
creating that mapping cone is
essentially the relative
co-homology but it's
a bit more general
and then of course this is going to repeat
so going back to that
we get this sequence here
so
we can do the same thing
as I was kind of mentioning
draw out your diagrams
and switch the maps
so map in the top left you would map
B to B to its left
and then go down with your inclusion into
A then you would get this third sequence
fourth sequence is a little bit trickier
fourth sequence we don't get
as freely as nicely
with this language of triangulated categories
but it's not too difficult
let's see I think I gave kind of a basic proof
here yeah so here's GC1, GC2
and GC3
those were the
essentially the exact couple
that I just sort of induced there
GC4 we essentially take these mapping
cones on the bi complexes
and then if we actually look
at the exact sequence
so take the co-kernel
of the S map
it's only a complex
I don't think I gave it
it's a complex of degree 2
but when you look at the
co-omology of this complex
excuse me a two column bi complex
it nicely gives us this
fourth sequence
the fourth sequence is actually
probably the nicest just because
it gives us the periodicity map
on our bridge co-omology
and it relates it to
a direct sum
this is an easy complex to compute
and work with of our
Hokeshield co-omology of A
and our Hokeshield co-omology of B
and then let's see
so we've got all our guys in con sequences
the other things we get are
is this notion of excision
we wanted to work with
so we needed a notion of exact sequences
remember our category is this category of
unidol algebra morphisms
or even just algebra morphisms
and maps between them
are these maps
pair of maps that make commutative diagrams
gives us a notion
of a relative bridge complex
in the standard way
and so what does excision tell
us
so I just
realized the
some reason that's not going in the
presentation but I think it's
alright
so
we develop a notion of
an exact sequence
we need certain notions of copurity
which are essentially dual to these notions
of purity
that are needed
for the
theorems of excision in Hokeshield co-omology
Hokeshield homology
given any much minor algebraic conditions
then the natural map
between the relative
complex
to the
complex of what would be
the
kernel map
in quasi-isomorphism
if and only if
the kernel algebra
so to speak
are h-unidol
or in this case co-h-unidol
for the co-complexes
the
geometry
now
the homology
I should say
with this sort of two-periodic
the ROM homology and then possibly some cycles
in the highest degree
so we want our algebra
functions
to be
we want to start off essentially with our
smooth functions on a manifold
and then the best place to look
functions that vanish on the boundary
but we want to look at the Whitney functions
so we mon out by functions
that are smoothly vanishing
on the boundaries so functions that vanish
of all orders
of derivatives vanish on the boundary
to give us our class of Whitney functions
and when that's our algebraic setup
of course our sigma is a surjective
unidol-algebra homomorphism
and the bridge complex
recovers what we want
gives us a new theory
of relating this
to the
the ROM homology
the inverse so essentially what we're looking at
is the space of now k currents
whose derivative
then descend
to currents that are supported on the boundary
and then instead of just the standard
the ROM homology
we have relative the ROM homology
between the manifold and the
boundary of the manifold.
Proof of this we can now
actually get a bit more easily
this is something that Marcus and Lesh
Marcus and Mathias Lesh
sorry Marcus Flam if you guys aren't familiar with them
and Mathias Lesh computed
and the way they did it was
you know a bit of a work around
but we can actually kind of
the proof if you look at the proof of
of hoaxia
or excuse me of cyclic homology
all came about this with
the guys
consequences you can
and the sort of periodicity
between this
cyclic complexes
which are now going to be the
you can essentially do the rest by induction
pretty easily and so now with
this
I
sorry it looks like I cut out
can you guys all hear me
I am back
can you guys
we can hear you
okay cool
so
so now
you guys can see everything now
sorry for cutting out there
as I was saying the the theorem
relating the bridge
homology to the diram homology
can be computed fairly easy
now with this fourth
guys and consequences just by simple
induction proof starting with low degrees
so some things
we like maybe just
kind of finished up in the last minute or so
we do want to extend
these pairings to
let's see where am I
these pairings
to
of k theory to
this bridge complex and so this was
a work by Matthias
and Marcus
they are finishing up so the
correct relative k theory is really what
we're looking for once we kind of find
the correct relative k theory
defined on
which I think they're pretty much finished
with it should pair naturally
with our bridge complex
so we should be able to extend some of the pairings
and possibly get some index
theorems out of that
and just sort of my ideas
for that I think some of these constructions
especially with these triangulated categories
should work very nicely
especially with
these mapping
because if we take a mapping cone
it
is in some sense just a direct sum
of these cyclic complexes
and these cyclic complexes we already
have turned characters that land
in our cyclic complexes
so I think from the these
mapping cone constructions
we should be able to generalize these turned characters fairly easily
from
the k theory groups to land
where we want and get these pairings
to extend
so that's it thank you guys
for listening
thank you
do you have any questions or comments
okay
okay so if there are no more
questions or comments let's thank Jonathan again
for a nice talk
