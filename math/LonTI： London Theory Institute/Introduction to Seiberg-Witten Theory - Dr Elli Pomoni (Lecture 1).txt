George I and Glashow and all of the people, for example, in a little bit, we will talk about the wheat and effect.
All of these guys, they had as their gaze group O3.
But you can just think of your favorite compact group and you are happier and let's call it G.
And if you don't like crazy groups, just think of as U2 and you win, yes?
Yeah, just think of as U2 when you don't want to do two complicated things.
So when we do this, we break the group down to the however many.
So R is the number of cartons for G2 is 1, yes?
So when we do this spontaneous symmetry breaking, we discover electromagnetism or many copies of electromagnetism, yes?
So here find the complex scalar or just to be...
The way I have written it, it looks, so I did it like George I and Glashow did.
Here it looks like a real, that's why it's written like this.
And that's why there is the half in the front.
But you can write it in however, it doesn't matter.
If you choose as U2 and a complex scalar, you just delete the half and put a bar.
And the changes will be very minor.
This is for O3?
Yes, correct, correct, correct, yes?
And maybe what is important, maybe I should write the covariant derivative.
Actually, this is the most important thing.
So I am actually using the conventions from that paper.
And this is what is the covariant derivative for them.
So it's an adjoint guy, yes?
Now we do this and I said already that there is a symmetry breaking, but let's say a little bit more.
So the gauge field, you can think of it, let's separate the components of it.
So if E plus and E minus are the lasing and lowering operator of the group, generators.
And then there will be another generator, like the carton, or many cartons, it doesn't matter.
What happens when you plug in, these guys become massive.
These are the W bosons of the theory.
And their mass is proportional, so that I don't forget any factor of 2, to AE, yes?
And then there is this baby here.
And this is massless, and this is the photon.
Yes?
And the perturbative spectrum of this theory has one more part.
Am I going too fast, or is this very easy and it's okay? Fantastic.
The perturbative spectrum of this theory, of course, also has the phi.
And yeah, you can think of it as the Higgs, and this guy is gonna have, let's put proportional to everything.
This mass.
You read it off immediately from the potential, right, from the middle term.
Yes? Yes, please.
AE, oh, very good.
E is here, is the electric charge, some complicated constant, yes, yes.
And I put it in, because I wanted to have electromagnetism in the end.
Yes?
These are important questions, because we should be clear what we are talking about.
Is this very clear or not?
This is a stupid way to say this is the carton.
So this, I can use, so this, or cartons, and this is the raising and the lowering.
The plus and the minus generators.
Yes?
Something else?
Okay, I erase this, and you can think of more questions.
Okay.
So are we good?
Yes, please, please, just ask, don't even need to raise.
More complicated would you have.
Yes.
There is now, now that it is absorbed, basically all the oscillation stuff,
do they still have the same group structure in the other massive particles?
What does it act on?
No, no, so the group is broken now, and this will be the U1s that survive,
and these are some massive guys that are in the spectrum of the theory.
Okay, whatever.
This is the remnants, this is the remnants.
That's it.
They are just there.
Of course, you can always derive broken word identities,
but let's not talk about this.
Yes.
So I will write now the stress energy tensor,
that I expect you to be able to derive by yourself.
Yes.
I had a very big struggle with this one half when I was preparing,
but I think now it's correct,
but you should not believe me and check everything by yourself afterwards.
So zero here is for time, yes?
Maybe I put it down.
No, maybe here.
Yes.
And the first stupid vacuum.
Okay, I will not write the word stupid,
I will just write when it's like this.
This makes the potential go to zero,
and then this guy is zero.
And that's what there is, yes?
Nice, pedagogical, everything is good.
So now we want to do the magic.
And the magic is,
I want to go to a little bit something more complicated than this
to discover the monopoles.
So I am going to do an ansatz.
I am not going to write you the details,
because if the details I would just do this
for the next two lectures,
but I will guide you through the most important points.
So we are looking for a solution
that is more complicated than this,
that basically let me make a plot
We are looking for a solution.
Maybe I write some words first.
So after spontaneous symmetry breaking,
we are looking
a solution with finite energy.
That is static.
This is already the definition
of what is a soliton, yes?
And in our case,
because we want nice life,
it also should be 3D spherically symmetric.
Yes, and we wanted to have magnetic charge.
Is this good?
This is what we want.
So we want something like this.
Ok, I also know the answer,
so I will make the correct plot.
But, you know,
we want something that asymptotically goes to a for phi.
This is phi, if this is not clear.
So this is not clear.
So this is something like this.
This is a function that goes to a asymptotically.
And for b, the magnetic field,
we want something that asymptotically
goes to g,
something, some constant, r squared,
yes?
And it's going to be something like this.
Whatever, we have to find this.
Ok, this is a very crappy plot, I'm sorry.
I cannot really.
Something like this, yes?
But the important thing is that asymptotically
here it goes like this.
Now, and the very important thing
is this word here in the definition,
finite energy.
So this is where you start from.
Ok, this is one of the most important equations,
so I will write it with color,
or I will start writing it.
So we want to compute
the mass of the monopole.
And I will call it m capital, yes?
And always in order to do this,
what we do is we integrate
the stress energy tensor, yes?
The 0, 0, yes?
And here we wrote the stress energy tensor, yes?
And we don't want to do something crazy.
We only want to make a magnetic monopole,
so we will put e to 0.
And also, at least at infinity,
nothing is going to happen,
so I will also put v to 0.
So we will do e, 0,
and v to 0, yes?
So I plug this in.
Ok.
Oh, and I said also something else.
I said static, so this baby also goes, yes?
Yes?
Ok, let me be a little bit fast.
It will go away.
The solution we will make it so that everything
that we don't want to be there, it will go away.
So you can take this as part of the answers, yes?
Yes?
So I start by writing this.
I don't want to be read, but it didn't become.
So it's ok.
I continue.
Ok, so now I will do a trick,
which is the standard trick that we always do in these cases.
This bogomoni trick.
Ah, there is a half here.
This was my struggle from here,
when I was calculating before.
So what do we do?
We have these two things.
We will put them together.
Can you see here?
Or this is crazy what I am doing?
Yes?
Can you read this?
It's ok.
You are the first row, it doesn't count.
You guys can do this?
Ok, I will write from here at the beginning.
So in this business with the mono,
actually in everything that has to do with any type of sholiton,
this is like a super standard trick.
So I write it.
I write it from this step.
Or no minus plus and minus.
Ok.
Yes, so this is where we are.
And this is just ansatz,
plus this making the square.
And here comes an important point.
And this is part of the trick.
This equal to zero makes life nice.
This is the Bogomoni equation.
Bogomoni, I cannot really say this.
So then this becomes greater or equal to just this bit.
And maybe because I will write it, why?
But this I am going to rewrite as a surface integral.
Yes?
In this way.
But then I do the integral.
This is Gauss law.
Oops, wait, wait.
Here there is a name.
No, this is not here anymore,
because there is this factor.
And no, no.
I will explain this in a second.
So this is equal to A g.
I will explain from here to here in one second.
But what happened is this very important thing.
The mass of the monopole obeys this inequality.
Yes?
Let me explain the trick very fast.
S is the surface integral.
And you can imagine that this thing that we are doing,
we are doing an integral around some sphere.
So we are constructing some monopole solution,
so something is happening.
So this is R is equal to zero.
And we do Gauss law.
And we do an integral here.
Is this clear?
Yes.
I wanted to explain this.
So, and I will say more comments in a second.
So this is really just Gauss law.
So now there are two things.
One is because this B,
like it came from,
OK, it's all gone.
It came from this non-Abelian theory.
And this is part of the B.
So I don't want to use all of it.
So the way you do it,
OK, now I put my indices back,
is that I projected to the vacuum solution
that I want to have.
And there will be an A.
But this thing carries units.
So I have to divide by 1 over A.
And now this is dimensionless.
And this is how I pick up the electromagnetic part,
the U1 part of the B.
So this is the proper B field.
Yes?
Maybe I write also here.
Maybe this is...
So this is how we project.
So I want to pick out the U1.
This is this.
So the vacuum will do it.
Just putting this.
This is how we do it.
And this I did the same thing for the B field.
And this little A guy here
explains that one more step.
But this explains this A.
So now here
there is one more step you need to do.
You need to do partial integration.
And you need to use Bianchi identity.
And then you can rewrite this precisely like this.
Wait, I am mixing up my notes.
Sorry.
What did I do?
The A is here.
Let's put it here in the front.
All the indices are there.
Can you see the indices properly?
Yes.
So this is how I went from this to this.
This is the vacuum solution.
And this is this.
So this is how I made this step.
And from here to here
I only used Bianchi
and just partial.
Good.
Ok, I am doing all the calculations almost.
So, but this is the important equation.
And when this equation is satisfied
m is equal to Ag
and this is called the BPS bound.
Bogomonli, Prasad, Somefel, yes.
It is also that.
And we will do this also.
So this is what is insane about monopoles.
They somehow,
they are meant to be super symmetric.
Yes.
Amazing.
How am I doing with time?
Oh, I am doing amazing with time.
Yes.
Yes, please.
So here we started with like fire
which transforms in some group G.
And then there is also the gauge group G
which is the same, no?
Do you need to take both of these groups
to be the same for these monopoles to...
Wait, I didn't understand
what this is.
So you have the group that acts on fire, right?
Yes.
That's like a global symmetry group?
No, no.
So this is my gauge group.
Ah, so you only have this...
I only have a gauge group.
I don't have anything else.
So if you remember, ok, it's all gone.
Ok.
Maybe someone can show him the original Lagrangian.
So I only had one index A
and this is the adjoint index
for the original Lagrangian.
And this is the adjoint index
for the whatever group G.
It just counts generators.
I didn't have no other...
I can write here.
There is no other symmetry in the problem.
Yeah, this is good clarification
if this was not clear.
So the small g
should belong to the...
to the one in R.
This small g?
Yeah.
So this small g, I wrote it here
but maybe I should have written also words.
This is the magnetic, this is definition,
this is Gauss law.
Maybe I want another color.
So this is the magnetic charge.
Ok.
Yeah, but I'm asking this
if we're breaking our gauge group,
do you want R?
Yes.
So let's just do you one basically
not to have too many of them.
For you one it's fine.
Yes.
But for you one too far R.
You just add them, you just add them.
Yeah, nothing fancy.
But really forget about R
and just do this.
Yeah, forget about R.
I just want it to be general.
Let's just do simple electromagnetism.
Yes.
So this baby is squared here.
So when I take it out,
I take out something positive.
So this is how I have this inequality, right?
When this baby is zero
and for that squared thing to go to zero,
I really have to put it to zero.
Yes?
And this is the most important trick basically.
And now you know all sholitons
because you just take another Lagrangian
but you do the same trick basically.
Yes?
Instantons the same.
Everybody the same.
Tell me if there is a question, tell to me.
No?
I can answer.
Ok.
Good.
I have a question.
Good.
So we have a way now, yes?
To do what?
To make a finite energy sholiton solution
with this mass.
Yes?
And there is one more step.
I mean I could have skipped it
so many of the reviews just skip it
but I will give you a tiny little bit
because it's cool and it's sad if I don't do it.
And I guess I will write here
because I want to show you
how to calculate, je, I don't want to just tell you.
Yeah, because otherwise it's just sad.
Of course it is very difficult
to really show you all the steps
so I will try to show you in a quick way
and I hope it will be ok for you.
But then you have the complete picture of these things.
Ok, so let's try to do this.
So this je je...
Ok, I shouldn't...
Ok, whatever.
ds.b
And I rewrite it in all of these ways that I wrote there.
And now I want to do a final rewriting.
Here there are dots
that are written there.
I want to do a final rewriting.
So I want to take this equation
and first of all I want to compute,
actually I want to show you a little bit
how we compute b
and then I want to almost do the integral
or almost tell you the answer of this integral.
To do this is not simple
and I can only convincingly do it for you
for a large r.
And in fact this is how people do it.
They say I want to find...
I deleted the picture
but they say I want to find a solution
that goes like 1 over r
and they work themselves inside.
And one other thing that maybe I should say
at least for this...
By the way, I didn't tell you
this is called polyakovic hoofed monopole.
Yes, maybe this is an important thing to know.
Maybe I should write it.
So...
So there is no analytic solution
for this thing.
So actually if you really want to do it,
you do it numerically.
And I am not going to write all the answers
and everything for you.
But let's work very far away
where the magnetic field decays to zero.
So very far away at infinity
you demand, you start by demanding this.
To leading order in 1 over r.
6
And I write this symbol.
This means to leading order.
This is very important, yes?
Otherwise this is not correct.
If you use this equation,
you can write
this.
So this is going to be my photon.
And from that you can compute at mu nu.
And by the way, I write here
there is a very nice review
that has more steps.
Actually it is very easy
to follow.
Can you read what I wrote here?
This is Harvey.
96, 0, 3, 0, 8, 6.
So there you get the steps.
Yes?
Not all the steps because she also skips.
But...
It's better than what I am doing here.
Although I think
you can almost imagine
how this calculation goes.
So this is the equation
I wrote before.
Almost.
So here you have
the usual electromagnetism.
But here you get an extra piece.
This is a 3.
So this is what you get.
And this is the important thing
I care about.
That you didn't have it before
in your life.
And this comes from this bit.
Yes?
So now you take this
and now
you plug this in here.
Yes?
And...
I see strange faces.
Is it something that you cannot read
or something?
Should we close?
This is a blast for me
to take away the sun,
but okay.
Yes?
So there is this beautiful object.
And if you have...
Eh?
If you have ever
studied
instantons,
when comes the moment
that you do the integral
for the winding number,
is something very similar.
So basically this is a mathematical theorem
that...
Where should I write now?
If I write...
I just write here
and we test you.
If you can see.
So this is an integral that as I said
because we are doing this approximations here
we take a sphere at infinity, yes?
So we are doing this integral
at infinity.
Okay, now I am a little bit
repeating myself, but okay.
So I want to do this integral.
Can you see this?
Maybe you can stand for a moment
if it's really bad.
So this you can show
that it's a topological invariant.
And it counts
the winding
of this five vacuum
and this is also I guess
why the first guys, Georgi
anyway they were doing O3
because they really wanted to see a sphere.
They count maps
that are defined by this phi
of the phi of
this S2 of phi
mapping
to the boundary.
So this counts these maps
and that's why this comes out
to be an integer.
Yes?
So basically what it comes out to be
maybe I will write
why not here?
So this is the final answer.
Maybe I write here
a nice formula
that is the formula that you should remember.
Yes?
So this is the magnetic charge.
Here.
I wrote from the very beginning
so the way we get all the monopoles
we need to do this spontaneous symmetry breaking.
And we have this A
the gauge field at the beginning
that is non-abillion
and we use it into bits
that they come from the raising and lowering
and bits that they come from cartan.
Let's do S2 or O3, right?
So the other guys they become massive
and we kick them out
and we want just to pick up the mass less.
How do you do this?
You use your solution
the phi vacuum
as a projector because
the solution actually tells you
how to do this decomposition.
So you use this as a projector
and phi has dimensions
so this explains this part.
And because this guy has dimensions
I need to cancel it
and I just put the value of the verb to cancel it
so this is the beautiful photon.
So here this A and A
yes, this is the guy that picks it up.
So this is my photon.
So
Where is the cartan going?
Yes, the cartan is inside here
and I always choose
the phi vacuum
so that it projects
so I am actually not telling you, for example
if we were doing as you too
what is a good way to choose this
is this.
Zero, zero.
Actually directly the cartan.
Yes, and then you pull out the A
you cancel this and you have the cartan
on this.
I am just writing like this
because I want to be more general
and I want this to also hold basically
for any group I like.
Yes?
Maybe just think about this
for cyber wit and this is what we will do
so if you know this I am very happy actually.
Yes?
Are there any such other questions?
Yes.
So the quantization condition
No, no, so the quantization condition
was the naive whatever
Dirac said.
Now
I just did my calculation again
for some monopole.
It didn't have, actually, okay
you make this as an observation.
Yes, you are still in my punchline
but okay, yes.
So look at this, this is amazing.
Visual based Dirac
quantization condition.
Yes?
Yes, what can I do?
Okay, so should I
That is life.
Should I conclude that these monopoles might not be
the fundamental itself?
So there is nothing, what is fundamental?
I don't know.
Is there, would that tell you that there is maybe an object
which has half the marimelitic charge
of these monopoles?
So what I can say is that I found a way
or not me
that I can create these many
monopoles and the rest
do they exist, do they not?
Why?
Anyway, but this is a way to create
some of the monopoles that you think
maybe exist.
Yeah.
Yeah, but always you have.
Yes, you always have something.
Yes, yes, yes. I mean think of as you too
think of this is why these guys did
no 3.
There is a sphere there.
Yeah, yeah.
So maybe I can write.
Okay, if you don't know what I am writing
close your eyes
for the people that know
this was the question.
I am computing the P2
and this is the integers
and if I have a more fancy group
again if you don't know what this is
close your eyes.
We break
to something
and then these guys
what we are counting.
If you don't know what this is close your eyes.
Yes, it's okay. We don't need to know this fancy stuff.
And I want to make one last
happy comment.
So we have this beautiful equation
the quantized
yes
and we have
this, the BPS bound
let's plug in
yes
can I plug in without making mistakes
maybe
this is the mass of the W boson
this gives you an idea
you can also write it with the
alpha
the monopole is very heavy
so
yes
this is also
something important to know in this life
this is really a soliton solution
so I think I said everything
about magnetic monopoles
so
the whatever
good
you have a breaking pattern
so this is what you need to divide
this is what will be left over basically
this is very general
sorry I didn't want to write this thing
but this describes the breaking pattern
yes after we break
precisely
because we only want for those guys
to count
ok
are we happy
and again this is nice
yes yes please
this number
is the charge of the electron
or the fine structure constant
over 100 something
this is a big number
if you divide something by
so this is small
so this is big
if you divide by a small number
you make something big
yes but electromagnetism
in nature
so this is in nature yes
your mass is proportional to any
yes
any is integer
put an absolute value
it's ok
the mass has to be positive
I
most probably was not careful
somewhere and I should have written
an absolute value somewhere
it's ok
yes
no the mass is positive
ok I'm not gonna do the same
for
dions
ok maybe here is a very good opportunity
because I really don't want to do the same
so when you have dions
yeah I will try to just
correct
the equations I have
so this is gonna change
a tiny little bit
and
no this can just go
this write down is nice
and I didn't give this
so it's not in the website when I gave some references
I went there
when I was dissatisfied
with the references I was using
and remember
where this came from
this came from
we had before this step
we had b squared
plus
d5 squared
this is what we had
yes and we made this
and now if I want to do a
dion
and maybe I write here
so we are doing dions
so we want them to have both
electric and magnetic charts
so if you remember in these answers
that I was writing I set e to zero
so I'm not gonna set e to zero
anymore
so I have something like this
so this cannot be written like this
but
I can do something very stupid
I can write identity
yes do you agree with this
yeah
so now
I will take
what did I do yes
I will take this
together with the shine part
and the b
together with the cosine part
and I will do the same
so if you do this
you get that the mass of the dion
everything else is completely identical
so
plus
again
like before in the trick
something that is like of this form
but the dot dot dot
now
is this thing with the cosine
so it will be e
d5
yes
this is the dot dot dot sorry
you know what I'm talking about
ok there is also
whatever it doesn't matter
yes this is what I did
but anyway this is the equation
that we want
we have it
here there is the parenthesis
is it obvious to everyone completely clear
so if you have this nice equation
you drop this
and you have your
inequality
so m
is always
and
ok
now I want to get rid of this sine and cosine
because it's nonsense
so I just square everything
ok for on the bound
on this bps bound
we have a
so
this is the bps bound
for a dion
yes
good
ok
do you need a break
let's have only 5 minutes
because I have a lot of things
ok, only 5
ok, let's start
ok, so now
I want to tell you what is this
written effect
and this is very important
because
I mean ok, written cared about
what he cared about back then
but what he discovered
is that if you have an electric charge
and you turn on
a theta angle in your theory
I will do this
and he wanted to do
he wanted to add the cp breaking term
this is what he wanted to do
and then you have a monopole
ups, something happens
the electric charge gets shifted
and we will do this now
so what he did
he was studying
so the Lagrangian
of Georgij Glasov
that I wrote before
I didn't write gg before
and I just add a theta term
and again
he just wanted
to
to add a cp
breaking term
yes
so he added this
when you do this
ok, maybe I first write the answer
and maybe I tell you how to see quickly
that this is what you get
but again, this is the identical Lagrangian
so I write the Lagrangian that I wrote
I plug in this
vacuum expectation value for phi
so I shift everything properly
and then this is this
and I add this
so the answer
if for theta is equal to 0
I say that the electric charge
was some integer
so n again is the integer
and I will have another integer
m
so if this was originally
the electric charge
what you get is this
where you get this
this will be a very important equation
and how to see this
very fast
is very easy to see this very fast
first
you write
the equation of motion
before
so this is
for theta
0
you have the Maxwell
yes
and maybe just because I like it
I put a coefficient
in the front
just to
then you turn on your theta
and what happens is that this equation
of motion changes
and basically what you get
is this
yes, equal to 0
so this is the equation of motion
so f nu nu
gets shifted by this
remember that I had one quarter
in front of f nu nu f nu nu
so this is what brings you from 32 to 8
yes
and I also divided by this e squared
so this e squared went away
and I get precisely
my friend, yes
oh
f tilde
is what I was writing before
as star f
and this is one
half epsilon
mu nu
mu nu
so this should maybe be a parenthesis anyway
rho sigma
the usual
yes
let's do this
so the electric charges this
and the magnetic charge
if you do the other equation of motion
nothing happens
so the g
is still what it was
in fact I really want to do this
and this is why I said I have another integer
m
this was the equation I wrote
before I just call it
now and I want to plug in now
so I plug in here maybe
q is equal
and this is my important equation
yes, one of my important equations
so this is with an effect
ok, of course
for what we care about
the paper is much more important
than just this
important actually
good
now let me define
it will come when we talk about supersymmetry
but now it's just a curiosity
I define tau
just because I'm crazy
or because I know supersymmetry
so this is just a definition for now
yes
and I want
now
first maybe I do this
I form
q plus i g
again just because I like it
this is a one line
yes
if you just define this
this is what you get in this life
and then
we had our beautiful
m squared
equal to a squared
q squared plus g squared
this is why I define this like this
because when I will square it
this is what you get
so now I derive
another very beautiful equation
for the mass of the dions
so
and maybe
I make a comment
it will come later
but first of all this is the way
the couplings appear
when you have supersymmetry
there is no way out
this is how it is in life
and also this thing
you can actually
when you have supersymmetry
in the second way
which is really cool
and this is why
you can in fact
so when you have supersymmetry
we will talk about
I will write just one equation
and I will have it again
so there is an equation like this
when we have an equal to two supersymmetry
there are central charges
and when you have supersymmetry
we will do this
this bps condition becomes
like this
so which is basically
what I am writing here
and you can derive this
by using supersymmetry now
by having
so this you can now just think of
just the charge of supersymmetry
and always to
calculate the charge
you do the integral of the whatever current
it is
so now there is a suzi current
again I am not gonna
and you do the calculation
precisely the same way we have been calculating
and you get this
you get precisely this equation
that now we got from
bosonic
so this is amazing and magical actually
and also crazy people
like amazing people actually
they also tested these equations
they did one loop calculation around the vacuum
and you still get the same
you still keep getting this
so this is somehow amazing
these are two independent calculations
this up to now I did the bosonic calculation
and now somehow
there is some other current
that defines some other charge
and the theory is supersymmetric
and you compute with this and you get the same
this is really insane
in the supersymmetry calculation
you must have to put something in there
about the gauge group
so you have to have the same gauge group
so basically the supersymmetry
theory it will be
the Lagrangian we had
supersymmetrized
of course yes of course
but anyway for now this is just
we will
are there any questions about this
yes
is that true?
yes
because here there is no dependence on position
no
I mean
the paper of Whitton he wanted to do
actually he wanted to do grand unifying theories
he was really so it was not a theoretical paper
he wanted to do phenomenology with it
people spend a lot of time
with these things
and people have been trying
also to find magnetic monopoles
experimentally
but no luck
for now
so now we will put
everything together
so
ok maybe before we put
I mean ok I just had the Lagrangian
and I deleted it
but I am sure you all know
that when you shift theta
by 2 pi's
nothing happens in this life
so this is a symmetry
of the path integral
and this is called
the T transformation
anyway
just the name doesn't matter
at the level of the T
which I defined there
you see that T
sorry tau
plus 1 I am Greek
and sometimes I read the Greek letter as the English one
but ok sorry for this
and then you can also take this equation
thankfully I didn't delete it
and you plug in theta to 2 pi
and you get NE plus ME
yes
so let's write it in a nice way
let's write
NM goes
to N plus M
divided by M
and let's also write it with matrices
yes
so this is the T transformation
in this language
yes
so this is a symmetry of the theory
then we have this S duality
I mean I never called it S duality
up to now I have been calling it
electromagnetic duality
but because of the group
with which I identify it now
it would be naturally called S
it doesn't matter
whatever it's a name
and what we did
we had the electric charge
this was the first thing that I wrote
electric duality on the Maxwell equations
so I had this
and I had this
so let's put it on a matrix
oops
and for this language
this just becomes
again you just use this definition
tau
goes to minus
one more tau
yes
so this is in this language
and this is in the language of matrices
so I can write here
this is the S transformation
and ok
these are 2 by 2 matrices
anyway I just tell you the answer
so the full duality group
is SL to Z
where
when you want to do it with matrices
you take these matrices
and the elements in there
and they obey this equation
for the S
ah
A D
so this is
what happens when you want it as matrices
and when you want it to act on tau
this is how it acts
I mean you put it wikipedia anyway
this is what is there
you could have discovered by knowing this in wikipedia
yes
so that's the full
electromagnetic duality
ok
for now
all I have done is something classical
but classically
I have this group now
yes
because this group is generated
maybe I should say this
this
is generated
by
S and T
so this is my full
symmetry group
so classically we discovered
that we can do this
and now the very big question
in life is does this remain
in the quantum mechanical level
and the answer
by the way this is amazing
do you understand that this is amazing
this is amazing
I cannot
I can just say amazing
I cannot
then it's on you to appreciate this
yes
this is really an important moment in life
and
and now is the question
what happens in the quantum
in the quantum level
and when your theory is bosonic
like if you are super power
like I don't know Peter von Neuheisen
was doing this calculations
you can do one loop around the background
you suffer like crazy
you calculate something
you can do this
but does this ever end
maybe there will be a two loop effect
that will break like I don't know
so then the only way to play with this
and make real progress is you go super
and that's why we will now go super
yes
and there are two things that you can do
if you want to go super
because I want to do the cyber written
you can study n equal to four super young males
and then you can see
that this symmetry acts
again this is not like the modern people
that do in the gravity
this is the IR
but you can see how it acts on the dions
and it's perfect and there is an amazing paper
by Sen that if you never read
maybe you should
it's all in this hardware review
that I proposed
but now we will take the other direction
we will do n equal to two
to discover the n equal to the cyber written theory
yes
so
if this is good now we will do super symmetry
is this good
and for the super symmetry
I think I will quiz you
because no doubt trying to scare me
that you don't know super symmetry
and I have a hard time to believe it
so I will quiz you
yes
yes
so I will ask questions
and you can scream the answer
yes
first of all
let's talk about
minimal
so now we have this n calligraphic
that tells you how much super symmetry
and we are in four dimensions
because the counting changes
so let's first write the super symmetry algebra
do you know the super symmetry algebra
yes
scream
ok, here depends on what you are reading
maybe some people will put it to
I don't care at this stage
put whatever you like, yes
like I don't care about the prefactor
it doesn't matter, it's convention
so this is the super symmetry algebra
and
maybe there is another bit
of the super symmetry algebra
that for now is not important
but it will become
so when you have n equal to 1
that's the only thing that you are allowed
then you can derive this by jacobi
that's it, it's very easy
now we want to do
massless representations
yes
who knows massless representation
say yes
or yes
oh, this is not very
wholehearted
ok, I say a few things
and let's see
because you know this group is
like Poincare is like too big
we go to the rest frame
and what is the rest frame
for a
massless particle
is this, yes
so what happens
to your beautiful equation
up here
up to a factor of 2
that who cares
you get this
yes
so
if you started
by having q alpha
what is alpha, the spinor index
do we know this
yes, no
so alpha goes from 1 to 2
so this matrix here is 2 by 2
because of this
so in this way now
we are going to the rest frame
I have only one q, the q1
yes, so this is how I will make
my multiplets
so I have to define a vacuum
so I don't write anymore q1, q2
I just write q which is the one
that survived
and I have to define my vacuum
and let me call
I will tell you in a moment what is this
so this is some cliford vacuum
so q bar
I define it to be my annihilation operator
lambda
is helicity
ok, I am doing it super fast
I know that if you have not
never seen this
this is insane
but you can complain also
yes
so this is how we start
and then how do we make the multiplets
we act with the raising guy
this is a multiplet
this together with this
yes
so let's choose just because we like it
lambda to be 0
so this is a scalar
what is the next guy
is something that has helicity
a half
is this enough
no, why no
if you want to have a fermion
you better have the minus half also
otherwise you get nonsense
so what do we say
we add the cpt conjugate multiplet
is this ok or this is too fast
so what is the cpt conjugate multiplet
you start with minus a half
and you get your zero
so these two babies together
they define
for you the simplest super symmetry multiplet
which is the chiral
or wezumino multiplet
and it has a scalar
a complex scalar phi
and a vile spinor
psi alpha
is this ok?
and we can count degrees of freedom
on cell and off cell
let's do it all together
so on is for on cell
off is for off cell
how many degrees of freedom
a complex scalar has
how many degrees of freedom
a vile spinor has off cell first
off cell
for
how many on cell
why?
because it obeys the vile equation
or like Dirac equation
amazing
how many degrees of freedom phi has
two
what is going on here?
so ok i didn't prove it for you
but when we have super symmetry
however many bosons you have this
however many fermions you have
this is a theorem you can prove it
it's two lines
I can do it afterwards while leaving pitch if you want
but so on cell it matches
off cell
is bad
what do we do?
we add an auxiliary field
which goes away on cell
somehow
but off cell it has the extra degrees of freedom
yes?
is everyone happy with this?
this is a good way of quizzing
and now I will tell you something really bad
if you have never seen it but it's ok
so these fields
we can pack them in a super field
and this is a way to go in life
and if it's scary
don't worry
so the only thing we do
is we take our normal
you know whatever
mikovski coordinates
and we augment it by adding
fermionic coordinates
so theta alpha
and theta bar alpha dot
and now our super fields
are vectors
with respect to all of this
yes?
so these baby here
can be written
as a vector
in this space
and I have left some spaces
in case you have questions
but here
this is basically how we do it
all of the coordinates here
they become part of one super field
I know that this is very very fast
and I left spaces for you to ask questions
but
yes
anyway we can also do more
when we are having pizza
ok
make the next best
next simplest multiplet
when I teach supersymmetry
in Hamburg
and when they come to the exam
one of the first question
is what is your favorite multiplet
and then according to this
the exam goes you know
so they can have a good answer or a bad answer
ok so what is the next best
we take lambda
is equal to one half
so what happens
in fact now
we get
one
is this CPT complete
no
yes? ok, I should have
you could get zero as well
what?
no, because the way I am doing
I define the Q bar
to be the guy that kills
and this is
yes
once you choose your conventions
you know
so this is my second guy
and now this baby is CPT complete
and what is the multiplet
the multiplet is
a gauge field
and a fermion
let's do the same
on cell
of cell
how many degrees of freedom
you know a u1 electromagnetism
that is the most basic thing
how many degrees of freedom a mu
has on cell
ok, I heard the 2 and 3
I will put it in the right place on the table
let's say what is the right answer
so first
a mu stupidly has four
real
good
but then there is gauge symmetry
so this
on cell or of cell
it brings you down to 3
no matter what
and then on the top of that you impose equation of motion
you are down to 2
and this is what we wrote before
2 and 4
and who can tell me
what to write here
I mean the obvious
we miss 1
so this is a real auxiliary
whereas
this was a complex one
yes
yes
basically
I want the dimension of each term
should be equal to each other
yes, fantastic
but I mean if you write
theta square times f
I can get the dimension
of theta from the first two times
first two times
first two times
but when I write the third time
yes
I love it
so what is the mass dimension of phi
all together
one
what is the mass dimension of psi
what is the mass dimension of theta
it has to be one half
so that
sorry one minus
so that I go from 1
to 1
now
what is the dimension of f
2
this is very strange
but this is an auxiliary field
what is an auxiliary field
an auxiliary field is in the Lagrangian
where you have whatever you want
is a baby
that either you add like this
or
you add like this
in case it's real or complex
so there is no kinetic term
it's just a square of something
so that when you integrate it out
when you do equations of motion
it goes away
and that's why
on shell the degrees of freedom are zero
because it goes away
that's what it means
to have an auxiliary field
maybe you know when you learn solid state physics
the Haber-Stratonovic trick
it's the same
it's an auxiliary field always
yes
good, amazing
yes
ok, now we know n equal to 1 supersymmetry
ah, one last thing
ok, I will add a super field
w alpha
it starts with this baby here
it has more
ah, I can just do this
how should I do it nice
yes, like this
f alpha beta
is take f mu nu
oops
ok, I am doing a little bit
when I take supersymmetry
I am doing something that I tell to the people not to do
but it doesn't matter now
maybe there is a quarter
it doesn't matter
this is the self-dual
and there is also the anti-self-dual part
and these babies are babies
that obey the self-dual
and the anti-self-dual condition
but ok, over pizza
we can talk about this more
but anyway
so you have half
so these are the
three degrees of freedom of f mu nu
here
so this is the superspace way
yes
is it very bad
complain
I will reply to your complain
if you complain
is it important to write to the supershow
in terms of games I think
because here in f
yes, so in life when we add things
they better be of the same kind
basically in some sense is what she did
but now you are asking the question for the group
so whatever
is the symmetry group of this baby
should better be the symmetry group of this
should better be the symmetry group of this
should better, otherwise we are adding apples with oranges
and this is not allowed
so all of these guys here
they are in the joined representation
of the whatever group
g or whatever is that that you have
in the microphone
so if you want to write about
in terms of superfields
your original Lagrangian has gate symmetry
but in this superfield there is no gate symmetry
there is
ok, this is just for you
because this takes explanation
but in superspace
there is a superparameter that captures the
I can explain everything over pizza
but this is how it works
so this is the super
gate parameter
and it transforms like this
but ok, scratch that
like I will
let's not go there
but I can explain everything
yes
are we happy with the multiplets?
if we are happy with the multiplets
let's make n equal to 2 multiplets
actually
I am not going to make all of them
because I will make only the ones I need
to survive the lectures
let's start with
here
so I will make
the n equal to 2
algebra
yes
this is a 2
so I added an index i
that goes from 1 to 2
yes
and in order for this equation
to make sense
I need to have
a delta here
yes
and what happens here
actually something is allowed here
and this is the equation
actually I wrote before
so now let's do
again representation
as less representation theory for now
we go to this
we do this
these kills for every i
I act
and I get an object that has an index
yes
so I get 2 things
and now
I will just write here the answer
so if I start with 0
I act once
with a qi
it doesn't matter which one it is
I get a half
something that is a doublet
and I act again
and I get a 0
sorry
a 1
because I acted twice
and q raise the helicity
so what do I have all in all
I have and I add the cpt
so
so what do I have all in all
I have an a mu
I have a lambda
I
and I have a phi
is this ok for everyone or not
or just say something
I don't know
say yes, say no
say maybe
good
and by the way
trivial but amazing
observation
this is called the n equal to 2 vector
multiplet
the n equal to 2 vector multiplet
is equal to an n equal to 1
chiral multiplet
plus an n equal to 1 vector multiplet
yes
very important
yes
and now I can write an n equal to 2 superfield
that takes everyone in
and I can do it in 2 different ways
I mean it's the same
so this is a naive super space
that is good only for the n equal to 2 vector
field
you really don't want to try to do this for the hyper
because you will cry
so
so it has x mu
it has theta
theta tilde is my second coordinate
you can also put them together
in a theta i
and the bars
yes
and again you can put them in a doublet
so how I make this superfield
let's call it psi
it starts with i
I will do it in 2 different ways
let's start like this
either I put my n equal to 1 superfield here
I will write it here because I deleted it
so
so either I do it like this
so
this language
is precisely this sentence that I wrote here
that n equal to 2 vector
is equal to n equal to 1 chiral
plus n equal to 1 vector
or
by the way I am just matching
the indices
so that they have a scalar
and basically
what she was asking about
how to match dimensions and everything in life
if you match indices and dimensions
you win
you may only lose some stupid factors
but who cares
and here is it in components
so
and here there is something nice
sorry let me be good
here there is also the sg2
asymmetry index which I contract
and here
I contract the spinor
but I leave the asymmetry nice
so i
j
and then I have
an object
that is a triplet in this sg2
and this
this is this triplet
of the three auxiliary fields that I had before
the complex conjugate
and the real
that's how you make a triplet
ok
please ask questions
I force fed you something now
like ask questions
don't cry just ask questions
no we will not do this
there is really no time
for what is on the blackboard
sorry
I'm sorry
ask questions about this
I know that I pushed a lot into you now
it should be this way
everything is
you just count with your fingers
can you count this with your fingers
is there anything that you cannot do with your fingers
ok
ok
we will discuss our picture
if there is something
but this is a way to write this
and this is amazing
maybe one thing
that I should have said and I didn't say
when I wrote the algebra
is that when I added this index i and j
this is the doublet
of sg2 asymmetry
that is equal to 2 algebra has
so this
doublet
of
gejginos
is a doublet of that asymmetry
and this triplet of auxiliary fields
is a triplet of that asymmetry
ok
ok
now in order to do our business
we need Lagrangians
so let's write Lagrangians
ok
so we will write
ok
so pure
means there will be never a hyper in this life
and equal to 2
super young youth
so the only option here is
what is the gauge group
at this moment I don't have to tell you what it is
but because I want to make my life
easy
you know next lectures I will also just take
as you too
but anyway at this moment it doesn't matter
you can scratch it yes
so I will write the Lagrangian in 3 ways
I will just write it because I can
and we will talk about it
this is my approach
so the first
so please don't cry yes
or maybe I write it the easy way first
or ugly
depending on whatever your taste
ok
I am trying now to
have my conventions right
but you should really
I am trying to also write fast
so
you know
so up to now
by the way this is the first line
up to now this is
George Iglasov
yes
the only thing is that I have chosen
a slightly different potential
but other than that is identical
yes
oh this is good
so
so this is one way to write your Lagrangian
and this is people call it in components
maybe I do like square
bracket here everything is multiplied
by 1 over g squared
again the first
line is like George Iglasov
the potential is a little bit different
and the second line is the supersymmetrization
of that so I have just a
proper kinetic term for the fermions
the only maybe thing
to note
is that I made the singlet
I contracted the 2s u2s
yes
and here the only other extra thing
is that there is a yukava term
you can ask yourself
what are the possible yukava
terms that you can write
but very quickly you will realize
that there are actually not so many options
because of the charges
so this is the unique way
to make an s u2 singlet
and there is another u1
and this makes that u1
and that's it and there is no other way
and the only calculation you need
to do in this life is actually for this factor
but I give you the factor
it doesn't matter if you ever know it
and also
whatever you will do in your life
different collaborations will have different conventions
and this factor will always change
so whatever
so this is the Lagrangian of this theory
in components
is this Lagrangian intuitive?
it should be just intuitive, yes
instead of
so this is like caramel
or what I did
which is very bad here
is I didn't put the bar
and this is also I didn't
let's put it
so if I put a bar here
I need to put a bar here
but of course you can put the bar here
and then have sigma here
so sigma comes in two flavors
in the alpha beta dot one
and in the beta
in the alpha dot
beta
and this has a thing
so depending on what you want to contract with
you need to pick the appropriate one
but there is a complex conjugation also
anyway
over pitch we can do
yes exactly
there is a reality between the two
yes, more questions
this needs to be just obvious basically
and the only thing that supersymmetry really does
is it fixes this factor
so I am using the SU2
are symmetry
and you don't even have to write the supersymmetry
but somehow they have to go together
good
now I will write the Lagrangian in superspace
don't panic
and I will write it in n equal to 1 superspace
and in n equal to 2 superspace
and I don't want you to learn it
I just want to make some observations
so I just want to know one thing
in the end
let me write first
and then we talk
so
maybe here the bar
so this is one way
to write the Lagrangian in superspace
by the way
I never wrote a trace
but there is a trace everywhere
sorry, I am just trying to write quickly also
there is a trace everywhere
so this is cyclic
this guy, properly
and the origin with the plus and the minus
is because when he asks
there is this gauge symmetry
this transforms in this way
I mean actually this I didn't explain
but it doesn't matter, there is something extra
that takes care of the gauge symmetry
and now n equal to 2 superspace
by the way
this imaginary part
you don't need to write like that
you can just say
something plus complex conjugate
it's just a little bit faster
that's why I do this imaginary part
and this tau
is the tau I defined
so supersymmetry
if you want to be able to write this line
you have to define this, there is no other way
ok, so this is the n equal to 2 superspace
ok, now we just talk basically
put it down
can you see
this is crazy, too low
maybe stand up for a second
so, first of all, let's make observations
because I don't really want you
to know this crazy stuff
I just want you to know
some basic messages
that come out of them
so, in this
this
theory here
is very important
if you wish to really check supersymmetry
because this is how you fix all these relevant
relative
coefficients that you put
so, for example
the relative coefficient between this and this
is very important and is checked by supersymmetry
and if you do it right
if you do it wrong when you are checking
you will never get zero
so, actually, usually people
want to discover supersymmetry
you put factors
and you go and you calculate like crazy
and then you fix them, this is the reality of it
now, good
this you can do
here, the whatever little bit
I am writing
because I am using these superspace integrals
it's directly supersymmetric
so, every little bit
here and here
is directly supersymmetric
and it's directly
because I am using here n equal to 1 superspace
is directly n equal to 1
symmetric
not n equal to 2
and the way to make sure that this is n equal to 2
in this language
fixes
the relative coefficient
and in fact this
with this
it fixes the relative coefficient between these two terms
which is not fixed
by n equal to 1 supersymmetry
and how do you do this
let's be practical
I like to be practical
so, in here
hides the kinetic term for the bosons
for example, this guy
and also, in here hides
the kinetic term
for the second fermion
so, here I have two of them
one of the two, the one that is in the chiral multiplet
so, here there is one of the two guys
one of these
here
lies the kinetic term
of the fermion that is in the vector multiplet
so, how do you make sure you have n equal to 2 supersymmetry?
you make the coefficient of this guy
such that the coefficient of this guy
when we put them together they have the same
overall prefactor
so that they can combine
that's how you do it
that's the practical way
so, if you don't know how to do these things
you open a book
you copy how you go from this to fermions
you copy how you go from this to fermions
unknown coefficients
and make sure you match them
so that they go together
that's how you do this
yes?
and in the proper words
this imposes you to are symmetry
this is what you are doing
now, what is this line?
this line is the way to put these two things
together in one
and there is nothing further to fix in this life
now, here there is something
that is very amazing
and here it's just an observation
this
object that I am writing
is holomorphic
what does it mean?
it means that this
superfield that I am using
because it's a scalar superfield
it can be psi or psi bar
whatever I wrote here
is a function of only one of them
and this
this by the way happens also here
the kinetic part
of the gauge field
is also holomorphic
so in supersymmetry
there is a whole
bunch of arguments
and the whole way this also goes under the name
Cybergology
whenever something is holomorphic
it's basically fixed
and this is why is this
analysis, when you have a real function
you really need to know the function
when you have a complex
function and you know that it's holomorphic
you only need to know
its singular points
and the asymptotics
and then you know the function
so this is why supersymmetry is powerful
because it allows us
to have these holomorphic bits
and now we only need
to find a way
to fix singularities
and asymptotics
and we are done
so this is the power
of this and that's the only reason
why I wanted to write this superspace
there is no other reason
is it okay?
sorry I have a question
well I come from
like the second line
to the third line
why I got an extra integration
so this is how this
superspace stuff works
here I have to
maybe I can even write it the way I wrote there
with a tilde
so to go from n equal to 2 superspace
to n equal to 1 superspace
so here is the n equal to 2 superspace
and it has all of these things in it
to go to n equal to 1 superspace
I need to delete one coordinate
it has only this
and this
so I need to kill
this
to go here
how do you kill?
you do the integral
it's a fermionic integral
but you do the integral
it should be very intuitive actually
so you have these
two guys here
you kill this guy
by killing this guy
when I am writing
so here there is tilde
sorry
you destroy this
so you will get something with two of those
so actually this bit is very easy to see how to do
you have
here
you have something with 2 theta tilde
and you have 2 theta tilde
so this is precisely what is getting killed
so you get
w alpha w alpha
contracted because this was contracted
very easy
right?
some of the terms are super easy
they take one second to get
some take more than one second
but
ask such questions
because actually this is the first way
try to understand intuitively what I wrote
so what I want you to know
is that these things are holomorphic
and this is amazing
so
and this is
fix
by only
knowing
singularities
and the symptoms
this is how we will do this
we will write a crazy general
for the cyber written theory
the only thing we will do is we will write a holomorphic function
and we will ask
how are we gonna fix it
singularities and asymptotics
and then we will just fix it
with some physics arguments
it is the same
no, but who cares
this is just
this is just decoration
the important is this function here
this is a holomorphic function
everything else is just decoration
you need to know how to decorate
and what is allowed to do
with the decoration or not
but once you know how to do this
this is just decoration
but is it completely true
that all the statements
yes, it is completely true
is it more marvellous
yeah yeah yeah
I am being a little bit fat
this is what I mean
basically what I mean
is that there is a function f
of psi
that is not allowed to be a function of psi bar
no
psi bar
yes, that is what I mean
actually that is important
meromorphic, yes
yes
what is the time
if you are not dead
I could do one more thing
if you are dead we stop
how do you feel
when is the pizza coming
7 min
ok, maybe it is ok
maybe we stop
and ask me questions
from now on we can just do questions
and pizza and happiness
