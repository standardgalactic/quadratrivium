Welcome to the EC online seminar series. This time we start with I would say something completely
new even for EC. We start with a series called Captivating Cosmology from the Big Bank to Tomorrow.
This will be a series of 10 talks and today we will have Tim Modellin talking about
well before I will tell his title I would actually introduce himself first so Tim
Modellin is professor of philosophy at the New York University and founder and director of the
John Bell Institute for the Foundation of Physics before he was 25 years before joining the New York
University he was 25 years at Rutgers University. He has a bachelor in physics and philosophy from
Yale and a PhD in history and philosophy of science from Pittsburgh and his research interests
like preliminary in the foundation of physics, metaphysics and logic. He's author of several
books I think one of this book will be presented today and so if you go and you search for his
books then you will find quantum non-locality and relativity, true and paradox, metaphysics
between physics, philosophy of physics and space and time and then the new foundation of physical
geometry the theory of linear structures and this it's I think more now his talk today.
So I will actually not prolongate too much the introduction I will just give two more
useful information to our participants but if you have any questions you have the possibility
to ask the question at the end of the talk there are two ways how to do it you can rise your hand
and you will be unmuted or you can write the question actually during the whole time of the
seminar in the chat and then at the end we will read the questions from the chat and again people
who rise their hand say we have the opportunity to ask the questions director directly. So Tim I will
let you now give your seminar we are actually at least we are all excited already and I hope
everybody else listening to your talk is excited as we are right now so thank you for accepting
our invitations and you're listening to you thank you. Okay thank you yeah I should I should
just clarify a bit and and hopefully say a little beforehand because this is going to be
as I understand it a very different kind of talk than is usually done in this series
and there's a little bit I will say I'll try to to remember at the end about the connection of
this to cosmology and the Big Bang because there there is one but really one way to think about
this is that in order to make progress in physics including cosmology we have to find a way to put
together quantum theory and the theory of relativity and that has turned out to be just a very difficult
thing to do in any kind of rigorous way and I'm going to be making some suggestions about why that
is and maybe a way forward and I should also mention this work actually is not in the in the
first in the volume that was mentioned it's the second volume which is not yet does not yet exist
it's not out I mean because I haven't finished writing it of new foundations of physical geometry
that this that this work will will be the end of so let me just share my slides
okay and I should also say although this may be on a topic that most people here are not that used
to thinking about because this is brand new a brand new idea as far as I know and developed
essentially from zero everybody should be able to follow what I'm doing there's nothing there's no
technical background or whatever that you would really need I'll try to explain the main issues
at the beginning but then there'll be a little bit of geometry that everybody should be able to follow
okay so why is there a problem putting together quantum theory which is more or less the theory
of matter that we have and relativity which is our best theory of space time structure
why is there such a difficulty joining them together in some way so that there's a single theory
that covers both which of course there must be because nature has both and one of the issues
is is non-locality that that quantum theory displays a kind of breakdown of classical
locality in a way that was that was demonstrated by John Bell I think that Bell's discovery here
was in some sense the most important discovery in the history of physics he proved for those of
you who who are not that familiar Bell proved a set of inequalities just purely mathematical
inequalities that if you do experiments in labs that are very far apart or technically at space
like separation so light from one lab couldn't get to the other lab in time to have any effect on
its experiment what Bell showed is that if the world is local in a certain sense if if causation
and so on can't itself go faster than light then there's there are certain mathematical constraints
on the kinds of correlations you could see between the outcomes of experiments done in these labs
and so he proves this this theorem and then it's just a matter of going into the lab well
first you notice that quantum theory seems to predict violations of this inequality and then
you go into the lab and check and indeed there are violations of this inequality so there is some
kind of non-locality in nature and that means that in some sense their connections between
events that have to have to be superluminal and and the question is how to implement that
cleanly in the physics right how to actually write down a physics in an explicit way that
will have this consequence now i'm going to talk about how this is done in a particular
understanding of quantum theory not because i want to convince you this is the right way to
think about quantum theory but i'm just making conceptual point so i want to talk about what's
called the Bohm sometimes called Bohmian mechanics of the pilot wave theory the de Broglie Bohm theory
which is a way of understanding quantum mechanics in the sort of way that that john bell insisted
we need which is where it's all in some equations right the physics is reduced to some clear explicit
precise equations that you can solve and analyze and not some hand wavy vague talk
that you don't quite know what to make of for example if someone says well things go a certain
way in the physical world until there's a measurement and then they go a very different way
and then you wonder what what constitutes making a measurement and what is the physical content
of that so this is the kind of thing bell didn't like and this pilot wave theory is the kind of
thing he did like just because it's an explicit theory so let me explain that theory for those
of you who don't know it the ontology of the theory that is what the theory actually postulates
to exist physically consists of two parts there's a quantum state which is what you would be used to
if you've studied any quantum mechanics so the thing that's sometimes called the wave function of
a system which is the main thing quantum mechanics uses to represent physical systems but in this
particular theory there's something in addition to the quantum state which is a bit unusual which
is that it postulates there actually are particles that when we talk about particles like pro like
electrons or or or the Higgs particle or whatever we're talking about that because there really
are particles there are point particles that are moving around and that follow continuous
trajectories so in this theory there are such particles and they do in fact move in a certain
way how do they move well once I tell you what there is in the world then I need to give a
dynamics that is I need to give some equations that specify how those things behave and because we
have two pieces of this theory the quantum state and the particles I need two pieces of dynamics
now for the wave function for the quantum state the dynamics is the usual one that's
used in quantum theory which is given by the Schrodinger equation this equation always obtains
in this theory so there's no such thing that you might have heard of the collapse of the wave
function that doesn't happen in this theory so it's always always the the wave function the
change in the wave function is governed by this equation again without going into much detail
you notice on the left you have you have this psi of x and t that's the wave function and this
equation is telling you how it changes in time because you've got deep psi dt and that's equal
to this Hamiltonian operator h hat operating on psi so you can fill in particular h hats and you get
a dynamics that tells you how the wave function changes through time it's a deterministic equation
it's a linear equation it has various mathematical features that are well understood
but in this theory in addition to the wave function in addition to the quantum state we
have these particles and you the kind of the point of the theory is to say that everyday things like
tables and chairs and stars and planets are made up of these particles and so you want to know well
how do the particles move and so I need a dynamics for that and that's given by a second equation
which is called the guidance equation and there it is again you don't have to worry too much about
exactly what's going on but you'll just notice that again on the left dq k dt is how the kth
particles position changes in time so it's just telling you how the particle moves and on the
right which specifies how it moves is an equation that just involves psi it involves the wave function
in a fairly simple it's a really quite a simple equation and this is why it's called the pilot
wave theory basically the point of having the wave function the point of having the quantum
state is that it guides the particles it tells them where to go and it does so in a way that's
specified by this equation good so to understand quantum theory in terms of in terms of this picture
you can always go into any actual experimental situation because you have these two explicit
equations and say all right what's going on right what what actually happened according to the theory
or what could have happened according to the theory and we want to particularly look at the moment
at spin experiments which are probably fairly familiar if you've studied any quantum theory
you can quantum particles electrons and and and neutrons and so on protons have a feature we
call the spin and the spin is like an intrinsic magnetic moment it's as if they're little magnets
with north and south poles and when you take an object like that and put it through an
inhomogeneous magnetic field a magnetic field that changes its strength as you move around in space
that can deflect the particle and so experiments that look at these effects of spin obviously
called spin experiments they tend to at least originally were done with things called stern
garlock magnets i'll show you a picture of that in a second and these magnets can be oriented in
whatever direction you like to make the magnetic field vary in that direction so we can orient the
magnets in the x in a in a direction we can call the x direction and then prepare a beam
so that all the particles when they're fed in are deflected in a particular direction when
fed into that beam let's say we'll call it the up direction so i feed this entire stream in
of particles and they all get deflected up and then i can turn the magnets 90 degrees into the z
direction and apply them to that same prepared beam and then what quantum theory predicts and
what actually happens is now the beam splits half the particles go one way and half the particles
go the other way in other words if i can predict with certainty what will happen if i check for
spin in the x direction then i become maximally uncertain what will happen if i check for spin
in the z direction that's an instance of what's commonly called the uncertainty relations the
more the better i can predict one thing the worse i can predict something else now
what we have here is a deterministic theory so the exact physical situation at the beginning
of an experiment together with the laws determine how the experiment will come out
so we can go and ask well what if i do this experiment where half the particles are deflected
up and half are deflected down what makes the difference right what what is different about
an up deflected one from a down deflected one and in this theory there must be an answer
now the answer can't be in the quantum state because the quantum state is the same in all
these cases so the only other place you could find a difference is in the initial positions
of the particles and so the outcome of the experiment much depend on those initial conditions
and in fact they do a corner theory and in an extremely simple way so just so you can
understand this and it's about the easiest thing you can imagine so we have here a stern
garlock magnet you'll notice it's got a pointy part on the top and a non pointy part on the bottom
you could say the top part would be the north pole of a magnet and the bottom was the south pole
and because of the different geometry the magnetic field is now not uniform
and you'll notice that the rule is very simple all of these indicated flow lines
tell you what a particle would do if it started at one of these various different positions on the
left and if the particle starts above the midline above the dotted line it'll be deflected upward
a certain amount and if it starts out below that midline it'll be deflected downward a
certain amount and nothing goes straight through so you get these two clumps of the particles that
end up here and the particles that end up here and that's just a matter of where they started out
so you couldn't ask for a more simple and straightforward explanation of the observed
statistics than that and there's nothing particularly mysterious or puzzling about that
according to the way this theory is set out when I prepare a beam I can prepare the quantum state
but I can't prepare the precise positions there'll always be a kind of statistical spread in the
initial conditions and so they'll be some of them will be above and some of them will be below
now there's a second kind of experiment that now starts to illustrate the issue of non-locality
the issue that Bell talked about and as I said non-locality has to do with effects of an experiment
done in one lab on an experiment done in another lab very very far away arbitrarily far away according
to the theory and so in in order to illustrate this I need more than one particle I need a
particle that's going to be sent to Alice in her lab and another particle that's going to be sent to
Bob in his lab far away and it turns out that these pairs of particles can be in special states
entangled states the the one that's usually looked at for a pair of particles like a pair of electrons
or a pair of neutrons is what's called the singlet state and again quantum mechanics makes very
specific predictions about the outcomes sorry the dog is whining about about the outcomes of
experiments done on these pairs of particles even when Alice and Bob are arbitrarily far apart
so let's just talk about that in the singlet state what are these predictions well it's that
if Bob and Alice the only one I'm going to talk about now they're more interesting ones but if
Bob and Alice set their two stern garlock magnets in exactly the same direction if they both check
in the x direction or they both check in the z direction then the predictions of quantum mechanics
are very simple it's that 100 of the time Alice and Bob will get opposite results if Alice gets up
Bob will get down as for whether it's Alice getting up and Bob getting down or Alice getting down
and Bob getting up the theory doesn't make a strict prediction it says half the time
it'll be like this and half the time it'll be like that but all the time they'll be exactly
opposite they'll be anti-correlate all right this was a this is an example of a kind of correlation
that was first noticed by Einstein and was made the centerpiece of a famous theory that Einstein
wrote with Podolsky and Rosen called the EPR paper in 1935 now you might think well there's nothing
very puzzling about that right why should I be puzzled that if that whenever Alice sees one
thing Bob sees the other as people say if I you know if I take a dollar bill and rip it in half
and send the two sides off one to Alice and one to Bob then always they'll get up different sides
right one will get one side of the bill the other will get the other side of the bill and there's
nothing particularly spooky or non-local about that so these phenomena this particular phenomena
of this perfect anti-correlation could be explained in a purely local way where there's
nothing spooky no spooky action at a distance as Einstein would have said going on but it turns
out that what Bell showed and I'm not going to go into that proof here is that although you can
have a local explanation of that particular experiment if Alice and Bob instead of measuring
in the same direction start to measure in slightly different directions if they aim if they adjust
their magnets so that there's some angle between them then the quantum mechanical predictions
cannot be explained in a local way these perfect correlations could be but as a matter of fact
in this pilot wave theory I've been talking about they're not in the pilot wave theory
it is the case that you have a kind of physical non-locality here and I just want to
go through this if you're interested it's nicely explained by David Albert and his book
Quantum Mechanics and Experience so what's the situation I'm sending up I have a pair of
particles I'm sending one off to Alice this way I'm sending one off to Bob that way the quantum
state of that system is a singlet state so I know what that is the in this theory I also
have the precise positions of the two particles and you might think well it must be that always one
particle starts out above the midline and the other particle starts out below the midline and
that's why this one goes up and that one goes down but that's not correct in this theory they can
both start out above the midline or they can both start out below the midline and then you might
say well then but then what determines which goes up and which goes down and the answer it's a very
simple answer in the non-relativistic theory is that the the particle that gets to its detector
first does the normal does what you expect if it's above the midline it goes up if it's below the
midline it goes down and the particle that gets to its detector second then is automatically
required or it follows from the equations of motion that it'll do the opposite thing
okay so if in fact you did this experiment according to this theory if you did this
experiment and both the particles start above the midline if Alice measures hers first or puts
hers through her apparatus first she'll get an up outcome and Bob will get a down outcome but if Bob
puts puts it through his apparatus first he'll get the up outcome and she'll get the down outcome
so um this is this non-locality that is in order to understand
what happens in Alice's lab you have to take account of what happens in Bob's lab
if if Bob decides to be lazy and not not do his experiment at all then Alice will get one result
but if he decides to be very ambitious and do his early Alice could get a different result
so you just can't predict what's gonna what she's gonna see without taking into account what he
does even though he is arbitrarily far away so far away that what he does cannot be communicated to
Alice at signals that go the speed of light all right so the main thing is is which of these two
experiments happens first good now that's the way the non-relativistic theory works
but you say gee that's non-relativistic I want to transition I want to somehow
write this theory or adjust this theory to work with relativity I want to transition to a relativistic
theory and the problem is that in relativity in the standard way of understanding relativity
there is no time order between these two events if they're that far apart if they're at what we
call space like separation there's no factor the matter at all there's no physical fact which happened
first um there's no time order there's no as we say global time order that orders all the events
in the universe so that for any pair of events you can ask whether a is before b or b is before a
or they happen at exactly the same time that's a part of the structure that gets lost in relativity
it's it doesn't exist it's um technically if you have a Lorentzian metric in a relativistic setting
there is not what we call a global foliation a kind of global time structure that orders events in
terms of earlier and later go on so now you say but wait a minute in the non-relativistic
theory I really needed this time order right it was important physically whether Alice or
Bob does their experiment first and now I want to somehow produce such a theory in a relativistic
setting I no longer have this global foliation what am I going to do um and one answer one that I
always have always thought was kind of reasonable to say well if I really need it physically I'll
just put the foliation back in right I will I will add it even though it's not part of classical
special or general relativity I'll put it back in and I'll be in order to use it to implement
this non-locality that Bell discovered um now I've been arguing for decades that this is a
reasonable thing to do most physicists don't like it the reason they don't like it isn't they
argue it can't work but it's this kind of comment that Russell made about certain philosophical
theories where he says well this theory seems to have all the advantages of theft over honest toil
it it just seems too cheap or too easy to say well I could use a foliation I don't have one I'll
just add one um now now I personally have always been a little puzzled by this because it seems to me
that um to say that something's cheap is as far as its cost goes a good thing right it's better
it's better things are are cheap than expensive assuming they work perfectly well um
what would happen in the case I just gave you is you can start with a relativistic space time
that has a light cone structure and all the normal structure relativity and then add to
it a foliation and now you have a new structure you're not going back to classical physics you're
going forward to yet a new structure um people don't like it okay I'm not even going to argue
about that here I've I've gone through all this to explain why one one would want just in order to
in order to be able to implement quantum theory you would like a foliation it would be a nice thing
to have now the rest of this talk is going to be this new stuff which you've never seen before
so suppose we don't do what I just suggested that is start with a relativistic space time
and add a foliation to it but suppose we start with an entirely different structure completely
different absolutely non-relativistic looking structure and see whether the relativistic structure
can naturally emerge from it that is even though at a fundamental level the space time structure
does not look at all relativistic maybe in a very simple and comprehensible way something that does
look relativistic can emerge from it um that's going to be the scheme now and I'm going to
show you that this actually can happen and it can happen where the underlying or the exact or
precise structure is as non-relativistic and non-classical in every respect as you can imagine
that even in that situation in a very natural way something that at at macroscopic scale kind of
looks classical and looks relativistic can emerge and can emerge in an extremely natural way
uh so that's what the rest of the talk is going to be about now the place to begin here is let's
imagine that space time is discreet and this is already making a change from all classical
physics because in classical physics you start with space say being thought of as Euclidean
a Euclidean space which is a continuum and if you do general relativity the first thing you pull
off the shelf mathematically to describe space time is a four-dimensional differentiable manifold
which is a continuum but we've known from antiquity people have thought from antiquity
maybe space and time are not continuum maybe they're discrete maybe they have a kind of atomic
structure when you get all the way down to the finest possible scales uh and we all understand
how something that is discreet at a fine scale can nonetheless look continuous like your you
know if you have good resolution on your laptop it might look like they're nice continuous lines
on your screen but you know in fact all there are pixels right discrete pixels that are either on
or off so the general idea that we can't tell by any casual examination whether space and time at a
fundamental level are discreet and continuous that's been recognized for well since the since
antiquity but I don't think it's been I don't think the discrete possibility has been explored
enough certainly not since Newton not since uh uh Galileo not since essentially the beginnings of
modern mathematical physics continuum were always taken to be the structure of space and the structure
of time so I've been looking at this and thinking about how you might implement the idea of a
discrete space time now the first thing to say is there are any number of ways to do it
and if anybody says there's some physical consequence of just having a discrete space
time that can't be right because there's just too many ways to do it you can't just saying it's going
to be discrete doesn't tell you enough um I've been thinking about how to do this in a novel way
that I call full discrete geometry so I'm going to tell you about that very quickly and starting
with the purely spatial structure so now forget about time time's going to play a very important
role in a minute but for the moment just forget about time and just think about space what what
could a discrete space look like um well the thing I'm calling discrete full discrete geometry is
called full because it has atomic elements of all dimensionalities up to the dimensionality of the
space so if I have a three-dimensional space I'm going to have zero-dimensional atomic elements
one-dimensional atomic elements two-dimensional and three-dimensional atomic elements um which
you know for obvious reasons I'll call zero one two and three elements with by saying they're atomic
I mean they don't have any parts of that kind um so the zero elements are zero-dimensional atomic
things zero-dimensional things that have no parts so you can think of those as points that's fine
that's what we always thought points were one elements will be one-dimensional atomic things
atomic lines if you will but you can't think of them the way you do in Euclidean geometry and
Euclidean geometry lines are made of points in fact they're every line no matter how short is made
of an infinite number of points because in Euclidean geometry you can always bisect any line and then
bisect that and then bisect that and then bisect that forever so these atomic one-dimensional
elements don't are not composed of points they don't contain points they are bounded by points
each one is bounded by a pair of points so the fundamental relation between
and different dimensionalities of these elements is that some bound others right n elements bound
n plus one elements if there are any um so every one element has exactly two zero elements as
boundaries and once you specify what bounds what you can then make decisions about what is adjacent
to what so in a discrete space unlike in a continuum if i pick out a point i can ask what are the
near what are the nearest points to it the ones next over the adjacent ones in a continuum there's
never an adjacent point there's always no matter how close i come there's closer ones
and in a discrete space there are adjacent ones but once i have this relation between the zero
elements and the one elements i can say what is adjacent to what so if i have a zero element
and a one element and another zero element that that is its other boundary at the other end then
i would say those two points are adjacent and if i have two one-dimensional lines and they
share a boundary if they are both bounded by the same point then i'll say they're adjacent
good so all of that is going to be well defined so here are some examples of one-dimensional
discrete spaces they're made up of zero elements points and one elements these lines the middle one
is what would normally come to mind if i said give me an infinite one-dimensional discrete space
okay it's dot line dot line dot line forever but from what i've said the other ones are perfectly
good one-dimensional discrete spaces as well in the upper image you'll notice there's a point that
bounds not two but three different lines in the lower image you'll notice that there's a loop
but you should not think that that loop itself is the boundary of a pentagon or anything because
there are no two-dimensional elements at all there are only one-dimensional and zero-dimensional
elements so these are some discrete spaces discrete one-dimensional spaces they're not
all that interesting things get interesting when we go up to two dimensions when we go up to two
dimensions we now have to make a decision namely what do our two elements look like what do our
atomic surfaces look like what kind of geometry do they have and here you have a choice point and
you have any number of choices you could make and so as i said you know again if someone asks
what are the physical consequences of making space and time discrete the answer is you have to tell
me a lot more before i can answer them now physicists have looked at this
the the most common and as far as i know almost the only choice that that's ever made
is what's called to use a simplex as your two-dimensional element and a simplex as the name
suggests is the simplest two-dimensional polygon namely the triangle and then if you go up to
three dimensions the simplex is the simplest polyhedron namely the tetrahedron which is of
course made of tri I mean it's it's bounding faces are all triangles and so lots of physicists who
have looked at the idea of a discrete somehow discretizing space or discretizing space and time
immediately go and do it in terms of what are called simplex complexes sets of these simplexes
which means you're dealing with points, lines, triangles, tetrahedra and so on
that's not what i'm going to do so this is the first thing to notice
and it's not obvious what to do and I went I when I was writing the chapter on this I rewrote
it four different times first with triangles then and with square as we'll see with quadrilaterals
and then back to triangles and back to quadrilaterals back and forth and back and forth until I figured
out what actually made sense um in any case what I what I ended up doing in the thing that works
for my purposes is when I go up to two dimensions not to use triangles but to follow Euclid so what
did Euclid say Euclid said a point is a dimensionless thing right it has no dimensions if I take a point
and move it again now through a continuum it draws a line so that gives me a one-dimensional thing
and now if I take the line and move it the whole of it in another direction if I have another
direction to move in that will trace out a quadrilateral or a square I mean you might say a
square right I take my line and now I move it it and now I take that square if I have a third
dimension and I move it it traces out a cube or properly I have to hear
um so this is what we're going to do we're going to we're going to take as our two-dimensional
elements not triangles but quadrilaterals I'll call them squares because it's easier but they're
not officially squares because I haven't defined angles or lengths or anything that you'd need
to really define a square and the three-dimensional elements will be we'll call them cubes again
they're just things like cubes and square-based solids of that sort that have six quadrilaterals
as sides okay so um sorry again this is what I'm just saying you you right one dimension zero
dimensions one dimension two dimensions and then pull that up three dimensions good so let's just
look at the two-dimensional case pure geometry pure spatial geometry and so this this picture
the square grid is the space the elements of the space are a finite number of points
which you can think of as as the vertices here or where the lines intersect a finite number of
one-dimensional elements which are easy to see and a finite number of two-dimensional elements
and the one-dimensional elements bound the two-dimensional elements the zero-dimensional
elements bound the one-dimensional elements and so on um now that space has a kind of intrinsic
geometry to it even though I haven't defined length even though I haven't defined angle
there's a natural way to talk about the geometry because when you do discrete things there's always
what's available counting measure you can always count things to get a kind of sense of as it were
how big they are um and the geometry you get in this case is what's called taxicab geometry it's
kind of familiar because it's the what would happen if you got into a cab in a city with a
square grid of streets and you you tried to figure out how much you're going to have to pay to get
from point a to point b it doesn't really matter as it were how far point a is from point b but
it's how far the cab is going to have to drive and it's got to be constrained to stay on the streets
so in in this picture you'll see point c and then this these other points that are indicated
with the dashed lines between them they would be what would correspond to a circle in this geometry
that is all those are the points that are three units away that is the the least number of moves
you have to make on this grid to get from c to any of those points is three so you can go you know
three out straight to the right three out three up or you can go two up and one over or one over
and two up and you get this this this thing that is the what corresponds to a circle and of course
it's not a circle it doesn't look like a circle and it not only doesn't look like a circle these
things don't behave like circles they don't behave in a very fundamental way like circles so if I
look at point d in that diagram and again start growing circles out from it which will be these
growing dot diamonds you'll notice that when they meet when the the the circle of three units from d
will meet the circle of three units from c along that entire edge along an edge that contains four
different points and that can't happen in Euclidean geometry and Euclidean geometry if I have two
circles they either don't intersect at all or they intersect at one point or they intersect at two
points and that's it they can't intersect at three points because three points determine a circle so
even without talking about lengths and distances just topologically these things that correspond
on to circles in this taxicab geometry aren't don't behave like circles so this is very non Euclidean
it's of course also very non Euclidean because you don't have an infinite number of directions from
any given point you only have four directions you can go in from any given point good so that's the
discrete spatial geometry now we're going to add time and we're going to add it in a discrete way
so again just as for any spatial point you can talk about the next ones or the nearby adjacent ones
now for any event you can talk about the next ones or the most adjacent ones in time the ones that
happen next from that one um and so because time unlike space has a direction from earlier to later
we're going to use directed elements arrows rather than undirected elements so we're doing
directed graph theory now as it were um how am I going to add the time structure in well again
I there I have an infinite number of choices even in the simplest case which is one plus
one dimensional space time so one dimension of space and one dimension of time as always
there are infinitely many ways to do this let's just look at some of them so um I have here
two copies of a one dimensional space the blue lines right with with dots and lines
and then another copy above it and then I'm going to indicate with the arrows immediate
successors in time and in this diagram what I've decided is that each zero element will have only
one successor in time and each one element will have only one successor in time which are given
by these vertical arrows so that's one way to add time but that's a really bad way to add time
because what I would like to do is to say things like this that particles have to travel along
continuous trajectories through space time and by a continuous trajectory I now mean
always to an adjacent point always following the arrows but if there's only one arrow from
every point then everything's going to be frozen if I have two particles that are right next to
each other they'll always be right next to each other if they if they're in this structure
so I can do that it's sort of what you might think of if you're familiar with this as a kind of
discrete version of Newtonian absolute space in time it doesn't it's it doesn't do me any good
it's not not useful all right well having only one successor isn't good I can go to the other
direction extreme and have an infinite number of successors I could say well let me draw an arrow
from every single point in one layer to every single point in the next layer so as it were
every point in the next layer is an immediate successor and you would get something that
sort of looks like this you see it gets very very messy and now there's nothing like a restriction
on on relative velocities that is if I have two particles that are right next to each other at
one time at the next time step they could be as far apart from each other as you like they could
have separated any any amount this is the kind of discrete version of what we call Neo Newtonian
or Galilean space time if you're familiar with that terminology that's also not what we want
because one thing we know that relativity has in it are light cones it has a light cone structure
that somehow restricts how particles can move and this wouldn't have any restrictions so I don't like
that either well one doesn't work and infinitely many doesn't work I have a whole you know a lot of
things in between but it turns out that what works really nicely as we'll see is the next simplest
thing which is just for each event in this one plus one dimensional space time to have exactly two
successors right so you can as we're either move to the right or move to the left up one and then
move to the right or move to the left and then from from point a here you get something that
looks kind of like a light cone if you if from point a you always have to follow the area
arrows you'll always stay within a certain wedge that goes out diagonally and you'll notice there's
only one path we can now talk about connectivity path connectivity by which I mean how many
continuous paths connect a pair of points so from a there's only one way to get to d I got to go
through b um but from a there are two different ways I can get to e I can go abe or ac so this
again is just because this is discrete I can just count and look at the number of paths um
so this is going to turn out to be an absolutely essential quantity in this theory in this discrete
theory you have a counting measure you can count the number of continuous paths that connect any
two points or any two n elements and that's going to give you a finite number could be zero
could be one could be any number any finite number above that um now how do I count these
paths well let's just look at the one one plus one dimensional case it's familiar everybody knows
this from Pascal's triangle Pascal's triangle is just essentially counting continuous paths
from the apex down to any point in the middle so if you if you ask if I start at the top of
this triangle and I go down to one of the well at the bottom one of the ones marked 15 there are 15
different ways to get from the top down there you're essentially just counting paths um
now there's a lot I could say about one plus one dimensional space time but I want to go to two
plus one dimensions I don't have much time left I'm getting really to the point um in two plus one
dimensions what do we do well the two dimensional space is our taxi cab space and I'm going to do
the same thing I'm going to take the space I'm going to take a copy of it and kind of shift it
so that the middle of one square is above a dot below it and then each from each point below
I'll draw exactly four arrows out to the corners of that square so I get this kind of trust system
here's how it looks from above the cross hatch ones are below the solid dots are above and you'll
notice from every cross hatch one you have four arrows going out in four different as it were in
four different directions good and then I can just build that build that build that up into a huge
discrete space time structure now I want to talk about path connectivity in this structure
how do I count the pads between things instead of using Pascal's triangle you use this thing
called Pascal square base pyramid it's a nice thing I was unaware of it until I started doing this
but just imagine I have a bunch of cubes and I'm stacking them up on top of each other as here so
each cube rests on four below it and that rests on four below it and again I just want to count the
number of paths from the apex down to any cube I just add the numbers that are above
and work down that way it's a little hard to see in three dimensions but if I go down five levels
in this pyramid and cut through it this is what I would see level five of course along the four
corners there's only one path that goes down I've always got to go down that edge but the other
things you notice about this is it has two interesting features one is that along each edge
along each edge you have just Pascal's triangle those are the numbers from Pascal's triangle
which if you think about it a minute has to be because in order to stay along the edge you always
have to move in one of the ways you can move you always have to keep moving in that direction so
that takes it out and then the other interesting thing is you notice this is a this is a multiplication
table right that is the numbers in the interior you just get by multiplying the numbers along the
edges that intersect so the 24 you'll notice is at the intersection if you go up to the top say you
get a four and go to the side you get a six so it's just a multiplication table with the the
usual Pascal triangle numbers along the edges now suppose this gets really big as you would expect
if space space is discrete the level of discreteness is very very fine every day things are many many
many many levels up and we need to make a calculation about this and we're going to use
sterling's approximation which is a good approximation to the numbers you proper numbers
you get out of Pascal's triangle as those numbers get large you get closer and closer to a Gaussian
distribution which i've given you here uh and the main thing about it i i i want to calculate
path connectivity uh i know how to do it i use sterling's approximation for these numbers
which goes to a Gaussian which i've given you and if i ignore the normalization constants it's just
e to the minus x squared so along each edge the numbers distribute like e to the minus x
squared where x is the distance from the center of that out toward the side and therefore for two
plus one dimensions i have e to the connectivity at any given level will be some constant e to the
minus x squared times e to the minus y squared and that's e to the minus x squared plus y squared
now what you have to notice about that is that it tells you that on a given level of this
the connectivity to good approximation goes as x squared plus y squared so any two points
where x squared plus y squared are the same number the path connectivity will be essentially the same
but x squared plus y squared is the is the formula for Euclidean circle
so at the level of path connectivity strictly Euclidean structure is emerging
from this underlying structure that's as non Euclidean as you could imagine
the the underlying structure the underlying structure has uh preferred directions
the underlying structure again the the things that kind of correspond to circles are really
quadrilaterals but at the level once i put time in and i look at path connectivity and time
what emerges strictly is Euclidean structure with no preferred directionality and it gets better
that that's what happens if i look at path connectivity and i cut through my space horizontally
if i cut vertically in a one plus one dimensional space time in minkowski space the main structure
the structure of proper time the structure that defines relativity is going to be a hyperbola
which is given by the the quantity delta t squared minus delta x squared equals constant
and if we look at path connectivity in that way i haven't been able to derive it as cleanly but i've
done it numerically here's the exact formula if i go up to level n and i'm counting x from the center
point and x and y from the center points this is the exact formula and i can actually plug that in
and get numbers so if i go up 800 levels and i look at the very center and calculate the path
connectivity i get this number 3.5 times 10 to the 478 right that's big numbers because of the
combinatorics but just remember that 3 point something times 10 to the 478 so that's a dead
center 800 levels up now suppose i go 10 more levels up up to layer 8 10 and i want where i have to
move out from the center to get down to that connectivity so the connectivity is going up
along the center how far out do i have to move along the x axis well you just fool around with it
and you find the best approximation you can get is this one where i go out 75 units and there i now
have 3.1 times 10 to the 478 so the path connectivity from 800 to 8 10 750 800 0 0 to 8 10 750 is
essentially the same what if i go out along the diagonal so instead of going out along x i go
equally along x and y the nearest point is at 40 at 53 out and that gives me 3.3 times 10 to the 478
so the points 0 75 and 53 53 have about the same path connectivity and you'll notice that the square
of 75 is almost exactly the sum of the squares of 53 and 53 again euclidean circle is emerging
but now i can ask another question and i'm really almost done what in relativity what i expect are
these hyperbole to show up and if i go up from 8 10 now up to a thousand i go up to level a thousand
and i calculate where a relativistic hyperbole in a continuum would hit that level
i can get a number right it's a precise number 354.6 i round to 355 so in this discrete structure
i'm going to make a guess that the path connectivity if i go up to level a thousand should be about the
same if i go out 355 units over and when i actually plug it in here's the number i get
3.3 times 10 to the 478 so there's no doubt that relativistic structure is emerging
with no twiddling of knobs with no setting of any free constants almost precisely
the structure of relativity emerges at the level of path connectivity from this discrete
underlying structure that has a preferred foliation and so if that's what space and
time were really like and if the physics were sensitive to path connectivity the physics would
as it were appear to be in a minkostian space even though the underlying spacetime is as far as
imagine as far as possible as you can imagine from being that way now that's the end of this
story i will make one more comment another nice thing about discrete geometries like this is you
don't get singularities all you ever do or add finite numbers of finite quantities things can't
blow up so in in terms of cosmology the big bang can't be the beginning there would you would
what we would naturally say is that the problems that arise in general relativity of the emergence
of singularities can't happen here the problems that arise in quantum field theory of the emergence
of singularities can't happen here and so you would expect that the spacetime structure should
continue back and you should be able to figure out what was going on back before the big bang
if this is what's going on at the fundamental level so um sorry i thought i had an hour maybe i
didn't realize that i did finish within an hour and that's the end of the talk
so thank you so much for your talk i was thinking i will see at the end again the picture of your
of your seminar i missed it because when we announced your seminar you sent us a picture
uh yeah i thought you were gonna use that picture oh yeah we use it yeah yeah but i was thinking it
will be in your presentation well now i hope you see why that picture struck me as being so
relevant because that that geometrical figure is sort of there i see so uh we have three rise
tens let's take um massimum at materassi please massimo yes very quick because i am in a library
that is closing right now so uh my question is how far are you from general relativity
so how far are you from curving these checkered structures right that's a really yeah that's
a really good question what happens here is is the the thing that you think of as the light cone
which is an absolute limit to to that's constraining the particles this really looks like a square
base pyramid like an egyptian pyramid and in in order to get a round light cone you have to go
inside it a bit but if you go inside it then that gives you the possibility of a physics
where where you can bend these things to some extent um you can bend these conical structures
a little bit and stay within that square base pyramid so i haven't worked out the details
but you can sort of see how the basic idea of explaining gravitational effects by curvature
could be implemented here you won't get all of the possible general relativistic models right
you won't get things with closed timeline curves there would be a limit you would essentially
have a built-in limit to how much curvature you could have but you can sort of see how how that
would go once you make the sensitivity to path connectivity clear
we have a next question is from Luciano Bordelli
please yeah you're un-muted now you're un-muted can you hear me yes yes okay well the question is
in all this construction you have made the interesting speculation about the way in which
point connect each other but what is the role of the mass this is completely independent on
this parameter that is mass that in principle has an important role in the dynamics of particles
can you comment on that sure so the idea is is that mass typically appears
and this i mean the the the one place this wouldn't be true is in general relativity
but mass typically appears in the dynamical equations for the material objects for the
fields or particles or whatever what i'm giving you is a kind of spatiotemporal background
in terms of which those dynamical equations would be written and so the mass would appear in the
normal way in the dynamical equations and the dynamical equations themselves would be specified
with respect to this kind of fundamental discrete structure thank you one more question from Richard
Frenzy
yes hear me yes okay um you'll have to forgive me most of my almost all my research is on
classical optics for things in astronomy so i'm not used to thinking about this stuff but
i didn't see the connection between the non-mocality and the discrete space time structures
right how does the discrete space time explain non-locality right so explain explain would
be a little strong what i said was that um the easy way to implement non-locality is to have
is to have a global foliation that you can make reference to and that's what you lose in in relativity
well foliation what does foliation mean foliation means assigning a assigning a time to every
like so what's foliation right so it just means that the space time structure naturally resolves
into a series of of stacked sheets right now you could assign numbers to those sheets and call them
call them a global time it doesn't really matter it's what what's important is just
that you've you've resolved the space time into these stacked sheets so that you can
make precedence judgments about what happens before what and in this discrete space time
that sheet structure is there it's there from the beginning you don't add it it's it's a natural
part pretty much it's very hard to do a discrete structure that doesn't have a preferred foliation
to it so i i didn't explain exactly how you would plug that foliation i mean if you're doing the kind
of um a bomean thing that i talked about at the beginning you it's easy to see how you'd write
down the guidance equation using that foliation to specify the dynamics so what what you're saying
is that the non locality pops out well the non locality would would be a consequence of
the dynamics you write down i'm not saying that any no it's not that any dynamics here will be
non local but it's that if you have a non local dynamics and we seem to need it the easiest way
to specify one is by reference to a global foliation and here i'm giving you the global
foliation to use for that purpose so we have three more raised hands now we'd like to go
on to Keith horn okay yeah now you're unmuted thanks um you are relying on triangles for your
spatial units or sorry uh square squares quadrilaterals um is that fundamental in the theory
i mean you said you liked it but can you do it with triangles can you do it with hexagons etc
right that's it i mean that's a great question i what one there are very specific reasons why
i was forced to use quadrilaterals even before i got to the time part i mean i made this decision
when i was just doing the spatial stuff i can say that with with high confidence if i'd been using
triangles all along and you run these numbers they wouldn't come out anything like what i just
gave you that is you would not get the emergence of anything that looks relative to this you know
hexagons i you know i've basically only looked at one thing in detail which is the one thing i did
if it turned you know it would be interesting of course to find out that this is a generic phenomenon
um that many discrete structures would give you this emergence but my my guess from my
understanding of why i'm getting it is that actually you'll only get it if you use quadrilaterals and
then and then cubes so we have one more question now from norma sanchez
yes yeah you are unmuted good afternoon from paris thank you as i see from your presentation
connectivity and triangulation in some sense give to you the key ingredients for the output
you want the question is why this input because one can define perhaps other
i mean from the mathematical point of view other
connectivities other affiliations and then you you will not obtain that in my mind
in my mind i finish that and so in my mind the question of non relativistic or relativistic
is not the key point but the question is about the foliation or the discretization
and discretization of space space time is is an idea which has been also implemented
from quantum theory and i think that the key here the underline is the is a quantum theory
because even what you explained give me the remember of the path integral formulation
of quantum theory because if you don't take the the physical path said connecting one event in
another you don't reproduce quantum theory in the canonical wave and so on so i think that
this is interesting from the point of view of the discretization of space time perhaps from this
idea of the foliation but it could have a i mean there is a great a great path to do
to go to dynamics and to some physical another point and i finish is about the physical
parameters you i mean the physical or even mathematical parameters you need to introduce
here because there are some parameters the foliation or the discretization intrinsically
introduce a parameter i mean a distance and so on because we know also to go from quantum
from classical to the parameter or fundamental or constant and the same thing is
to going from non relativistic to relativistic so what if you obtain here relativistic from
non relativistic but that is not magic is is because there is in the non in the path connectivity
and foliation you have intrinsically a parameter which is here you need but
but is but is there if if you want to interpret in the physical terms thank you
yeah so so let me completely agree with one thing as a purely mathematical fact right so
there's a the purely mathematical fact that if i calculate path connectivity
in this structure i get a structures emergent structures that are very nearly isomorphic
to relativistic structures now does that make any different to physics well only if the physics
cares about path connectivity right and classical classical physics wouldn't right classical physics
that would just be you know an interesting observation maybe but of no physical significance
but of course you as you say you turn to quantum theory and you have the path
integral formulation which typically in a continuum isn't even well defined right because
i mean most of the paths are fractals but but quite independently of this you say gee actually
the path integral formulation suggests that path connectivity does play a central role in
quantum theory uh and and might be the kind of thing that the that the physics cares about right
responds to um now just to notice that is not to implement it but but that's right now it's
it's true that there have been other ways that people have tried to discretize things i mean
one thing is the so-called causal set approach which is also discretization but they they're
not doing this and they don't end up with anything that looks at all like this so just
discretization alone won't give that to you um and the last thing is you said well there's a
parameter i guess i really disagree i don't think i've put any parameters in i'm just using counting
measure um using counting measure doesn't mean that i i'm i'm assigning distances or anything i'm
just i have a discrete structure and i'm able to count it without adding anything to it and what
i get by counting in a certain way turns out to be i provably isomorphic right or or
emergently approximately isomorphic to structures that i get in relativity yes but but i agree i mean
but in in the in the distance so in the way you you you have the gaussian and i mean intrinsically
intrinsically you are using unit you are using parameter is equal to one you don't you don't
need to you don't need here but you have when you said the discretization well there is a
there is a limit in which in which um the discretized space time becomes continuous
and there is a length uh perhaps a a minimal length from which you can you you don't have
any more resolution so a parameter a parameter is intrinsically in in the way you are you have
affiliation because you have some distance and what is this distance
if you are talking about if you are talking about minkowski space in some in some sense
well if you talk about minkowski space intrinsically you are putting c equal one
yeah i i again i and i don't think i'll just say to actually specify the geometry here i mean
mathematically it's specified by an incidence matrix that just tells me which n elements bound
which n plus one elements if i if i in terms of the spatial geometry and then in terms of the
temporal geometry it's just which ones are immediate successors of which ones so all of
this would just be done by incidence matrices and and simple things that don't actually involve any
in any any distance parameter anything like that in their specification okay so um first of all
thank you so much dear team for again for having accepted our invitation and for your
talk it was very interesting for me there were so many questions that i had even zero time to
ask my own question i am sorry for massimo there is still one more rise 10 but he already asked
the question and i think it's time to finish the talk i would like to remind to the participants
to the listener that the next talk will be on the 15 next week on the 15 of september on an
infinite of words cosmic inflation at the beginning of the universe with willy kiné from the
university of buffalo in the usa so thank you again to all of you and thank you dear team for your uh
your talk
