Hello everyone, I am Dr. Anuj Kumar, Assistant Professor in Mathematics Department.
Students, from today's video lecture, we will start with module 2, unit 2, of discrete
mathematics or you can say of discrete structure and theory of logic.
And this portion is also in our Mathematics 3, so this video will be of Mathematics 3.
Module 1, unit 1, in which we have function, relation, set theory and along with it natural
numbers.
We have discussed all that, its already playlist has been made, so you will go to my YouTube
channel and go to the playlist of discrete structure and theory of logic, so you will
get all these video lectures of unit 1.
So the first topic in unit 2 is our binary operation Algebraic structure, which we are
going to discuss.
Students, let me tell you that module 2 is in our pure mathematics, unit 2 is in our
pure mathematics.
In this, our portion of mathematics will be 50% theoretical, you will get to see it.
And it is very easy, you just have to understand the starting lecture very well, because in
this whole module, everything will be linked with each other.
Okay, in today's lecture, I will tell you the binary operation Algebraic structure.
In the next video, we will discuss group, semi-group, group wide and quasi-group, these
things.
And after that, we will do some examples of the group, after that we will do some properties
of the group.
So, I mean, from the first day, from the first lecture, you have to understand this module
very well, then you will be able to understand it very well, because you will get a link
with each other from everything here.
So, let's start.
So, in today's video, we will discuss what is the binary operation and also how we can
define the algebraic structure from the binary operation.
The function that I had taught you in the last module, I used it to define the binary
operation.
If we talk about the binary operation, it is also called binary composition.
Here, I have written that binary composition on a set, right, binary composition on a set
or it can also be called binary operation on a set.
We define binary operation or binary composition on a set.
So, the definition is something like this, that we have led, we have led that yes, we
have a non-empty set, yes, we have a non-empty set, which means there is some element in it,
there is some element belonging to the set, then we can do this G Cartesian product
with G.
If we do G Cartesian product with G, then you know, in the Cartesian product set, you
will get an order pair element of AB type, right, and such that this AB element will belong
to both of our G sets.
So, if we remove G, then order pair element will belong to AB type and AB will belong
to us in G.
Now, we will define the binary operation from a function, we defined a function, then
a function, we defined a function here and gave the name of that function, we denoted
it in some books from O, right, so we gave the name of this function of this star and
this star is such a function which belongs to this Cartesian product set, which is G
cross G set, it will belong to G, how far will it go, G cross G set will belong to G
and how will we define it, that if this star function or mapping or operation, if we
put G cross G on any element, the element of G cross G that I told you, it will be in
order pair of AB type, so if you put this star operation on any element of G cross G,
we took an element AB, so after putting this on that element, it will operate between
both of them, that is A star B, you will get the value, if we put this function on any
element of G cross G on order pair AB, then one star B will operate with AB and this
A star B will get our element, it will belong to us in G too, because our function has gone
away, so A star B will belong to our element in G, so this is the definition of our binary
operation, which is defined from G cross G to G, if we put G cross G on any element,
then you will get the element of A star B and this element of A star B will belong to
G and this condition is for our four all AB belongs to G, so this function we defined
between A star G cross G to G, this is our binary operation or binary composition
is called G set, that is what I have written, it is called A binary operation on the set
G, on the set G, it is called binary operation, we call it binary because to put this operation
you need at least two elements, here we have taken two elements A and B, it can be on
A and B, so we need two elements, so we gave it the name of binary operation, binary composition.
If we talk about the figure, we can also see it from the figure that we believe G is a non-empty
set, this is our G cross G set and this is our G set and we defined a function between
them and we named that function as star and from where the star is defined, G cross G
set is defined to G, this is our function, star which is defined on these two sets and
how is it because G cross G set, which you know, in this our elements will be in order
pair, so we took an AB type element in it, okay, when your star function will apply on
this AB type element, then you will get an element of G, star AB on its surface,
star AB will be found and an element of G set will be found and how will it be found
that the operation star will apply on our A and B, and this A star B element will come
to our G, okay, so in this way, we can understand binary operation from the figure,
let's take some examples of it, like example number one I took here, the operation multiplication,
we took an operation which we named as multiplication, the dot which defines multiplication, the
operation dot on the set of real number is a binary operation, right, so the operation
multiplication if we apply on it, then on the set of real number, then it is a binary operation,
okay, how is it, this condition I told you above, remember that if you apply an operation on
any element of A cross B, the element you will get after operating should be of our G set,
right, so we will use the same definition here, here the operation is dot, which is defined on the
set, so R cross R will go to R, and how will it go, that if we apply this dot operation on
two elements of the pair, which will belong to two elements, this element will belong to your
R cross R, because it is a Cartesian product, so if we apply this operation on AB pair,
then what will it do, it will multiply our A and B, and the element that comes on AB
will belong to our R, then we say that this operation is our binary operation, okay, so
let's check this with an example, if R cross R is there, then R cross R will have many
elements because R is an infinite set, right, in this our 11 will be an element, 12 will be an
element, 23 will be an element, many elements will be there, 4, 5 will be an element, this way
infinitely will be an element, right, so if you apply this operation on all of them,
right, assume that you have applied this operation on 12, so when this operation will apply on 12,
then this, sorry, if you apply it on 11, then it will multiply with 1, which will be multiplied by 1,
and 1 is also a real number, this real number will belong to R, if you apply it on 12, then
if you apply it on 12, then it will multiply by 1 and 2, it will solve and come to 2, which is a real
number, if you apply this operation on 23, then it will multiply by 2 and 3, which will solve and come to 6,
6 is also a real number, so you can take any element and see, right, because if you multiply two
real numbers, right, 4 into 5 will get 20, 20 is also a real number, because you know that
when you multiply a real number, a real number comes to us, which means the operation of the multiplication,
which means the operation of the multiplication will work on the real number for the binary operation,
right, so on the set of the real number, the multiplication is the binary operation, because if we
apply mapping on any element of R cross R, we apply star function, the dot function is here,
we apply multiplication, so we get the element of R, and to check the binary operation, you have to see
that if you apply two elements after applying the operation, you get the element of the same set,
like R cross R, you apply the operation on it, you get the element of R, then we say there is a binary
operation, okay, so this is our first example of binary operation, let's take the second one,
the second one, we have defined the operation here plus addition, the operation plus on the set
of natural number, capital, natural number, capital N, we denote the natural number set from N,
which is a binary operation, okay, the addition is the binary operation on the N set,
how we can define the plus operation from N to N by the definition of binary operation,
and how it will be that if you apply the plus on any element of N cross N,
it will be the element of N cross N in A comma B pair, right, so what will it do, it will add
A B, it will add, and the element that comes after adding A B should belong to us in N itself,
okay, if it belongs to N, then this means that it is a binary operation, and that is the simple
thing, if you give the natural number set, then it belongs to your 2 and 3 element, if we apply the plus
operation on it, then it will do 2 plus 3, and 2 plus 3 will get 5, and 5 will also be our natural
number, if you apply it on 7 into 5, then it will add 7 plus 5, and 7 plus 5 will be 12, which
will belong to the natural number set, if you apply it on 12, then it will add 1 or 2,
it will add 3, which is the natural number, so take all the elements, 4 whole A B belongs to N,
the condition satisfies, all the natural numbers belong to us in N, the condition will satisfy for everyone,
that if you apply this operation on any pair, then the element that comes after applying the operation
will always go to the natural number, this means the plus operation is the binary operation on the
natural number set, next example, example number 3, now here the example is that if we take the
operation minus, then the set of natural number, if we take the natural number set minus, then it is
not a binary operation, this is our binary operation, if we take the natural number set minus, then
it will not be a binary operation, let's check it, if it is defined as minus, then it will go from N cross
N to N, and let's check that why the minus is not a binary operation, the natural number set,
you know that this element starts from 1 to 1, it goes from 1 to 3 to infinite, or you already know,
so now what do we do, let's take an element, we took the element 2 and 3,
because we will belong to N cross N, this element will belong to N cross N, if we apply minus
operation on this, then the element will get 2 minus 3, and 2 minus 3 means minus 1, and minus 1
never belongs to the natural number set, and what is the definition of the binary operation,
that if you have defined the star operation from G cross G to G, then the element that comes after
applying this star operation will belong to our G, and you can see that what we have taken
2-3 pairs here, we have applied minus operation on it, then you got minus 1, 2 minus 3 value
minus 1, which does not belong to the natural number set, this means that our minus is our
binary operation, it is not on the natural number set, okay, you just have to check for the binary
operation, that if we apply any operation on two elements, then the element that comes after us
should also belong to our set, if it belongs to the set, then it is a binary operation, if it
goes out of the set, then it is not a binary operation, for example, we have discussed example
number 3, so these are the few examples of binary operations, then in the next video,
we will use the property in the group, which is the closure property, which we call closure
lobby, we call it closure lobby, what is the closure property, we define it from the
binary operation itself, right, if star is a binary operation on the set G, if we take star
as a binary operation, which is defined on set G, then by the definition, what will happen
that star will be defined from G cross G to G, in such a way that if we apply this star
operation on any pair of G cross G, then you will get an element of A star B type and that
element will also belong to our G, and this condition 4 all A B belongs to G, okay, if
it comes like this, then we can say that we took two elements of G, we applied operation on them,
and after applying operation, if our element comes to the same set, then we say that G is
closed under binary operation star, and if G is closed under binary operation star, then G
closure property will satisfy it, okay, we can define it with the help of binary operation, if
star is a binary operation, then it will hold the closure property, right, we can write it in this
form too, that 4 all A B belongs to G, okay, if we take A star B, then that element should also belong
to our G, right, if this happens, that is, if we apply star operation on all the elements of G,
and the element that comes when we apply operation will go to our G, then we say that the closure
property is satisfied there, right, and G is our closed under binary operation,
next definition is your algebraic structure, what is the structure of algebraic structure,
in non-empty set capital G together with one or more binary operation, if we
write non-empty set G with one or more binary operation, then we say that it is our algebraic
structure, right, for example, for example, we have considered, for example, we have defined that
the n and the addition, what is the addition on it, the binary operation is on the natural number,
so it will be an algebraic structure, if we take n and take operation minus, then this
will not be an algebraic structure, because minus is not the binary operation on the natural number,
right, so this will not be our algebraic structure, and if we look at the rest, the integer set plus
it has binary operation, right, if you take the real number set, then plus and multiplication
also has binary operation on it, because two real numbers multiply and a real number comes,
two real numbers come together and a real number comes, two integers come together and an integer comes,
so these are all binary operations, and the set of the real number will also form a binary
operation, plus in respect to multiplication, because two real numbers will come together and a real
number will come, multiplying and a real number will come, so if we write a set of one or more
binary operations like this as a pair, then that is what we call an algebraic structure,
okay, so leaving this n minus here, right, all the other examples I have written,
okay, so we will use the definition of algebraic structure in the next video,
so in the next video, this basic concept that I have told you is going to be very useful,
so you should understand it well, whatever I will make it a lecture of module 2,
every one of them will have a link lecture, so you should prepare all the lectures well,
if you want to understand this module well, there is a lot, if you see all the lectures sequentially,
then the theorem that will come in this, the theorem is most of the theoretical proof,
there is no calculation, there is no process, just use the concept and prove it,
and to prove it, you should have the knowledge of it, right, how will the knowledge be,
when you understand each video very carefully, so that's it for today's video, in the next video,
I will tell you all this in the next video, thank you for watching and students,
