1. **Closure Property**: A set G is closed under a binary operation * if for every pair of elements (a, b) in G, the result a * b is also an element of G. This property is essential for the structure of a group because it ensures that the operation's domain is self-contained and consistent.

2. **Algebraic Structure**: An algebraic structure is defined as a non-empty set G equipped with one or more binary operations. The set G and the binary operation(s) together form an algebraic structure. For example, the set of natural numbers (N) with addition is an algebraic structure, but the same set with subtraction is not, because subtraction is not a binary operation on N (since it may result in an element not in N).

3. **Binary Operation**: A binary operation on a set G is a function that takes two elements from G and produces another element in G. For example, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are all binary operations on the set of real numbers, but only addition, subtraction, and multiplication are binary operations on the set of natural numbers (since division can result in a fraction, which is not a natural number).

In the next video, we will use these concepts to explore more about groups, specifically focusing on the group axioms that define the structure of a group. The closure property will be crucial in this context, as it is one of the axioms that every element in a group must satisfy under the group's binary operation.

To ensure a thorough understanding of these concepts, it's recommended to watch all the lectures related to module 2 sequentially. The upcoming theorem that will be discussed is theoretical and relies on these foundational concepts. It does not involve any calculations or processes but rather uses these ideas to prove properties within the context of algebraic structures.
