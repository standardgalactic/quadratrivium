Checking Qualia Research Institute/Frank Yang on the Symmetry Theory of Valence.txt
Your reflections touch upon the transition from a state of conventional awareness, characterized by a centralized focus of attention and perception, to a more enlightened or "awakened" state where consciousness is experienced as more integrated and balanced. You draw parallels between this transformation in consciousness and the principles of symmetry found in aesthetically pleasing human features, art, music, and even in phenomena like mirror reflections where a symmetrical arrangement leads to an infinite recursion that seems to cancel itself out.

You suggest that in a highly awakened or enlightened state, all forms of perception—sensory experiences, emotions, thoughts, and body sensations—are experienced directly and evenly, without the mediation of a central self or ego. This state of being is characterized by a profound balance and symmetry, where the individual sense experiences are recognized as aspects of a larger, interconnected whole.

Furthermore, you posit that this ultimate symmetrical state, where all dualities and distinctions have dissolved, is akin to death or Nibbana (Nirvana) in Buddhist terms—a state beyond suffering, beyond individual experience, and beyond the fabrications of the conditioned mind. In this view, true symmetry in consciousness represents an absence of self and a cessation of all perceptions, leading to a state of profound peace and unity with the universe.

In summary, your perspective is that the journey from pre-awakening to full awakening mirrors the movement from an asymmetrical, fragmented perception of reality to a symmetrical, holistic experience of being, where the boundaries between self and other dissolve, leading to a state of ultimate peace and unity with the cosmos.
