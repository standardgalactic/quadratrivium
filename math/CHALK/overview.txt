Checking CHALK/SEPARATION BUT MATHEMATICALLY： What Types of Mathematical Topologies are there？ ｜ Nathan Dalaklis.txt
1. **T0 (Kolmogorov):** The weakest separation axiom. Two points are separated if they have different closures.

2. **T1 (Hausdorff):** Each point has a neighborhood around it that contains no other points. Also, for every point and every neighborhood of that point, there is another neighborhood (possibly the same) which does not contain any other point.

3. **T2 (Tychonoff or Hausdorff and Regular):** For every pair of distinct points, there exist disjoint neighborhoods. Plus, for each point and each neighborhood containing that point, every neighborhood with non-empty intersection with the original neighborhood also intersects the closure of that point.

4. **T3 (Regular):** For every point and every closed set not containing that point, there exists a neighborhood of the point which does not intersect the set.

5. **T3½ (Frechet-Urysohn or Normal):** Every family of closed sets with the finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection. This implies T2 and T3.

6. **T4 (Completely Normal):** Every pair of disjoint closed sets can be separated by a function. This implies T2, T3, and T3½.

7. **T5 (Completely Normal and Accessible):** A space where every pair of separated sets can be separated by a Urysohn space-continuous function. It is also called completely T4.

8. **T6 (Perfectly Normal and Accessible):** A space that is both T4 and T2 in the sense that for any two disjoint closed sets, there exists a perfect set (a closed, uncountable subset of the space) separating them, which can be separated by a function. It is also called perfectly T4.

In this video, Nathan Mott explained these separation axioms in the context of topological spaces and provided examples to illustrate each concept. These axioms help define the properties of the spaces and are fundamental in the field of point-set topology.
