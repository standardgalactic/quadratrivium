Right, so today I'm Munson, by the way, I'm right now. I just arrived at Stanford University. I'm with psychiatry
But all the work I'm going to show you today has been done in the Center for Complex System and brain science at that Florida Atlantic University
So I'm going to talk about
The my obsession that is how multiple agents can through their simple interaction form complex collective patterns
So a little bit outline of this is first I will talk about what do I mean by complex systems?
Because everyone in complexity science means a different thing when they say complex systems
So everyone has their own story at their own origin. So I will tell you a little bit about what I think
What complex system is to me?
So and then how does it relate to multi agent coordination?
What is it and what are the relevant existing studies?
And then I will show you a human experiment that I conducted
That that was designed to study the coordination between eight people
and
Then I develop a model to capture the observed phenomenon in this experiment and
Then I observe some really complex dynamics in the experiment
So I want to think a little bit theoretically about how I can really systematic or crackerize these dynamic patterns based on their topological
properties and then eventually I develop a method to actually quantify these
Dynamic patterns and detect the changes in the dynamic coordination patterns using topological data analysis
So first of all what is complex system?
What is a complex system?
How does it have anything to do with multi agent coordination?
So it started with undergraduate trauma. I was in a medical school studying pharmaceutical science
These are all my undergraduate
textbooks most of them are in Chinese so probably don't know what it is
But in short it consists of a like a large piles of
Disciplines so what really confused me was that well, we're talking about one system that is called the human being and
What you have is a catalog of all the piecemeal informations
Locally on different spatial temporal skills, but none of these textbooks actually told me how is a human being work across all these spatial temporal skills together
So what exactly is the kind of complex system I'm interested in so I really like this quote
From wedding things book over how animals develop
So he said well leaving animals are constantly on the move and
They are also made up of smaller
Elements of that's called organs and in all the organs there is something going on all the time
And these organs are built out of cells and there are always some
Chemical action and reactions in those cells so he said two things about these kind of complex systems
One is they have multiple levels of description. They cannot necessarily be reduced to one or another
The second one is that they are highly dynamical on these multiple levels of descriptions
The question is how
Does this kind of system emerge?
So he went out saying that in leaving organism these dynamics are not isolated
They adjust you to one another so that the right thing can be done at the right time and right place
so is
The way that we're so impressed with how these innumerable separate processes work together
We called animals organisms and if there is a secret of life it is here
We must look for it is among the causes that brings about the arrangements of innumerable separate processes in the single
harmonious
Leaving organisms so here we see is that how many components can work together to become one integrated system
through coordination
so the key question is what kind of
lock of coordination
Can integrate separate individuals in the collective and the collective on the other hand can constrain the activity of
these individual to form complex systems and
A collective relative to one levels of description
Can be individuals relative to another levels of description and
Indeed if we think about the collective of leaving animals
We have social organisms as after my painful years studying
Pharmaceutical science and went on to study criminology and find out the same theme has been repeated in criminology
so I
Really like this quote from a cut to lay he said the society itself contains the germs of crime
It is a collective that is
Constraining the amount of crime that happened that's happening in the society
criminals the individuals are simply the instruments that carries them out and
Cohen said and these criminal subcultures
Where emerged has emerged from the mutual
Exploration or joint action of
Individuals and the crime sometimes is a formation that might not have been anticipated about any of the individuals
So the collective pattern is truly a
emergent phenomenon on the group level
So the complex system
That I'm interested in has both the characteristic of being have multiple levels of description
They are dynamical and they have emergent behavior at higher levels of description
So the fun part has been done now
I think oh I can't need to quantitatively study this stuff what are the laws of coordination and
Under what condition they can give rise to this kind of complex systems in principle
So well at first I need to think of a dynamical process
That is generally enough that it can transcend multiple levels of description
It's not substance specific. It's not level specific. So I
chose rhythmic processes
Human has been fascinated by rhythmic coordination
through all ages from the motions of stars and to the heartbeats
So I want to reveal some of the major theories that exist before my study and
To give you an impression of where we are on studying the rhythmic coordination in relation to complex systems
so first of all
We talk about large large scale rhythmic coordination and the key examples are
synchronization of many fireflies in the forest and
Synchronization of heart cells and people clapping in the audience
So the classical model is a criminal model. It describes how individual
individuals are entrained by a collective rhythm and the individuals here are
coupled phase oscillators theoretically
So what are phase oscillators?
so it assumes that each individual is
This is whose dynamics is completely described by its face the face of each individual is much like an arm
On a clock. So where the arm is pointing indicates where's the phase of this particular oscillator and also like a clock the model
entails multiple phase oscillators like the Claus era multiple arms on the clock, but there's something that's different
Between the model for a model model and the clock is that these oscillators are in fact coordinated or interacting
So to describe the collective behavior of this multiple individuals
We can take a vector mean of all these individual oscillators and that gives us the collective
Oscillator and when the system is in the disorder state meaning they're spreading out around the circle
The collective oscillation is really weak the amplitude of the collective oscillator is really small
So if their interaction is strong enough these oscillators will align themselves
Together and this is an orderly state and correspondingly the collective oscillator have a relatively large amplitude
indicated by the by the size of the length of the vector here
So mathematically speaking
the Coromoto says that the rate of change of each in the
Individual oscillator is a function of its relative phase to other oscillator
So what this term is saying that every oscillator is attracted to another?
Oscillators phase so they want to be aligned with each other and how strong that feeling is is dependent on the coupling strip
between them and
How much they want to go on independently is determined by the natural frequency of the oscillators
Meaning if they're not coupled attracted to other oscillator, they will keep this omega i at their own pace
When some mathematical transformation we can rewrite the system into this form it means that every oscillator is essentially
Want to reduce its distance to the collective phase is this angle here that they are entrained by the collective oscillator
So
What is what is interesting about the system to many theories is a
Transition between the disorder state to the order state. So we want an emergence of order
And this is dependent on a critical level of coupling strength
And how much this coupling strength is needed for the system to become?
In order is dependent on how dispersed this natural frequency of the individuals also with or sorry
The problem is I have with the model is that this is all there without complexity
Once they enter in this state
They are all aligned with each other. They are no longer separable plot processes. They're not doing anything different
But this model has been shown to capture a lot of empirical phenomenon
Over the past 20 years. So what has been missing in the empirical experiments?
So it turns out that in the past empirical experiments of large-skill coordination people often only measure the collective
Amplitude they never actually look too much into the micro level dynamics of these
Oscillators the reason is there are too many oscillators. It's not very easy to detailly study every
Relations relative phases in the system. So well people can study smaller skill, right?
But when people study smaller skill rhythmic coordination, they turn to
Relate small skill normally is less than four oscillators and the most obvious
examples are animal gaze patterns
and
Essential difference from the larger coordination in percol study of large skill coordination
We're focused on multiple possible coordination pattern. We don't just have one order this day
We have multiple order these states for example a walking dog
So if you look closely
You will find out that the front leg of front legs of these dogs are oscillating opposite to each other
This is an anti-face and the front and high hind leg both the black legs
They are oscillating in faith with each other. It's traditionally synchronizing
But if the dog walks a little bit faster at certain point
You'll find out the phase relation between the front and hind leg will become
Anti-phase and if it goes faster
The relation between front legs will become synchronized rather than an anti-face
So for animal gaze at least for dog
We have multiple stable patterns that we can use for different functional needs
So unlike the RCO coordination, which only have one single order
and the example I'm going to show you in terms of modeling is the Hawken-Kelsov-Boone's model is
Describes a empirically observed phenomenon between the coordination between two components
It can be two fingers, two legs, or two neuronal populations
So initially this model was proposed to study bimanual coordination
So you can oscillate your finger in anti-phase or in in-phase much like the dog's legs
So here the collective
Pattern here is relative phase is the difference between the two oscillators that are coordinating and
It can be in-phase or they're aligned or it can be anti-phase when they're opposite to each other
Both of them are orderly states
So the interest at the main major interest of studying this model and relevant
Empirical experiments is the transition between orderly state to orderly state
So this model
Describes the dynamics of relative phase between two oscillators
We should look rather familiar because this is also a function of the relative phase between two oscillators
and
It is also dependent on the difference between the frequency difference of these two oscillators and
It depends on the coupling strength between the oscillators
But here what is difference is what is different is there is a second order coupling strength this term here
This term turns out to be critical in reproducing the phenomenon observed in experiments of both
Anti-phase and in-phase patterns are stable
This is a time series of the relative phase between two oscillators
It says that if the system start near anti-phase
The trajectory will go into anti-phase and stay there if the system start near in phase
It will go into in-phase and stay there
So whether the system is in-phase in-phase or anti-phase depending on initial condition when I started with
and
There are important parameters here as I said if we manipulate these coupling strength of the system
In particular when you pull it if we manipulate how strong the second order term is relative to the first one
We will see if the coupling strength ratio is strong enough
You will have both
Attractors stable that is a region of bi-stability
But if the ratio is small enough, but this is a reverse axis this side is small
Only the in-phase attractor is stable that the system only have one stable state or we can say is mono stable
Well, if we change the frequency difference between the system
We'll find out for small difference between these two oscillators. You will still have two stable states
And if we increase it further the weaker anti-phase pattern will disappear first and the system become
mono stable and if we further increase the difference between two oscillators
You will find out the relative phase start running forward and non-stopping
But if you look closely, you will find that
This relative phase actually dwell for a longer period of time near those other tractors that are near in-phase and
Anti-phase so we call this pattern meta stable coordination
So I also have problem with this model. Why is that?
It has complex behaviors, but it doesn't have multiple levels of description. I only have one variable
How can I have multiple levels of description? This is by the way the work of my PhD advisor. So I'm like, oh, this is not good enough
So I decided I needed a skill experiment
So the reason is I want a system that's large enough so I can examine the dynamics on
Multiple levels of descriptions at the same time, but it's also not too big to study the micro level dynamics
So I did this experiment that I called a human firefly experiment for reasons will become apparent
So I designed a new paradigm where I asked subject to come into the lab
Eight of them sit around a table. I
Give each of them a little touch pad that they can tap on I will record their tapings
And I also give each of them an LED array with a lies
So the flashing of each light will reflect their own tapping in real time or taps of others in real time
Or I can substitute you these lights with metronome so I can manipulate how fast you're tapping and
What's the initial phase there at when they're starting to interact?
So this allows me systematically
manipulate the frequency of phase of individuals and
I can also manipulate the coupling through the network connectivity among them
So these are all critical variables that I've told you in the classical models of rhythmic coordination
And now I can really manipulate them systematically to elicit phenomenon of coordination behavior at different spatial temporal scales
So in the real experiment that I did
Oh
No, that's too far
Okay
So in the in the human experiment I did I collected data from 120 subjects for each trial
They were first paced for 10 seconds by
Metronomes and then I've removed the metronome and they're allowed to interact with each other through the flashing of LEDs and touch pads for 50 seconds
Their task was to continue tap to tap at the metronome frequency
During this fifth sec 50 second period. They were not asked to intentionally coordinate with other people
So all the observation were spontaneous coordination
So this is a replay of a real trial where everyone was paced with the same metronome
So it looks like five lives in the dark
But I said I want to manipulate
The system such that it might have coordination at different skills
So I assigned a metronome is a little bit differently
So I signed each of four person the same metronome
So this people were labeled with the same color were paced with the same metronome
And I manipulate a frequency difference between these two groups such that I can induce the segregation and integration
Between two frequency groups and observe what's happening on the intergroup level intro group level and micro dynamics
So first of all I want to show you the dynamics observed real dynamics observed in this
experiment
I'm going to start with
One particular dyadic relative phase. This is remember embedded in a larger group
So you will see
This pair
Subjects three and four their relative phase stuck in phase for in very long time about 30 seconds
Before this switch to anti phase
So this I've shown you in earlier studies of small scale coordination. This is a sign of bi-stability
Yeah
So so remember they were paced for 10 seconds by a metronome
So these two were paced by actually by the same metronome of the same frequency
So when they see each other, they were supposed to imagine a lay tap at particular like say 1.5 first
And they were asked to maintain
Keep tapping at 1.5 first while looking at the LED array. That's the only instruction. It's a very simple instruction
Frequency yes, they were not instructed to do this
this is a spontaneous behavior and
So let's look at another pair. So this pair
After they started they quickly go to in phase and dwell there for a while
But quickly escape from it and stop any in phase again the next time they pass by it
So I told you about this before it is called meta stable coordination. So they never stuck in any phase
They recurrently visit particular
configurations
So well all these stuff that I've already talked about in small scale coordination. So well, we're done
I didn't find anything new, right?
But if we look closer at the
First relative phase, we'll find out that there are some bumps in this relative phase near in phase in the periodic fashion
So I was thinking well, why is that? Where are their bumps in this? We've never observed this in dyadic interaction
So you may have guessed it that these are from the same trial
it turns out that
Every bombs in the yellow relative phase follows right after it dwells in the pink relative phase
What essentially says that every time that the person one is coming close to person three in phase
It caused a perturbation on the relation between three and four
Or metaphorically, I said me and my boyfriend has been in a long-term relationship
at in phase
But there there's another girl that's keep calling him three times
Every time it's longer than the previous one and that creates some
perturbation on my relationship with my boyfriend eventually. I was so paced off I flipped the anti
So more is different in a social sense
More of multiple agents
Interacting agents give rise to multiple relations and these relations going to compete with each other and
Give rise emergent behavior that has not been observed in a dias alone
You might also have observed that none of these relations are actually totally stable
They simply dwells and different time scales
One is longer the other is shorter but recurrent
When we have more relations in the system
we will have even more different time scales involved in the dynamics and the results is that the system will switch between
Different spatial patterns in a complicated way, which well we return to a later time. What does it mean?
But for now in aggregates
If I plot the distribution of a relative phase between all the dias
In the group I will find out that there is a strong in phase peak at zero
and there's a very small anti-phase peak at pi and
Both of these peaks are decreasing with the diversity that I introduced in these groups and the anti-phase
was the first to go and
On the microscopic level, I told you I manipulate the frequency difference between these groups at the largest difference
Between groups we see now. This is a frequency dynamics of these two
These eight persons you can see that the ensembles has clearly differentiated into a frequency group at around two hertz
And another frequency group around 1.2 hertz
Well, if we decrease the difference between the two groups
You can still see there are one groups at higher frequency the other group by lower frequency
but there are much more interaction between them and
I even lower of if there is no frequency difference that I input into the system. They just form one super group
to quantify this I
Study the relation
Between all the dyadic couplings within groups and how it relates to dyadic couplings between groups
For example, when there's no frequency difference
if the
Coordination within group increase it will correspond to a similar increase in intergroup coordination. I
Define that the slope of this regression line is the levels of integration between two groups. I
Said if the slope is positive
Meaning if more within group coordination
They rise to more intergroup coordination the two groups are more or less integrated and this is a case for both
low and intermediate diversity and
if
the slope is negative as
For the case of high levels of diversity it means that more intergroup coordination
Lead to less intergroup coordination. It leads to segregation
So I can say well, what is the critical levels of diversity that differentiate the regime of integration and segregation I
Can interpolate and find out is about 0.5 Hertz
and
If I only look at the dynamics within
The these groups remember I only manipulate the difference between group, but I want to study if the outside
Changed the inside of the groups and in fact it did
So when there are more intergroup differences you have a different group out there it reduce your cohesion within the group
So just to summarize I showed you in multi-aging case
How matter stability can give give rise of spatial temporal matter stability?
It means the group will switch between different complex spatial patterns sequentially and
On the dyadic level I showed you there are strong in-phase tendencies and weak anti-phase tendencies and
I also showed you some results at the intergroup level and intergroup level
So now I want to model these phenomenon mathematically
So what I want to do is the simplest model possible to capture three important quantitative results that are observed in
dyadic level
intergroup level and intergroup level and
After some tinkering around
I found out the simplest model that can reproduce all this phenomenon on multiple levels of descriptions take this form
It says the dynamics of individual oscillators is a function of their relative phase not surprisingly and
It depends on a coupling strength of the first-order coupling and
the strength of the second-order coupling
So
You should think this is a rather familiar because if I set the first I remove the second-order coupling
This is simply the coral model model that I've showed you earlier
If I set the number of oscillators and to two then it will derive extended HKB model for small scale coordination
So this is a result comparison between human behavior and model behavior
For intergroup relation, which are reflected by the slope of these regression lines
And we also were able to reproduce the reduction of integral coordination due to the presence of integral difference
and on the dyadic level the model show both in-phase and anti-phase peaks and these peaks are reducing their
amplitude with the increasing diversity
So well
Then my commenter member at a time asking me well if you can just use coral model model get the same results
Why not use coral model model because they're more famous, right?
So I said okay, I will try it
So it turns out that
If I use the coral model model it will give me a really fat in-phase peak and there will be a trough at anti-phase
And it turns out that to reproduce
The empirically observed phenomenon you cannot get rid of the second order coupling. So the question is what does it do?
What does it tell us about coordination in complex systems
So it turns out that the ratio between so how big the second order coupling relative to the first order of coupling
Would determine whether the system is model or multi stable
So there is a critical coupling ratio such that if the coupling ratio is below one
The system only have all in-phase states. This is a mono stable system
And if the coupling ratio is greater than the critical value the system can stay at any
combinations of in-phase and anti-phase
So the number of stable states is actually 2 to the n where n is the numbers of oscillators
It means that a systems complexity sort of amount of possible behavior will grow exponentially with the size of the system
Well, if you have a mono stable system the complexity of the system does not grow at all when the system grows and
This critical ratio itself that differentiated domain of no complexity and complexity
Is actually invariant across skills
So it in this sense connects the emergence of
complexity across skills
So the summarize I showed you a model that captures experimental phenomenon and multiple levels of description
And reconciled to well-studied models of large and small-scale coordination
And I also also shows that a critical coupling ratio can connect the emergence and growth of
The behavioral complexity of the system across skills
So now time to wake up. I told you earlier that these system
Exhibit spatial temporal metastability. It means they switch from different spatial patterns sequentially one question
We can ask is our visitors random noise
Maybe they're just you know switching randomly from one patterns to another. There is really nothing funny about it
so I will show you a
Systematic way to look at these patterns from a topological way
So first of all we want to start with some at the simpler case. Let's say there are only two oscillators
When there are only two oscillators their relation can be described by a single relative phase which leads on the circle and if there are
They stays in the fixed point. It takes a topology of a point on this circle
However, if the system became metastable is start wrapping around the circle
It takes a topology of the circle, which is the topology of the space itself
And there's only one type of matters they would pattern topologically speaking
Which is constrained by the underlying space of two oscillator problems
Well, if we go into the coordination between three oscillators, we can characterize
the relation between three oscillators with two relative phases
so three two relations and
We can plot
I would say the location around the large circle on the Taurus
Indicate the value of one relative phase and the location around the small
Circle represent the value of another relative phase in this three triadic coordination
So now I say well, I want to do a thought experiment
I
Said what if I think of a three oscillator system if one oscillator is
Naturally at zero hers the other one at one hers and I have a third oscillator
If this oscillator has the same frequency with the first oscillator
They will become synchronized and they may coordinate
Metastable a with the second oscillator
They will get this will give us a simple topology of a large circle on the Taurus
meaning here's a relative phase between
Lambda and oscillator at zero is constant over time. Yes
You know, it's a relative phase remember is three oscillators are moving at different frequencies and I'm talking about relative phase
Yeah, because right now I said these two oscillators to have the same intrinsic frequency. So they're just stuck together at zero phase and
Symmetrically if I made this oscillator the same as a bull oscillator here
This system was simply circle around the small circle here here the relative phase between
Oscillator at one hers and oscillator at lambda hers will become constant
What was puzzling to me is that you cannot actually deform this loop
Continuously into this one because there are topologically not equivalent
So the question is how can topologically to topologically distinct loops can change into each other under a continuous change of the parameter lambda?
a
natural frequency of the third oscillator
So I did some numerical experiments
So I choose a coupling strands to be snot enough such that the three oscillators are not synchronized at any moment in time
and I also want to
Quantitatively talk about these dynamic patterns
So I assigned them some winding numbers
the winding numbers means that
Here zero one means this
Pattern circle around the large circle for zero times while circles around a small circle for one time and
Symmetrically I can assign this pattern a number one zero
So the first thing I observe is for a wide range of change of the third oscillator
The variable oscillator the topology itself of the pattern does not change at all
Even though the curve has been deformed and shifted it assumed the same topology and
This topological information can also be seen in their frequency dynamics in terms of the clustering of the black line with the blue
or the red line here
These are what I call the partial metastable coordination patterns because there are still two oscillators are more or less synchronized
These two oscillators the blue and black here. They are not metastable
So this is a partially metastable pattern. The question is can we find purely metastable pattern where none of the oscillator are synchronized?
Yes, indeed we can find in between that this
Pattern of type 1 1 meaning as one relative phase go through 2 pi the other relative phase also go through 2 pi and
Gives you a symmetric pattern in the frequency dynamics. I call these purely metastable patterns
There is an interesting thing in the relation between the patterns and the relation between the numbers
If you look closely if I add these two numbers together
Two tuples together you will get 1 1 in the middle and you can have you happen to be able to find this pattern of type 1 1
between the corresponding
frequency parameter
So I said well, can we reproduce this relation?
and
Indeed if we say we add these two
Topological type to back together. We should be able to find some patterns between these two. That's of the type 1 2
and
We can find this pattern indeed and it looks very much like the concatenation between this pattern and this pattern and
In the frequency dynamics, you can see this is a concatenation in time of one period of the pattern above and one period of pattern below
symmetrically so
for
The other case when the oscillator 3 is closer to the lower oscillator
So there are multiple
Metastable on patterns and before I left I was working with a mathematician
We were trying to study how there are infinitely many possible patterns
emerging between these two values
So these patterns have never been observed in
Diatic coordination, so these are really truly
emergent complex order of phenomenon coming out of just three oscillators and
More interestingly we can categorize or think about them systematically in terms of relation between their topological types
So have shown you that triadic example very simple model of three oscillators
Demonstrate a power of when we combine
Metastable coordination that's initially observed in diatic interaction when we add more relation into the system
We can generate infinitely many complex coordination patterns
and
I give a topological way preliminary way at least to think about these patterns systematically and
The next step was really to say well in real data. How do we analyze these patterns?
We don't have a priori knowledge about the mechanism of that's generating these patterns
So I first want to tell you what's the difficulty in analyzing the real data in terms of real
Dynamics, so this is a boyfriend girlfriend example that I showed you early. This is a rather simple
simply
Visualizable trial where we can see the system
Repeatedly visited a same pattern meaning everyone was in phase for three times between 10 seconds and 40 seconds
And before that they were doing something else after that they were doing something else. You can see this information
because there are not many agents and
All these relative phase are relative close in free in the time seal at which they evolve
Well, if we go to eight people
We can describe them by seven different relative phases
You can immediately see it's a little bit
bit of a headache
the reason is first of all there are too many relations and
They also evolve on very different time skills. So the flatter one I labeled I thicken the flatter lines
They're evolving on slower time skills and in the background. There are steeper lines are evolving in the much faster time skills
Well, even if I plot these mass on the separate axis
I you know split of seven different axes you still wouldn't be able to tell how these dyadic relations are actually forming a global structure
So I turn to a very traditional way of visualizing high-dimensional dynamical system. That's called a recurrence plot
So this is a recurrence plot of this triadic example
So a recurrence plot the color here indicates how similar the state of the system at one point 20 seconds is similar
To a the state of the system at another time point for example 25 seconds
So here you can see a grid of three by three grid that represent the three
Recurrence of the same pattern that we observe in the dynamics and before and after it was something relatively different
So well, okay, it tells it nothing new
Can it help us with the eight person example?
I'm not sure it looks at as much a mess as
Before when I just show you all these squiggly curves
So we need some new tools to deal with these dynamics that are highly complex
So I have an idea what about when we're having the original dynamics
I do not study the recurrence of the state variable of themselves or the relative phase himself
instead and analyze some talk topological features of in these dynamics and
construct some topological portrait of the dynamic patterns and
They study the recurrence of those topological features instead
So
Why does topology matters here?
Well, I showed you a little bit theoretically before but here
I want to talk a little bit more generally about
Multi-steal structure, which I'm highly interested in and how can we understand multi-seal structures with topology?
And this feature figure you should seen that many in many places in psychology article, etc
People will ask you well, is this a B or is it is this many a's?
Well, in fact, it's both at one skill
You can see this in a finer skill
You can say this many a's and a larger skill you can say this is one B
So the description of the system is skill dependent much like leaving systems
Well, how can we study this a little bit more concretely so we can
Characterize a skill of this system by blowing up each pixels in this figure
So we can see at finer skills
We can still see the a's are here
But gradually at the intermediate skill these a's are becoming blobs and they form a big B and a very large skills
The holes in B's are filled in and you just have a one single blob
So the these are called the connected components when they're connected
Together and these holes are called loops
so we can look at the loops and
Connected components in these series of structures to figure out how the system is skill dependent for example
The loops the smaller loops in a only presents a smaller skill
we may be able to draw these
Represent these loops as little bars at which skills they present they're present and
The loops in B's are however, they're only present in larger skills and both of them disappear at even larger skills
So with this collection of bars
We can call them a barcode and they gave a multi-skill topological portraits
Of this particular figure that I showed you and there is a precise mathematical tool to let you do that
It's called persistology, which I didn't show at the beginning because I think it's scary when I first time saw it
But this is the essence of what persistology really is
Now we apply this
Study the recurrence of these barcodes for the three agent example now we can see this is the recurrence
Of the connected components meaning if these points are actually connected. We see there are three
It highlights three sudden changes that actually indicates the transition between
The escape from this all-in-place pattern and the recurrence of loops in their barcodes
Highlights the point at which they enter into this
three recurrence
Patterns and when they leave this particular pattern so overall it captures what we already know about the
three-person interaction
Well, now we're going to see if it works for the eight-person
The first thing you can see is that there are a lot of structures in the recurrence of these topological
Features compared to what I showed you before
And this recurrence of connecting components
Highlights there is a sudden change around 30 seconds when I first saw this I was really confused
Oh, like I saw nothing here. Like this must be an artifact
So I spent a little bit more time look at a dynamics
So I see what was happening before 30 seconds
Before 30 seconds these eight oscillator now show as your frequency dynamics
There are three pairs of them the orange red
green blue and the purple blue another blue
And
There is a long foot long wolf on top and there is a yellow guy that's also waiting between them
But at 30 seconds there is a sudden regrouping of
these three pairs and
This yellow guy it means that this three pairs broke up
Two of them broke up and this blue guy rejoined the group on lower level and these two
From different group pairs before regroup together and the top two regroup together and after this transient
They return to their early
partners
So is this is a random bumps in the data?
Yeah, after I look at a relative phase
Corresponding to this period of dynamic
I think not because the duration of this partner is
Exchange dynamics is it controlled precisely by the relative phase between the yellow and orange oscillator
It takes exactly time for a system to be destabilized from anti-phase and go back to anti-phase
So it's a local
perturbation on this particular relative phase and cause an avalanche of repartner in the collective dynamics
so
By using topological analysis, I was able to show a
Important collective pattern transition that was not be able to observe by traditional means
So to conclude
And I showed you a new experimental paradigm
For studying coordination dynamic among multiple agents were at comminipulator frequencies and comminipulator coupling
and
This experiment revealed a coordination patterns among multiple spatial temporal skills
And I was able to capture them with a theoretical model and this model happens to connect to important
Theories of large-scale and small-scale coordination dynamics, and I also find a critical
Parameters that connects the emergence of behavioral complexity across multiple skills
And then I showed you how to think about complex meta stable pattern emerged observing the experiment and the model
Through a topological classification and finally I showed you
How to use topological data analysis to construct topological portraits across multiple skills and detect
important transitions in the single trial dynamics
So one X so why am I here?
So I'm trying to look at if these complex
These principles of generating complex coordination pattern can help us understand
Neurodynamics, so as Plato has said if you can automatically substitute any justice in this paragraph with complexity
Socrates slash Plato said
We were lacking King's eyesight
We were told to read really small letters
Like in the brain from a distance and then we know this the same letter exists elsewhere in the larger size on the larger surface
We consider it a godsend
I think to be allowed to read the larger ones first and then to examine the smaller ones to see whether they're really the same
There is a justice of a single man and also the justice of a whole city
And if a city is a larger than a single in the city of larger than a single man
Let's first find out what sort of things justice is in the city and afterwards we look for it in the individual
Observing the way in which the smaller is similar to the larger one
And so I want to acknowledge and these are my comedy members and the fundings
Were coming from NIH
And now I'm open for questions and this is the actual photo of the actual equipment that I built
I
Do you run a metronome pacing period they have different flashing lights, so
Yes, I show them a light so each one have a light
Eight of them have 64 lights
Exactly
Yeah, that's a good question though I want to go back to
the way
One
So yeah, this on the right-hand side, this is deterministic
The points are the data points
So the variation here
Well, I can add noise in it and then it will become noisier
But the main variation here was actually coming from meta stable coordination
So it's because they never actually become synchronized that gives other give them the freedom to exhibit a range of this behavior
And that's one of what I think is the most important thing to think about complex system as meta stable patterns because they are both
Coordinating while they're not losing their individual differences
And that gives you the variability
Yeah, this this these are all from the model
Yeah
I
Now I ask them to look at the center of the LED array because I don't want them to coordinate, but I want them to be influenced by
Because
Like
But
Right so there is a I would say
I think there's a multiple questions in that question
So there is a question of
What is attention in this particular
Task so if I want to I would just want to go back to
So
Is the tag it is attention arising
from is it is sort of a
Illusion that emerged from the actual coordination where it was intentionally being you know
It results of oh, I'm actually actively paying more attention regardless of of the this actual patterns
It might be difficult to differentiate
So I interviewed a lot of subjects
The most common
Reaction with what those are other people
So I told them well after the metronome disappeared
They will see other lies flashing and all they need to do is look at the center of the LED and keep tapping
So a lot of them actually didn't realize what where those dots or flashes were coming from the people
Or I just throw them some try to throw them off with random flashing. So they didn't actually know it was
very social and
and
If you do the experiment yourself, you will be sort of automatically attracted to some of the patterns
If I showed you this
Come on
Yeah, if you look at this long enough in a dark room
You will start to even if you don't shift your eyes. You will start to sort of pay attention to
other people some some people more it could be that
Some people are synchronizing with you
You you you might be able to pay attention to synchronized patterns between between different oscillators different flashes
Or in some other case we would call there's a mutant fireflies. So there will be people tapping extremely fast and they don't know it
So it's definitely a
complicated situation if we consider all the cognitive processes are actually involved
But I think what is really interesting about it is in the model. I really just assume
They have there are simple phase oscillator with a natural frequency and that's enough for it to work
And I think that was kind of surprising to myself as well that I don't need to assume
What exactly was a cognitive process the underlying timing of principles, but the coordination between them
sort of transcend the specific
Processes that may underline the timing
In human behavior oftentimes, you know, there are intentions of coordination, right? Yeah
So here and here actually it's not
Young I don't know whether you can manipulate that like in one condition
You just instruct the participants and also incentivize them say, okay
You know, you please cooperate as much as possible
And we will pay you right if you can do a good job and versus, you know, don't tell them and see whether they are different
Right, so that has to go back to my earlier motivation
Where I was thinking more about, you know, what is a secret love life?
And how is a human organism is similar to social organism?
We might fit feel a lot of intention on a social level when we're doing stuff, but what is the intention for a molecule?
if I am a
Metacondria, I'm doing a lot of things. Am I intentionally organizing the energy supply of the cell?
if I am a protein and I
started a trigger a
DNA duplication, am I intentionally doing that?
So do you think all the cells in the body are coordinating and do you think they're intentionally coordinating?
So that's you know, how I think about it and the reason why I designed experiment that way
I was sort of like I don't quite want to tell you what to do
I want to see what you naturally do without that much intention
They may have like a spontaneous immersion emerged during the task. Some of them are more social
I would say they may think have their own theories about what they should do like if they do I
Interview some of them. I say this is my instruction. Why are you thinking about a different task?
I thought this is what you meant. I was like I didn't mean it
But they do have a their own internal models of you know, their own intentions in this
But I did I just didn't interfere with that
From they were ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 Hertz
And then there's three seconds where there's no tapping and then they're just being asked to continue
Yeah, I'm just surprised that anyone
Subliminally
Count 1 Hertz counts like a true second
I feel like with eyes closed or not knowing what pattern or that the fact that people were across from you or something
But you're not looking at the body language the person next to you something it's just surprising to anyone stays in sync
Stayed in sync
It's not they're going back to the metronome frequency. They're simply attracted to other people
But they know to be attracted to
Yes, so I randomly assigned their metronome when I say this they were assigned the same metronome
It was over simplification to keep your attention
Right within a one hour. So I actually assigned there are actually different
Metronomes, they're all the same frequency but random initial phase. So they started off non-linear in phase and anti-phase in general
Oh point when during the point three seconds, they were continuous tapping
But they don't see other people they were tapping by themselves and then suddenly they see a bunch of dots flashing and they try to continue tap at that frequency
Yeah, they don't know if I was messing with them or not some of them said
Yeah
Yeah
Right so distribution wise on these patterns are relatively rare actually so they mainly show up when
So what I'm trying to say is state is only cannot say if this is for sure because there are very few trials
Where they actually
Managed to have this some kind of what we call split state when they follow one another
and
This case is when there are pace all with the same frequency
So their frequency has to be close enough when they're having a space
Playstate
They has to be sort of phase lock their their frequency has to be very close
So it's kind of a rare event if in a look and in aggregate
Following on
So I played noise in the background to prevent them from hearing each other
But this experiment actually have a second part
Where I split them because I told you I can control the network connectivity between them
So actually split them to two separate groups and I found out there were still coordinating because they can still hear
Is sometimes it's just one person tap really loud and one experiment will destroy our entire data
And I didn't have enough trials to wash off that one person tapping really loud which happened to be yeah
Yeah, I shouldn't talk about the privacy of the subjects
But yeah, there are people who does tap really loud. Ideally, I would sort of give them
Half-homes we're having with half-homes that that's playing noise that would be a little bit better
So
Yeah
Because auditory coordination is much stronger for humans than the visual coordination show here, but
Yes, yes, and we're also very constrained with lab space, but
Yeah
So the reason that I did this and I actually spend I
Would say how many time I spent two years
On this so
This thing itself took two years to set up probably not we're gonna be able to do a Stanford because everyone seems to be one
Have a faster progress on things
But the reason I have to spend two years on this is like I was doing electrical engineering of this apparatus
The reason is very hard to do online is that a rhythmic coordination very sensitive to delay
five milliseconds delay is good enough for
for to have a fact and coordination pattern itself is dependent on a delay if you have longer delay you will have self
To self-coupling you'll have a different pattern with yourself
I have two to one or different sort of stuff when you start to have too much delay in the system
so the delay here is really critical and
Now I'm importing eight
Data eight channels of data into the computer. Well, I need to do a complicated transformation when I incorporate this
information of the
Spatial maps that what they see really especially located on the LED array. I need to do the network connectivity stuff
I also need to compute the metronome, etc in the middle and I need to redistribute 64 different channels out to these
Subjects and waste for a lot of preparatory
Hardwares to do that first of all
You they don't really give you the instrument to control 64 bits of output very
flexibly and
So I was doing a lot of microcontroller stuff for this
Equipment there are two microcontrollers on one PC in this lot of soldering
Design these touch pads myself so to really lower the latency of the delay on to two to four milliseconds
So that's the reason why you cannot do this online. It will be too slow
Yeah
Yeah
Right, so you're talking about how the individual differences are coming into play so in the model actually fitted the individual
distribution of
Frequencies during that short three second period where they're not seeing other people they've had they have already been paced
So they have a three seconds recording of
No social interaction and already been paced
So the diversity there is large, but that's not a diversity. I'm trying to explain
I'm trying to explain given the diversity
How do they coordinate?
So I was sort of taken that as a given no matter what is a mechanism
It could be it could be a degenerate problem means
It for a given individual difference there can be infinitely many ways that this person can be different from another
Behaviorally there doesn't have to be a unique way
for example, if this person has a
Longer finger if this person has a response time. So there's a multiple
I
would say
Nobs in the system and you can tweak and that will eventually generate some diversity
In how they response to the metronomes and how they keep track of time over time
And these were incorporated by fitting the subject distributions of natural frequencies
It was not incorporating the other noise terms, but
Okay, yeah, the latency would
Right if the constant is not enough it just has to be short enough
So it's because there's a closed loop system is when you're tap
It does a lot of processing and the signal return to you
And that has to be short enough you cannot tap and don't feel like this is your own tap
That's flashing this will cause really confusing on the subject perspective
Yes, I told them yeah, sometimes they still forgot
Yeah, yeah, I have no idea
Sorry, does the injury on interesting answer
Traces it was still like
So if you plot them all
Can you ask does is there like a bootstrap both distribution of synchrony or is it just always possible to subset
All
So what I was trying to explain that I
Took out one of the slides because I want to
Manage your attention
So here is another slide and to explain why I did what I did
To analyze the topological patterns
In the frequency that I showed you there there's a part at the end that I showed you the frequency
Using the frequency dynamics to show the coordination patterns and here I show you why that's important
So
Metastable phase dynamics is a here is the relative phase between two oscillators
When their dwell is kind of flat and they escape and they dwell again is flat again and then escape like this and this
Information that the the reason we study the characteristic
Dynamics of metastable coordination are the dwell escape dynamics and these can be precisely reflected in the frequency dynamics
so when they're dwelling these curves are closed or forming sort of one connected components and
During their escape, but they sort of forming one loop and
Why is that?
This is actually because the frequency here and
Is the derivative of the individual oscillators phase so relative phase is
the integral of
The relative phase is the integral of the difference between frequencies
so
That is the same because they always dwell at in-phase or anti-phase
So if they go away from in-phase and go back to in-phase
That's going to give you a 2 pi and that corresponding to the size of this loop our area between these curves to be one
There are some quantum if I think here
so the the size of these topological structures and the fact there are loops and connected components is
Characterizing these topological structure characterized the key dynamics in metastable coordination
And in multi-agent case
The pattern can be much more complex and this looking at the frequency dynamics itself gives you a
Really a short way to reduce a high-dimensional dynamic problem to a 2d geometric problem
So it's mathematically we can really only analyze the
Topological structure across skills in a 2d graph
But we know all the dwelling escape dynamics of the relative phase even though we don't know which phase they're dwelling at
But we know when they're dwelling and after how long of a phase they return to the same
Pattern
So yeah, I have a lot more slides. I was like a really cutting hiding everything
Most of the papers are the date the experiment was published and
The model is on archive, which is very very difficult to publish to be honest because it's very offensive
if you look at if you Google criminal model and
You will understand why people don't like an article to say oh
Criminal model is probably insufficient to characterize experimental data. And so it's it's kind of offending for a lot of you delete this clip
And
The topological analysis
Here is gonna come out on archive pretty soon. Hopefully I'm waiting for a mathematician colleagues, too
They are very they're not easily social
Socially coerced so I can only say take your time, you know, don't worry about it
the I think my favorite part of the three oscillator
Use winding numbers to characterize three oscillator
Dynamics is only in my dissertation, which is also freely available online
But it might not be published ever because I'd like to start running out of time when I moved to Stanford
Right
So right now you we only know that a larger skill you'll have more stable patterns
That's one thing that we can predict
and of course a larger seal you can in principle produce
More complex meta stable patterns, but I think the most important step for meta stability was from two to three
So from two oscillator problems three oscillator problem that give you all the
Inflate many possible patterns and you can become more infallible in many when you're going to larger skills
but the qualitative change from
One meta stable pattern to infalli many I think is the most interesting thing
Yeah, so you can think about this
That is one of the effect I want to go back to the model
So there is actually a difference between my model and the core model model even though I said they're the same when
We remove the second order coupling so you will see here
I have a coupling strength a outside the sum
In core model model as a K a coupling strength over N
So you can imagine that their coupling strength was normalized by the numbers of oscillators. So
the behavior of the core model model
Does not really change too much with the numbers of N due to the normalization
But the behavior of this model will change because you can imagine you just times N here
From from this this model. So you it's equivalent to
core model model as increasing the K
by not normalizing by N
So in large scale, they will definitely turn to be more synchronized
Because the effective increase of coupling strength
Investors from your own active group versus
You know that some investors from a another
And then they look at the efficiency of the stock market and when it will burst, you know
In terms of price and what they find is that with more diversity
Actually, it's less likely to burst and it's more efficient. Yeah in a way
So I think it's very interesting in your in your analysis
Actually, it's in the middle level that it has integration. If it's too diverse, then it has
Sacrification, right? Yes. Now in your definition of
Diversity actually you define in terms of the first difference. Yes, frequency. Yes. What if
diversity is defined as
multiple groups, you know multiple different groups, right? So you can have three different like
Frequency group or four different frequency group. What do you think with the same kind of mechanism occur?
I
Do so their frequency diverse
I still divide them into two frequency groups. So in principle, I can use the same experiment to divide into at least four
Three is a little bit difficult because you're gonna not gonna have integers of the equal size groups
So I do not imagine the results come gonna be very different
Actually
I mean in the model, I do not
Society say many, you know, there was study that show if you have two sizeable different groups
They are more likely to have more conflict. So actually segregation is more likely to occur
But if you have multiple groups, you know, but relatively small size then, you know
Then you're more likely to have
Well, it depends on a lot of things, right, that's true
It depends on if they actually coordinate, right?
For example, I would say in southern China, there are much many more subcultures
Yeah, in South China, it doesn't mean that are
highly integrated
Than in northern cities when there are less
There were research that show that, yeah, actually in those area, there are more intense interval conflict
Because there is easier to see a outline
So it's easier to see in group versus on group
But then when you have really multiple groups and there's more in size
Then that might not necessarily or there might be other things that help you to re-care out
So it's a matter of carerization, yeah, and re-carerization
As I said, it depends on if they actually interact or not
If there is a small group, they're localized, they don't really interact with the outside world
I wouldn't say a region with multiple
Smaller groups will actually be more integrated if they don't actually interact, but if they interact, yes, maybe
So, for example, in the simulation that I showed, I actually showed one of the simulations
Come on
This is one of my advisors' favorite spot
Is this one? So this is a
Uniformly coupled eight people and they're starting with slightly different equalities
So this simulation actually there's no group. So each individual has their own intrinsic frequencies and there is no group here
So their dynamic is relatively interesting. So for each period, they started off branching off
There are a-sebrary groups at the beginning
But at the end of this period, they started to
Segregate into three different groups and become two groups at last and become one group again
So, I mean, it's also a dynamical process. You cannot say they are integrated
Then there will be forever integrated, but it can be, you know, they can regroup and do all different sorts of things over time
But this particular one is more diverse. You can't think of it as a different
frequency groups
