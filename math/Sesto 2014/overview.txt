 The speaker is discussing the challenges of combining quantum mechanics with general relativity, particularly when dealing with superpositions in the presence of a gravitational field. In a superposition, an object can be in a state where it is simultaneously in two different locations, each with its own gravitational field. This presents a problem because the gravitational fields are not naturally described within the same Hilbert space.

The speaker introduces a concept called EG, which represents the error or uncertainty due to the difference between the gravitational fields of the two superposed states. This error term is related to the gravitational self-energy of the difference between the mass distributions in the two locations.

To resolve this issue, the speaker suggests that nature might handle this by invoking the Heisenberg time-energy uncertainty principle, similar to how an unstable particle decays. The speaker proposes that there is a characteristic time scale on which the superposition of locations 'decides' which location to collapse into. This happens when the difference between the two gravitational fields reaches a Planck scale, indicating a critical point for state reduction.

The speaker mentions experiments proposed by Dirk Bouwmeester, aimed at testing whether nature respects this proposal or not. The outcome of these experiments is expected to provide an answer within a few years, as suggested by the experimenter's predictions.

In essence, the speaker is addressing the non-commutativity problem between quantum mechanics and general relativity and offering a potential resolution that involves the concept of time-energy uncertainty and the critical role of Planck scale effects in resolving superpositions in the presence of gravity.
