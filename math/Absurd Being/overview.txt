Processing Overview for Absurd Being
============================
Checking Absurd Being/Henri Bergson (3.1) - Duration.txt
1. **Space**: Berkson distinguishes between perceived space and conceived space. Perceived space is the lived, heterogeneous space that we navigate through, while conceived space is an abstract, homogeneous backdrop useful for analytical purposes such as juxtaposition, measurement, and counting.

2. **Duration**: Duration, according to Berkson, consists of succession (a following one after another) and mutual penetration (where past events influence the present and future). It is not merely a linear progression but a continuous progress of the past that "gnaws into" the future, meaning the past is always influencing what comes next.

3. **Consequences of Duration**:
   - Every state is constantly changing, which implies that the state itself is in a constant state of flux. This applies to psychic states or any enduring state.
   - Change represents genuine creation; it's the birth of something entirely new and unpredictable.
   - Changes are irreversible. Each moment experienced is novel and unique, never to be replicated exactly as it was.

4. **Implications**: These ideas have profound implications for our understanding of time and change. They suggest that our experiences are inherently novel, creative, and unpredictable, which has significant implications for the concept of freedom and the nature of reality.

In summary, Berkson's concept of duration offers a richer, more dynamic understanding of time, contrasting with the static, uniform conception of space and time that dominates much of Western thought. This dynamic view of duration emphasizes the continuous interplay between past, present, and future, acknowledging the influence of history on the present and the novelty of each new moment.
