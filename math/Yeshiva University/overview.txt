1. In a position with omega squared, one player (typically White) is trying to advance their pawn to the 8th rank while another player (typically Black) uses an infinite series of checks from a distant square to delay this progress indefinitely. This creates a draw since the pawn cannot be advanced without responding to an infinite number of checks, which is impossible within a finite number of moves.

2. In the "Releasing the Hordes" position, White attempts to open a file by advancing pawns and bishops, while Black uses rooks to deliver perpetual check, effectively preventing the advancement until White has set up the necessary conditions for the queens to enter the fray and mate.

3. The "Door, Key, and Lock" position involves a similar strategy where Black uses an infinite series of checks to delay the progress of White's pawn while setting up a sequence of moves that will eventually release bishops and allow the queen to checkmate. This is valued at omega squared times four due to the presence of four rooks involved in the harassment.

4. The Axiom of Determacy (AD) is not the standard or basic axiom for games in classical game theory, where most open games are determined. Games that can be clearly defined with simple rules are usually determined. It's only when games require more complex constructions, often involving the axiom of choice, that non-determined games become possible. The Gale-Stewart theorem applies to Borel games as well, which includes most games considered in game theory. Thus, in practical scenarios within the realm of game theory, games are typically determined.
