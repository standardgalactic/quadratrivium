1. Professor Salvatore Alessandro Longo presented a talk on the concept of time in quantum mechanics and its relation to thermodynamics and relative entropy.
2. He emphasized that in quantum mechanics, time emerges from non-commutativity and the KMS (Kubo-Martin-Schwinger) condition, which is a generalization of the Gibbs state concept.
3. The KMS condition arises naturally from the thermodynamic perspective, suggesting that time is not an external parameter but an emergent phenomenon.
4. Longo discussed the modular approach to quantum theory and how it provides a framework for understanding time without relying on classical concepts of time.
5. He mentioned the importance of relative entropy in understanding divergences in entropy calculations and how it can be used to extract meaningful results.
6. The talk touched upon the debate between different approaches to time in quantum mechanics, including the modular approach and other perspectives like taking time as a fundamental parameter.
7. Longo highlighted that in quantum information and computation, time is intertwined with thermodynamics, and evolution is an intrinsic property once a state and algebra are fixed.
8. He invited further debate and discussion on the interpretation of time in quantum mechanics, especially in light of recent developments in quantum information theory.
9. The audience showed interest in Longo's work and engaged in questions about the conceptual nature of time, its role in quantum gravity theories, and the implications for philosophy of time.
10. The discussion underscored that while there are different viewpoints on the primacy of time in physics, the modular approach provides a powerful framework for understanding temporal evolution in quantum systems.
11. Longo offered to continue the conversation and further clarify any points of interest related to his work, indicating openness to future collaboration and dialogue.
