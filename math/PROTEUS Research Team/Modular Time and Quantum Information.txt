So thank you very much, Professor Longo, for having accepted our invitation for our protest
coming up series.
Today, Professor Longo will talk about one of your time and quantum information.
So I leave it to you, thank you very much, Professor Longo.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for this invitation that was to the stimulating with me, because I
think it is important that people in different areas communicate.
And so I took this as an experiment, but my experience is that when people working in
different areas communicate that something good always come out.
So of course, it's very difficult in a talk to give an idea of a subject and what I am
doing and so on.
So I will start with the origin, giving some idea, mentioning some fundamental facts,
and tell you what I'm doing at the moment.
But of course, there are many missing results and subjects that I should mention, but of
course, I have no time.
So the first thing I want to do is the way of thinking in different subjects.
So this applies not only in the relationship between mathematics and physics, but also,
for example, different way of thinking, internal mathematics.
And I give you a test just to start.
So we have a closed curve, this blue curve, and then there is a point in the middle, in
some way, internal.
And then the question is, there is, it is possible to draw a straight line so that the
straight line will intersect this curve at two points at equal distance.
So if you ask people, even mathematicians or mathematicians in the physics system, typically
you get two answers.
One answer is, okay, I try, I draw some line, and then I try to rotate to try it, and then
I'm going to find a critical point, a minimum, so it's a dynamical process.
There is another way to answer, which is, in a sense, just thinking, it's a meditation,
if you want.
You take this point, and you construct the curve, which is symmetric with respect to
this point.
So for every point, you draw the point at just opposite to this point.
Then these two lines, these two curves, the blue and the opposite, the mirror, not the
mirror, the symmetric curve, we intersect at least in two points, and these two points
are the solutions.
So this is just thinking, and sometimes people say this is an oriental way of thinking, the
dynamical one is in the east.
I don't know which one came to you first in mind, but it's quite important that two
ways of thinking collaborate, and this applies to the cycle of mathematics and physics.
Of course, mathematics at the very beginning comes from physics, because we are people
that we look for example, we try to understand what is to count or to make some measure,
what is physics, and then we want to make a square triangle, for example, and then comes
mathematics, which takes this idea as an abstraction, and then mathematics proceed just at once,
mathematics has an idea, then abstractly construct another structure, and for some miracle, this
idea goes back to physics, and maybe many years, even centuries later, they are successful,
at least this was the situation so far.
So physics consolidates the ideas by experiment, makes some theory, then goes to mathematics,
and mathematics proceed just by formalism, which is an art to mathematics and then comes
back.
This was a very famous paper by Eugene Vaid Wigner, the unreasonable effectiveness of
mathematics in the natural sciences, I think it is not true that the title is famous, few
people read the paper, but the title is already condensate what the idea is.
I remember when Israel Gelfand came to Rome 20 years ago, and Gelfand was one of the most
important mathematicians of the 20th century, and he said that mathematics is an art, like
it's a mixture of art and form, like music, but if I will be born again, I will do music,
not the mathematician, not the mathematics, the reason is that many people understand
music, it's easy, but it's not easy to communicate mathematics, this is truly the point about
mathematics, it's difficult to communicate.
Now let's go to time, what is time, this is of course a big philosophical issue, but
we may say, we start to say something, that if you look at the classical space, classical
meaning before quantum, and we can imagine, just imagine, that a space which is completely
static, no more, it is in this situation time has no meaning, because if you have only one
configuration, the time has no meaning, but then if you have several configurations, then
you order, so something comes first, and something comes later, and then times appear just as
an ordering of different configurations, but when we go to quantum space time, there is
this phenomenon of quantum fluctuation, there is no static quantum space time, just because
there is always creation and annihilation of particles, therefore extremely short time,
but yes, I cannot hear well, can you repeat?
No, I think it was just someone that didn't switch on the microphone while entering the room, so you
can continue. Okay, so in a quantum space, there is a spontaneous fluctuation and annihilation
of particles, so there is no static space time, so if we look at the space from the quantum
point of view, there is no static quantum space, so there must be a time, so time is, in a sense,
intrinsic in quantum. Now what is the difference between classical and quantum, the essential,
the fundamental difference, it is non-commutative, classical space time is commutative,
and quantum is non-commutative, I will tell you something in a moment about that,
but this is the crucial difference, so we may say that non-commutativity generates time,
so let's start again with the other time, and if you look at classical the other time,
is understood, is defined to thermodynamics, Newtonian mechanics is reversible,
but thermodynamics is not, so heat tends to go from something warmer to something colder,
and not the other way, so there is only one other time. In quantum mechanics, there is another
possible quantum arrow time, because when we make a measurement, we go from a
mixed state to a pure state, and also this process is irreversible, so there are two
ways to fix the arrow time, and an old question is that is there a general frame to encompass both,
or in another, or even more ambitious, can one derive one arrow time from the other,
and of course, if you try to answer the question, we should keep in mind that the
time is relative constant, as we have learned from relativity theory of Albert Einstein.
So let the origin of quantum mechanics, of course, quantum theory started, as you know,
by Planck, but quantum mechanics were developed in two ways, independently by Schrodinger
and by Eisenberg, and Schrodinger was based, the description was based on Schrodinger equation,
so differential equation, if you want, but Eisenberg description is based on the fundamental
relation, commutativity relation, commutation relation between momentum and
and position, and which says that they do not compute, it's a multiple of idea, the identity,
and for Neumann, this was a situation for Schrodinger, but then for Neumann, uniqueness came,
phenomenon came, and proved the theorem that the two pictures are equivalent, one can pass from
one to the other. So these two pictures are equivalent, but in the Eisenberg picture,
more clearly, the non-commutativity comes out, which is the fundamental difference.
Now, there was this, the quantum mechanics
was, when quantum mechanics came, there was a critical moment in the communication between
mathematics and physics, why? Because quantum mechanics required these new mathematics, which
is non-commutative, and mathematician did not have this framework, so physicists tried to set up
these new mathematics in heuristic terms, and physicists, so were not interested, well,
of course, with the new exception, but generally speaking, were not interested in what mathematicians
were doing, and mathematician were not interested in what physicists were doing, because it wasn't
certainly not a truly mathematical one, it was heuristic, and this was, in particular, in
the situation in Italy, was peculiar, because a lot of young people died before the world,
so there were not enough people, good people, to support both mathematics and physics,
so that the mathematics had a very high tradition in geometry, by Ricci Levincivita,
and also in functionalism, whatever, but young people went to the Fermi school, because that's
what was attracting the good people. Now the situation is quite different, and personally,
I was, I had the passion to meet my advisor, Sergio D'Oplico, that introduced me in my
learning mathematics coming from this, and he introduced me to the operator algebra subject.
So operator algebra, what is operator algebra? The operator is a subject that von Neumann developed,
and at the beginning by Elon, but sooner or later he wrote a monumental work in collaboration with
Morey, and this is the list of this opera, developed with an ear in mind to set up these new
mathematics that was necessary to describe quantum mechanics, and it is quite interesting
to see that this monumental work was not cited, or almost for teniacs, with one of the exceptions,
which was not truly important, so there was, it was necessary to wait
to absorb, to understand this great work. So what are the basics of operator algebra?
So we have a space, as you know, space is maybe infinite dimension, so it is the natural
generalization of the Euclidean space, and then one considers the linear transformation,
bounded, which means continuous, on this ill-bred space, and these linear operators
or linear transformation, of course, have a linear structure you can add, you can multiply them,
it is a star operation, the joint, like for matrices, you know, you can conjugate,
you may take the joint on matrices, but the most traction, there is an order, so you can say
an operator is positive if it is of the form of B star B, like a number, a complex number is positive
if it is of the form B star B, for some complex number. Then there is a matrix structure,
there is a norm, which is just the best bound of the constants that dominate A star A,
and then there is a C star norm of the property, that's the norm of A square is the norm of A star A,
and if we have an algebra with this property, this is called a C star algebra.
Now, Gelfand Neimer made a fundamental result on commuted C star algebras,
so what they proved is that every C star algebra is an isomorphic, naturally isomorphic,
to the algebra of continuous function on some compact space, so if you have a compact space,
we can consider the algebra of continuous function, which is, and if we have a commutative C star
algebra, we can consider the character, so one-dimensional representation,
and then these operations are in duality, so every, it follows from Gelfand Neimer's
team, that every C star algebra is isomorphic to a closed algebra of BOH, so BOH,
the algebra of all bounded operators, contains all C star algebra, and so we have a
and a non-commutative geometry by Korn, then also refined piece, so we want to
generalize the fact that X is a manifold, rather than just a topological space, and it is the notion
of a spectral triple that I will not explain here, rather I will go to the concept of
for normal algebra, for normal algebra is a C star algebra, so it's a closed,
not closed sub-algebra BOH, but which is a algebraically closed in the following sense,
we can see that all operator that commutes, commutes with all operator in them, and then we take twice
this operation, and if we get to the same algebra, so M is the set of operators that commute with
all operators that commute with them, then in this case it is a for normal algebra,
and if you look at commutative for normal algebra, then this is isomorphic to L infinity,
measure space, so for normal algebra it's a non-community measure theory, like and
and what are why these are the good for the description of physics, because observable
in quantum mechanics will be self-adjoint element of a for normal algebra, and states
are normalized positive linear function, so we have at least a linear function which is
positive and normalized, and the expectation value of the observable x in the state phi is phi of x,
this is the formalism, so the general structure is a following, in the commutative case we have,
we can have for example a manifold, so the algebra is the algebra of a smooth
the infinity function on the manifold, and the quantum analog is a star algebra which can be
non-commutative, or we can just more generally take x as a commutative space, a commutative
x is a topological compact space, and then take the algebra of continuous function,
which is a c star algebra, that in the quantum case can be non-commutative in the
concerning for normal algebra, the classical for normal algebra are measurable bounded boreal
function, say L infinity function more precisely over some measure space, and for normal algebra
is just what I told you, so this is a scheme of the mathematics that comes,
I don't think I will dwell on that, but today at least my people that work in the operator
algebras and want to look at quantum field theory, they look at this scheme, so from classical
variables, let's say one can go first classically with infinite dimensional manifolds,
but non-commutative, they go to subpar to modular demorphic whatever it means, or one can take the
other part from classical value, one can go to quantum geometry of a 90 degree of freedom,
and then quantize, and now this was the general picture, and now I wanted to go to some concrete
problem that I have been working on very recently, I am still working on it, and quantum information,
but quantum information, I am interesting, quantum information of a system with infinitely many
degree of freedom, because I have been always in mind the quantum field theory, you know,
quantum information as you know, it's growing in the whole subject, there are many interesting
results, but most of them concern finite dimensional systems, which is motivated by many things,
for example quantum computer etc, but when we go to large system that we can consider just
infinite, then there is something new that we have to work out, and I am working this direction,
so the problem that I want to discuss now is the following, we have Alice and Bob,
Alice sends a signal to Bob to a wave, for example like an electromagnetic wave,
like what I am doing now, I am transmitting you some information to waves, but Bob
measures as a laboratory, and measures and gets the signal, but he gets the signal only for a limited
time, and only on a limited space, so Bob has access to the signal only for a bounded
space time region, so the question is how much information can Bob get, so in other words,
can we define the local information, or if you are going to small at a point, the information
density in a wave, this is completely new problem and that I will formalize now, so what is the
equation, the wave equation, possibly with the mass, it's called the Klein-Gordon equation,
it is following, so there is the second derivative with respect to time minus the sum of the
second, the appellation, the second derivative with respect to the other
directions, and then this equation, when m is equal to zero, it's called the wave equation,
otherwise called the Klein-Gordon equation, it is an important equation because it appears in
quantum filtering, in particular, it appears in classical physics, and if you want the famous
Dirac equation, it is in quotation mark the square root of the Klein-Gordon equation,
so this is described for the quantum point of view boson and Dirac equation describe fermions,
and the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation can be given by the initial Dirac-Cochit data, so
the value of the wave at time zero and the value of the time derivative of the wave
at time zero, if we note this value then there is a unique solution, and in classical
physics there is a notion of stress-energy tensor, T mu ni, that gives the energy momentum density
at any time, but what is the information of the entropy density, so what is the information the
entropy carried by the wave in a given region or a given point at any time, and I will see that
we give you a classical answer, like this classical question, but by quantum filtering,
and in fact this will give also, this answer will have a meaning in quantum filtering,
but since the mathematics is the same, you can read either classically or quantum,
and to do that I have to state something that I understand, it's difficult to understand
right away, but it was truly a fundamental result in Pareto-Lagevac and in my opinion one of the
most important results in mathematics in general speaking, which is the Tomita-Take-Saki theory,
what does the main theorem of this theory say, then suppose we have this phonomer algebra,
so it's, phonomer algebra consists of operator on some inverse space, so we can take a vector,
unit vector on the inverse space, and then the expectation value will be a state,
so we can embed the phonomer algebra as a linear subspace of the subspace just evaluating,
so we take an operator in M and X, and then I go to apply to exomer, I get a vector,
once we do, and if the vector, if this application is one-to-one or so, which is a
rather general factor, then I can read the star operation on the inverse space,
that will be an operator, that's fine, I can write what's called the polar decomposition,
in case I get operator, and the miracle is that this operator delta, the modular operator,
exponentiate, and this is what the logarithm delta, exponentiate and gives the automorphism,
when J set up an anti-zomorphic with the algebra and the commutant, so algebra and commutant play
the same order, they are anti-zomorphic, one in the middle of the other, but any state, any,
with the, with the, and the very general conditions,
starting and separating with a, then gives rise to evolution, so, so phonomer algebra,
if you look at classical and infinity, it's no evolution, of course you can put by ends,
but here there is an intrinsic evolution, just the fact that you, you give a state,
then the system evolves by itself, there is an intrinsic evolution, this is the modular
evolution, and this parameter I will call it the modular time, and Tomita proposed this
in 1977, at the Baton Rouge conference, this was the first conference on operator algebras,
and Tomita distributed, it is, it's pre-green, but by, by an historical accident, in the same
conference, Rudolf Hager proposed what should be the, the, the characterization of thermal
equilibrium states, KMA states, and Takesaki participated at this, it's a very young artist,
Baton Rouge conference, and it fixed, because the, the, the Tomita's preventer was some errors,
he fixed, he, he, he, he complete Tomita theory, and showed the equivalence with,
that the modular group is characterized by KMS condition, so among the, the many properties
of a important part of the modular group, let me single out the following three, the modular group
is a purely non-community object, you don't see the modular group, if you remain in the
classic framework, the modular group is a thermal equilibrium evolution, in the sense, if, if we
are in the metrix algebra, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a small, infinite dimensional system,
then a state is given by density, the, the density matrix, and the, the, the evolution
is given by expo-initiated the density, the logarithm of the density matrix, and these are
the so-called Gibbs thermal equilibrium states, I will tell you in a moment, and then there is a
common value on TMS, that if you, if we choose different states, of course we have different
evolution, but this evolution are different only up to inner automorphism, every, in, in the
abelian case, there is no inner automorphism, because, but in the non-community case, every
phenomenon has a lot of inner automorphism, and the, this evolution does not depend on the state
up to inner automorphism, it's in completely intrinsic quantity, so what the, the, the, the,
the scheme is following, quantum physics gives this KMS, which is thermal equilibrium condition
with positive temperature, but it's equivalent to say that the flow is the modular time,
so we have a term, a, a, a, a, the modular time R of time, and this gives a positive entropy,
and this is related to the thermal dynamical R, so in, in this scheme, if you want, but
there are two R of times, they are put together, there is the thermodynamic R of time, and there
is the modular time, and the quantum, the Gibbs R of times, and they are put together by the modular
time R of time, so in a sense, modular time unifies the two R of time, the classical one,
and the quantum R of time. This is just to remind you what was the, for, for finite
quantum system, the equilibrium, the, when you have an evolution given by, you know,
by just a, a joint to a, to a one parameter group of units in a matrix, so to explain
shaders for joint matrices, this, you normalize, this, the Gibbs, you get the Gibbs states with
density matrix e to minus beta H, beta is the inverse time, you normalize, and then,
and then these are the K-m states in the finite means, okay, system, so K-m states to be generalized
Gibbs states, and this is the equation of K-m states, I will not perhaps do a lot on this,
but the K-m states, if you, if you, K-m states say that if you take a state and you have an
evolution and a state, then of course, if the evolution is trivial, this just means that we
have a trace x, y, and y, x are the same, commute under the, under the state, but in
general K-m states that we have to, to make an analytic continuation
with the evolution to pass from x, y, and y, x, so the, the commutativity here
as a, this manifestation, the, the, the thermal states, you know, for infinite,
at the infinite volume, for infinite states, are described by this K-m condition.
This is the, on the left, you see the original
preprint by Tomita that was never published, because in fact, the people didn't believe in it
for switching, as I said, it contains some errors, and then on the right you, you see the,
the lecture notes by Takasaki on Tomita's theory, you know, these are the historical papers.
Now the generator of the modular group is called the modular mistonia, because we, we can do,
we can embed the phonomenography in the space by two vectors, not by one, and then we get the
relative modular operator, the logarithm, still the modular mistonia, and modular mistonia is
quite important object, and nowadays it's quite a hot topic in theoretical physics, so if you,
if you go to archive and digit modular mistonia, you will find a lot of papers, because now
the reason is that mainly because of entropy, as I will explain, but there are also other reasons.
Now let me say something of the general framework of quantum filtering. Quantum
filtering is a huge subject, so if you ask two different experts what is quantum filtering,
I think you get two different answers, and there is a part of quantum filtering with
that digs with the constructing model, there is because one of the main issues is that we still
we don't have in one plus three dimension a model with interaction, but there is another way that
was proposed by Hage Kalstler in the 60s, and to start from first principle, so by notion of
local nets, so we have the space time, which is typically the Minkowski space time, it could be
something else or something, and then for each region on the space time we get a phenomenon
algebra, and the roots are the basic principle of the following, we have this isotony, so larger
algebra gives larger phenomenon algebra. Locality, if two regions are not a space like
separated, means that there is it's not possible to send a signal from one region from point in the
first region to a point in the second region at the velocity less or equal to the speed of light,
then the two algebras should follow an action to communicate, this is Hage Kalstler's argument,
because if two observations are independent, they must commute, and the other is symmetry,
one corrector, for example, that's the most natural, but in the other dimension
we can have, for example, the film of invariant conformity, and positive energy, so the generator
of translation should have positive spectrums and positive energy, so in a sense this association
or region to phenomenon algebra is a sort of non-commutative chart, because if the chart was
if the algebra was commutative, then we would have just a usual chart, I should be more precisely
or precise on this, but let this adjust as an indication of what's going on, not a complete
statement, and by classical theorem rich leader, if we take the vacuum vector,
this is cycling and separating for all local algebra, it means that if I apply, if I fix any
bounded region with non-empty interior, then if I take any vector of the space,
can approximate as well as we want by applying an operator localizing this region to the vacuum
vector, and so we are in the condition to define the modular operator, the modular group,
and the modular Hamiltonian, so what is the meaning of the modular Hamiltonian in quantum
field theory, and the first answer came in 75 by Bisognano-Wickman, it was and it shows that
if we take a ringless space time, so it's a sort of wedge region, which is shaped this way,
you know, all of the other directions are free, then the trajectory of the modular group is
the trajectory of uniformly accelerated observer, but time, modular time is not the
natural parameter for uniform of evolution for the proper time, let's say, of the uniformly
accelerated observer, there is a rescaling beta equal to pi over a, where it is a proper acceleration,
and a sort of comment that this is indeed the Hawking effect, you know, that this famous
result by Stephen Hawking, that a black hole radiates as a thermal radiation, so from the
classical point of view, a black hole should not have any radiation, because gravity keeps
averaging, but if you regard from the quantum point of view, it emits a thermal, very, very slow,
very little, tiny thermal radiation, and this is the inverse temperature, and by general
relativity, by the equivalent springs for the uniformly accelerated observer, it's equivalent
to gravitation, and then one can get it in this way, the whole effect was independent,
and the Misoniakon recommended theorem as observed by Sewell, it's an explanation,
the Uro effect, and so in a sense also the Hawking effect. What happened for a bound original?
In general, the modular group has no geometrical meaning, but something that I did with Islop
long ago, if we are in the conformal case, in the massless case, then it is geometric,
it is an evolution that I write here, but it is not important at the moment to understand exactly
the evolution, these are the orbit, so in the massless case, the modular group has a geometrical
meaning too. Now let me digress a moment about entropy, what is entropy? Of course, entropy,
the original entropy is thermodynamical, but I want to talk today about the information entropy.
So, suppose we have a finite set of events, x1, xn, and each event xi occurs with probability
p i, so p i is a number between 1 and 0, and the sum of the p i is 1, and as you know that the
probability of the independent event is multiplicative, but information is additive, so it's
natural to consider the logarithm of p i's information over at least up to a rescaling
constant, if you want, so Shannon defines this entropy, which is the average information that
one has, which is the sum of p i log p i, and then one can also define the relative entropy,
so if you have two probability distributions on the same set, then you want to measure
how much the two distributions differ, or the second differ, because when you make an experiment,
of course, you are always a bit wrong, and the relative entropy is just the evaluation,
they mean in the first state, in the first distribution of the different of the information,
in the non-commutative setting, for example for matrices, for norman defines the entropy,
which is just a state is given by density matrices, and then the entropy is given by
this formula for norman, and the migratory defines the relative entropy, which is exactly,
you write what your format is, what you expect from a relative entropy, so this
is perfectly good for the finite quantum system, but when we go to infinite system,
there is no trace, there is no trace, and then we have two situations, one is there exists a trace,
maybe infinite, but it takes continuous values on projection, these are called the type two
case, this was considered by Siegel long ago in the 40s, but never truly considered
after zeta, and in my work with Edward Witten, that was posted just yesterday,
we reconsidered this, and showed that this entropy made a bound of the entropy increased
from a subsystem to a system by the, or this is the recent order, I should correct this
slide, by the logarithm of the Jones index, and this entropy, this bound is optimal in the
infinite dimensional case, this is a point which is interesting because
there are indications that this situation is interesting in physics, but the most general
situation, there is even no continuous trace, and anarchy, so entropy is not definable,
but the relative entropy is definable, and therefore you know what's given by anarchy,
by the modular, the modular, the logarithm of the modular operator, the former is this one,
if one compute in the finite dimensional case, this is exactly the umegaki relative entropy,
and the fact that it has all the natural properties, it's positive, it's monotonic, and so on, so
the relative entropy is in a sense, most fundamental entropy, in the sense that all
entropy quantities can be expressed to relative entropy, so we, in principle, we could define
a relative entropy also in type 3 case, but it will be always infinite, so it's meaningless.
Now I will tell you how long can I talk again for another, I will talk about standard space,
I will tell you, this structure, simple structure where you have already modular theory,
so you have a complex space, and we consider a linear, closed linear, real linear subspace,
and then when we have a real linear subspace, we have simply complement, so all the vectors,
such as the imaginary part of the scalar product vanish with respect to every vector in the space,
and we have a notion of a cyclic, this is the end of the space, a cyclic separating,
ever, this is the most general situation, is when the space is a cyclic separating,
and then one can define this Tomito operator, if you want, or it was not defined by Tomito,
the one that goes from xi plus ih to xi minus h. This operator is an evolution,
the square is identity, and the adjoint of the Tomito operator is the Tomito operator of the
template complement, and all the composition, and then we have this theorem, that the
logarithm, the modular Newtonian, the exponentiate, the exponentiate with one product,
unitary group that leaves the space invariant, and the modular conjugation makes the
standard subspace is a simplistic complement, it was implicit in some work,
in explicit, but not emphasized already in the 70s, in a couple of papers, and
this is important, okay, in several contexts, I will skip this,
but it is important because it allowed to go to define modular theory beyond phonona,
just with a simple structure, with the space and real linear subspace, and
if in the factorial case, which means that the simplistic complement has no point,
no vector in common with the space h, except zero, one can define, of course, the projection,
simplistic projection, cutting projection, and some mere priorities, cutting projections
expressed by the modular data, it is not important that you understand this formula
right now, it is important that you understand that this cutting projection is expressed in terms
of J and delta, so the general picture is the following, we have, once we have in by space,
we have a real linear subspace, then we have a, they form a certain subspace geometry,
if you are complexified and internal, and then we have a complex structure, play a role,
and then we have the modular data, these three things are equivalent, but we can go with the
cutting projection out of this picture, we can be specific in quantum field theory,
because the cutting projection will be always geometric in this picture, so this work will be
the way to define, because the cutting projection will be just to cut the the Cauchy data of the
wave, you have a region, a wave is expressed by Cauchy data, and then you put the Cauchy data
zero out of the region, this is the cutting projection, which is, of course, the geometric
operation, and then we can define an entropy, and then also the entropy of a vector in a
in a complexed space, with respect to a closed real linear subspace, the formal rise is a following
that I am going to explain, but if you, regarding with the real part of the scalar product,
it's the expectation value of certain operator, the entropy operator that I define here,
so entropy has become an operator, so the entropy of a vector is the expectation value,
now once we have this entropy, we can go back to quantum field theory, and what we do for
free theory, when first we make one particle space, so to every region we define the space of states
of localizing that region, which is a real linear space, and then there is a procedure called
second quantization, which to every real linear subspace gives a phonomenal java,
just by vial operator, and so we go back to the phonomenal java picture, and the entropy
in second quantization will be just the entropy of a coherent vector, so the entropy I have defined
is nothing else, let's go to second quantization to consider the vacuum state, and the vacuum
state composes with the joint action of a vial operator, and computes a relative entropy,
so as you see there are several ways of interpreting this entropy, entropy of vector and
relative entropy, and so on, but when we specify Hilbert space waves, this will be the entropy of
a wave, so the picture is the following, we have our one particle space, the entropy of a vector,
if one particle space is made by wave, we have the entropy wave, then we make entropy,
second quantization, the entropy recline code on quantum field theory, or we can go from the
entropy vector directly to the entropy recline state, and then specify this to the free field
and get the entropy recline code on quantum field theory, so the same mathematical quantity
can be seen as a classical wave packet, the wave function of a free quantum particle or a
coherent state quantum field theory, so depending on how you interpret, you have three different
different interpretations of this entropy, and the entropy in the one particle space,
it's important to note that the Hilbert space depends on the mass, but the imaginary part
of the mass does not depend on the mass, in the sense that on Cauchy data, we have always the
same symphletic form, it's important because when we go to, for example, to quantum field theory
and a current space time, there is no vacuum vector, there is only class of representation,
so the imaginary part is fixed, but not the real part of the scalar product,
and then when we compute in a simple model, so let's say, for example, for the human current,
so this is just the one-dimensional massless case, we can compute this entropy, the entropy
on an half line, and then this is the formula, L is charged, and what comes out is that the
second derivative of the entropy is a non-negative, and this is quite important because it is related
to a very important issue in quantum field theory, which is the quantum null general energy condition,
so the second derivative, or when we deform a region in the null direction, the second
derivative should be non-negative, this is considered as prerequisite to quantize gravity,
because the positive energy does not survive, but this quantum null energy condition could survive,
and then I, very recently with Gerardo Monserla, I have computed the logarithm,
the modular Hamiltonian for a boundary region, let's say a ball in quantum field theory,
and this gives, in order to give the energy density of the wave, and the formula
is the following, as you see, it is on Cauchy data, so it is two by two matrices,
there is something that does not depend on the mass, it is in the massless case,
and if we consider the entropy, the arachisentropy, this is interracional with respect to this
parabolic distribution, this is the so-called energy density, the energy of the density of the
wave, okay, let me go directly to the massive case, what is the problem that was, remain open
for half a century, I would say, what's over there in this paper with Monserla,
and that what is the modular Hamiltonian in the massive case, and it is a perturbation,
if you want, of the massless one, but there is no local term, and the surprise was that
this local term, there is a local term that is given by this form, this integration,
this integral, and what was the surprise at this kernel is the Eukawa potential,
Eukawa is a potential that was discovered, predicted by Eukawa in 1934, Eukawa predicted
this Newton, this was the potential that was responsible for Newton-Proton interaction,
and for two years nobody cared, but then the particle with this Eukawa potential was found,
the pion, and Eukawa was awarded the Nobel Prize, this is the first page of Eukawa paper,
and you can read the paper if you want it, explain the story by Heisman Fermi and so on,
and how he got this idea, but in a sense he put this potential by hands, here it just comes from
mathematics, from Tumida theory, I don't want to say that it is, in this way I explain the potential
for the pion, I want to say that this quantity is an intrinsic quantity, it comes just from the
first principle, and then one can compute the local entropy, okay this formula, I don't think
I have time to enter in the explanation of this formula, but what I want to say,
and then when you go to for large ball asymptotically, when r is large,
when r goes to zero, so the density then it has an expansion, and this expansion is proportional
to the area of the ball, and it is in accord with the holographic area here, where the entropy,
very interesting for example, the entropy of the black hole should be proportional to the area
of the horizon of the black hole, and when we go to infinity then we have a bound which is
in agreement with another famous bound, which is the backstab bound, if you fix the energy
how much entropy can be in a ball or in a boundary, this is the backstab bound, and so this also
comes from a corollary of our result in this setting, I think my time is over, so I will
stop here. Thank you very much for your talk, Professor Longo, I would like to ask people,
so okay we have already questions, so Giuliano you raise the hand, go ahead.
Giuliano? Sorry, it was clapping actually, but. Ah, okay, so it was not a question, it was clapping,
okay, so it was maybe, I don't know how much, it was possible to transmit, maybe I have used
too much, too many formulas, I don't know. No, no, no, actually I could follow, and I think
because other people in the group would follow for hang, please go ahead.
Yeah, so thank you for the talk, it was very nice and rigorous, I would have some questions that
account general, they might not address the results, but it's about modular theory in general,
so one of the things that you mentioned in the introduction about modular group of
automorphisms, and that they kind of, the interpretations that they provide an internal
evolution in the system, what I don't understand is that they are unitary groups, these are unitary
transformations. Okay, the modular automorphisms are automorphisms of the phonomenal algebra,
and they are implemented by unitary group, the generators, the modular metronome, so you construct
first the unitary evolution on the space, but then you prove that this unitary implementation,
the adjoint action, gives automorphisms of the phonomenal algebra, this of course
a very deep result, in fact the proof is still quite difficult, but it is a very
consolidated result by now. Yes, so that's good, but when we think of time evolution,
in the sense that there is a direction of time, I mean in physics, naively we would say that the
entropy of the system, let's say, phonomen entropy of the system should increase as you
evolve the system, and that cannot be implemented with a unitary transformation, because unitary
transformations always preserve entropy, defined the phonomen entropy, so usually you restrict
these maps and get some like a channel or some sort of a irreversible transformations, which
cannot be implemented with unitary maps, so my question I guess is, how
you are perfectly right, but here we are in a modular group, described
evolution in a thermal equilibrium, so entropy does not change, of course it is very important
to describe other situations, in the way you say, but so for example, even if we go to the very
beginning of my talks, it is not possible to explain the origin of time, because we are already
in a thermal equilibrium state, so minutes at least after the big bang, but asymptotically
would say we are in thermal, so this is a situation, of course there are papers and so on,
with a non-equilibrium, but for example, I have a paper with Stefan Ollanz, we describe
non-equilibrium, but in a non-equilibrium term of dynamics, so the situation where we are not
in equilibrium, so this is the situation that we have asymptotically, but in a sense we are
close to equilibrium, so still physics can be described as a thermodynamical class, the usual
thermodynamical variable, of course there are also other works, but I don't think this is a subject
of research, I would say, but of course an important point is the one that you mentioned.
Yes, thank you, I would have another question if I can, and that is very speculative, it's about
von Neumann algebras, because von Neumann algebras, the way I understand them, they describe
quantum field theory or operators on a space where there is no gravity in some sense, we can go
small and small and small as we want, so it's kind of infinite dimensional. I was,
the kind of good question is, do you think, if you want to address regimes, a plant regime,
let's say where there is a notion of, but the kind of this picture breaks down,
is there some sort of an algebra there from which type three von Neumann algebras can emerge as some
sort of deformation, like is there some approach or is there some program to describe quantum
gravity in a purely algebraic way, let's say. Okay, if we talk not of quantum gravity, but
a combination of gravity and quantum field theory in the sense of quantum field theory on a curved
space time, so there is no background reaction from the space, this is rather well understood
so far, so what's the structure when we to describe quantum field theory on a curved space time?
Of course, it's not quantum gravity, quantum gravity does not exist as a rigorous field,
so it's difficult to say, but there are of course several schools that try to quantize gravity,
I don't know whether, which will be successful, and one thing that has been made is a proposal for
quantum space time, so where space time is made by coordinates, and you declare that these
coordinates do not commute, it is working by Sergio D'Opliker and others, and also the other
approach, and I said the formation as you want, it exists, but at the moment I really space time,
there is not much about quantum field theory on this, there is some work even on that,
but it's not at the level that a theory which is a complete or even a satisfactory,
just there is much, I think there's other ideas that are needed, so in this direction,
and then there is this idea that I mentioned now that to quantize
we need, also we need to understand, for example, this positive energy, this idea of
quantum null energy condition is rather recent, and what I can say, for example,
there is a very recent work by Edward Whitten, it was posted just before Christmas,
in which he proposed to consider not the usual phononage, but the cross-product of the
phononage by the modular group, from the mathematical point is well understood,
and so to have entropy there, which is continuous entropy and so on, but of course there
would say many results, many ideas, but as you know quantum gravity is still out of reach,
so we cannot say which one will be the final idea, if there will be a final idea, because
nobody tells us that there will be a theory of quantum gravity, and of course our experience
say yes, but this is a point, this is true that we are able to describe everything mathematically,
our experience say yes with physics, but it will be like this in the future, who knows.
Thank you.
Other questions?
I have a question, can you go back please to slide number 29?
Well in a sense it's 29, so in a sense it's related to
part of the questions that Farhang asked, we bring up to you, so you, in commenting this
slide then you concluded and then passed to the next one, saying that in a sense for type 3,
I mean what we obtain is meaningless. The full notion of the entropy is always infinite,
but relative entropy survives, it's a good notion. Okay, okay, I see, now it's clarified,
because I, you know, just, okay, excellent, thank you. So relative entropy, I consider,
I'm not the only one, but I consider relative entropy as a fundamental concept concerning
entropy, because even for normal entropy you can, there is a simple formula we can express
for normal entropy in terms of relative entropy, so everything, but in central context for normal
entropy it's always infinite, so it's meaningless, but relative entropy is still, still, because in
a sense what happens in part of the theory typically is that entropy is divergent, and if you
have a good approximation, maybe you see how it diverges, there will be some linear terms,
so when you compute a relative entropy, you subtract the divergent terms, and you remain
with some finite quantity. This is the work, for example, this is an appear in several work,
for example, the work of Michael Cassinian, who worked at the Thai National, that my work
with Feng Shun, the biggest about just to say, to say something, but this is the idea, to avoid
divergent quantities just by subtracting, and then see what remains after subtracting.
Thank you, I also think that it was very interesting what you have shown
today to us, and I also thank you for having discussed something that relates to your recent
work, especially for philosophers of time, it's important, or at least it became important after
the philosophical discussion in philosophy of physics with regard to approaches to quantum
gravity theory. I find very important what you said with regard to the modular theory of time,
and let's say, I would like to ask you an eighth question, so on the ground of what you
have shown us today on the ground of the recent development,
do you think that, or how can we define conceptually speaking time, also considering that
we are going to work more and more on quantum information, and we are developing quantum
computation, so what is in a sense the message with regard to temporality that your work wants to
convey? My message was that time, in this view, there is first thermodynamics and then time.
Time is the right point from thermodynamics, which is, I think I understand that my
creator has some doubts, if you want time, but if you have a quantum system and then
a state, then it already has thermodynamics, so the interpretation of the KMS condition,
which is the equivalent of the generalization of the Gibbs condition comes for free,
so just intrinsically we have evolution, so time, of course, time is modular scaling,
because the parameter can be scaled, but time comes from non-commutativity and
from the thermodynamical interpretation. Of course, other people might think,
have a good reason to say that maybe time comes first than thermodynamics, but it's a debate,
I think, and there is a paper by Dettel Buchot recently, where it takes, in a sense,
the opposite point of view. It starts with time as a first principle, it's something that we agree
without questioning what's the other time, just because we have a past and so on,
and then it derives, if you want, quantum mechanics or
having a Lagrangian, it derives, for example, commutation relation.
What I am not a physicist, I work with physicists, I am very interested in conceptual
problems, but what I can see as a mathematician is that there is the message that there is
an intrinsic evolution, only when you fix the set of the algebra and take a state.
Then, of course, we can debate over the interpretation, but it is a fact, this is not something
which is so surprising, that of course one has to meditate and meditate on this. It's a very deep
result. Thank you very much. Are there other
questions, also related to clarification?
Let me say that if you want to ask questions in the future, and if you want to communicate,
of course, we can do without any problems.
Thank you very much. I really enjoyed the talk, and we'll be in touch for sure. Thank you very
much again for accepting our invitation. I think we can thank again our speaker for this invitation.
Goodbye then. Thank you. Thank you very much, Professor Longo. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. See you.
