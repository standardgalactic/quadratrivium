1. **Super Determinism:** Super determinism is a hypothetical framework that suggests every event in the universe follows from its initial conditions without exception, unlike quantum mechanics which involves probabilistic events due to wave function collapse. In this context, if one were to reverse time, it would theoretically be possible if you knew the exact state at all times, but practically, it's not feasible due to the immense complexity of determining these states precisely.

2. **Time Reversibility:** The collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics is not reversible in time because there are multiple initial states that can lead to the same final state. In classical systems, while individual equations of motion can be time-reversible, the collective behavior of a large number of atoms (like a gas) can exhibit irreversible thermodynamic behavior, indicating that even in a time-reversible system, the whole can behave irreversibly.

3. **Irreversibility in State Space:** In the context of super determinism, there might be elements of irreversibility in very small parts of state space, which are necessary to create the observed fractal structure in the entire system. This could mean that irreversibility occurs at specific points or events (like the Big Bang or spacetime singularities) and leaves an imprint on the overall structure.

4. **Thermodynamics vs Time Reversibility:** The laws of thermodynamics are not time-reversible, which suggests that an underlying theory might be fundamentally irreversible despite individual equations potentially being reversible.

5. **Theoretical Considerations:** For an underlying super deterministic theory, the equations would be time-reversible in principle with infinite accuracy, but it's more practical to consider models that are time-reversible because nature seems to favor this approach.

6. **Future Research:** The speakers expressed openness to future research and discussions on these topics, suggesting that the underlying theory could be either time-reversible or not, and inviting further exploration in the context of similar talks to follow.

In essence, while super determinism is a compelling theoretical framework, practical considerations and observations suggest that irreversibility plays a role even within such a framework, and the nature of this relationship between determinism and reversibility remains an area of active research and debate.
