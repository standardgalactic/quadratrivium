1. **The Continuum Hypothesis**: The problem of whether there are more real numbers than the sets of natural numbers (which is true) has been a longstanding question in mathematics, with a variety of axioms proposed to address it, such as Martin's Maximum++ and the axiom of choice. This question was at the heart of the set theory community for over a century until David Asperow, with collaborator Ralph Schindler, used a technique to create a mathematical object called a "witness" to show that an axiom (Martin's Maximum++) implies another (star), suggesting there is an additional size of infinity between natural and real numbers. This resolves the continuum hypothesis by showing that both sides of the debate, which have been rival positions for 120 years, are likely true.

2. **Liouville Fields and Quantum Gravity**: Alexander Polyakov introduced Liouville fields as a model for quantum gravity in two dimensions using a path integral approach. However, his formulation was not rigorous. Over 40 years later, researchers like Vincent Vargas aimed to make sense of Polyakov's path integral by defining it precisely. They employed probability theory and transformed the Liouville field into a Gaussian free field, a simpler object that is tractable for computation.

3. **The Gaussian Free Field Approach**: The Gaussian free field is a model in physics where the landscape has infinite spikes everywhere, but it's theoretically boring because its properties are easily computable. Researchers found that they could express complex computations from the Liouville field in terms of the Gaussian free field.

4. **The Bootstrap and DOZZ**: In the 1990s, physicists independently developed a technique called the bootstrap to solve the Liouville field. They came up with a formula called DOZZ, but they couldn't prove it at the time. The new approach using the Gaussian free field has now shown that their original intuition with DOZZ was correct and rigorous.

5. **Polyakov's Path Integral and Quantum Gravity**: By connecting probability theory to the bootstrap approach via the Gaussian free field, researchers have now proven that Polyakov's path integral correctly models quantum gravity, validating his conjecture from 40 years prior. This breakthrough bridges two distinct fields of mathematics—probability theory and representation theory—and provides a rigorous framework for computing in quantum gravity.

In summary, recent mathematical work has provided a rigorous foundation for Polyakov's path integral approach to quantum gravity, which was inspired by the study of Liouville fields. This work also resolves the longstanding question of the continuum hypothesis in set theory, confirming the existence of an intermediate size of infinity between natural and real numbers. Both results represent significant advancements in understanding the nature of infinities in mathematics and the complexities of quantum gravity in theoretical physics.
