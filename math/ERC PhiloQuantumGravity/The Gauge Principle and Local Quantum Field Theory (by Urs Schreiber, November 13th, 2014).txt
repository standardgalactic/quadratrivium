You
So
It's also great pleasure for me and actually I have to apologize for not having to be introduced anymore
It means I've been speaking too much already, but thanks for still bearing with me
So now comes the second part of the conference and that will be about physics
I will talk a bit of physics and a bit of mathematics now. I might get a more technical, but I'm trying to give
An exposition so the punchline that I'm going to make is a that you know now that mathematicians since maybe four or five years
I finally realized that one should better distinguish
Things that you don't better keep track of objects being equivalent without necessarily being
Identified I would like to make the point that this is an insight that fundamental physicists have made in the middle of the 20th century
Almost 70 years back already. Of course the way they talk. It's a heart
for
Mathematicians and also for physicists themselves to keep track of what they actually know and what they forget, but if you
Look at what they should have written down with the mathematicians
They would have written this down seven years ago and this will be a bit my story today
I'll talk about how the gauge principle in quantum field theory is really
It's really pretty much the homotopic logic that Eric Kinsey just presented
And I will come to the actual homotopic logic at the very end and first we'll do some
Some something more reported and more sticky. They will connect to the talk by Mathieu in the morning
So this is a fact that it's experimentally kind of established the world is
governed by quantum field theory
But actually they're qualifiers to this which are important to keep in mind and we first of all
It's local quantum field theory. This will play an important role in my talk
My talk will be about two principles of locality principle and then the gauge principle
It's local quantum gauge field theory and actually but this will not be the topic today
It's like Grandiom quantum gauge theory. Whatever that means
This is not the topic of today the topic of today is the combination of these two aspects of the locality principle and the gauge principle
In quantum field theory, and this is what I will
Recall and explain so you don't even know any quantum field theory. I hope to follow this talk
He's a well-kept secret something that has been true for you know known for 70 years
But you don't see the textbooks highlighted. It's the following thing if you combine the locality
This I will explain in the following slides. If you combine the locality principle
Quantum field theory whatever it is with what fuses nowadays sometimes lately called gauge redundancy
But which is not actually redundancy and we look into this which is better be called as what it was when it was introduced
Gauge equivalences and the word equivalence there, you know the gauge is just jargon
What equivalence is going to be just a way just a notion of equivalence
If you're unveiling the equivalence that we we saw the previous talk that this combination is
That's maybe called the gauge principle to make it be more symmetric
The locality principle combined with the gauge principle is is what in mathematics is known as the stack principle
The stack condition I will this will be what this is what my talk will be about and another way so stack is a
Historically grown term that I think as most mathematical terms is entirely unsuggestive of what it actually denotes
Maybe a different way of saying it is that this is the concept of higher geometry where higher means again homotopic
So the goal of today is to reveal that well kept secret by example, I will demonstrate
how gauge fields
Form smooth group points then the soon stacks at the very end I'll indicate on the very last slide
The formalization of this is homotopic type theory and cohesive homotopic type theory
There has been alluded to before and I think that David Coffield will
Talk about a bit more in the following talk. So 90% of my talk about is just exposing this point of view
The topic of geometry has been present
So
It's kind of quasi definition
Meta definition. So what do physicists mean when they say a field is local
So field you should think of the fields before think of this like the electromagnetic field filling this room showing us how the light is distributed
And you know the electronics is distributed might be more exotic fields that get further from the media the Higgs field or some other fields
But it's good for everything that I'm going to say to mostly think of say the lecture
So, why don't we say that such a field is local?
Well, it's an obvious condition
It means that if I feel if I have a few conversion on a large space time say in this whole room
Then it must be true that this field configuration
is equivalently recovered by
The local field configuration saying the left half in the right half of the room such that they are
Identified on the overlap
So we don't want the globally funny things happening that some global field configurations exist that cannot be rebuilt by the local pieces
That's one way of studying the locality principle in physics
Here's a simple example the simplest mathematically simplest example, even though physically this is a bit exotic until until when was it last year
This was a hypothetical example last year a scalar particle was actually found so you might think of the Higgs field here
So when physicists say they have a scalar field like the Higgs field
Then that means that on a spacetime X X will always be my spaces
There is a function field conversion will be a function to the real numbers or to the to the complex numbers or something slightly more
Sophistic but essentially just such a function and the locality principle just means the following now
If you have a chart of X by open subsets ui, so this is my running notation
As we always have spaces X that are covered by open subsets ui and we take them all together to form a chart of X
So then if we have such a global future may restrict it to each of these patches to get functions on the new i and of course
being restricted this way they will
Identify these local restrictions on the double intersections ui cap uj of these charts
They feel the left half of the room feel the right half of the room
The section would coincide so the locality principle here is that these local v i
Together with these identifications on the double intersections are equivalent to the globally defined functions
so this is a trivial statement that
Nevertheless first as the
Starting point for what we're talking about so it must start this just means that we have the sheaf of functions are underlined usually
Which is physically the fields of the sheaf of scalar fields on patches of u
which mathematically is just the sheaf of smooth functions and
Yeah, a priori the fact that you have this assignment on local spaces and the restrictions to local spaces is what makes it a pre-sheaf and
That locality principle is mathematically the sheaf condition
Let's look at a very similar example, but this is good for what follows top
So this is not the true story, but back in the 19th century
Max will explain that the electric electromagnetic fields is local fields in a very similar way
so he noticed in modern language that the
Electromagnetic field strength encoded in what's known as a far-away tensor is a modern language just a closed differential to form f
on our space time and
Just as before without scalar fields
There's no longer a real value function, but two form by the story is the same
We may go and restrict such a two form to each of these patches to get local two forms and on double overlaps
They will intersect they will
Be identified and again the locality principle says that such a bunch of local two forms
Equipped with identifications or whether supports intersect are equivalent to the globally defined two forms a master and it's just the same thing again
We have now the sheaf of closed two forms
Starts off being a pre-sheaf and the this gluing condition is the sheaf
So this example of course the rock daughters in the 1930s is not the end of the story that there's more going on
This will concern us now
Here's another
Example that I want to mention for those of you have seen a bit more of mathematical physics
You know the sophisticated mathematical physics textbooks will go and say what is the field?
They will say well a field on a space X is defined by a field bundle, which is some vector bundle
Gamma over X and then such to the field configurations of the sections of that bundle
For what I'm talking about today, we should just be careful that this is what this is would call maybe a non-covalent version of a field
This encodes field configurations on that fixed manifold X
so
being a sheaf of sections
There will be a locality principle on the fixed X, but no locality principle
If we also let X vary as we would for instance in general
It is where X is space time that is not fixed up. We already so there's two concepts
maybe of locality and
What I was just to highlight here also is I did in my lecture on Monday is that what the textbooks like most of them
Not all of them, but most of them will highlight is this left part. They will look at sheaves on a fixed topological space
Whereas what's important here is that we look and achieves on the category of all manifolds
We let X vary in a covariant manner
We might call this covariant locality and um, this is
You know mathematically technically it's still the same concept of sheaf on a side
But I just want to highlight this fact that conceptually it plays a very different role
So I'm mastering what would distinguish by saying on the right side. We're considering the gros topos
On the side of manifolds instead of the petit topos on a fixed manifold just to keep this point in mind
So this was a locality principle and now we come to the gauge principle
Remember the goal of the talk is to combine these two and show what results so what is the gauge principle in physics?
It means that we change the notion of identification. Remember the locality principle was important
We said if local field configuration is equipped with identifications and overlaps
That was okay for scalar fields because if you think about it, you have two scalar fields to real their functions
There's really no other way either. They're not equal or they're equal. So if we have a phi one and a phi two
Kind of two you know terms of this world if you wish terms of type scalar field and they're equal or not
But for gauge fields, this is no longer the case. So these a one maybe I should write this here
So such a gauge field a
Is a is a one form not closed on the given base space
This is called when physics what the electromagnetic potential the vector potential of the electromagnetic fields
It's such that the derangue differential of it is the far and I tend to we saw before
Maybe the slideshow on this
Anyway, the point is this was the big insight first half
Of the 20th century that if you have two times gauge field configuration a such vector potentials
They may be gauge equivalent without actually being equal. So they may
Be the way first I'd like to speak is they they are physically indistinguishable, but still they're different
So we could write this twiddled sign coming from the notation for equivalence relation to denote
They might be a shoo a one which is different from a gauge for a two, but they're gauge equivalent
But in fact, it turns out what for the physics actually matter is the choice of identification
This is big of gauge transformations when they have a group value function
Let's just think of a real value function g here such
Maybe right now the board the g on this board would be a real value function
Say or general a smooth function the verge of the gauge group of our or forms take values in the learch of that gauge group
and we would say the gauge potential a one is
identified on the gauges versions a two if you know it satisfies some relation to these genes for a billion g that
Will just mean that that a two is a is a one plus dg plus the derangue
so
So I must run of course remembering choice of gauge equivalence
This means that we refine the equivalence relation. We just remember that two things are equivalent
To group ports the way that Matthew very nice to explain this morning will be remember this actual g that makes them equivalent
so
So to emphasize this here again what I just said so take chart are in
So Euclidean space inside our space that makes a coordinate chart if you wish and let's look at the gauge equivalence relations
Of the gauge fields on our end. So, yeah, finally a bit on the board
So I'll get you there's a one form on our end with the reason that the aspa and
and
And a priori when I think if we just say well, let's just identify these things if they're impeachable
Then we say let there be a gauge equivalence relation between a one and a two whenever a gauge transformation exists
Which means again
Mathematically that there's this formula
right and this
Gage this will be a children's relation
So it will have transitivity in it and that is just that transitivity is just inherited from the fact that the gauge transformations may be combined
So if a one is
Gage equivalent to a two via some G that exists in a two to a three while some H
Then a one will be Gage equivalent to a three wide via the combined Gage transformation
But as we just saw we should remember we should take this really
Equivalence relation lines and replace them by actual morphisms that remember that a morphism in a group are in there
Remember the actual gauge transformations
So what we will actually want to do is we want to assign to each Rn the group point of gauge fields
On that chart because objects are again these one forms whose morphisms are these gauge transformations
And now this is actual composition of gauge transformation and of course they have inverses this really
forms
group
So now comes the key point of the talk
We had have seen two principles now the the locality principle that said global fields should be equivalent to a bunch of local fields
Equipment identifications and overlaps and we have seen that the gauge principle says that the notion of identification changes
Identification should be by gauge transformations. So we now combine this. What does this mean?
So suppose we have our X again covered by the UI on each local chart
We have a gauge field AI as we had before
UI
These are the local field configurations
But now I'm supposed to identify them where they overlap. So on the overlaps of two charts
Supposed to identify them in this refined notion of gauge equivalence
So I'm supposed to choose a gauge equivalent between these two field configurations
Restricted to the double intersection not just assert that there is one. I have to choose one
so as we go from
field configuration A1 on UI on UI to that to it
You know the field configuration AJ and UJ
We maybe label that gauge transformation if we choose Gij
But then to do this consistently
We should on triple intersections
May make the situation here on the previous slide. We should say well if I identify AI on UI via Gij with AJ
Identify furthermore AJ with AK by some GJK and then that total composite
Identification between AI and AK should be the chosen one that I've chosen the double overlap between UI and UK
If you work if you write output
So this is a picture of that group point of gauge transformations
Where the composition of of these gauge transformations is just the point wise
Multiplication of these group values functions that these little g's are so if you work out
What what the fact means that this diagram commutes in the group port?
It just means that you have this equation between functions on these triple overlaps
Gij times Gijk people Gijk is an equation between group values functions. And that is the famous cosine condition
A cosine of the form that Mathieu mentioned would be
The kind of thing that the language of stacks
Helps us to phrase in terms of direct maps and that's in fact what we do in the next slide
So
So this is how local gauge fields actually work a gauge field configuration
Let me just reiterate this again
Combining the locality principle and the gauge for principle a gauge for configuration on big spacetime is a bunch of local gauge
Children to gauge gauge for configurations equipped with choices of equivalences on where they overlap
So let's build some interesting examples from this. This was not just 1931, I think by Paul Dirac
Was the first time that somebody added something new to Maxwell's equations
He he observes the following. Suppose you have a spacetime outside of a magnetic monopole
So you suppose
It's a pointer space. There's a magnetic monopole sitting. He took that point out at this origin of r3 there and
And um, you know topologically the remaining space is just a sphere times
Times something else since we're just since I'm currently not talking about
You know metrics or anything and just interested in topology
We can just as well just think of the resulting spacing is just being the sphere around this magnetic monopole
Because you know time the remaining space dimension being ignored for just presentation purposes
So then what is a gauge field configuration on that spacetime around that magnetic monopole?
Well, we have seen the prescription for how to build gauge field configurations on the previous slides
Here's what we have to do. We have to choose a cover of that sphere
Well an easy choice and it turns out to be sufficient. That's some theorem I should prove
But I just assume it we can cover it just by by two hemispheres. So here's our sphere
And we cover it just by the the southern hemisphere that overlaps the equator just a little bit and by the northern hemisphere
That overlaps the equator just a little bit called s plus and s minus
Then to define a global gauge field configuration
You have to choose local gauge field configurations one here and a plus on this hemisphere
And minus on this hemisphere and on then on the equator where they overlap
I have to choose a gauge transformation between them
G
So
That equator can be thought of as being arbitrarily thin. It's effectively just a circle. So the gauge transformation will be a
G value functions the gauge group g here for the electromagnetic field would be the circle group u1
So this gauge transformation this choice of gauge transformation that I have to make to glue these two
Two variations together. It's just a u1 value map on the circle
and now I haven't described the group part of
global gauge fields yet, but if you work it out you find that
In the group point that all these global gauge transformations of which we have constructed one year forms
One such will now be equivalent to the winding number of this gauge transformation g regardless of map from the circle to itself
That's what the physicists call the monotone number
the charge of this magnetic
Part of it being closed
It happens to be also the interval of this as two of them of the fire defense or
And people physicists would also call the magnetic charge the magnetic flux through that sphere
In mass jargon what we did is just the club what's called the clutching construction that exhibits the first charm class by tschechko cycle
That's just some jargon
Let's look at one more example
Which is sort of the same kind of example just to see how this really does appear in physics that this is something that you can
Experimentally test
Is the young mills in santong this come out maybe 20 years out or you know written down maybe 20 years or 30 years
I don't know after a dirac same kind of story now we think of an su2
So that's the gauge group of the nuclear weak nuclear force and su2
gauge fields
So so locally given by one forms of verse in the liaison of su2 on on the one-point
Compactification of our force so we think of doing an axilla rate experiment sort of
at CERN and we approximate CERN by
You know we approximate genie or something by r4
But we say it you know what happens at infinity. We should ignore field field should manage that infinity
So mathematically that means one considers the one point of electrification of r4
So that we consider fields advantage at infinity. So
Logically it means we consider fields on s4 the one point
And now we want to construct an su2 gauge
Configuration on that spacetime. It's the same story as before we may cover
There's definitely something you need to prove but it's happens to be okay
So we may cover again the force sphere by two hemite three spheres
s plus and s minus choose local gauge field configurations a plus and s minus just as before
the gauge transformation is the equator is now
a little thickened three sphere
And the gauge transformation is mapped to su2 on the three sphere again one finds the equivalent glass
These global field conversions given by the
So su2 again looks like s3. So you have maps from s3 to themselves. So again there
The turn out to be measured by the winding number of this map, which is now called the infantile number for historical reasons
Which is also expressed by this integral expression in mass starting again
What we did is just because the clutching construction of for the second charm class of an sc2 principle button
So these are just two examples that show you how from this prescription to build global gauge fields by
Using local gauge fields and gluing the gauge transformations. We get these very non trivial structures
Where you know the point is that all the non triviality is in the gauge transformation
This instantonum is the winding number of this gauge transformation. This gauge transformation is what sees this
This characteristic class without that gauge transformation
She would take this to be an identity. You would always see just a trivial class. You would see no incidence
Yeah, I should do this on the next slide. I should just do the next slide
So punch that what did we just saw? Yeah, I'm just repeating myself. The choice of gauge transformation crucially matters. So what I've kind of shown
Is that if you combine the gauge principle with just gauge relations
If you forget the choices of gauge transformations, there will be no monopoles and monopole would be zero because the winding number
for trivial gauge transformation is zero
Whereas if you do consider the full gauge group point for the locality principle, you get all magnetic monopole configurations
Similarly, if you combine the locality principle with just gauge relations for it say as you too
We can do force fields that you find no instanton configurations while
If you do keep the gauge group point
With its full information and take it into account. You do find all the instanton sectors
And these methods for the following reason. This is kind of an experimental fact
There are instantons in nature. This is deduced experimentally by you know
By all the standard mode for the barrogen is this the way that you know
the way that
The reason why there's more matter than intermittent in this universe comes from something called the chiral anomaly
Was the anomaly term is precisely that instanton number
So if these instantons were not there, there would be no
You know, there would be no matter over antimatter also more some phenomenon was called the QCD vacuum require
Instantons related to the theta angle and there is locality from the simple fact that if you take the Lagrangian
Well, I haven't explained this but if you take the standard model of party of physics
The thing that people get excited about when they find the Higgs particle. It's a local Lagrangian that describes a local field field
So if you take these two things together it follows
Logically that the physical world follows some of the topical logic in the sense that
We're not allowed to identify things that might be related just by ignorance relations
Let's make this let's let's draw a draw a conclusion from this
To come to the actual steps. So what we should what we should do when we when we consider
When we consider the collection of global gauge fields
Is that we should say to a spacetime x?
we assign
Not just the group height
Of globally defined one forms in the gauge transformations on this spacetime
But we assign the group height of our gauge fields and all of these topological sectors that that we build by
by gluing local fields and non-trivial gauge transformations
and one can check that
This assignment
To spacetimes of this group height of gauge fields in non-trivial topological sectors with non-trivial insertial sectors
That this is co-variantly local in the right sense
In the right senses in mass driving. This is a stack a higher chief of group heights
Meaning if you consider that as the correct global gauge fields, then these are recovered up to equivalence
from local fields with gauge transformation
Whereas the naive assignment to a spacetime x assign just the group of gauge fields
In the topologically trivial sector. So just the globally defined a's this will not be co-variantly local
And our two examples have shown this a global field configuration in that case
Would always be just a global one form whereas we've seen that if you glue it from local data, you will get more
So in mass driving there's naive choice where you forget the gauge transformations. It's just a pre-stack
Meaning it doesn't satisfy the locality principle
But also, you know while while you might say and while i'm arguing that this is a bad thing to consider
Actually math also offers you a way to use that
To present the top guy. There's some
Given any pre-stack. There's some universal way of completing it
Restoring the locality principle, which is what mathematicians would call stackification
So some more jargon
So so while this is called stacks
I think that neither of them were stack or sheaf of group points or as some people say category 5 in group points of a manifold
Nothing of this great terminology. I want to propose a different terminology
So the first one is unsuggestive stack is really bad work. This is certainly too long is both
so
So for formulating physics it's useful to change perspective a bit. I have said this in detail in my lecture last week
I'll say very briefly now again
We will go and think of these stacks on the gross side of all manifolds as being smooth sets with
refined gauge equivalence relations
Let's just look at what I mean. I mean this
Here's smooth sets that was the first part of my lecture last week
so
Think of an arbitrary sheaf an arbitrary assignment to
patches of manifolds u of sets x of u
Ascending any manifold u is a rule that that sends any manifold u
To what is going to be the set of smooth maps from u into some x
The space of maps from u takes only that this x hasn't been defined yet. That is our rule
We're defining a would be sorry a would be space x
But how we would map smooth manifolds into it
But the collection of these rules we will take to be the smooth the definition of the smooth space
And one of the the standard factor of category theory says that this is actually a consistent way of going about it
The unedalema says that this is consistent smooth manifolds do faithfully embed into such rules
They define smooth set sets
And indeed the unedalema says that we may remove after this inclusion the quotation marks here
If you consider consider maps of such rules defining smooth sets between a smooth manifold and such a would be space x
you do recover
The set that we predefined to be the set of maps from u into x
So the point of view here is that the point is that if you consider a sheath on the gross side of all smooth manifolds
There is a good generalization of the concept of smooth manifolds. It's a set equipped with smooth structure in some generalized sense
And uh, what i'm trying to advertise now on the on the next side is that this is a perspective in which we best
In physics think of these stacks of gate streets. So this is the same thing
Yeah, so we did for all my sources
This is the same thing now with the with the gate streets. I'm going to take into account the same slide as before
Only then it has group points now everywhere we had sets before but let me just say it anyway again to
Just to repeat so an arbitrary stack on smooth manifolds an assignment to each manifold u
And again, we take all the manifolds of group x u which you should think of as being the group of gauge fields on that u
Think of this as a rule
That where this group point is the group of maps from u into a would be would be smooth group point to be called x
That's the generalization of the unedalema
The two unedalema or maybe two kama one unedalema which says that again, this is consistent
Smooth manifolds will again faithfully embed into smooth group points
Which are things defined by such rules which are stacks on the gross side of all manifolds
And if under the embedding we map a smooth manifold into such a smooth group point
We will get precisely the smooth group point that defined x in the first place
So it's a bit of a i did you call a winchhausen trick to
To say what is a smooth what is a smooth generalized space by defining
What it would mean to map into it a smooth manifold and when you notice that a consistent rule of such assignments actually defines that thing
But is it okay that smooth maps between manifolds are just a set?
Yeah, because sets are special kinds of group loads. Yeah, so this happens to be
You know two kama multiples on one side. Perhaps one could consider more general things, but yeah, it's okay
So so here's where maybe a bit of research begins and now we're in the last five percent play of the talk
So I'll just state this so you can consider this category of all smooth sets
As a replacement for a category of smooth manifolds
And there's an excellent context for doing differential geometry and physics like lame
And moreover, you can take this full category or two category of smooth group
Boys and it turns out to be an excellent context for doing high differential geometry on gauge fields
And he actually has a precise meaning which I will not
You know get much at it, but it's it's the thing that I that levier actually called cohesive
So so this category satisfies some property
That makes us want to say they're cohesive and as soon as they're cohesive it turns out you can do
Certainly everything that we ever wanted to do in terms of differential geometry and physics and these things in particular
That's right bg con for the smooth group of gauge fields. So, you know what's going on now is we take bg con
As the name for that thing
which stands are you
a manifold u to the group point
Of global I mean of correct g gauge fields
Fields on you the way we discussed in some detail
By the previous slides this whole assignment now I may regard as one
single smooth group point
Aspects of this were mentioned in previous talks by Mathieu and maybe also by
by Eric. So what we can do now
In the category of smooth group points we take a manifold any manifold
We got a smooth group of value and consider maps start into this
And this is how these will be these cosines that Mathieu mentioned. So these these maps. It's called the nabla. They will be the gauge fields
on x
So what we have built in this by going to this excellent context of smooth group points of geometric commodity types
we've built a context where
Gauge fields on manifolds have a what's called a modular stack
We find classifying space so that maps into this space are gauge fields. It's right like this actually
And then if you have two such maps and hence two such gauge fields that are more to be between such maps
It's precisely gauge transformation between the gauge fields
So this allows us to do lots of nice things which
Which is the topic
Maybe of another talk maybe of tomorrow's lecture actually
So let me just end this talk by
by saying
One could ask now given that we saw that physics
So recovers or knew already about many concepts that turn out not to be crucial to this new homotopy type theory
That we just saw in Eric's talk you can ask well, can we formalize this kind of construction on homotopy type theory?
Say if if we want to bring computer scientists into the game and have them prove something about
You know magnetic monopoles and youngness in sometimes then there's not a real real chance that
If we could formalize these things that they might reason about
the QCD effect
So let's say this is an outlook so recall the previous talk by Eric Fincer about homotopy type theory
So this plane of homotopy type theory that was on the board
Does now about modular types BG of instanton sectors. So
So
So this is forgetful map from this stack BG con to the stack that is called just BG
Which which forgets forgets forgets these one forms AI and simply assigns
The the unaligned G principle abundance encoded just by the transition functions g ij
So this type these types may be extrematized in homotopy type theory namely simply there are pointed
Connected types mean they do have a term and that term is unique up to the equivalent
Connectedness is something that was one of the initial insights of a votsky
And connectedness and distinct something one might formalize in terms of formative that fit
Now, however
The insert from seconds alone, of course, not what we're interested in. We really need these smaller aspects of the gauge fields
Our plane hot is consistent
But ignorant
Consistent with what ignorant about these BG corns what I mean by this is they don't want to be
Type 3 does have models in infinity top process, you know in context where these BG cons exist
But the plane language or what would be type 3 is no means to to speak about them
To characterize them or to notice that some type is of this form whereas it does have the means to notice
of some type is of this form
This was mentioned very briefly. I think by eric at the end of his talk when it's an extra axiom to to capture this
generally geometric information
And the idea is to add an axiom to hot
I mean this has been made precise, but
Not given gives the precise definition. So the idea is to add an axiom to it
That ensures this is how to think about it. That ensures that for every type x in there every smooth
group point
there's another one
Shape of x
Which has the interpret which is supposed to have the interpretation of being the
The type of geometric paths in x not the
Not the plane paths that exist in homotopy type theory that are just
Gage occurs, but actual geometric paths in the sense of
Actual trajectories, you know, this is a type x here space talking about actual trajectories
Smooth trajectories that a particle might trace out in such a space. It's a smooth message from a real line
So so one may one may add such a construction
It gives a modality on the type system shape
And you know add a bunch of axioms to it to ensure that it behaves the way
that this idea suggests it should behave and then
Homotopy type theory equipped with that modality is called cohesive homotopy type theory
So this is something I did with Mike Schumann
And I think a little bit more about the maybe philosophical implications of this will be in the following talk by David Corker
So if we do add that axiom
then
We do are able to axiomatize these things as follows
First of all, if I have a direct function between this shape type of x into bg
And this these functions have another interpretation of flat
Connections and the way this works is by
Parallel transport for those who've ever seen this thing
So if we take the shape of x
Which you should another simplest but it collides with a dependent product
That's why I'm writing it should think of as being the path infinity group point of x
If I map from that to just bg
That is the same thing as a flat connection. It turns out. I mean this has an interpretation of flat connection because you think of this guy
So this is pass so this is as objects kind of the points x y z
In x but as morphisms that has geometric paths between geometric paths between these points
So as we have such morphism to bg, you know bg looks like it has locally it has a single point
And and the morphisms are these g valued elements, which are the gauge transformations
So such a cross cycle that's just in each point
Located to the single point here in each path gamma here to
To a group element associated with this path
This group element when we think of being the the parallel transform the transport that a g connection would assign to such a path
But it has to be a flat one because this being an infinity group point
You know if this really is a diagram here in the group, but there will be a two-cell fitting it. So it means that if I if I go
Go out on two paths
And and from this process there's a surface between them
Then there must be a multitude between this parallel transport and this parallel transport
Which is the flatness condition of
Okay, I mean this is maybe a lot of time
But for those who have seen it just the basic course of differential geometry will maybe recognize how this works
So this is the parallel transport of nabla. It is in this way that
Functions are the shape type to bg encode flat connections
But now we wanted all connections not just the flat ones but often and it's just a proposition now
Which I which requires a bit of explanation that I won't give here that one can obtain this by doing kind of
Forming certain
I want to be fibers twisted I want to be fibers of the
Of the type of maps between these so the statement is first of all
It's possible a cohesive thought to axiomatize
Mathematic concept of the chan character. The chan character is some measure of curvature of
Of gauge fields. It's the contour of chanberry theory
And it's then possible to define these bg con types increase the thought is being multiple types of
What would sensibly be called chan character twisted flat gauge fields?
So this is the content of some
Some articles that I wrote if you want to see the details. I have to point you to those and
and I'll just close this this talk by
by stating that one of the
I think we really need theorems or facts that you have then you may approve and cohesive formative type theory is that you have
There's a differential version of you know to end with one extra sort of new inside
There's a differential version of the brown representability theorem
So the tradition of brown representability theorem says that
There are nice komodji theories in the sense of ironberg stainwood komodji theories like k theory or elliptic komodji
But they're equivalent to spectra in the sense of stable of multiple types in a multiple theory. So there's a
These the spectra are a billion versions of these types bg that we've seen here
And you would ask you should ask
What does it mean to take such a journal as komodji theory like k theory and form a differential refinement for it?
Such as differential k theory the differential k theory is the there's a space of fields
In string theory what's called the r r field. So these two appearance gauge fields in some
professible
Theories of physics and so you want to ask what happens to the broad representability theorem
As you as you add these this connection structure this gauge construction
That used to be an open problem for a while and
based on work by
By some people in regensburg around
oli bunker
They show that in cohesive formality type theory you can
You can show that
That the cohesive stable of multiple types have all the properties that you would demand of a differential of generalized
Komodji theories so that you would
Take this as the defining
So this just is an article to see that something real can be done by taking the gauge principle from physics
Combined with the locality principle from physics interpreting it in the modern formative type theory and running with it
Just close by pointing it to some references that go into the full detail of all the stuff that i glossed about
So there's a kind of lecture note review that i
That is introductory of what and what for is high geometricalization that exposes these things. There's the full details in this
in the book that i wrote
This is articles mike schulman where mike shows how to fully axiomatize this cohesion
in quark
And uh particular in that book there's a section one two
I think this would be the topic of tomorrow's lecture actually which which walks in full detail through how to do all of classical
field theory and transfer this
cohesive axiomatics. That's it. Thanks
I
I want question
What is differology in your point of view? Yeah, it's an excellent question. It has an excellent answer
Yes, it's included in this as follows
So
Thanks for the question. It's an excellent question. So so if we if i like to write age for
This collection of smooth sets
and um
Yeah, let's just talk about sets for the moment to make it easy. So I talked about this shape modality
You know, I said on age this is operation shape which sends every
Every age to the shape this this is an
Ammona that really comes from an adjunction on this age that works as follows
So this age is a top or sitting over set with a global section functor and an inverse image
This inverse image has a further left adjoint
So give it a name maybe right now
And this has a further right adjoint
so
So the full axiomatics of this cohesion is actually that they are such an adjoint quadruple of functors
setting the terminal geometric morphism and
Induced from this is an adjoint triple of monads and co-monads on age
Right these two give a monad these two give a co-monad these two give a monad. These are called shape
flat
And sharp and this bill of years the deer really
just
written out so there is this
This monad which is part of the system called sharp coming from
Taking global sections and going back to this right adjoint and here's not the answer to your question
if you have any x and h now
then
This being a monad there's a unit meant to its sharp
for x
So x is a different logical space precisely if this is monomorphism
Another way to say this is that the different logical spaces are precisely the
the quasi topos
Of sharp separated pre-sheeps here
A better way maybe to say if you have an arbitrary x which where this is not a monomorphism
If you have any smooth space like
The smooth space of two forms or something is far from being concrete and you have the image factorization
You can factor this unit through a
Epi morphism followed by a monomorphism now this makes this universally a monomorphism
So this would be the the concretification the universal different logical space underlying x
So so one way to write it is that the different logical spaces
Form with subtopos here the sub quasi topos
factoring
this extra
So so the points these smooth sets are more general than manifolds
They're more general than for shame manifolds
They're also more general than different logical spaces, but they contain all these categories faithfully
An important thing is
That that they're precisely those objects that we need to form gauges are precisely not the phyrologic
if you think about
So so just Maxwell theory. So there's a sheaf of two forms
Say close two forms in age
So we may regard as a smooth space, but you need a such that
If you have a manifold and are morphin into this smooth space of two forms
That's precisely the same thing as a two-form or let's write f precisely the same sense. It's far
But now this space is maximally non-concrete
It has no underlying set of points supporting it if you do if you do the
Sharpification of this you get the point
so in epsilon
Of omega two closed is the point
So the unaligned phylogic space of this is trivial and yet this is a highly important and interesting space in order to bring these
gauge spaces gauge theory space into the game. We go to this full topos of all
smooth sets of huge
Okay
In the
The specter you have in mind are just the internal specters
When you say when you say stable, yes, exactly, I mean the yes, so
So
Right, then that is exactly what connects to your your theory of so we could start with that of tangent
Also, we could start with a cohesive infinity topos say of infinity sex on smooth manifolds
And then form a tangent infinity topos of parametrized
parametrized
cohesive
spectra
Bundles over space in here, of course the fiber of this is kind of
All right, this fiber would be the stabilization of H
the actual spectra of H
So the statement I had on the board in the previous slides
As stated there what give what gives that if you take these guys
Included in here. This is still a cohesive fin topos
Then then then maps into these represent differential determinants
But actually looking at this picture something even better is true
You can why just include these you can take a general guy in here, which is a base space x carrying
carrying a spectrum
Let's call this base space something different
Be
It's to do some brackets around to indicate that it's a cohesive parametrized spectrum in here
And now you can take an ordinary say smooth manifold
equipped with a zero spectrum bundle over it
and ask for
What is you know, chromology of x with coefficients in this boundary from the turn home?
And as you know, I guess what this gives is
This is the total
Twisted generalized differential
Ecology this gives the parametrized spectrum over the space of twists b twists
on x
And over it it has a spectrum bundle whose fiber of a given twist is the twisted
Comorgeti spectrum of it there. So so what even gets a statement that is a bit more general than this one has that
Twisted differential generalized common theories are the same as
How would you call them cohesive tension types, right? So again, you would have paid for the characteristics that by the way used to be
Used to be a wide open problem in a in string theory. They knew to correctly model the r r fields
So the underlying incident sectors are in k theory
They knew that the actual fields are differential k theory and they knew that in the presence of what's called the b field
It had to be twisted k theory
But there was no working formalism. They would tell one what
What the spectrum of b twisted differential k theory was
You know, what's kind of clear what we should do, but there was no
formula the hopkins-singer formulation didn't apply to this setup and um
And this kind of solves I mean, there was also given an explicit construction again by by willy bunker and tomas nicole
but um
But if you if you take if you take e to be there's a smooth version of the k u spectrum for k theory
It's naturally parametrized about b gl one of k u about the twists of k theory
And that represents in the smooth tension infinitobus. So is the differential
Okay, so this answers and this is how I got to these questions. This answers
Concrete open questions that people have for study, you know
string theory like one of your theory where you ask about consistent string backgrounds for d-brains
In the presence of our our fields there despite, you know, all the years that people have been talking about this
There there were and are open mathematical problems as to what exactly that is and such technology actually goes some way to
to answering this
Well, at the same time being I mean, this is kind of a point I would like to make but at the same time if you look at it from this
logical perspective
There's this shortcut
That lets you reason about these things
You know without going through this full machine of the hopkins sing a construction of difference
Yeah, the top the category of all chiefs on the side
Chiefs, yeah, okay, so they're chiefs. Yeah, that's my question
There's a locality principle right here
So the fact that I'm working with extra chiefs and stacks means that you know
If I write BG con and then say that a map into it is a gauge field
then
It really means the space of maps it is gives the full
space of correct gauge fields seeing all the
topologically non-trivial inside of sectors instead of if you took this just to be the pre-chief
of you know the pre-chief of
The naive pre-chief you would just get the topologically trivially one. So the chief condition is
Yeah, I build a driving. I mean we're talking top horses anyway, but it's built in and
It has this physical relevance
So
Yeah, it's chief right maybe I should have said more clearly so the category smooth says it's a category of all chiefs
I mean you put the you know the point of this is that
that you can change you can change your side if you if it
You can change your side and maybe there are lots of sides as top horses are cohesive and hence
There are lots of exotic geometries in which all this theory also goes to us also interpretation
In particular, there's this very exotic choice
You might take sites like smooth manifolds and equip them with the trivial growth nick to point it such that the chiefs are just
Pre-chiefs I think that will still be cohesive because they have a terminal. Well, yeah, no
I'm not is it
I think actually it is yeah, so you will get a cohesive theory which will however be
Very exotic geometry
But that's a good point maybe so this whole axiomatics in the end proofs statements that are hold true not just in the smooth context
They hold true forms and complexity context and the context of super geometry
in this tangent context
also in the context of
Of spectral infinity geometry one has to work a bit there, but also
I mean when what you think about it is that you are taking a site with some algebraic structure
You know, and that's what you use so, you know, like in a lobbyist theory
Well one could do that too that it's useful to build some models, but I haven't actually used that right
Let me a series
No, I don't mean lobbyist. I mean look at the real estate, but I mean you have some operations you want to apply on your
on your objects
And these operations come from the basis from the site you choose
I mean
Do you want difficulty to apply smooth?
Smooth maps
So you pick them in your in your basis
You know how I mean the question is how how how much of what you're doing
Dependent on the site. Yeah, that's the whole point nothing, right? So I what what I mean as long as I'm so this is the point of this quiz
Actually, we see that lots of topos is they may be defined as being sheaves or infinity she is on some side
Then we may ask so in which of these for which source of site we have a good notion of differential geometry differential
commodity then this is the
So one answer is well as soon as this topos
Exhibits cohesion and that it's thermogenetic morphogenesis extra adjoins as soon as that is the case
We can axiomatically build
All ingredients of modern differential geometry inside here and hands get you know notions of all of them
For whatever side makes that true, but you're of course right then, you know
But can you do some reverse engineering and understand without the
kind of properties
I don't know completely this would be a question for some other experts in the room
Maybe so I know I have you know, I have this notion of what I call infinity cohesive side
I have some sufficient condition on the side so that's how I build these models that I that I know that topos is cohesive
Yeah, you would be the expert too
So
Of course the the important point it would be one really needs is for
For the stacks where the conditions a bit condition for the extra left to turn is much stronger
So but it would be excellent the three
We thought a bit about it
That by working sufficiently hard it was able to arrive on basically everything
But that would be nice
Yeah, but uh, I mean it can take pages of calculations
I mean what kind of description do you have
Well, you have some
Some elementary properties on the sides
So something involving just the category and the topology seems
Jacob receives these kind of things
So if you want to have a look at you can take my paper
And in fact we were discussing that I I know
Yes
On the end forum, so it's it's called um
Cyber characterizations from geometry in my ends of thought
So in this paper I gave various general tools to deal with these kind of questions
Of course, the cohesive condition appears to be
More more difficult than the examples I treated in the paper, but still
I mean, so I'm not saying that's just why you find the
You can get the result from one way, but still I mean
I'm talking more in general about
Making the summaries and often it is the case
Sometimes you have general
Yeah, but my question was really do you do you have some
geometry, you know insights from
From this kind of criteria
And you know
I should say you eliminate the references to sheets
Completed so you are able to
Rephrase all the conditions you want without using
Because this is the big problem. You see when you pass it from a site to a topos
They don't really are the real non-trivial ingredients in the sheet indication
Fact which admits a very complicated very
relatively complicated construction because you have to take the last last construction and each time
You see it's it's an higher order construction
So the point is if you want to arrive on things in some sense, you have to
Eliminate this sheet indication. There are various ways you can do and so in some sense the idea is to
Eliminate the reference of the sheet indication by expressing
properties in terms of denseness of certain
sub-objects
And basically if you are able to do this and for example in a locally connected case
I showed that it is the case and once you replace things in terms of denseness then
Instead of talking about the sheet indication you have to talk about closure, which is something which has a perfectly elementary characterization
So I mean this is one part of the but I mean
For for complex in areas like this one has really worked very specifically. So I mean for local connectedness
Uh, it was relatively easy to find and this is more complicated. So one should
Should work specifically on that. So I can't say anything more than that
But I think uh, it's right to be optimistic because I mean this relationship between sites and this by the way very very natural
We could expect
At least for some specific
Maybe it's not possible to do it for all possible sites, but at least for some sufficiently dark
classes
That's um
That's his way of thinking engage fields provide a different interpretation of the high guard BRT community groups
So
I mean first of all one maybe to answer these questions
So so one can take so suppose you have a space supposed to be a c complex if you have a spacetime x
you can form
You form this because this this mapping stack into
Into the modular of of the connections and you want to say this is the modular of gauge fields on x
This is not quite correct actually due to the content. This needs to be this connects to the question about
Deflogical space this needs to be concretified. This modernize deck is non-concrete. So there's a there's a if you
Yeah, it's taking it choosing a choosing a hot filtration on g connections with such a choice
There's a way to concretify this
I'm just saying there's some way to build this internally certainly this is the stack that one would call maybe
g bundles
with connections on x
and um
And uh with a few more exams for to bring
differentiation into the game
This modernized take may be differentiated to a lee algebra it
And that is what the BRST complex is the BRST complex is a algebra of that lee algebra
So it's that in a way the lee algebra the infinitesimal version
Corresponding to this thing. So the commodity of
The commodity of the BRST complex is a shadow of the homotopy groups of the full modernized stack of gauge fields
So this recovers for instance the lowest lowest group of seven pi zero of this is just equivalence class of gauge fields
Which recovers the fact that the degree zero commodity is the BRST complex just a gauge invariant
functions, right?
Maybe I should run dual or something right? It's the functions on the lee algebra of this kind
And so forth, right? So
So in this sense it has this interpretation, but I think you may be asking for something more concrete
I'm not sure if I could answer a bit. Maybe you want to know why exactly do people say that the second commodity here
Knows the anomalies or something like this and this is uh, I don't know if this has a good. Yeah, I think this is a bit
I don't want to say any answer to this right now. Let me just stay this year
So
