We are going to start the morning session, we are going to start the morning session
with Dean of the daughter of the ex-University of Wales, who is going to speak about this place as if you would like to ask about it.
Good morning and first of all thank you to the coveniters, the organizing committee for writing me.
Now since it is early in the morning, I am not going to get into deep formalisms and a lot of complicated formalism and so on.
What I want to try and do is to look at the question of the relationship between topological spaces and inferior parts
and don't worry, I am not going to assume you know what it is.
Until then I am not going to define it.
So you will see how it comes back.
What I want to do is to look at the intuitions behind the relationship between inferior parts and spaces.
And this links what might seem to be the abstract infinity category maybe through to homo-topical algebra and algebraic homology in a quite classical way.
So if I take spaces as very good points, like similar infinity good points, whatever they may be,
we have left some aspects of some topological spaces.
Now I have over the last, well, any number of mentioned, been evaluated by certain people of a certain school of homo-topology
basically in the states who have tended to use spaces in that way.
They use it on all sorts of things.
I think of spaces as being topological spaces possibly with traditional structure.
So that's what spaces is going to be.
What type of spaces do I want to put a learn on the way of having to decide if there is anything I can do about this?
So what type of infinity good points and what is infinity good points?
What aspects of a space are milled by infinity good points and what should be our intuition of infinity good points?
My least of the last question, and none of these questions are going to be answered to the definitive answer,
my least of the last question is that a lot of the time, those of you who work with this,
they have to deal with what seems to be a whole of the technical paper around infinity good points.
How are you to think of these in terms which are nearer to the geometry that you are used to?
I think that's a very important set that needs to be made and is completely consistent with the aim of this meeting.
So I want to sign show you that the whole of this machine is very well based on classical questions and classical mathematics.
So it's fairly historical for some of these at the time and hopefully that will mean that you don't switch off your brains too early.
I mean it is early, it's a long one.
So let's go back and go back a hundred and fifty years to 1895 and I want to ask the audience to come out with what 1895 is,
because we're here.
So, Henri Blancage and his famous paper, which is one of arguably one of the main basis for modern performance.
Now, what can I do, both at spaces and in the utility services of V-Manual or what you wanted, and polypots.
I want to make a distinction because a polypote or a food initial complex is going to be a space plus some combinatorial information
on how to build it and that's important because it's one of the ways that he looked at it.
There's another reason why this is important and that is that if you look at many spaces that aligns in modern differential geometry,
they have got an extra structure, they're coming from a geometric situation, so they're coming with additional combinatorial structure.
So, that information will come and get, oh, we will be faced by just its combinatorial state or differential manifold or whatever.
It is in the states that we get where it came from.
That's been admired in England.
Now, there's a very good at anyone who's interested in looking at the history of topology.
There's a very good history of topology, edited by John James in 1999, and in it, Sir Caliott gave an introduction to Juan Caliott's work.
But I'm not even saying history, I'm using a paper, you don't know what to do, you know, by Bob Gorman in the annals of a meeting a few years ago,
and he did a very good job of looking at the algebra of parts, which is where we're going to start.
Now, according to these sources, Juan Caliott has adopted at least four different views of what I'm going to do about it.
Which I'm going to write as pi1, should have been the capital of that, pi, but it is pi1x of the space,
and the use of modern differential geometry, it's going to be standardised in three dimensions.
So, in a little particular order, this first one, debt consummation to company faces of x.
Now, I will, for any of you who wants to, or wants it, I will give a brief mention of what company faces are, surely.
There's a whole nine groups of an integral connection on a vector bundle.
That, I'm not going to pick up, because it takes me too far away from the other sources.
There's one which most people have met, if they've done an algebraic biology course,
and that is a set of modular classes of loops at a base point, or paths,
and that will give us a new body rather than a mention of new.
And then if x is a polyethope, so we've got additional information, either realisation of some sort of visual context,
and again, that I will give some indication of some sort of context, surely.
Then we can actually give a presentation of this group, or real-life, in terms of generation of relations.
And that's a very important third thing that I want to pick up, surely towards the end of the talk.
Because that has led to a lot of results in common for the loop day.
We will not follow up to the second and third.
So, let's go back to today what we're comparing the sum of.
We had, at that stage, the mathematics had the use of paths to imparting rules,
so there was a certain amount of, I'll do the art of the paths,
do the first one, and this will be on one path, and then this will be on the path, which you can concatenate.
There's also the idea of analytic continuation,
and so you have, at the beginning of the covering phases,
there are transformations, which are covering phases,
transformation of covering phases, leading the base space.
Thanks for being there as well.
So, we've got a definite link into past and classical analysis,
which I think is something that we tend to heed in the back of our minds when we're doing things in today,
but it's very important for some of the applications of these ideas.
The fourth one was this, when we had parted out to not a presentation,
which meant that we would hopefully include some of the geometry into the presentation,
just that, in instance, obstacles, like obstacles,
the generating elements have gotten into the patient in terms of the usual situation of the day.
So, I think in combinatorial information and how the space was built,
I've seen combinatorial information into how to do it, to be presented,
and this has a two-way purpose.
Now, a great people, assuming that most people have met this,
I wanted to put it in because of the fact that it's an location,
and it's one of the two little cliques that I want to point out,
is a certain special feature.
So, if we've got parts, continuous maps from 0 and 1 into X,
then we've got a source, which is evaluation of 0, and a target.
We've got competition, there's the usual formula.
You go on half third, twice as fast in the first half of the interval,
and then B third, twice as fast in the first half,
and you go from continuous maps to QC,
and you have nations that do the same.
And we scale so that it's still building in between 0 and 1.
But this means the competition is not associated with the life of Dan,
but it is up to a homotopy.
And the homotopies are important because, you know, it's a usual thing.
You do one path and then another path,
and then you, having considered that, you've got third one,
and Q by alpha, Q by gamma.
And when you look at the homotopy,
if you look into that and all the elements, the books on homotopy theory,
the homotopy actually happens inside the curve.
If you're looking at a homotopy here,
it re-planatizes the curve in a continuous,
it forms a planatization curve to another one.
So there's a sense in which it's very thin.
It happens within the image of the curve.
So that idea of thin is something which comes in occasionally.
It's not sensual, but I think something which is quite simple.
Constant paths act like identities of the thin homotopy.
But again, within, the homotopy happens within the curve.
It doesn't matter about the effect.
It's all happening within the kind of difference it's made to be using for the curve.
And the regardless paths, my usual thing, notice,
you've got the path, you've got the middle path as well.
And you're going to probably be getting a little over 4% here.
So that, again, moves us.
Showing that it works like an inverse is up to thin homotopy.
Now, even people who are coming to Texas,
well, by the way, I've put a handout version of this,
given it to the organizers,
so that if anybody's wanting to have notes of it, it will be available.
So even if these are before the government phases,
we've got to put some restrictions on the state,
because I don't think it's connected.
Yes, basically really, but it gets very messy.
And we'll choose the base point again,
to keep the acquisition reasonably safe.
Then there's a thing called, provided the state is nice enough,
there's a universal covering space.
Now, the usual example, as everybody expects me to write down,
is if you take the circle, then the real line acts as a universal covering space,
and this is all to do with winding numbers,
and I get back into classical complex analysis.
The covering spaces have a unique part lifting property,
so that if you have a path, and if you've got a path down in the base,
and we've got something in the covering space,
if you pick a point in the fiber,
and you've got a path down here, starting at the base point,
at the leader, not just,
then you lift it uniquely to a part of it.
So, as long as you say where it starts, it will lift uniquely.
And that gives an action of the fundamental interview on the fiber.
Now, the depth is small, well-known,
and some material in a lot of courses on the game is common.
Now, the covering space is equivalent to the category of sets
of, or with an action of the fundamental interview.
And if anybody wants, I can sketch that,
but as I said, this is all reminding you,
trying to get into the thinking in terms of these ideas.
And the thing is that the fiber over the base point
comes from everything with the action of the event,
the covering space.
And you do it at,
it's like a depth transformation.
The depth transformation of,
I've probably been looking at all the morphisms of the top,
which don't shift anything down below,
but they project them off the attention.
So, this is sort of moving the parts of the,
the high one set around consistently the projection.
And so, that's the one way I'm going to define the fundamental interview.
Now, the other thing is that this acts as the key starting point
for the definition of the opening game,
but I think in fact we've derived it from an earlier one,
but to say I'm not certain of that.
A fundamental interview of a scene for which,
in the beginning of the scenes as well later,
we haven't mentioned that.
So, the out-of-the-game version, the geometry version of effects.
And here the interesting thing is,
this is related to Galois,
and a famous SCA-1 seminar,
which defined the mathematical distinction.
So, this Galois-Tranquillian mix is one that will come in later slides,
because we're still in a one,
and actually although here we're now actually in the early 1960s,
but we're still in 1895,
so the better get going on as a way of thinking.
Like, since the initial complex,
I said I'm going to give you a brief reminder of that.
I'm not going to define it,
but think of the space as having the sort of
previously seen computer graphics, you know,
dinosaurs and wire frames.
And that can give, if you don't know the definition,
you're going to have to go on with,
you can call it a fan-scale,
I don't think it's a dinosaur-scale,
the one-cells of the,
the one-celled machines of the spiritual complex.
You form up the freedom by darkness.
It's not just a,
just a lot,
it's a complex system,
and it is generally important to think about it this,
and that whenever you see a two-sympact,
or a dynamo,
which I'll call V0, V1, V2,
you force the path that goes down to the side of it
to be the same as half the total amount.
So, so you're adding in these today,
and that's how you get the,
this one isn't correct.
There's the other one,
so this is how you get the translation part.
Now, as I said, these were later,
these ideas were later taken up by Shire,
Nielsen and others,
and they form the basis of a lot of results in what we have,
nanoconformant or immunity.
So, these are some presentations,
these are some feed-goods,
Nielsen Society,
all related and fine about this sort of,
of way of looking at things.
That is a point I wanted to suggest is one that couldn't be important to me.
Now, these are the 19th century,
and I come into the middle of the 19th century,
and the beginnings of,
one of the beginnings of modern,
modernity.
The quotes I want to take come from Henry Whitehead's ICM address in 1950,
and he spoke to her for an area which he wanted to develop,
which he thought I'll do today, modernity.
And here's the point, actually,
I couldn't talk a lot about it,
I couldn't model it,
but it gets technically quite hard fairly quickly,
and you've got to go with the fairness of the people,
you get some beautiful results,
but they're a bit more tricky to approach.
So, I'm going to come at it from a different level.
Whitehead said,
the ultimate aim of this ultimate harmony body
is to construct a purely algebraic theory,
which is equivalent to a homotropic theory,
in the same sort of way that an analytic is a movement of pure,
coherent, and dramatist.
This is spoken in Hans Farrer's book,
The Statement of the A's of this very homotopy
might be the following classification problems,
the homotropic classification problems.
Classified by the homotropic habits of colleague either,
either by those realizations of solutionality,
or by algebraic data,
and then compute the set of homotonic classes,
maps in terms of classification data by x and y.
So, we've got an algebraic model for x
and an algebraic model for y,
and we want to be able to work with it,
and maybe this is totally unrealistic,
when it is realistic, when it is not realistic.
And the points to know are that this sets up,
now you know the set of modelling nice spaces by algebra,
modelling them quite completely,
as far as their homotopy is concerned.
But does it make any thing to know what algebraic data is to me?
It doesn't actually know what algebra,
algebraic might mean,
and that is an interesting find,
because I think we're going to have to get it.
Each such context of algebraic homotopy
clearly corresponds to not just spaces,
but maps.
And sometimes we tend to forget about this,
and I've actually just had it,
to definitely take this,
where some of you might be able to do a beautiful model
for an homotopy,
or a suitable part of an homotopy,
and never actually check,
so it doesn't know how they're going to compare homotopy,
because they have a lot of maps to do with it.
But it has to go on, in some sense, through a thought.
Now, it is interesting, in Henry Whitehead,
1950 was only using cathode number,
and the beginnings of cathode at the end
of seeing the usefulness of it.
But here we've got,
there's not such a thing going from top,
a category of suitable spaces
to algebraic data,
of the type on the first slide.
And we've got,
immediately,
some of those general legal equivalents coming in,
which is,
I'll say cathode is half the univervalent,
because it happens,
it doesn't depend on that.
And it's going to be those things
that we become isomorphisms
when we go over the gap.
So things that our models can't tell the difference
between those basic,
active equivalents,
electric equivalents,
or x and y,
then our models can't tell the difference
between x and y.
I'm not asking for a complete solution
to all the problems,
I'm looking for instant.
By mentioning this,
if you,
if I go on with this,
it will be good, of course,
all right, models can't be used.
But I'm not going to,
go on here,
but of course,
I'll remain the partner
to have a clue of my slides,
if you're interested.
In particular format,
this is actually a problem.
Okay, this doesn't as many times.
Now, the classical case,
would be the ultimate data
would be a,
the list of model values.
Okay, that would be a very,
very simple,
example.
So all the harm of a group,
acting as peers in your base,
at the base point,
and then you can come up with
a thousand different values.
So the math gives,
the fundamental group,
and then a whole lot of it.
A billion groups,
and we can project
that we could ask for,
well, this is an action
from all the others,
on the compute,
so you can add that in,
another bit of additional,
other bit later,
or we could add in
a lot more actions,
a lot more operations around,
and if you do that,
you get things which are
high output.
A very interesting thing,
they've got a lot of structure.
Now, you might say,
we used to go up to what we had
in the beginning of the course,
I don't know what happened,
but you'll see that coming in shortly.
But,
the relationship between
this approach,
and the infinity group
approach is,
nowadays,
I think it's an area
that needs to be clarified.
There's got to have
at least some
literally between the two sides,
you know,
I'll just make a comment
on the theory,
and then the infinity group
or machinery,
there's some interesting
problems there.
In this case,
we can have an FB component,
it's just a class on a weak component.
It means, you're getting
all the harmonics,
all the moves to the same,
and the map,
gives you the answer more.
Notice it's a question
of the harder moves to the same,
because the map is much more
the same.
Now,
that's an important
consideration.
Anytime,
that is,
the case where
you're just looking at the
harmonics, because it's up to
level N.
There have been interviews
in 1941
by a lot of folks,
and
Whitehead picked them up
in 1949,
and started talking about them,
because
1949
is
quite in the paper,
and it's
a 10th grade
of component 1.1
and component 1.2,
and this is when
a CJA component is
formalized,
which
is a physical component,
if you have it.
Like,
you could also
work with
the outdated data
between Pi 1
and the
homologous, the general
homologous,
just to accept it,
of the universal cover.
The homologous and the universal cover
are together with Pi 1,
the F
the F
the F
which we can prove in a two-side
of the rule,
and
we can take the fundamental complex
of it, I haven't mentioned it,
it's a
fundamental complex,
is
where you're taking
CJA spaces,
again,
these are spaces
where it is known
there is a structural complex structure.
The structure is not specified
and you just know
it exists.
If you
pick one,
you are making a choice
and that's a very
important idea,
a specific CJA context,
it's not necessarily given
just the existence of it.
Now,
automated models for
I've mentioned N-pipes,
this is just one of the three
of Pi 1 and Pi 2
which wouldn't care less about any of the others,
they're not
in our
model. We're not asking
for an enormous
machine which is where you get
all the information
stored,
just have one and Pi 2
and I'd love information
to get things back,
but I'll assume that I've got
a CJA context structure
on my space,
so this here
is the one character of my CJA
context.
Pi 1 and Pi 2 is
a CJA 2,
remember the
point of the
superficial context
that generalizes,
and then this is the
very good
example of
X, never did it before this time.
And this gives
a CJA
2
to the body.
So
it's taken me
half an hour,
a little bit more,
to get some 2's
to
2, that's still a lot of echo there
to infinity, so
I thought we would have it
last, so
I get it, this is in fact
a cost model,
it's a 3
cost model, and this is
a 3 strict
3, strict
I haven't mentioned that, I haven't
mentioned being looked at,
be looked at,
but
wait for it
a little while.
The cost
context, I mentioned
that it's
fully
explained in
a big blue book
by
a whole lot of
obedient books
but when you get down
to the bottom, you've got
still one down to
C0, I have a connected case
so I'll assume I'm working with
this, this is a cost model
all the others
adjust the usual things in the
chain context where you've got
delta, delta, being 0.
And there's a whole lot of
conventions about the action
this act, this group here
acts on everything above it
and it models
a fair amount
of the Honour Body type.
It is a permanent
to a strict Honourary group
but the important thing is
it's strict
and this isn't good enough in fact
it doesn't model all of the Honour
but it does quite, it's a
step in the right direction
and
another way of looking at this
in fact is
due to a resounding low take
where the people with N types
and he
looked at what's called
hat N minus 1 nodes
I have a good point there
until we send it to the world
these aren't
heading off in N categories
now an N category
is something where you've got
objects, arrows
1 arrows, 2 arrows
between 1 arrows
3 arrows between 2 arrows
4 and 1
I wouldn't have my spatial dimensions
so I can't wave my hands
from that direction
so
instead of that this is an
N-fold
group
so
you've got N different
category structures
N group structures
all interacting
in a very neat way
you
oh yes, perhaps I should say
the usual thing about
cross modules
a cross module is a generalization
of a normal subgroup
it's a normal subgroup producing the subgroup
that doesn't make sense
but it does
hat 1
groups are the same as
really the same as
cross modules
hat 2 groups
correspond to a group
and 2 normal subgroups
is specified
and
no
writers though, guessing what
can end it
right
I think that's
the end of my alphabetic homotopy
although
aside on
cross complexes
cross complexes give a sort of linear
model of homotomy types
they include
all the information
of the two types
this is a
closer by the way
although they are
not the most general model by any means
they do not contain
dramatic information such as
white-haired startups
and remember I said
strict omicron group
as in
infinity group
these cross complexes
this question
white-haired startups
relates to
the fact that
you can't get away with
strictness
strict infinity group
so this
old
idea of white-haired startups
in the
topological
case corresponds to
things
which are
causing a weakness
a weak
end category
like a monoidal category
or the peak hour categories we saw yesterday
now this simplicity
makes them easier
to handle and relate to classical
tools
but
that's
that
there is a
problem I said
supposedly got
x and y are related by
the weak equivalence
classical weak equivalence and the homotonic groups of the same
now suppose you've got
two groups at two
spaces and the homotonic groups of the same
are they really equivalent
and it's not obvious
because
okay you may have a
I said they were the same
so suppose we've got
the homotonic groups of the same
and the actions of
pi-1 in each case are
correspond by an isomorphism
at all levels
is this enough to say that we can build a space
a map between the spaces
which induces a map
no
there is a realisation problem
there is a problem of actually
coming out with
given the models
this is a
question of whether the
modelling process
is full
essentially full of homotopy
now there are cases where it works
I mean if you look at
this the
very complex of dimension k
then its universal covering
space is and so
when we look at the chain
complex which you could use to define
its homology
there isn't anything about dimensions
k
and whitehead used in
his original 1949
pages
uses to solve the
realisation problem for
two-dimensional homology
which I think you get complete description
I'm a bit
fascinated but when we get
on towards the end
to infinity group white
there is very little
explicit
linkage between
the geometric
dimension of the space
if it has one
and properties of the
infinity group white
it's not that it's important
to applications
but I think it's important for the
intuition and the
understanding
of how this fits in
with other
cases
so
the three-dimensional homohever
case works
you need a lot more to make
the four-dimensional case work
I
got it
right
that's the problem I had
in the last two slides
now I'm going to go over
skip up to
the sewing stacks
here is a
book
in the beginning there was a long quote
I won't read the whole of the quote
but it's from
personally
running man
had sent some
briefings
on
complex and infinity group white
and things like this
to
both of them
and both of them
was
to ask
Philan
what
he thought of this
wider attack
that
had thought of in
Manchester that we're doing
which we'll see shortly
this is directly relevant
to the question of spaces
in terms of infinity group white
what he wrote
is
that
white
he thought for a moment
that
he had answered
the question he had
but
then he realised he wasn't
going to do that
here you are
let's see
I'll leave it
at first I could seem to me that the vacuum boom
had indeed come to work and quite independent
in one basic intuition
of the photograph I had
envisaged in those letters
this is a quote from this
an earlier paragraph
which mentions this
namely the study of N truncated
homotopy types
of semi-simplical sex
or of complex spaces
was essentially equivalent
to the study of the so-called
N-disposited where N
is a natural integer
this is expected to be achieved
by associating to any space
say x
its fundamental
N-disposited
pi and x
generalising the familiar
point-parallel fundamental group volume
for N equals 1
the obvious idea is that zero objects
of
pi and x
should be points of x
one object should be homotopies
or columns between points
two objects should be
homotopies between one object etc
this pi and x
should embody the
N truncated homotopy type
of x in much the same way
as for N equals 1
the usual fundamental
group point in bodies to one truncated
homotopy
and then discusses the fact that
weak infinitive group points were needed
basically because
the
composition
was associated here
the other things were
not on the nodes
they were going to have to
be taken into account
so
we got this
now
in the 83
and
I'll go back to redundancy
can I say your
infinity group points
surely there's a variable
for the last
can complexes
which are a particular type
of cylindrical set
cylindrical sets
generalised cylindrical complexes
a can complex
well let me just give you
if you've got
if you've got
a 4 one
which is a
collection of
simplices
which are
a given dimension
here as equals 1
this fit together
as if they were
parts of a
higher dimension
one higher dimensional
one higher dimensional
one higher dimensional
simplex
minus one face on the interior
so you take your simplex
a big simplex
a metal simplex
you scoop out the middle
through one face
now
if you're going into
a can complex
then there's a way of
extending this map
so this is a family of
pieces here
you can extend it
to a map from the whole
of
two simplex in this case
so when you can do this
for all horns
then think of the can one
so why is this
important well
if you look at
mapping
those two
edges in
now
into a space
about this into some space
x
we found out how to
compose
earlier
what you do is you take
a
two simplex
which has
those two edges on
you map
that in
first of all
mapping it down onto
this part
so you just
squash everything back
into the
into the
horn
squash it up
and then map that in
back here
from the whole of the two simplex
but
you've now got one simplex
along the edge
and what you find if you choose the right
squashing
you get the formula
for alpha dot
beta
yes
this one's big
it depends only on
the values that you've got on the horn
so
what I suggest
whoops
what I suggest
it was that
because of this
fact that you have some sort of
composition
available
that this meant that
you know can't complex it all
then you have a lot of the features
that Werthebyt was wanting for
in infinity blue points
he came back to me
the next letter
and said that the singular
complex structure wasn't
what he was looking for
for two reasons
there's a visual set
an orthogonal and I've
the intuition of higher
categories and then
the composition is not defined
so society is only defined as the
homotopy
certainly chose to come up that way
why didn't that come up
like that
or like that
there's lots of different choices
and the two of those choices
are homotopy
they're all thin
stuff
but
so
you can counter these
and for this
your talk
and the others
and the other people have
actually taken
the ideas behind
Werthebyt's
construction and work
and lock in a method of
doing things
I can't help feeling that there's
a point
in actually looking at this notion of
thinness and trying to see if one can
make sense
can make sense
and make the
model
coming from the
the particular
singular context a little bit
simpler
so
using
some ideas
related to the completion of
Werthebyt's
so
so
singular context gives you some idea
of what
an infinity
could point to be
but it's not the end
because
it's still
way back in
classical algebraic psychology
this
method to Krillin
has led to some people using
the term
homotopy hypothesis
for
a related idea
but then they
Werthebyt didn't say the homotopy hypothesis
he was actually
saying if you have a notion of any good point
this is what we want
to do
if you have anything to give it
so
what is the homotopy hypothesis
but there is a equivalence
of weak n plus 1
categories
between spaces at the n homotopy
and
n good points up to n plus 1
equivalence
now there are a lot of terms here
which I haven't defined
very good
so I mean good company
the challenge in any given
setting where you've got an idea
of algebraic data
is to come up with
a notion of n happy
our
and that and also n good point
that cuts into this
best
so this is one of the things
if you are looking at spaces
at infinity good points
infinity good points need
to be able to pass this test
if you've got a notion of infinity good point
this is one of the
litmus tests
you should
should
I mean give it to the next time
so let me just show it quickly
how complexes do
handle things well
so there is an
a weak form of
the homotopy I have always seen
that
classically
n complexes
aren't algebraic
I think that's very obvious
you can
do this in various ways
and make them more algebraic
but it's always going to be
feel a little bit
artificial
one way you can another
sort of way you can use
instead of sort of picking
fillers or horns
is
you're feeling a join
fillers or horns
in some sense and then
you've got
in a particular sense
and that is to
form what's called
simplicity in which good point
and
that gives you formal
compositions of parts
and then pair the formal
geometry
that
works well
you get simplicity in which good point
and
you get
a very nice
w bar
which takes you back to
a little sense and in fact a kind of
sense
so based on the fact that
these hand complexes form
a
good sense of doing things
then you can go further
and this is all classical
in the 1960s
classical
algebraic topology
w bar g gives you a link
with principal
g bundles and therefore
with the cosmic spaces
I'd like to get very quickly on to that
go for the
letter of B
I'm not going to have time to
read all of this
so let me just
point out
I've put some parts in blue
the parts in blue
are the ones that I want to
emphasise
there's a notion of an N
stack which is like a sheet
of
N capital
or N in the book
and Gertrude
was trying to get
a local
description
based on something that I
in a maze I had done
and that's the et al.
lecture notes, spring lecture notes
100
which
measured that
this one is a bit difficult to understand
but it's the first of three
if
you are
I'm going to go to C
because I'm running out of time
the N-1 stacks on X
should be able to be identified
with the N functors
from the category C N
which is N
to the
category N-1
of all N-1
remember
that if N
is
we're looking at the coupling space
they're getting Pi-1
sets
Pi-1 is a group
sets are zero
so the next stage up should be
a Pi-1
and two
two groupies acting on
one category
then you should get
a Pi-3
three groupies
acting on two categories
and so this is
the next generalization
and this point is made by
Grosunty
in the case N equals 1
this is nothing other than
the Frank Harvey theory of classifications of couplings
in terms of the fundamental viewpoint
now
I think
I'm going to stop there
because I've
used up more or less the hour
and I haven't got time to do
the last thing
which is to look back
at the link to the combinatorial
good theory
you can go back
I'll just do a little bit too quickly
but notice we've got
the way that Grosunty
had introduced this
going back to the title
spaces as infinity viewpoints
or spaces that
when homo-copy
is N viewpoints
that
reflects very much
on both
the
paths
of the fundamental viewpoint
and the covering space
theory
so both of those
are
essential for this
new way of
new
1895
so
already
in Grosunty's letter
that I've been
good with this
was being pointed out
and of course there's a lot
going on since then
and I'm not going to try it
intentionally
but that's just a big thing
about
the
very recent papers
have actually looked at the
sort of a Galois theory
interpretation of this
in the last couple of months
so that's what this
second thing is
right
okay, theme three
and
I said
when we came to the
right from the start I said
there was this link of combinatorial
loop theory
and in fact when we get to the
we have this thing about
if we had a CW complex
we could build a
cost module which is a two loop
point
but if we
change the CW structure
we've got
to
change the presentation
so
changing the CW structure
changing the presentation
well it's pizza transformation
and all the
the lighting ideas
combinatorial
so
if you try and do this with the CW complex
there's an interesting thing that happens
and again
and that is
it hate doesn't work
in other words
there are
spaces where
you can't realize
homotopy equivalences between two
spaces
in terms of
doing something to
the structure
you can't, it's called simple homotopy theory
and you
find that
there are spaces
which when you look at them
and try
and realize
a
homotopy equivalence by
say adding in cells
and then
squashing other cells
never changing the homotopy type
adding in things, squashing them
down, expanding them
and then in facting
then
you can't realize
all the homotopy equivalences
using these combinatorial ways
now
the reason why this is interesting
is
that's one of the two bases
of
but here, what about doing this
for infinity group point
if we had, we've got
our favorite
definition of infinity group point
and I come up with
another version which uses
some CW structure, some combinatorial structure
to build me
myself a smaller
hopefully
somebody's models are enormous
so I want to be able to handle it
but
I really would like to be able
to do that
to replace
by using
combinatorial
information on how a space is built
and that's all spaces are palatable
of course
then I would like to be able to build
a smaller model
of my infinity group
now this is
possible up to a point
that
this would need
a combinatorial
infinity group point theory
to mirror
combinatorial homotopy theory
and it doesn't exist
as yet
so that's a challenge
to anybody who's looking for a nice
way
of understanding
infinity group point theory
which to sort of say
suppose I've got additional information
how can I build something
which models this
big infinity group point
smaller
using the combinatorial information
conclusion
but
I think it's
simplistic to say
that
spaces are
infinity group point
or infinity group point are
spaces
because we're forgetting too much
of the different
rich structure
that spaces have
but
spaces can be
modelled by the entire
higher dimensional model of that
can be modelled
by infinity group point
that is the
modern
I hate that word
it's been going down to date so quickly
but it's the modern way
of looking at
the extension of the path algebras
of taking path
integrating dimensions
looking at
connections on
various
geometric situations
all that
we've got
this infinity group point structure
reflects that
but there are also
there's also the
covering space
picture
and
that again is a very useful
structure
provided we don't take it too
simplistically
so I'm trying to get
people to stop using
infinity so space as
a
term for an infinity group point
because it just doesn't seem
to be
it's not spatial
anyway, something irritating
and then of course
a whole in the theory
which I think is
this question of a combinatorial theory
which is the third
of
Poincare's themes that I
picked up
which hasn't been developed
and that's the rest of it is
some
things
that
there
thank you very much
very
my question
is
and
first
is there any
say argument behind
may be
that you may
reconstruct it
draw
a global approach
versus
in Goettingen's letter
he
in his advice to me
he said when you actually
meet
say three viewpoints
in
the speech
say when you meet them in real life
for him that was the
algebraic geometry
then the things are global
therefore
he wasn't satisfied
with this initial
picture he said it's forcing
a beautiful global situation
into something which is
it may be commentary
very nice
but it isn't
the same field
and it's really at that level
that he was with
he also was
it's field
we've got to have intuition otherwise
we can't
if you force your intuition
and this is very philosophical
but if you
force your intuition
into the global
form
you can't push it forward
it's got to
your intuition
got to reflect
he also said
that
I can't remember the exact quote
and it may be in pursuing stacks
that
he thought that there would be
as many models
of
infinity group points
as there were mathematicians
working on
do you understand also
the second question
do you understand correctly
that's actually part of the first
so he wanted a big group word
so strictness in this context
just means strictness of composition
he wanted strict composition
because he wanted to think about this
but you can always
take a composition
and then that's fine
he was wanting to
this already
occurs in
biathletes
there's various ways
including the first week
to classify
whether you actually
require a composition
a strict composition
a composition map
or merely
you know
and if you go into the algebraic topology
you've got
there's a
non
thin ice as far as my
my knowledge
my detailed knowledge of physics
but you get situations where
you get the possible
there is a
the set of possible
compositions
is contactable
sort of thing
but you don't want to choose one
because if you choose one
you know you're losing what you get
but
you know
it's
it swings around a bit
as is
the question of the colloquial
or any other
so
the marvelous
those
the models of
infinity cathedrals
is a reflection of this
they reflect different aspects
and as long as they're
affirmed
that's a great business
I thank you
for your very enlightening talk
what I would like to
make is two
remarks
one on the very start of your talk
and one on the very end
he went to sleep in between
the first remark
when starting with system
on the fact that
importance of
starting with some
covenant of your extract
data on your space
and also on the fact that
the space has to be
located nice
and perhaps
I would say located, no
so
just on this point
perhaps
people have forgotten
what is written in Chevalet's book
presentation
of
Kavelins in Chevalet's book
was very enlightening for me
it was six years ago
you know that
Chevalet
doesn't start with paths
he starts with chains
of open sets
and it's very combinatorial
and also very adapted to
space which are local in you
and to spaces
which are
an open person
you can be nice like that
but also spaces like
magic rules and traditions
well now
about the combinatorial
aspect which is more evident
than perhaps
when you
draw paths
it's less evident than this combinatorial
when you use chains
of open sets
it's clear
it's purely combinatorial
the second remark
is about the end
or
would be completely informative
if I was able to do what they have to say
I would have been
and just a very
little part
but what I think is that
the geometers are able to
do some little part
so the verbal mark is
of course we observe that to go to infinite
you have to
be able to go from end
plus one
and
so you have to know what happens
the step end
and then you want to go to the step end
plus one and following from
end to end plus one you have to be able
to go from zero to one
of course if you start
with a space which is
very simple
it's not so difficult
I think that's
sometimes
if you want to go to end to
S plus one
and maybe
rather interpret
but it's supposed to be known
so
I have an example
from geometry
where
we are able to start
to go from
zero to one
but zero is
rather interpret
and this example is
was
known by geometers
and people like that
when they define a fundamental group
of the quotient space
of a correlation
and so
especially it's
in the construction used by
by Panet
but
it amounts to
to be able to say
what is the pi zero
of the group way
with certain structure
so
the step from zero to one
in a certain sense
is a way to
associate
to
group weight for zero
to group weight for I cannot
be more precise
what I would like to say
hmm
I don't
perhaps you have a question
that's your
what
I wanted to say
the
so
in zero mass
information
and the construction used by Panet
I
was to go to
the step one
I cannot be more precise
I written a note on that
and of course
it would be very interesting
so the idea
with a response
structure group weight
is that at the step zero
we have a group weight with a structure
which we describe
the structure of the step n
and so
we would like to have a
detective process
I don't know
but it's possible from zero
to one for four issues
I think there's a
on your earlier point
if you look back to
this
if you look at the letter
to Larry B
but
he is talking about
and in fact
if you look
this whole business there
relates to
approximating
spaces
by
hypercovering
and
so this
part here actually does relate very closely
to your first point
thinking of
chains within cover
so I mean
and the second point
spaces as
infinitely good points
spaces aren't the end
one should be looking at
n-stacks to start with
as honest geometric objects
and that relates
to your second project
and I think that's going to come in
soon
may I point to
so my question would be do you think that
infinitely good points can somehow have an application
or can be used in physics
I think that
specific classes
of infinitely good points
are already being used
in some parts of here
but
the
a lot of the time
historically
remember I said
about
chains on the universal cover
and the action of I1
well
that's handling classical homological
type things using chain complexes
if you go from chain complexes
and bring in
a bit of a
a loophole structure
you're beginning to already
get to
situations which are still
so many linear
but are like
because
they are
so
it's happening
whether it will solve anything in physics
and how do you think of them
that's
you know
in some sense it's not
as a mathematician
I think
oh well I've got a certain
intuition of physics
and of course physicists
there's an intuition about mathematics
and well
it's trying to match them together
so that in fact
there might be
whether it's going to do
something useful
but it'll be very interesting
so
you know useful is always a
because you can have something
that looks absolutely
useless now
and in 20 years time somebody
will say
oh
just what I needed
so
I would hope it was
because it's a lot of
of such
where you've got
that sort of
picture
just
in terms of
what are the groups
like for the infinity algebras
of the
both the minimal part of the differential
so it's kind of
some extra
but
is it possible to do something
combinatorial
just take these sets
P by 1 by 2 and so on
and get some auxiliary
solutions
which will describe
the structure
I
believe it is
but
I don't know how to do it
because
I mean this
this
has tried to
follow up
in this
that he first of all looked at
the basic
way of extending
some of
combinatorial homotopy theory
from
Whitehead's
1949
papers
to higher
dimensions
and in here
in the combinatorial homotopy in four-dimensional complexes
he talks about trying to get
a sort of a minimal model
from
a four-dimensional
on a Hebrew
he's having to bring in
more than I've introduced
because you've got quadratic complexes
where you're actually
just allowing yourself to get
well
the interchange law
in the infinity viewpoint
isn't working so you have to
put something in there
you've got to
sort of
use
you have to have an interchange
using the way that John Byers
keeps on introducing terms
so
the
this relates very closely
to trying to understand
the relationship
between
the classical
or
non-stable
homotopy theory
operations and so on
with
the infinity-dupoid
structure
and it also relates to this lack of
a combinatorial
infinity-dupoid structure
I don't know whether that answers your question
but I didn't mention
the
questions relating to
minimal models
and that sort of thing
because
you saw I had to
increase speed
I was trying to get
120 years into an hour
so
thank you
