1. Black holes have a property called temperature, which is known as the Hawking temperature. This temperature arises from quantum effects near the event horizon of the black hole and is given by the formula T = h bar / (8π M c^2), where M is the mass of the black hole and c is the speed of light.

2. The first law of black hole mechanics relates changes in the mass of a black hole to the flux of matter and energy across its event horizon, as well as the energy emitted by the black hole (Hawking radiation).

3. The Beckenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon area (A) and is given by S = k A / (4 l_p^2), where k is a constant that can be set to 1 in natural units, and l_p is the Planck length. This formula shows that the entropy of a black hole scales with its size, unlike ordinary systems where entropy scales with volume.

4. The generalized second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system plus the black hole must increase over time if the area of the event horizon of the black hole after any process is greater than the initial area plus the entropy of any matter falling into it.

5. The question remains: what are the microstates that make up the black hole entropy, and why do they appear to live in one lower dimension? This is a significant open question in theoretical physics, which suggests that there may be deeper, underlying degrees of freedom associated with the quantum gravity effects that black holes represent.

In summary, we have a quantitative understanding of the temperature of black holes (Hawking temperature) and their entropy, which challenges our classical notions of thermodynamics and has profound implications for our understanding of quantum gravity. The microscopic origin of black hole entropy remains one of the most intriguing questions in theoretical physics today.
