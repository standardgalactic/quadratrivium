super super super excited to have David Traffer here from the Santa Fe Institute. David, I am not
entirely sure if you remember but I actually had the pleasure of introducing you at the
intelligent summit that was hosted by Gaia.c and by Anthony a year two years ago now
and we are talking really glued many people's minds. That was really fantastic so and no pressure
and and I think everyone here is quite excited about the presentation but today you will focus
on collective computation and nature and some of the historical parallels machine models and
metaphors and you are leading Santa Fe's program on collective computation in addition to having a
variety of other roles and they really work on fundamental problems and evolutionary theory
concerning collective intelligence from societies of cells to societies of individuals to machine
human hybrid societies and that as the group can tell fits really well into our thinking that we
have in the book and in this group in which we treat civilization as a super intelligence that
is composed of many individual agents some are humans some are AI who voluntary cooperate
and so without saying a little bit like too much I think I'm not giving the title of the topic
but I think yeah I just want to welcome you to the group super excited about the discussion I'll
probably kick us off with a few questions after you've presented and I'll share more info on
your recent writing here in the chat very excited to have you here we're looking forward to the
discussion too at the status here thank you thank you very much Anderson thank you all for being here
much appreciated um I'm going to uh start with a little history ancient history and then jump in
just in details of what we do on collective computation that has evolved that is in the
natural world to include humans but I want to make a distinction between two styles of reasoning
and they're not orthogonal uh but that I think this group would be sympathetic to and perhaps in
the end we can come back to them and I'm going to show my screen here to work before so we'll work now
yeah um and I'm just going to jump right in into classical antiquity with um
herodotus of talicon asus and many of you will know herodotus um I grew up with this book the
histories and um this is a book that does many things uh not least it gives the most detailed
account that we have of the greek or persian wars in the fifth century bc and herodotus was a marvel
I mean this is an encyclopedia it's published in the full version in 12 volumes and he makes this
very enigmatic remark that of all men's miseries the bitterest is this to know so much and to have
control over nothing and of course in in this particular instance he's talking about the
brutalities of the wars and of course all of us can very easily transpose the insight of herodotus
into our present time fast forward about half a millennium and we encounter Isaac Newton uh and
Isaac Newton one of these extraordinary figures a hero of course to many of us um who not only
gave us an understanding for how the non-living universe works in part but showed us that the
human mind could comprehend it uh in a form that was highly compact um and compressed in this case
in in mathematical form about 10 years after the publication of the pre-kippia Newton was
made warden of the mint and in that capacity he oversaw the famous sancti bubble this was
a huge market collapse that followed from the treaty of eutracht which had quite unfavorable
terms at the end of the war of the spanish succession and Newton made the point I can
calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies but not the madness of people so once again just like
the roditus there are things that we can know uh and there are things that we fail to understand
and certainly fail to control now Newton's ideas uh were taken up with a matricity in France
in particular by Emily Châtelet and Voltaire uh this is the an extremely important book actually
the elements of the philosophy of Newton which was actually co-authored by Châtelet and Voltaire
and unfortunately the only Voltaire's name appears so this is a problem then it's a problem now
but this is a book where the ideas of mechanics were introduced to the broader public in fact
the pre-kippia was so difficult to comprehend that many people in the english-speaking world
had to wait for the english translation of this french explication of the works of Newton to
understand what he said of course Châtelet himself translated the pre-kippia and that
was published posternestly it's an extraordinary woman now these ideas through the works of people
like Voltaire and of course through the encyclopedia and other works of the enlightenment
were never known to restrict to justice science they became a way of understanding society itself
and human pedia the most famous uh proponent of this style of reasoning was Julian Alfredo
Lomitri this is the great text of understanding humans as machines long machine um and in this
book which starts actually with an epigram by Voltaire um Lomitri basically claims that humans
and this is the position I think many of us would share are no less machines than the universe itself
the non-living universe um we just haven't understood the basic mechanical principles
and that's no less true for society
now the the ultimate realization of this position actually was in the french-realized
revolution and in the worship of the cult of the supreme be this is a painting of that
cult who was overseen by Roespierre and rather than worship divinities you would worship a
divinity who was reason so we we we essentially sublimated all of our needs for gods into
you know a sort of a demi-god that represented rationality and here's a quote from St. Juist
Roespierre's good friend where he basically makes the point that the if you like the manifestation
of the mechanical worldview manifests in society through law so that's the place that we should
be thinking carefully about mechanics and that's where we could perhaps mechanize things out of
the way that Newton had but of course this didn't work and this is a rather famous paging from the
terror which was the consequence of a lot of this mechanization and this dehumanization
where anyone remotely suspected of having sympathies with the dissidents
was guillotined the guillotine was one of the beautiful classical machines invented by
ashia physician at the very beginning of the revolution so even in that exalted period
where there was this connected belief that through reason we could transcend superstition
the consequences were pretty foul
and i would argue that many current efforts that might be unaware of the history but
regardless it doesn't really matter are actually continuations of the fundamental enlightenment
idea that human behavior is so complex the madness of the multitude is so uncontrollable
that the very best thing we can do is replace minds with guillotines in this case software
and so this idea somehow that humans are fundamentally limited in their cognition
but machines don't have to be in the same way and if we just outsource decision making for example
legal decision making as we do everything would be much better this is obviously opinion and opinion
that i don't share and but i want to give you another history which i think is perhaps closer
to the interest of this group and in the vortex to this particular alternative is this book that
was published in 1901 it's called the life of the bees it's a very extraordinarily weird man
he was a flemish playwright poet naturalist plagiarist but in this book he actually showed
that there had been this long-term interest in undying society through the behavior of collectives
most known to be social insects as this quote from the beginning this strange little preacher
being that is lived in a society under complicated laws and executed prodigious labors in the
darkness attracted the notice of anistar to catch a barrel pliny etc this sense of energy
i think is the sense of energy that's present in the modern world in a slightly different
community actually um those of us interested in how we manage semi-autonomous collectives
that are noisy and unreliable but nevertheless we would like ideally in some aggregate to produce
a particular function of interest to us and what i wanted you now having given you a little bit
about history which i think is very interesting and actually sanitary for us talk a little bit
about the work that my colleagues and i have done analyzing as rigorously as can
the history of evolved collectives and extracted few insights from those
might be of interest to engineers who are designing uh collectives of the row
i don't necessarily believe that has to be done um it's an interesting discussion in itself
but i think it makes sense to be aware of this alternative world beyond simple
metaphors published in popular science books
so where we've worked is at a multi a multiplicity of scales from cells brains organisms through
to societies but with an interest in in the mappings between these levels if you think
about universities it's quite interesting universities are basically structured according to
principles of spatial scale and there are cell biology departments there are neuroscience
departments there are behavior and psychology departments there are economics departments
it's quite interesting right that spatial scale became the principal axis along which we organized
at pistol onage could have been tiring actually it'd be interesting right you have departments
the nanosecond department year department century it would have been a completely different principle
every bit was fundamentally legitimate in spatial scale
but rather than organize our thoughts at particular scales as i said i'm interested
in organizing our thoughts as mappings between scales and these are these mappings as collective
dynamics right how do cells make brains how do brains make organisms how do organisms
constitute societies it's a different kind of science actually and it transcends in some cases
the particular constraints of material that apply at every spatial scale and out of that work new
principles emerge and that's what we do and i'll sort of go through some of these of course the
next few minutes um but there's a lot one could say here the notions of endogenous coarse graining
circuit design but in this evolved sense not necessarily engineered fundamental coding principles
of connectives the statistical physics of evolved systems and particularly issues of phase transitions
and my particular passion collective intelligence and as important which i will not talk about
today collective and individual stupidity which is the great elephant in the room of all of our science
so let me just start with um molecular levels and i'll just i'm going to rush through these
just to give you sort of a sense of what this is all about and then we can have a chat
all of this work is collaborative all of this work in other words is collective
science stopped being individual um probably gone as soon as science was invented
but as we discovered in the case of Voltaire there are all sorts of um ideological and social
reasons why we would like science to look as if it was a solitary pursuit so i went so i think the
Voltaire Châtelet insight is is is significant so um just to quickly say it was discovered in
80s actually that very simple
chemical kinetic descriptions of molecular interactions could produce
amplifiers and switches in other words we could build transistemic elements to the
molecular level out of evolved constituents and if you took those evolved constituents
so in other words we could build a sentient to the animal of a transistor
if you added feedback to those constituents we could build memories
and those memories are actually quite cool i won't go into them today
but i was always very interested in this memory which is the certainly familiar to some of you
the so-called mercury display delay line in which actually memory is stored in waves in
mercury some of you recognize that from the Univac where you have two pixel elastic crystals
that propagate essentially a wave through mercury which is and in fact these actually
have the mathematics very similar mathematical properties um and we started studying these
kinds of systems as a due to understanding how cells could be doing computing i mean and this is
all basically statistical physics for those who have an interest in these things atomizing issues
of phase transitions um excursions and fluctuations and the behavior of critical points in these systems
and i just summarized as i said i'm being very cavalier because but i can give you
these references for those things um out of that work and out of other work like it we discovered
that noise is absolutely critical to the to the function of these systems noise is not
the thing that you want to eliminate as in the classical case but actually that you
want to increase early and decrease late so noise turns out to be the critical organizing
principle for exploration um and once a particular stage has been realized or reached
collective dynamics kick in up to stabilize a system around a critical point where you can
exploit various properties like hysteresis for memory the point i want to make here is that um
in collective dynamical systems particularly stochastic dynamical systems which is what
everything is in the world that you study in the natural world um noise and collective dynamics
are critical to understand and we shouldn't be thinking the way that we normally do in classical
terms because of course as everyone here knows the classical limit is the privilege of engineering
it's not it's not the reality in the natural world so now we can jump to another level which is up to
the level of cells so that was molecules in cells cells and grains so that the great mystery of the
grain if you like is twofold one how noisy elements allow us to do things like root theory and category
theory they feel so clean and so pure there's no noise in them deduction seems so classical
and deterministic and yet the elements that constitute the system that does the calculation
is a mess you know and so how does that work the other question of course is so interesting about
brains is here we live in a world with just under eight billion people but it's a it's a disaster
there's just no way of coordinating humans at that scale it seems to be the case and yet
brains have the human brains about 86 billion neurons that somehow collaborate and cooperate
to produce thought the kind that allows this conversation to take place how does that work
uh of course that's the whole field in neuroscience and cognitive science psychology
but i sort of give you one little insight uh this is some work that we give with some colleagues
at stanford uh you have a monkey looking at the screen there are dots moving along on the screen
and you have to decide are the dots on average moving right or left uh this is actually the
test i would i'm gonna give you the chance so here's what the monkeys do each one of these
panels has dots you have to now tell me on how this would work maybe in a regular lecture on
zoom itself kind of rubbish but there you go on that one if you had to decide shout out
using the microphone are they going on average left to right what would you say
no one does left okay um yeah i think even okay he went very well what about this one
left left top right is moving left obviously yes and the question on it left is moving left
bottom right is moving right right so it's getting easier right so um so these are actually
whoever said even was direct on the top left as likely to random walk left is right and um as
this probability is zero one you get nam and a flow uh in one or the other direction and the
point is of course it takes longer to arrive at a answer the close of that probability is to a half
right and the close to zero one that you viewed as dated i think it was dated um you would fairly
quickly reach the conclusion that it was left to break so this is the chance that they're given
these are monkeys where there is a macro array that's inserted in the um essentially lateral
interpretable cortex from which we take readings and we can use that data to decide whether or not
what they're seeing is moving on average left to right and how they come to that decision
and there's a lot to say about it but essentially what we observe in this kind of study is two
distinct phases there's a phase in which all the cells in this part of the brain are independently
sampling the world and then there's a phase where they all collectively come up with a decision
so there's a independent phase and a correlated phase and essentially what you're seeing is
cells that are sparsely connected in this particular part of the brain they're benefiting
from independence but at a certain point during the task as i think when many of you shouted out
a conclusion that you've had reached all of those cells have to come to some agreement otherwise
every cell would be shouting a different answer at the same time and it'd be very useful for
coordinating society and this is a dense correlated phase and this principle is called we
call it the dual coding principle and it's actually ubiquitous it's now being discovered
in bees termite brains and you can sort of see information theoretically why this makes sense
you kind of want your dependence right when the data is noisy but once you've reached some kind
of decision you'd like to aggregate and connect your findings so this is another property i would
just say of stochastic connected dynamical systems that do information processing that they
exploit processing that they exploit too limited phase and they maximize the density
connectivity in order to reach a conclusion in this sort of consensus phase so this this
duality of strongly bound and strongly and loosely bound is actually a critical feature
the way the brain works and i in none of the literature when often here's about you know
what all these stupid agents or autonomous no you don't you want the autonomous one phase but
not in a second phase so let's just jump to societies now this is work that's been going on
for many years um i'm going to give you a sense of what this work is done we work on a on uh
non-human primates and i want to give you a sense of two groups one group that we've worked on is
the picture on the cat this is a new world monkey that's the one at the bottom of the picture
these are behavioral studies and the other group we work on are the spider monkeys um and they're
their new world sorry pig channel world they diverged on the order of about 35 million years ago
so just to put that in perspective we diverged from gyms about six million years ago
and we study the pigtails because we're interested in conflict and we study the spider monkeys
because we're interested in cooperation and just to give you a basic sense of what we do
we observe over 12 hours a day interaction between every individual in a captive colony
we can determine exactly who is in a fight when who fights with whom we can construct a symbolic
time series and from that symbolic time squeeze we can actually extract inductively a basenet
plus because it has logical elements like and or not gates and construct a strategic circuit of the
attire of science and i again i'm going fast but um and so essentially what you're looking at here is
a circuit where each vertex in that graph is an individual and an arrow is an interaction between
for example in a conflict and we can then use these circuits which are in some sense
high order summary statistics of the society to predict behavior into the future it sort of
replaces them right it's an encoding of them and for example we can predict things like
the duration of fights who's in a fight when if we remove someone will the fight stop
etc we can do exactly the same thing in a cooperative regime here's a beautiful looking spider monkey
they forage in roots and they form little subgroups that each explore different parts of
the rainforest and when it's wet there should be a certain subgroup distribution when it's dry
another kind of subgroup distribution just as with the pigtails we can reconstruct these
circuits of the society and then use that circuit to predict the behavior of the troop
how individuals move through they can sort with etc and again this is kind of interesting
so these social circuits which is not typically how we think of a society where you think about
the social network which is a much simpler concept um but actually they can be used to
predict actually how a society will evolve in time and what are the dominant causal vertices
or sex of causal vertices in those logical graphs and so we can actually think of a society as
performing a stochastic computation along the lines that i described that is when should i fight
would be one or who should i cooperate with in order to extract resources during the wet season
finally uh and i'm very quickly this is work that i've been doing actually last year under
confinement because i went back to my old rubik's cubes this should be published hopefully only next
year and working on on essentially highly competitive rubik's cube players um just to remind
you that the rubik's cube was invented before have many permutations the maximum number of
permutations required to reach a solution from the deast uh solved initial condition is
god number that for the n3 to 20 they're solved using algorithms or rules they use this community
uses algorithms in a in a special way right it simply means there's an input output mapping
from the configuration of these little faces to the optimum move required to move towards a solution
and and there's a lot on this about this it's actually a really fascinating community to study so
essentially i've been studying these communities as naturalists but of course we have this great
advantage here um because the cube is actually just telegraph so it's a mathematical object
which we can treat as such but we can embed that mathematical object in the natural history of
competitive rubik's cubers uh very interestingly we have all the stages of course which is how much
better they've got over the course of time both cited and blindfolded uh that's actually fascinating
incidentally itself which is how you solve cube blindfolded um but the nice thing is here we also
know the social network of cube solvers so what you're looking at here is a graph um each of those
vertices is a cube uh b denotes blindfolded and where there's an edge connecting two of these
cubes it means that a competitor has broken a record in both cubes that is great they compete
on more than one cube and if you do analysis and i'm really short circuiting everything
on the learning rates of cubes what you find is for the cited cube um the learning rate goes down
the higher the linear dimension of the cube because that's a three by three by three cube
four by four by four five by five by five up to the seven by seven by seven and other variants
but if you look at the blindfolded cube actually the learning rate is maximized at the four by four
by four not at the three by three by three or the five by five by five in other words there's this
interesting peculiarity in the blindfolded case and it turns out that that can be predicted
by the structure of the competitive network right so this is not a cognitive network
but the thing on the right is a cognitive cell and the basic point here is that the community
of rubik's cube solvers have discovered the hue which maximizes the efficiency of learning
and the competitions they should participate in so as to achieve that result
so this is nice connection between the collective and the individual cognition
and this is really i would argue the canonical property of the human being which is that the
social informational networks in which we live in that case the rubik's cube network in our case
everything else actually structures individual cognition so as to increase something in this
case like a learning rate right and they're constructed they go both directions right
that the social structures we build come out of our cognitive biases
you would say yes that's what a school is you should then of course we know it isn't
and that's part of the problem and a school is in some sense a collective social structure
or framework or a scaffold in which we hang individual cognitive elements in order to
maximize something like the learning rate but i would claim that we're not designed according
to fundamental principles um and study things like this allow us to get a little bit of a
peephole into how that's done in communities with a much more restricted task so just fun fun
slide these systems are very interesting they're nothing like engineered circuits
they have very high autonomy many of the elements are in competition there is no
god that puts them together and certainly i don't believe there is they're very noisy and noise is
important they show another conversation very interesting robustness properties very interesting
energy efficiency properties they're highly reconfigurable and they can be the basis of
building larger circuits that's scalable and evolved so they have nice properties that
i think would prove us to be aware of not that they're the answer to the engineering of the
future but i think the useful i think in this opinion i thought final final mark this is a quote
from our gaudy in relation to his architecture and you wrote this beautiful thing where he said
you recognize the right there's a garden to me on the left termite mound anything created by human
beings is already in the great book nature that is not true okay but what might be true is
design principles applied by human beings already in the great book nature and that in a sort of
very young expansive conception of biomemesis i think there's a lot to learn from the way that
evolution has created coherent uh collectors so with that i'm at the end thank you very much
oh fantastic thank you so so much i will stop sharing the screen of your mind that was um
quite uh yeah quite a lot to process you know but we yes but we rely on our connected intelligence
to do so so uh first one up and before i have a few questions does the way dual coding works
go against the bayesian brain hypothesis it seems if the entire system collapses to a decision
then it gets rid of uncertainty so it's not bayesian rather it looks like the brain is
selecting the most likely model of the world and then running with it what do you think yeah
it well we know the brains of bayesian so i i always find that kind of strange this weird
misunderstanding of mathematics i mean there are mathematical tools that we use to comprehend
reality and i always find it weird when we project back onto reality the framework we sort of
indoctrinize it so i'm not should say them everywhere i'm not really sympathetic to that way
reasoning um so on the other hand to say is bay is bay is bayesian statistics a useful tool
absolutely super useful and uh we don't have to go the full hegemonic limit that the brain is
is reverend bays in every case but um but you make a good point um it's a much more complicated
dynamic it's it's and it's it's clearly it that bears approximately bayesian and probably not
bayesian technically speaking um it's just a more complex computation i mean would you describe
for example microsoft word as bayesian i mean it would be a sort of weird thing to say right if it's
somehow the brain is more than just a very simple statistical inference device it's actually running
quite complicated logical rules in its circuits and i it's a longer i just find that too weak
a statistical framework to understand the full richness of what something like a brain's doing
yeah sorry about the microphone issues there i i was using my linux to cure for the first time
and uh i apologize but um yeah that's that that was my impression and uh basically i i thought it
was very interesting it looks more like sort of a winner takes all dynamic where the the model that's
most consistent with the data sort of wins out um rather than having a lot of
different credences assigned to many different models oh it's interesting as you down that that's
a good question um there is actually a voting mechanism here so when it takes all would suggest
in the simplest case like lateral inhibition that the highest amplitude unit would inhibit
one of its adjacent or connected units it's bit more complicated than that if there is actually
a pooling mechanism and by which they reach consensus so if it's in neuroscience by the way
there's this big divide between what's sometimes called ensemble selectivity um and the sort of
grandmother hypothesis or some grandmother neuron and what what what are they are ensemble
activities where many many cells contribute tiny fractions of the total solution and then
the sort of grandmother neuron is where one cell somehow can encode a very complicated perceptual
set of features in the world and what we observe is that you both it's not one or the other it's time
dependent you you move between them right you could you have a redundant phase which is right
where everyone knows everything and then there's kind of a fractional phase where everyone knows a
bigger great next one happy analytics yeah i i have a first question is where do you get a chalkboard
these days ha ha you steal them from more people probably um the way you described the way the
molecular and cellular systems use noise with a lot at the beginning was at the end
sounds a lot like simulated annealing computations that's right absolutely and um the
it's it goes beyond annealing but but because but it is but i think it's a totally reasonable
metaphor um the the idea that there is this exploratory phase um but it's also in in the
theory of phase transitions um there is as you know as you approach a critical point the
vulnerability of the system or susceptibility goes up um as do long-range correlations and so
it's there is the annealing metaphor but i think it goes somewhat beyond that um because for us
they're also evidence of this behavior new criticality which is sometimes called the
criticality hypothesis and just to sort of give a bit more background on that there is this
peculiar fact right that a lot of systems that we measure in the natural world seem to live by a
critical point and if you were designing a system most people would say that's probably not a very
good idea right because i don't the last thing i want is loads of noise and fluctuating back and
forth um so you try to push away from the critical point to damp the fluctuations but
if you look at like john hopfield's early work um in hopfield networks all of those memory capacity
calculations right are close to critical points where actually you get the most degenerate states
and at the two limits even the system freezes into to one stage from another so it's it the memory
capacity i guess is another important component of noise in these systems lovely next one up we have
chris i just to do the introduction thing that ellison was asking for on a software guy currently
working on blockchain stuff uh history and prediction markets and privacy and a bunch of other
things i wanted to ask about the kubesolvers you talked about when i got to watch some kubesolvers
both uh visual and uh masked a couple of years ago and it's kind of interesting i also talked about
what they do on you sounds like you've delved into the sociology of the learning it seems like
during the competition you can see who's fast but it's hard to tell why they're fast what what
opportunities do they have for talking about their algorithms how do they share their algorithms and
learn from one another yeah oh yeah so there's i mean it's just wonderfully rich i don't know um
so just to remind everyone else in the room um with the blindfold cube competition what you do
is you get to inspect the cube um and then once you're ready after a reasonable limit you then
a blindfolded and you start the clock and um it's not that you pick a blindfolded from the very
beginning when the hugus shuffled it's sort of a magic task so um some a few things to say
there's really wonderful things on that are happened here um the way which you can you
actually commit a cube to memories using the so-called method of loci or memory panaces that
folks who are interested in the early works of giordano bruno that was the great classic text hero
um on memory palaces and so you have to commit the entire cube to memory right before you
blindfold and every time you uh can you deface you have to store that new foot state of the
cube in your memory right that is not true in the cited case and one of the consequences of that
incident is the number of algorithms used to solve the blindfolded cube is on the order of five
but the number of algorithms used to solve the cited tunes on the order of seventy
and it's a very interesting memory trade-off right what can you hold in working memory if i'm
going to solve it hold the cube in working memory i'm sure as hell i'm not holding all those algorithms
in working memory at the same time so so that's something it's really interesting and this is
not well known and it has interesting implications um these communities are extorted and can can i
ask uh do they when they're doing it blindfolded do they actually okay you say they only use
fine algorithms so they're they are show they're storing a picture of the shape and not the path
they plan to take well that's an interesting question that's a very interesting question
no but you're not storing the power because it's because if a chess master is playing blindfolded
chess um a lot of what they're doing is collapsing the representation of the board down to simpler
parts of it now it's exactly the same thing you actually that's that's the key so mathematically
the cube is massively over determined there is the low-ranked representation of a chess board
and there's a low-ranked representation of the cube and when chase and simon did those early
experiments where they created board configurations that were legal but silly but they would never
be reached by any competition player masters didn't know what to do it was like modern earth
to bet you now right because it didn't have that nice uh them rank approximation it's like
professional baseball players uh playing against the softball pitcher they have no idea how to hit
the ball they value work they don't know when it's going to arrive you know it's a very interesting
question for this group that i've often thought about in relation to alpha go and alpha zero which is
and i i don't think it's the full answer but it's an interesting possibility which is part of what
made it so weird for lisa idol is that it was it was like you say it was such a weirdo opponent
it was playing in such an odd way that that might partly explain why he underperformed it's what an
earth is his band thing doing right so i think anyway so um just to get to your first question
uh yes that it's a very cooperative and generous community lots of sharing going on
all the time on blogs and in fact you can find them where they'll say this is how i saw this
queue that competition and this is the trick that i employed so yeah the social network
the learning networks incredibly dense and um they all depend on it
it reminds me a little bit there's a mickey mouse and goofy cartoon i think in which they're being
attacked by a super intelligent alien civilization and then mickey tries all different smart things
and then goofy goes and this is like and they they went um yeah yes it's in karate it's called
drunken master right is that you you sort of fall into the play he says not to be a predictable
adversary yeah well okay great and next up we have uh mike d
hi yes nice i wonder if you've uh looked at neuromorphic computing and if this has any applications
to it i have not and i know that's not a satisfactory answer but it's a true answer
that um do you have some ideas well um yeah neuromorphic it's supposed to be a lot more
like how the brain's actually constructed the chips are made with like neurons implemented
as devices um it can use like probabilistic or analog levels sigma levels instead of just binary
so yeah given the structure it looked very well suited to the kind of work you're doing
yes i mean there is this very interesting open question that and which is what does it need to
do engineering in a system of agents that are in competition or only have partial information
and or other you know a belligerent you know and um that
that for me is the interesting biological limit one thing is to say right we're going to use noise
and i think it was alan who said brightly you know engineers and understand that you have a
complicated frustrated system or multiple peaks or degenerate minima injects some noise into it and
but this isn't this so goes beyond that you know these are units that actually they're in competition
i mean they they they're almost like free living pritchards in one or head
and um and that just introduces this other dimension which i think is fascinating that
turns out and this is something that that might be the key to robustness right it might not make
for great calculators but it probably makes for robust calculators because once you eliminate
components everyone is else is saying excellent you know i can jump in and do it now and so as
opposed to being in a studio despair we would be with an engineering system they're all rather happy
that someone is fallen by the wayside and i have a follow-up on this actually and so um not only in
your talk but also you know i think the the entire centers that you really address on the premise
that our understanding of natural intelligence is a little bit too shallow really um if we want to use
it as an analogy or if we want to port um much to um to ai systems and so could you maybe kind of
pinpoint a few of the most common myths uh that people have i guess about intelligence and how
you know uh applying a more deeper understanding actually leads to better systems like do you have
any concrete example almost of someone who's at really using those uh you know the this more
deeper understanding and actually producing like a system that like outperforms uh let's say a system
that relies on a more shallow understanding of intelligence like other people applying this
stuff already i'll be so keen to know well yeah i mean is it i don't want to say as i said at the
beginning i had that little caveat which i think it's it's it's true and i and i which is i don't
i don't know how much you need to know right about these systems to build great designs i mean
it is quite interesting right that the current preference for deep learning like structures
grew out of people like McConaugher and Pitts and and you know posthumously published John Boy
Neumann's book on concrete and gray that have bring like this distributed structure so i don't
know how to disentangle the history of thinking about software from an awareness of the way the
biological world works and i've encountered a number of these people and i'm always impressed
by how much they do know right in other words it might not be written in the journal articles but
it's there in the background um but you know there are very clear examples i mean i think
it's other than obviously in convolutional neural nets um and in its feature so activity
influenced by some structure right now based that kind of thing but then there's this whole area
of genetic algorithms of course we worked on here john holland in particular in early rituals and then
cyber security issues with uh immune systems for operating systems it's definitely forest
so there's a lot of work like that that's very biologically inspired and and and they're using
them i mean this is not you know it's a marginal thing and i but i but it's still quite simple and
i've gone through a whole bunch of systems that are very neglected i think from the point of view
of engineering maybe for good reasons right but i think it makes sense to be aware of um
they could come in especially in a world where issues of scale become really important in
particular relation to energy because the energy efficiency of human beings is the thing that we
need to be you know a light bulb essentially that we should be very aware of and that of course
if you pick up the newspapers every day in relation to blockchain right and you're wrongly that's
where the debate is in society these days this seems like a very energetic and efficient
system you know we're going to move you know to prove the state because that's going to help
so it is interesting that a lot of the debate is centering around energy which is a problem that
life had to solve and so perhaps that's the next system would be of interest to us
yeah i guess the energy is really the final frontier and most of these things but um i had
one particular question like could you maybe elaborate in how maybe perhaps the current
understanding of for example our immune system in in the way that we use it as an analogy for
computer security may not be sufficient or do you have any you know more thoughts on this particular
angle i mean i i would i would redirect this to people who know vasking more than me i think
stefanie floris and melanie moses thought very carefully about both energy and security and um
i'm just an audience member in in those conversations i do want to get to annan's
question about blindfold chairs um when you say i didn't get the impression that my due
was no right kind of interesting uh the way to think about this is you were whether consciously
or unconsciously thinking about constellations of pieces on the board and it's those higher
order correlations that i think i'm referring to but i suspect you were thinking that's that's the
position of the bishop in relation to position of the knight that's in other words it wasn't just
atomic level piece representation but some higher order representation of the
relative position of pieces on board that's what i mean yeah and but but um when i when i'm
analyzing a lot when i was analyzing the way to play inside a chess i have to do the same
representation once i get more than one or two moves in that's right right and so it's just
the starting move i'm at that place instead of two moves in but i didn't think it was a
qualitative difference no that's interesting i do that's an interesting point i'm in the case of um
um it's funny because my my grandfather was a chess master and i used to play here blindfolded
and me sighted and you know weight the carpet with me and i think that um you know in the case
of the cube i know for a fact that you lose you use fewer algorithms to solve blindfolded right
um in the case of chess and i don't think that holds i think that great chess players don't have
fewer rules in their head uh when they're playing blindfolded or sighted and so that trade-off i'm not
sure the exists well i wasn't i wasn't a great chess player but uh it was just something we did
over once at high school neither one of us had we played without a board yes yeah but but the idea
that that once your couple moves in you have to picture a brand new board anyway um made the
blindfold seem quite natural right yeah no it's it's it is interesting i mean i just to jump laterally
um you know to what extent to these outsource you know the the chess board as a blackboard right
in other words um a very convenient efficient encoding for working memory to use so that you can
actually do deductive reasoning rather than have to spend all of your energies on memory
and the but for example if you take the abacus which is another system that i studied quite a bit
um that's very interesting right because master abacus users most of whom are about nine by the
way uh who could start learning they drilled at schools which are very severe um actually have
a mental evidence and in that particular instance and it's been studied using fmri it's quite
interesting you know how is the abacus encoded in the brain um and that's a case where at a certain
point the marginal cost of storing the abacus is is niz zero and um and so it could be that with
expertise the chess board actually is just marginally not that significant
yeah paul derliner uh attempted to do chess playing the way the euling plays rather than
brute force and what he realized was the chess players the masters break the board up into
conceptual chunks and give weights to certain patterns and so it's more of a pattern thing
than an entire brute force analysis thing eventually you go to the individual moves but
it's more distraught than an analysis yeah that that is the sort of i think that's the general
one of the few i think general truisms of human reasoning that applies across games and
science and mathematics right which is that that's sort of what we do in all of our domains of
enquiry and um as many people pointed out part of the problem of early chess computing is it
it didn't i mean it's a harder problem and um didn't have to but i think there's no doubt that
when we're solving problems i know for myself technical problems we are working with these
gastronomic entities and i have a follow-up question i guess to uh piggybacking on the um
the analogy to games so uh one of the article that i really loved was playing a go with darwin
that you published and i kind of i think literally you say take the premise that
charles darwin was very likely the first person to have understood nature from those
game played across deep time and then you use go as such a game analogy of evolution and
maybe you know just to go search from chess to go i could you maybe level it a little bit more
on go for enriching our evolution our understanding of evolution as a game and perhaps find a few
minutes yeah i mean the the the basic point there is that um i i didn't you know as someone who
actually works in the evolution of these things and so frustrated by the cartoon of evolution
we get i'm from you know i i would purge myself but from people like richard dorkins and others
where we we think of it in terms of very simple surviving the fittest dynamic so you can just
write down this one-dimensional system and with density dependence and it's basian actually
it's like basian insurance they're actually mathematically equivalent the replicate equation
and basian there's so much more to evolution than just oh i'm a little fitter and therefore
i produce on average slightly more offspring and then in the course of time they fix which is the
sort of it's it's so tedious and and what we've discovered if that were true there would be no
complex life it would be impossible because we have so many valley steep valleys to cross
and this is recognized by the way in 19 teens um
you know by sul right another that's who introduced diffusion into the framework
part of the motivation about that article was to say we've been thinking about evolution as if
it were tic-tac-toe whereas we should be thinking about as if it would go and there are very interesting
representational problems that evolution has to solve particularly in relation to the genetic
architecture that a much closer spirit to some go concepts these distract like things actually
and concepts like sentient others that i enumerate uh than tic-tac-toe like strategy and i so as me
that was an exasperation article that's you get real with the way evolution actually works
and genetic architecture development and mechanics they matter and if if the standard
cartoon of dowry isn't that we teach in high schools were true we would still be in the
primordial sludge uh so yeah for me go the the value of go was it makes these cognitive
psychological gestality things front and center because that's how you describe the game when you
play it and these are very rich concepts um you do not describe go at the micro scale
this piece can do that that's it's just not interesting when you're talking to another human
all right i posted the article again here in the chat it's forming too much of a multiple to
actually go through here in kind of minute but i want to take perhaps the final minute to just ask
you you know what's new in your work or like what is the center of the institute focused on now and
in terms of potential programs like would be interesting to the group yeah like what's uh
what's next well there's a lot actually it's a very exciting time um we have a big new project on
intelligence and diverse intelligences so actually throughout the last year within many
rather make this one actually uh but with people more squarely focused i think on natural not
but also artificial um so anyone's interested in that let us know because we're always looking
for institute to join that conversation um and it was just much to say but my particular
upset work work over the last six months has been trying to get this book out uh which is a big fat
thing and it's it was Santa Fe Institute's response to COVID um which was our community
really mobilized in 2019 because we were all frustrated and asking ourselves how can I help
you know what is all pointed with this if i can't make a contribution to society much of what we
contributed was useless and noise in a negative sense perhaps um but i think it was a real reckoning
and so if you ask me what the Santa Fe Institute now i think we're all asking but i think everyone
on this call is asking which is how to prevent a despot from taking over the White House again
and uh and i'm not gonna be too difficult but um and how do you make a society that's that's robust
and uh a tiny petabation of a little virus with six genes can take down the world
how is that possible so this little book which um is a community effort to try and address this
question from a complexity lens with meaning how does epidemiology connect to issues of nutrition
and economic markets and sociopolitical systems and one of the consequences of them becoming
entangled in unpredictable ways so i think that's where my heart has been let me say what i might
do okay great there was one final question of um you mentioned a workshop on what is it
mathematics of intelligences did you see a i'm good yeah that's that's funny that's not
the one i mentioned but i know the other faces have fun and um that's taken fostering others um
that looks great and i think i'll go to it but i'm not the organizer but that that looks very
interesting that that comes out of disti that comes out of the diverse intelligence institute
um oh what was the workshop i mentioned they have been internal by and large uh discussions in our
community um on particular themes for example the biophysics of the neuron or prince was the
collective intelligence or on and on and um but i if what i can do is if if the larger
meeting takes place i'll send it to alison and perhaps you could circulate it i will disperse it
okay hey we've had you two minutes all the time thank you so so much i think we should cover it
at the top of all kinds of things and you know hoping that one day you know we may actually
make a conversation thank you i think you've really given us a few really interesting um
nuggets to tune as and we kind of go forth and build the systems that we're building so thank
you very very much and i'm hoping it wasn't the last time that we welcome you to the group
we wish you much success in your work and i see uh everyone else for our next meeting so thank you
davis it was a pleasure hi much appreciated
