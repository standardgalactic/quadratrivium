ðŸ’ƒ
and welcome to today's episode where I'm joined by Professor Hamkins. I don't know, are you still
at Oxford at the minute but because I know you're moving to Notre Dame or Notre Dame.
Yes, at Oxford at the moment I'm in my office here in Oxford at University College.
And in terms of how I came across your stuff you've got a little book on proofs which is
really good and it's really helped me out a lot and then also a book on lectures on philosophy
of mathematics which has got tons of sort of interest because you're a mathematician yourself
you think about think I do philosophy. So I'm coming at things from a slightly different angle
and that has helped me to sort of see things from a mathematician's point of view as well.
So if people are interested after this you know those two books I would definitely recommend
and I'll put links to those things in the description. But today we're going to be talking
about Frager's philosophy of mathematics. We're talking beforehand about the best way to approach
this in terms of questions and I wasn't sure if it would be useful you know to kind of talk about
some of the ideas that are floating around at the time but then you know that's a very broad
question as you said. Is it I mean is it worth maybe just painting some of that historical
background about what's going on with Frager maybe before we get into the question so like
you know where is he what kind of time period are we talking about in terms of these ideas
just for people who have completely unfamiliar so they've got some idea of what's going on.
Sure so Frager was doing his work at the late 19th century which of course was a time of enormous
and extremely powerful advances in mathematics and what had been happening at that time was a
kind of systematic rigorization of many different parts of mathematics for example the
virus drought epsilon delta methods in mathematical analysis gave a kind of
much more rigorous foundation to that part of mathematics and in many other areas there were
these kind of rigorous advances and axiomitizations of different mathematical subjects
and I view Frager's work as somehow participating in that because he was extremely interested in
providing a kind of logical foundation for mathematics and developing a kind of
system in which one can view mathematics as taking place in his logical system and so it
really is a kind of participating with those logical advances in mathematics and also I would
say that it was a time of increasing abstraction in mathematics and of course Frager's system is also
partaking of that abstraction. So in terms of beginning to kind of tackle Frager's
philosophy of mathematics I mean where's the best place to start do you think like so the
broad questions which you know are a part of philosophy of mathematics like what is a number
you know like what is it that we're doing when we talk about numbers and mathematics and Frager's
grappling with that but then there's also unique parts of Frager's theory you know distinctions
and things is it best do you think to begin by talking about those distinctions that Frager
wants to draw in his theory or just kind of tackling head on you know the big question like
what is the number and going down that route what would you prefer? Oh well what I would prefer
always is to just tackle the big question I mean of course Frager's grid logging is remarkably
readable in translation there's some beautiful translations of it and it's so easy to read
actually and his writing is very clear and so he's grappling with this big question what is a
number and if I say there's two horses in this table or two apples on the table what is it mean
what is this number concept what is the nature of these number assertions because they're saying
there's two horses in this table doesn't seem to be a property of the horses of either of the
horses in the stable it's some and what one of Frager's insights really was to recognize that
those kinds of number assertions are really assertions about concepts rather than about objects
so the concept of being a horse in the stable has the property that it has two instances and this
is kind of a fragging way of looking at what's going on so number assertions like that are
uh making assertions about the concepts and and one of the things that so he recognized okay so
we can we can kind of translate those number assertions into a kind of formal logical language
to say that there are two f's for any property f or any concept f is just to say look there's an x
and a y so that x has property f and y has property f and they're different okay that would say
there's at least two and then we can add on the assertion and and for any z if z has property f
then either z is equal to x or z is equal to y and so we can kind of make understand the number
assertions there are two f's as just this kind of logical assertion in the language that's uh
allowing you to talk about that concept f and so that's a hint of this larger logistic program
that of course he was advancing which is that to to reduce essentially all of mathematics
to logic maybe in a in a similar way i don't know if that answers your question but yeah no again
i mean it gets us started then with that with this um big question you know of what is a number um
and then i suppose i suppose within that in terms of my my personal studies i guess i came across
frage's logical stuff in begriff uh begriff schrift concept script first and i mean that's
kind of interesting because he does talk about concepts as he expresses concepts i suppose
is kind of like functions right um so um i don't i don't know if it's it maybe it's not helpful to
mention too much about that but i mean what where in his philosophy of math does sort of
thinking about you know what what a function is um what a description of a thing is versus a thing
that it represents where does that fit in with his mathematical talk because you know he these
things called concepts seem to be doing a lot of work later on um and in terms of i suppose the
grounding in the metaphysics of what's going on like what are things being objects as well seems
to be relatively important for i guess so what you know what do these terms mean for him right
so this business about this sort of concepts as functions or concepts as predications i think is
is uh is is easy to go back and forth between concepts as functions and concepts as predication
if you just have the idea that look if i have a predicate i mean maybe i should start like this
so frage's ontology makes a clear distinction between objects and concepts so the way i think
about it is the objects are this sort of realm of individuals of individual objects and when we
quantify quantifier assertions we can quantify overall the individuals and they might have
various properties but concepts are kind of predicates on top of that realm of individuals so
we can we can say that a particular individual falls under a concept or is predicated by
that concept if it if it has the property that that concept is expressing if it's a horse in the
stable then that particular horse in the stable will have the property of being a horse in in
that particular stable and and so the for frage a concept is kind of a predicate or a class of
individuals and so it aligns very closely with the way we think in contemporary mathematics and
logic about sort of the first order second order distinction so first order objects we have a realm
of individuals and second order objects are sort of classes of individuals or predicates and so
and then the difference between a predicate and the thinking of a predicate as a as a class of
individuals or as a function that maps the individuals to the true or the false is almost
inconsequential we can easily translate between that it's the difference between having a set
or having the characteristic function of a set so the characteristic function of a set is the
function that maps every possible individual to either zero or one depending on whether it's in
the set or out of the set and and so usually value one means it's a member of the set and value zero
means it's out of the set and so frage is thinking about the concepts in this kind of characteristic
function manner but we can easily translate back and forth between those i mean one of the things
about this sort of number what is a number question is that frage emphasized this what was very
important about that kind of number talk was that uh the the distinctness and the individuation of
the individuals for which we're making the number assertion so when i say there's two horses in the
stable then we have to be able to distinguish the horses as particular individuals and that
would fit in with his ontology it's a very different kind of assertion than to say that
there's 10 gallons of gasoline in the tank because when i say there's 10 gallons of gasoline in the
tank then i'm not talking about 10 individual gallons i mean if i uh if i had a tank of gas and
it had 10 gallons of gasoline in it then i'm not counting them one two three you know up to 10
and i mean actually if i think about sort of individual collections of molecules of of gas in
the tank there's way more than 10 even in a 10 gallon tank there's probably you know hundreds of
millions depending on exactly how i count those guns with the one on the bottom and the one on
the top and on the left and the north side and so on there's one exactly in the middle and then one
millimeter to the left if i think of all those different ways i could chop up that volume of
gasoline into a one gallon unit there's way more than 10 in a 10 gallon tank right and so we lack
that kind of individuation so ian rumpit emphasized another kind of problematic thing
for the way that freggie sometimes talks about numbers like consider the statement
at least three engineers are required to operate the train safely
but if if you need at least three then you also need at least two right but and so it would seem
logical that you should be able to truthfully say at least two engineers are required to operate
the train safely but that seems wrong because if you need three then it's wrong to say that at
least two suffice if you're somehow saying that two would suffice or if i say the concert hall
seats at most 800 people well 800 is less than 2000 and so is it also correct to say that the
concert hall seats at most 2000 people i think many people would object to that statement
if 800 was the actual maximum number so you can find some instances of number talk in the style
that freggie was mentioning that don't quite fit in with his framework um but okay so he's talking
about these other kind of clear cut cases when we're talking about individuation and able to
distinguish the individuals so we have this kind of realm of individuals and properties or concepts
on those realms and we want to be able to make number assertions about how many instantiations
of a given concept there are so broadly i suppose on our way to talking about this this big project
of of logicism for freggie um we're gonna have to introduce um maybe a few well there's a few
kind of stops along the way so one of them might be um extensionality which might be a word that
people haven't come across before so what would you be able to sort of clarify what is extensionality
for freggie um and then maybe you know what why is that relevant to something called the cantor
hume principle which you talk about in your book a little bit right so freggie had this idea of
extensions of a concept and actually that word has a very different connotation today than it had
in freggie's work i think so now when we talk about the extension of a concept there's a connotation
that we're we're talking about a collection of some kind the extension of a concept is the
almost in today's language it means the set of instances for which that concept holds but
that's not how freggie thought about it the extension of a concept was very much connected
with his basic law five which i think we'll get into later um and the extension of a concept was
sort of an object that represented the concept so he had these concepts which are these kind of
second order uh what we would now call second order objects predicates on the on the first
order realm of individuals but he wanted to think about those concepts as objects themselves and so
he had this extension idea the extension of a concept is an object thinking of the concept as
an object but it it led him into trouble actually when he wanted to think of concepts as objects
then he he got into trouble which russell eventually pointed out to him and uh and it
ultimately made his system inconsistent this idea of wanting to represent every concept by
an object the extension of that concept so how how is this relevant then to the cantor
hume principle which you which you talked about in your book and firstly i mean what it what is
the principle and yeah yeah so the cantor hume principle it's also called the humes principle
many people could just call it humes principle but i prefer to call it the cantor hume principle
because of cantors use of it in such a dramatic way um so earlier than prega and uh hume mentioned
something like something very specific so let me just say what it is the cantor hume principle
is the assertion that uh the number of f's is the same as the number of g's just in case f and g
are equinumerous just in case we can put those concepts into one-to-one correspondence with
each other so two concepts or sets or classes however you want to talk about them are equinumerous
if there's a a one-to-one association between the the instances of the first class with the
instances of the second class so it's maybe easy to give an example if i'm looking at a dining table
set for dinner for a dinner party i might be able to observe easily that the number of plates is
the same as the number of forks because i can see at each place setting there's one plate and one
fork and so i have a kind of one-to-one correspondence between plates on the table and forks on the
table and so i know that the number of plates is equal to the number of forks even if i haven't
counted them i might be able to tell that those numbers are the same so that's an instance of
the Cantor-Hume principle it says the number of f's is equal to the number of g's just in case f and
g are equinumerous and Hume says something very much like this in his in his writings he has a
few sentences where he expresses this idea and Frege had mentioned that and so this is why it
came to be known as Hume's principle but Cantor of course also used this principle in his theory
of cardinality particularly in the case of infinite sets quite dramatically showing that the reels
are uncountable and that there are even larger uncountable infinities and so Cantor took this
principle basically as the basis of his theory of cardinality making all those dramatic conclusions
especially for infinite sets Frege was much more focused on the finite cardinal cardinalities and
in particular arithmetic in his logesis program he really wanted to give an account of arithmetic
meaning for finite numbers for the natural numbers and so he wasn't so much concerned with with Cantor's
aspect or Cantor's use of the Cantor-Hume principle actually it might be interesting to point out that
Galileo used the something very much like the principle before Hume even so Galileo had pointed
out he was very confused about the fact that the number of positive integers can be put into one
to one correspondence with the squares because I can associate every number with its square one
with one and two with four and three with nine and four with sixteen and so on and so I seem to have
a one-to-one correspondence between the positive integers and the and the perfect squares and this
was this was confusing to Galileo or to Galileo's character in the two new sciences dialogue really
wonderful dialogue exploring these issues and so Galileo came to the conclusion look it's not
sensible to make size comparisons between between infinite sets or to say that one infinite set
is the same size as another or bigger so he's in a sense considering the Cantor-Hume principle but
but rejecting it ultimately as nonsensical because it would force him to give up the
Euclid's principle that the that the hole is greater than the part
mainly the set of all the positive integers seems to be bigger strictly bigger than the set
of perfect squares and so Galileo didn't want to accept the idea that the number of squares
would be the same as the number of natural numbers it's very interesting
as as you explain that sort of think about the different way that people historically
have thought about some of these concepts as well because obviously someone such as
myself approaches this from an angle where there's just so many textbooks and stuff about maths you
know so you can approach this and there's well-defined kind of different areas of mathematics already
established and it's interesting you know when people are far more influenced by by Euclid for
example and like a principle like that to see how they think about it whereas for me you know something
like that you know I don't have such I've not had such certainties when it's come to like figuring
out what mathematics is what it does and things that influence me anyway in terms of would it be
good then at this point do you want to go through logitism to the Julius Caesar problem or the
Julius Caesar problem yeah let's just talk about Julius Caesar it's a really wonderful kind of
issue that Frege had identified with the counter-human principle
so he wanted he was interested in the question what is the number and he had an account of what
it means to make specific number assertions in terms of these logical expressions and and he
identified the the kind of human principle as sort of a fundamental feature of what it would
mean what what a kind of equivalence that numbers should obey namely that the number of f is equal
to the number of g's if and only if f and g are equanimous um but uh he recognized that the the
counter-human principle doesn't actually tell us what numbers are it only is a property that they
would have to obey and maybe one way of thinking about this property is that it's saying if we think
about concepts under the equanimousity equivalence relation then the counter-human principle is saying
that we're assigning to every concept that this number and it's what's called a classification
invariant for equanimousity meaning that whenever two concepts are equivalent then they get the
same number and whenever two concepts are in equivalent they should get different numbers
and so uh so it tells you when numbers are equal to each other but it doesn't tell you
for example whether whether this pen is a number or in particular whether Julius Caesar is a number
i mean it's kind of absurd to talk about the question of whether Julius Caesar is a number and
maybe one has the sense that frege thought that Julius Caesar should not be a number and i think
this is a this is a kind of presumption that many people have that well of course Julius
Caesar isn't a number and the spoon on the table uh isn't a number either um but this is exactly what
goes strongly against the philosophy of structuralism actually it reveals that the worry about the
Julius Caesar problem is an extremely anti-structuralist worry because according to the philosophy of
structuralism then we really only care about mathematical objects or mathematical um
we only care about our mathematical assertions up to isomorphism so if i have one system of
numbers or another system of numbers and they're isomorphic then uh then they're equally good
and have an equal claim to being the status of a number and the structuralist philosophy is that
it's um misguided and mathematically unenlightening to ever inquire uh uh about the sort of fundamental
nature of what a mathematical object is precisely because we can take any mathematical object
and and have an isomorphic copy of it and that other copy is just as good fully just as good
for any mathematical purpose as the original one this philosophy is pervasive today in mathematics
um and the Julius Caesar problem is um is is anti-structuralist because it's asking whether
Julius Caesar is a number or not or worried about the question of how can we tell whether or not
Julius Caesar is a number but the structuralist attitude would be to say it doesn't matter if
Julius Caesar is a number or not and if he's not a number then i can make another number
system in which he is the number because you can just take any copy say of the integers
and if Julius Caesar isn't a number in that copy then i can take the number seven for example
and remove it from the set whatever it was whatever object it was that was represented
in number seven before and i can put Julius Caesar into that slot and now i've got a new
number system in which Julius Caesar is a number he would be the number seven in that system
and i could make him any number i want and it would be just as good a mathematical structure
as the original one because it's isomorphic and uh so therefore on this kind of way of
thinking on this structuralist view um the the Julius Caesar problem is seen to be anti-structuralist
so so Frager he doesn't he doesn't sort of resolve this he sort of raises the question
right but he doesn't he doesn't resolve it either way in his thought that's right so ultimately of
course he's going to he's going to justify the counter hue principle on the grounds of his basic
law five and it's the number of a the number of a concept will be the extension of the of the
concept of being equineumerous with that concept so um so we could should we get into that a little
bit or what do you yeah yeah we get we can i i was wondering maybe just before that um
you know do you know anything about like what kind of considerations are driving Frager in the
first place to sort of think that um you know everything would be reducible to logic in some
sense that logic is more fundamental and that he'd be able to you know engage in such a program
as opposed to taking i don't know arithmetic itself as like the basic thing and so well
you know like platonic forms of the numbers or something like what does he think
that that discourse is going to be eliminated into logic right so i mean ultimately he was
successful in in giving a definition of number that did fulfill the counter hue principle because
i mean it's a fundamental idea that he had uh which is now pervasive in mathematics and it's
it's known as the quotient uh the quotient construction i mean in every subject mathematics
they're doing exactly the same kind of construction namely whenever you have an equivalence relation
so a notion of objects being equivalent then um you can always consider the equivalence class
of an object which is the the set of all the objects equivalent to it or the concept of being
equivalent to that object and the point is that the equivalence class of an object is always an
invariant with respect to that equivalence relation and so what this leads frage to say well look
what a number is is the uh is the extension of the concept of being equineumerous with that
concept so so the number two is the in a sense the concept of having two elements okay so the
this is a the equivalence class of all the two element sets if you want to think about it that
way and the number three is the class of all three element sets and the the number zero is the the
number of of any property that doesn't have any elements of the number of a contradictory property
if you want um and so one can show i mean it's a theorem basically that if you define numbers that
way then you're going to fulfill the counter hue principle um and so uh so in this sense it it
does provide a reduction of mathematics to logic i think as far as that is concerned
now frage used the basic law five in order to undertake that argument because he's he's talking
about he's defining the number as the extension of a certain concept and basic law five is what
entitles him to to know that every concept does have such an extension i mean it's an instance of
what might be called frage in abstraction so frage in abstraction is whenever you have a notion
of equivalence then you have the abstraction of that equivalence so if you know for example
if you have a concept of parallelism for lines lines are parallel it's an equivalence relation
for lines and then you're entitled to refer to the direction of the line what is the direction
of a line well it's it's the invariant for of it's the the we can assign to each equivalence class
of lines this thing called the direction of the line by an instance of frage in abstraction
in the same way that we assign the number object to any class but with respect to the
equivalence relation of equanimity so in terms of um maybe if we if we go through logicism first
before coming on to um you know paradoxes and stuff that that sort of fall out of basic law five
so what what are the primary um other what what other considerations that are there in sort of
frage is um attempt at um reduction so is it there's this idea maybe that you can construct a class
for any kind of definable thing or something like that is that one of them um so so yes so
frage in abstraction is the idea that for any equivalent for any notion of equivalence we can
assign the abstraction of that concept and get these kind of objects that's what numbers are
that's what directions are that's what extensions of concepts are they're all instances of frage in
abstraction so so using that idea frage established basic law i'm sorry established the canter
human principle and then he argued on the basis solely of the canter human principle that uh his
definition of numbers fulfill the dedicated arithmetic axioms the idea including in second
over induction and so on so frage's theorem is the idea uh is the the statement that
using using the canter human principle um as established by basic law five we get the
dedicated axiom sub arithmetic and piano had proven quite elegantly and remarkably from
the dedicated axiomization which is also now often called the piano axiomization
um developed essentially all of the fundamental truths of arithmetic on the basis of those axioms
so once you have the dedicated axioms which is the assertion that that you have uh numbers
including the number zero and you have the successor operation uh which is one to one
and you have this induction axioms and on the basis of those three uh principles you can define
addition and multiplication and exponentiation and you can prove all the fundamental facts you
know commutativity and associativity and distributivity and all the familiar arithmetic
facts and you can develop the theory of prime numbers and so on all of it is just coming directly
out of those axioms as piano showed so elegantly and frage in establishing the dedicated arithmetic
axioms hold for his concept of number is entitled to all of those conclusions on the basis of his
purely logical definition without um you know obviously without notation stuff because um
we're sort of verbally communicating would it be too difficult do you think to talk a little bit
about you know how frage goes about defining something like the successor you know because
it's like well okay we can get zero by saying that's you know the empty set or whatever and then
how do we how does frage go about you know defining well that well firstly how does he go about
saying there's only one successor of each thing I suppose and then say you know showing that there
is a successor in logic right so he talks actually I mean it's a bit anachronistic so he talks about
the predecessor relation it's the more fundamental thing for him uh and he says uh so so x is a
predecessor of y exactly if x is the number of uh the the the concept that you would get
by taking any concept that's represented by y and removing one element so basically he's saying
look the predecessor is the number that you get if you take one element out so if you have a certain
number of y of horses in the stable then x is the predecessor of that if if you fix any particular
horse in the stable and then look at the concept of being all a horse in the stable except for that one
one less basically so that's how he defines predecessor and then he has this idea of the
ancestral relation and so but of course once you have the predecessor you can define successor kind
of as the inverse and so this is a kind of dedicated manner of talking about it in terms of
successor instead of predecessor and and then ultimately a a natural number is something
that has every property that zero has and which is always passed from an object to its successor
which is a kind of inductive way I mean it amounts to to showing that the natural numbers are what
you get if you start with zero and then you apply successors and keep closing under that so the
natural numbers are the closure of zero under the successor operation is what it amounts to
but that's the that's how he explains it in terms of these ancestral of the predecessor relation
now is it worth talking about neologism before or after the sort of Russell's
paradox that comes up right so I guess I've already basically explained the main idea
of neologists of the neologists is to point out although frege had used basic law five to
establish the cantor hume principle and then proved the dedicated axioms on the basis of that
the only problematic part of his system was coming from this basic law five part as Russell
pointed out which I'm sure we'll get to but the rest of the argument is totally fine and
the cantor hume principle is completely accepted in contemporary mathematics and one can still use
frege's argument to show that it leads to a number system fulfilling dedicated axioms
so that's the main neologist observation is that frege in fact had succeeded in that other part
and Russell's argument doesn't get rid of all of that part so then in terms of the problem with
basic law five so we sort of talked about a similar problem I already said you know for frege
concepts aren't objects but you can sort of you know you can sort of refer to concepts as
objects so that sort of creates this problem which I'm more familiar with from which is there in
philosophy of his philosophy of language as well and then there's this sort of self-referential
problem that comes about that Russell points out so what is the problem I suppose what is it that
Russell notices and you know what's the the historical story as well about what happens here
right so the the the story that one can tell I think in the most successful manner is to say
that Russell refuted what's known as the general comprehension principle the general comprehension
principle says look if you have any set I mean sorry if you have any property at all then you
can form the set of all x that of things that have that property and it sounds quite reasonable
at first maybe if you're if you have a kind of naive picture of how set three works then yeah
if you have a property you should be able to take the set of all things that have that property
that should be a set and Russell pointed out that actually this is wrong it's it's very easily refuted
because look we could form the set of all sets x so that x is not a member of x
x not being a member of x is a perfectly ordinary property most sets have that property
because for example the set of all elephants is not an elephant it's a it's a set and and it's not
an elephant so so the set of all elephants is not self-membered and the set of objects on my table
is not self-membered because that isn't an object on my table so it's a perfectly kind of ordinary
property that Russell is considering and he's saying well let's take the set of all non-self-membered
sets x and the difficulty now is that if that's a set which it would be under the general comprehension
axiom then it would be an element of itself if and only if it wasn't because the only way to
become a member of that set is to not be a member of yourself so if it wasn't a member of itself
it should be and if it was it shouldn't be um and that's a contradiction so Russell is refuting
the general comprehension principle this is a kind of usual way of explaining the Russell's
theorem but okay the difficulty for Frega is that he didn't actually state the general
comprehension principle as one of his fundamental axioms and so both Russell and Frega laid the
blame at basic law five in their letters to each other and in his appendix where he's explaining
that his system is refuted he said the problem is basic law five and basic law five is the assertion
that he has this idea of this assigning extensions to concepts and and it's the axiom that says the
extension of f is equal to the extension of g if and only if f and g have all the same instances
so for all x fx if and only if gx and so but that doesn't sound anything like general comprehension
and it's not the general comprehension principle rather the general comprehension principle is
baked into Frega's system because of a kind of notational matter he can form the terms for
those sets and and he can just make the term which would stand for the extension of the concept of
f is basically the the the um the the set of all x with property f it that's what it amounts to
for Frega's system and so and so I view it really as Russell's argument is refuting general
comprehension and the point is that the basic law five is what you need in order to know that
that the element of relation is working as you expect it to work for classes so it's a combination
of his implicit commitment to the general comprehension principle plus basic law five
that's really being refuted by Russell there's a couple of sort of more colloquial ways to describe
the Russell paradox I mean it's often described with the barber paradox so should we talk about
some of those yeah we can do people as well who might be interested in this I had Graham Priest
on yesterday as well talking about dialectism so um so so there's um a general theme here that's
coming out of our weird weird logical puzzles but yeah let's absolutely talk about you know
Russell's paradox which is more colloquially mentioned sure I like Graham a lot he was a
colleague of mine when I was in New York before I came to Oxford I was at the City University of
New York which is where Graham Priest is now so I know him well so the barber paradox is the the
paradox of the barber in town who shaves all and only those people who don't shave themselves
uh and the it's very the logic of it is very much like the Russell paradox because you can
ask does the barber shave himself or not well he shaves all and only those who don't shave
themselves so if he does shave himself then he shouldn't and if he doesn't then he should
it's this exactly the same logic as the Russell paradox also there's the uh my wife Barbara
Gail Montero talks about the barista who serves coffee to all and only those who don't make coffee
for themselves uh and of course this is the same logic again um so this is extreme similarity between
the Russell paradox which Russell mentions and Cantor's prove that every set has more subsets
than elements strictly more so in other words Cantor proved this is way before uh well well
before Craig and before the Russell paradox Cantor proved that uh you can never have a one-to-one
correspondence between uh the elements of a set and the subsets of the set um and the the way to
prove that is well if you had such a correspondence then you should form the set of individuals
from the set that are not in the set that corresponds to them and so that would be a
subset maybe empty maybe everything maybe just some of them whatever it is but it couldn't be
associated with any individual because that individual would be in that set if and only if
it wasn't and and so that's Cantor's argument you know uh uh decades before Russell and Russell
says look the logic of his argument is basically the same as Cantor and it shows you what's wrong
with Craig's idea that he had the realm of objects and he had the predicates on top the
concepts those are like all the subsets and Cantor says look you always have more strictly
more subsets than objects so you can't assign to every concept an extension object in a one-to-one
way uh which is what basic law five is asserting and so so that's why I see a very tight connection
between Cantor's theorem on the power set which is of course a generalization of his
theorem that the real numbers are uncountable this very tight connection between Cantor's
theorem and Russell's refutation of Craig's system so how is it that sort of Craig takes this news
you know as he um he gets this letter from Russell and my understanding is that he's got a second
edition of the of the Grundlagen on the printing press or something and he sort of you know runs
off to to stop this but stop it printing out you know it's sort of held up as a as a paragon of
someone changing their mind actually and accepting you know the kind of reputation and acting quite
admirably in a way but how does Frager then sort of you know respond what what's his attempted
solution and is it successful right well he was extremely gracious in his reception of Russell's
argument uh I mean it was of course devastating for his system because it showed his system was
inconsistent uh in a fundamental way it wasn't just some detail but really the way he was using
basic law five uh and his and his term algebra was was completely refuted by Russell's argument
um and uh and he was so gracious in his appendix he had this remark and there's this famous
quotation about there can hardly be anything more disheartening uh to just as the edifice is
completed to see the foundations be shaken and uh and so uh so in a sense that I mean
he couldn't continue with that axiomization and he did more work after that
but uh but basically the the original Frager term logic as it was conceived in that work
was irreparably damaged and then um I suppose uh a last kind of question from me and then
we'll go over to some questions from the chat so if people have got them and they want to tag me
just put them up and and I can bring them up um in a moment would be how has this um
how has this affected sort of subsequent attempts to reduce mathematics to logic so
sort of in that you know I'm familiar with um obviously Russell and Whitehead's work
familiar with like Russell's type theory or church Alonso Church's sort of a type theory
stuff as well though I'm not an expert on any of these things so so how how is it received
and how has it affected the subsequent sort of series of attempts to reduce mathematics in this
way oh and I think von Neumann tried to do something did he show that it's indeterminate
which way you look at it as something yeah you hand it over to you and you can right so there's
huge amount of work uh coming after that in the foundations of mathematics um and uh and a huge
amount of uh of inks built in philosophical analysis of logicism I mean um this this one way
of looking at it as a question of terminology I mean a lot of these arguments turn turn into a
discussion of well what counts as logic for example Zermelo proposed his axioms shortly after that
time and Zermelo's set theory became a very prominent foundation of mathematics uh in which
one can view essentially all of mathematics is taking place in set theory on the basis of the
Zermelo-Frankl axioms and if one if one were to regard the axioms of set theory as fundamentally
logical in in character which I do actually uh then this is a complete success for logicism
so the the the set theoretic foundations of mathematics is a is implementing mathematics
on the basis of fundamentally logical principles of set theory and I think that's a perfectly
legitimate way of looking at logicism as completely successful okay not everyone agrees with that
perspective at all because they say well things like the axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice
are not fundamentally logical in character um and so this is what I meant by the debate turning
into a question of well what counts as logic is second order logic is that logic I mean quine
famously said this is set theory in sheep's clothing and so if if one doesn't count second
order logic fragus system was second order in nature fundamentally and and inherently actually
if you just take the first order fragment of fragus system it's not inconsistent and Russell's
argument doesn't work so that the basic law five considered as a first order system is consistent
and uh and so so he really was using second order logic but many people have argued that
second order logic is really just set theory and if you have the view that set theory doesn't count
as logic then maybe you should have the view that second order logic is not really logic but
mathematics because it's set theory um and so uh I mean I wouldn't want to say uh I mean the
the idea that somehow the whole debate is a kind of terminological dispute is not really correct
because of course we have the idea that to judge something being a successful instance of logicism
would mean that we are able to implement mathematical you know mathematical foundations
using purely logical ideas meaning not just that we're going to call it logic but that it's
obeying the fundamental principles of what should what logic should mean and have the right
sort of necessity claims being made about it and so on awesome I'm just looking through the
checks there's quite a few people have been putting questions throughout so um okay great thanks for that
um uh so so one question here was um yeah are you I think Susan Bobsian who I think might be at
Oxford um has done some work recently I think it was last year or this year um saying that
Frager plagiarised the Stoics I don't know are you familiar with I don't have anything to say
well that I'm sorry okay I don't know um and then a second uh question from the same person was um
presumably uh C.S. Purse's thinking on existential graphs had not been published
early enough to have any possible influence on Frager's graphs uh but similar
I so I'm sorry I'm sorry yeah I think I think this is in terms of uh I mean in a sense uh
I come from set theory and I'm looking at Frager from this sort of set-theoretic
perspective and interested in Russell and so on and I'm not really familiar so much with the
with that part of the Frager scholarship so second another question from a different person
Roman asks how much does Platonism influence Frager's project and its later downfall especially
especially in regard to basic law five in Russell's paradox can Hume's principle
still be used like uh Neologisists propose I suppose slightly touched on that right so we
touched on a little bit so the the Neologisists I think are um um really emphasizing the idea that
from Hume's principle or what I call the counter Hume principle one can get all of arithmetic and I
think that for Frager it it is a form of Platonism um and uh and and so he's he's using those principles
really uh with a Platonist perspective you know he has this realm of objects and he's and the concepts
aren't even he's thinking of all these abstractions as fully real objects which is of course a kind
of Platonism is it is it right to sort of think of it that that you know it's not so much that
the numbers themselves are sort of the these Platonic forms but but it is right that there's
sort of Platonic forms as it were that are playing roles in the theory so like you know the true and
the false and um maybe various like logical apparatus that construct well it's not just that
but the Hume's principle itself is is it's important for Hume's principle that the numbers
of the concepts be objects themselves right and this is this is related to the extension of a concept
that you know that the uh the idea mentioned in basic law five but they're both Frager and
abstraction principles and it's important I think in both cases that the abstraction objects are
objects in the realm of objects I mean it's interesting when you think about the the Julius
Caesar problem Frager considered it in connection with the Hume principle but he didn't seem to
consider it so much in connection just with basic law five itself but it's exactly the same problem
as far as I can see if we're worried about whether Julius Caesar is a number why aren't we worried
about whether Julius Caesar is the extension of a of the concept of being a horse in the stable
or any concept so can is Julius Caesar the extension of a concept I mean maybe you think well obviously
not but why should you think that because there's no axioms in basic law five that that would seem
to determine whether something is or is not an extension which just saying two extensions of
concepts are equal if and only if those concepts have the same instances so it it it seems exactly
analogous the Julius Caesar problem and I find that quite interesting and it's connected with
this Platonism issue because if we think of the extension of a concept or the number of a concept
or any of these instances of Pragerian abstractions as the objects then then this is a kind of
Platonism about those abstractions and so it's going to be subject to the Julius Caesar problem
awesome um so let's see um why does uh predicate precedes subject in notation even though subject
precedes predicate in speech merely because copying over function notation from math's question mark
oh I see well that's quite interesting I mean it's a notational matter of course what a
mathematician would say well look it doesn't matter if you write it before after I mean
that's just a notational distinction and we have lots of different notations in mathematics
including in logic and Frege famously you know starting in the Begrift ship had his kind of logical
notation that he set up and some of those ideas were carried further but a lot of his notation
thankfully was abandoned and simplified by in current usage although conceptually it's very
similar and so we can view say that the main concepts that are used in first order logic really
grow out of Frege's work but his notation is often not but some of it does survive and so
of course we can have prefix post fix notation whatever you want and somehow translating between
these and and so what does it matter whether we put it first or second maybe the linguists would
have stronger views on that but in terms of logic and mathematics it just doesn't matter it seems
there's a question that sort of spans over two so the first part of the question is
in your books you present mathematical proofs of quite different kinds historically a proof consisting
of steps logic has long been oh I think and then it sort of like shifts a bit at books present
mathematical proofs of quite different kinds historically a sequence of inference has long
been regarded as proper proof does Frege's logicism allow for wider notation of proofs
right so Frege developed his his formal system for giving formal proofs and that's extremely
important that was an extremely important development for the rise of proof theory and of
course today we have many different formal proof systems and I view those all as somehow growing
out of Frege's work if you're referring in my in my proof in the art of mathematics book where I'm
which is a book I wrote for helping to teach aspiring young mathematicians how to write
proofs and it has nothing whatsoever to do with that sort of formal proof but rather just understanding
the nature of making a sound logical argument and it's I think to my way of thinking important to
keep in mind the distinction between having a formal proof in the sense of having a proof
that obeys the rules of a formal proof system and having a proof of a mathematical theorem if you
go back and look at Euclid's book Euclid's elements there's nothing like a formal proof system in
that book and yet it's the paragon of formal mathematical argument deductive reasoning Euclid's
proofs read like pros and they're not formal in any sense they consist of sentences with
with sort of ordinary language use and periods at the end and so on and it's quite readable
completely contemporary I mean it's like the proofs that you find in a contemporary
mathematics journal or in a lecture hall if a mathematician is giving a proof of a theorem
they're generally not using those formal proof systems so so the way I view it is Frege is
trying to introduce a kind of foundational ideas about what it really means ultimately to have
a formal proof and the math the rest of mathematics is proceeding on this comparatively informal
matter manner and and and I wouldn't want to see that informal kind of proof abandoned or
neglected because when we understand a theorem we understand the theorem on the basis of those
more informal arguments that express the true content of the mathematical ideas rather than
a formal proof for example Bill Thurston really emphasized this point the distinction between
having a formal proof and having some understanding of a theorem and of course we always want the
understanding in favor of checking the details of a formal proof unless the unless the idea is in
doubt or something of course if we have doubt about the informal argument then it's nice to have the
formal proof because maybe that that helps us to feel that we didn't make a mistake in it but
in very few instances are we getting the kind of mathematical understanding and insight from a
formal proof that we would ordinarily get from the informal proof so another question then was
have you got any books in your on the books at the minute as it were I have about five books
I'm writing at the moment but I think the next one that will be finished is a called topics in logic
and it's a kind of a sweeping account of the enormous breadth of the subject of logic including
propositional logic and predicate logic and logic of themes and the relational logic and model theory
and epistemic logic and modal logic and what I want to do is somehow broaden the scope of what's
normally studied by students of logic when they first see logic rather than concentrating on a
relatively narrow selection of topics from logic I want to show them the enormous scope of the
subject of logic and so that's topics in logic it'll probably be out in a year or two that's
really interesting because my undergraduate degrees in software engineering and I'm doing a
master's now in philosophy and I worked as a software engineer for a while but you know coming
across the use of logic as it's implemented almost in programming languages versus then coming
across it as I suppose in philosophy is a quasi historical but also you know you're practically
using it to argue as well and there's this chasm in the thinking between the two kind of subjects
in the way but it's not it's it's completely filled in because there's all kinds of other topics that
fill in intermediate places between those and extending on either side beyond I think logic
is just an enormous subject and has so much fascinating work and so many interesting ideas
I want to just share it with everybody. So a question here then is does the HP presumably
Hume principle versus the EM I'm not sure what that one is but hopefully you do resolve concepts
such as actual infinities seems if A and B are allowed to be sets that have infinitely many elements
both cannot be correct. So what is EM I'm not quite sure what yeah I'm not I'm not quite
sure I'm just looking through the chat see if I can see it put anywhere maybe
if you're still here doc pluromonaut put what EM is and we could come back to it.
Maybe he means the Euclid's principle maybe so so I mentioned this tension between the
Hume's principle and Euclid's principle and so this is brought out by Galileo also I mean in
his example with the perfect squares and is already an instance of this kind of conflict right and
and Galileo also pointed out look if you have a line segment a short one and a long one
then you can imagine a one-to-one correspondence this sort of draw a fanning of lines between them
and it would give you a one-to-one correspondence between a short line segment and a long one
and he also describes how to make a line segment equinumerous with the entire number line with the
entire real line and so this is another instance where his characters sort of throw up their hands
and say therefore we don't understand the infinity but I think the the the right way to understand
Euclid's principle is by replacing it with a reflexive version namely that the hole is at
least as big as any proper part and then everything's fine that's totally compatible
with Hume's principle so um so the in fact it gets into this uh there's a there's something missing
from Frege and the the logistic analysis of Hume's principle or the counter Hume principle
in that it gives the criteria for equivalence of numbers but he doesn't have any criteria for
comparison of numbers and so it seems like it would be very reasonable for Frege he could have
said that one number is less than or equal to another number if the first concept is equinumerous
with a sub a subclass or sub concept of the other one so that would correspond to having a sort of
injective map from the first class into the second one but then the question would arise well look
if the number of f's is is at most the number of g's and the number of g's is at most the number of f's
does that mean that those two numbers are the same and maybe you think well that's obvious
because of course if x is less or equal y and y is less or equal x then x should be equal to y but
you don't want to assume that we want to prove it basically that it would be true of Frege's number
concept and in fact in set theory this is a theorem known as the counter Schroder-Bernstein
theorem and it's not trivial it's not a trivial theorem in fact it confused those people and
that's why it has three names because it came in various proofs and the proofs were shown to be wrong
or that they used the axima choice but they didn't need to and so on and so finally uh it now has
established proof the counter Schroder-Bernstein theorem is the principle of anti-symmetry
for Frege's numbers basically and to my way of thinking this is just as important a principle
as Hume's principle is and whenever one states Hume's principle then the very next thing you
should say should be a statement of the counter Schroder-Bernstein theorem namely that if the
number of f's is less or equal the number of g's and the number of g's is less or equal the number
of f's then those two numbers are equal and that's true for infinite sets finite sets every all sets
in a very general way because of the counter Schroder-Bernstein theorem so it's related to
this reflexive version of Euclid's principle which kind of solves the tension between Hume's
principle and Euclid's principle. So just a couple more questions then and one of them
should hopefully just be um clarifying something for someone where they said
what is the metaphysical status of mathematics according to Frege so is it a form of idealism,
a variation of Platonism uh you know we kind of have touched on that but just to maybe clarify it
in um the terms of the questioner here maybe. So uh well I don't want to speak for Frege but
I mean I think Frege ultimately in the logistics program was attempting to reduce mathematics
to logic and so I think he thought of those logical concepts and the objects as as real
and so that would be a variation of Platonism I guess and the instantiation of extensions of
concepts as objects is is I guess not really a form of idealism but rather the opposite so
but one should really uh ask Frege himself. I was just um getting the link from your website
as well to put it in the chat for people so the last question someone has asked
can you suggest some good books to start with logicism and related topics? Well I would start
with the um with the GrÃ¼nlogen because as I said early on in the interview it's very readable
in translation and uh and and so you can um you can just start immediately engaging with
the question of Frege's program, his logistic program and he's talking there about what is a
number and and giving the the ancestral arguments and so on all of it is right there and it's very
readable. Awesome um well I've put the I've put the link in the chat so people who are watching
live can click on that if they want to check out more of your stuff and I'll put the links in the
description if people are watching later um so yeah thank you for coming on and I put a random
tweet out a couple of months ago being if someone was willing to come on and talk about the Frege's
philosophy of mathematics so thanks for sort of taking the gauntlet there and uh stepping up to
the plate for a random kind of tweet as well. Well thank you very much it was a pleasure to be here
and talk with with you about Frege thank you. Great um so I'll just play the end credits and then
if you want to hang around for a moment you can and I'll just say bye but other than that thank you
everyone for watching um there's a couple more discussions on the channel over the next couple
of weeks that people might be interested in namely um Graham Oppie is going to be talking to Bernardo
Castro about whether physicalism or idealism is true um so those are two people that I think a lot
of people in this space are quite interested in and they're coming together to dialogue here so be
sure to set a reminder for that um if you are interested in that kind of thing other than
that thanks everyone and I'll see you next time
