Checking Digital Gnosis/Frege's Philosophy of Mathematics - Prof. J.D. Hamkins.txt
1. **Hume's Principle vs. Euclid's Principle**: Hume's principle states that the number of something is equal to the number of something else if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between them, which can be extended to all sets by the Axiom of Choice. Euclid's principle, on the other hand, posits that equality of two quantities implies that there are as many units in each. The counter Schroder-Bernstein theorem reconciles these two principles by showing that if the number of Fs is less than or equal to the number of Gs and vice versa, then the two numbers must be equal—this holds for finite, infinite, and all sets.

2. **Metaphysical Status of Mathematics in Frege's View**: Frege's view can be considered a variation of Platonism, where logical concepts and their objects are taken as real. This is not idealism, which posits that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial.

3. **Recommended Books on Logicism and Related Topics**: A good starting point for engaging with Frege's logicist program is the "Grünlogik" by Gottlob Frege, which is a collection of his essays and lectures on logic and is written in a very accessible manner.

4. **Upcoming Discussions**: The channel will feature a dialogue between Graham Oppy and Bernardo Castro on whether physicalism or idealism is true. Viewers are encouraged to set reminders for these discussions if they are interested.

5. **Closing Remarks**: The interviewee expresses gratitude for the opportunity to discuss Frege's philosophy of mathematics and emphasizes that Frege aimed to reduce mathematics to logic. The host thanks the interviewee and viewers for their time, and mentions upcoming discussions on the channel.
