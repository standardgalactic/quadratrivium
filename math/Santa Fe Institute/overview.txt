1. Dave explained how his vision of future computing involves a three-dimensional stack of processing layers, similar to building a tablet computer out of hundreds of layers with sensors, processors, and LEDs. This concept is an extension of current computing paradigms, where each layer processes information independently, leading to a highly parallel and non-deterministic system.

2. Dave emphasized that the systems he describes are not deterministic due to thread scheduling and pseudo-random number generators, which introduce unpredictability. This non-determinism is beneficial for robustness as it avoids long chains of reasoning that could be disrupted by a single bit flip.

3. Dave touched on the balance between state reliance and functional programming approaches in computing. While state is not going away, the key is to minimize dependency on it and have strategies in place to handle its corruption, which aligns with the principles of "plan B" robustness.

4. Dave's slogan reflects his belief that von Neumann machines, despite their potential vulnerabilities, can be made robust by being part of a larger system where they can be quickly replaced if faulty. This approach acknowledges the need for state in computing but focuses on resilience and redundancy to maintain system integrity.

5. Dave's presentation and subsequent discussion highlighted the importance of considering non-determinism, robustness, and the balance between state and functional programming in the context of future computing systems. The audience was encouraged to think about these aspects when designing and implementing such systems.

Checking Santa Fe Institute/Lecture 1： Coarse-Graining, Renormalization & Universality.txt
1. In physics, course grading (averaging over a volume) is straightforward because it's typically done in one dimension—spatial scales. The hierarchy of scales is often continuous, allowing for smooth transitions between different levels of resolution.

2. In biological and social systems, course grading can be more complex due to multiple dimensions (e.g., time, functional categories). This leads to a discrete hierarchy where you might jump from one level of granularity directly to another without a fine-grained intermediate step.

3. The choice of course grading function is crucial and can affect the renormalizability of the system. Some functions may not effectively capture the dynamics at finer scales, making them less useful for understanding the system.

4. Simple theories in social sciences and biology often require course grading operations that filter out large fluctuations while keeping the essential patterns. This is to avoid models with a multitude of adjustable parameters that are difficult to estimate.

5. The example given in the lecture (grouping people by sex) illustrates how course grading doesn't necessarily imply a lack of interaction or relevance. It simply indicates the way in which the data was aggregated, and not finding an effect does not mean there is no effect to be found—just that the chosen course grading method may not have been the most informative one.

6. The question raised about the renormalizability of different course grading methods is a significant point, as it touches on the robustness and effectiveness of different averaging or aggregation techniques in capturing complex systems' behavior.

1. **Carl's Talk Overview**: Carl explored the concept of Markov blankets and their role in understanding complex systems, including social dynamics within families. He emphasized that these systems are not static but dynamic, evolving over time.

2. **Question from Aaron**: Aaron acknowledged that he didn't have a question but appreciated the discussion on Markov blankets and their application to interpersonal relationships, which Carl confirmed is an exciting area for future research.

3. **Alison Herter's Inquiry**: Alison, a family psychiatrist, inquired about work related to interpersonal relationships and Markov blankets, particularly within the context of families and social groups. Carl recommended reaching out to Maxwell Ramstead and his network of researchers who are exploring these areas.

4. **Economic Application**: Carl mentioned an ongoing project where economists are using Markov blanket concepts to address sustainable energy use, specifically in California.

5. **Psychiatric Perspective**: Carl highlighted the importance of understanding how the brain works and identifying broken beliefs to effectively treat psychiatric conditions.

6. **SFI Podcast Invitation**: Michael Garfield expressed interest in having Carl on the Santa Fe Institute podcast to discuss his work further, which Carl welcomed.

7. **Audience Appreciation**: The audience showed their appreciation for Carl's insights through applause emojis, and there was a general consensus that his work is valuable and deserving of more attention.

In summary, Carl's presentation on Markov blankets opened up a rich discussion about their application in diverse fields, including psychiatry, economics, and interpersonal relationships. The audience's interest in these topics suggests a growing recognition of the utility of complex systems theory across various disciplines.
