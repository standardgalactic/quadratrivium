Checking THIRD EYE DROPS with Michael Phillip/The Meaning Crisis, Platonism and Mystical Experiences ï½œ John Vervaeke.txt
 In this conversation, John and Michael discuss the concept of Noasis from Plato's divided line, which represents a state of direct knowing or intuitive understanding beyond intellectual comprehension. They highlight the importance of this understanding in the context of spiritual but not religious movements, emphasizing that it should not be used to feed narcissism or ego. Instead, Noasis is associated with theoria, or contemplatio, a deep and ongoing journey into reality that leads to greater insights and transformation.

Michael underscores the dynamic nature of Noasis as a process of traveling and beholding, where each step taken in understanding leads to deeper vision, which in turn allows for further exploration. This process is akin to moving from the shadows of the cave towards the light, accommodating one's vision, and seeing more clearly with each journey.

John and Michael also touch upon the upcoming series "After Socrates" and "Walking the Philosophical Silk Road," which will delve into practical applications of these philosophical concepts and explore the potential for a new advent of the sacred that could be transformative for our lives. They invite viewers to engage with their content, including courses and workshops offered on their Wisdom Cultivation platform, to deepen their understanding and application of these philosophical insights.
