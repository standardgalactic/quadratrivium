1. **Uniform Distributed Scale Invariance in Destin**: In OpenCog's visual hierarchy, a pattern recognition issue arose due to the non-uniform distribution of patterns across different layers of the hierarchy. To address this, a uniform distribution approach was introduced where a common dictionary of patterns is used across all layers, and simple mathematical transformations can map a pattern from one layer to another, making the system scale and translation invariant. This allows for the recognition of the same pattern at any hierarchical level or scale without pre-processing like drawing boxes around objects.

2. **Integrative AGI Challenges**: The example of Destin highlights a broader challenge in integrative AGI systems, where different components must be interconnected and their internal mechanisms may need significant modification to work effectively together. This is similar to how evolution has co-adapted different parts of the human brain to function synergistically.

3. **Procedure Learning with Probabilistic Semantics**: In procedure learning within OpenCog, genetic programming was initially considered, but it was found more suitable to use probability theory instead due to better integration with other components. The same goes for declarative reasoning, where Pei's NARS logic was replaced with a probabilistic logic that maintained the term logic structure and multiple component truth values.

4. **Continuous Integration and Modification**: When integrating different systems into an AGI architecture, it is often necessary to continuously iterate on each system's internal processes to ensure they work cohesively together. This process can involve significant changes to the components to achieve the desired level of integration and functionality.

In summary, the journey towards integrative AGI involves not just combining separate systems but also deeply modifying their internal workings to ensure they can effectively communicate and collaborate with one another, much like the evolutionary process that shaped the human brain.
