Checking 極限宇宙の物理法則を創る --Extreme Universe Collaboration--/An Algebra of Observables For De Sitter Space by Edward Witten.txt
1. The talk focused on applying the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetimes to two specific models: the closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe and the Einstein-Rosen bridge (or wormhole), also known as the Sitter space.
   
2. In the case of a closed FRW universe, the algebra of static patch operators is trivial without including an observer, making it impossible to impose physical constraints on the algebra. By introducing an observer in the middle of the spacetime, the algebra becomes non-trivial, as the observer's gravity can dress the operators, making them invariant under time translations.

3. For the Sitter space, the algebra of static patch operators remains trivial even with an observer present because the global symmetry of the spacetime allows for different choices of time slicing. This leads to a richer structure where one can study transitions from type 3 (unspecified causal relation) to type 2 (causally connected) CFT correlators.

4. In the context of the black hole spacetime, it is not necessary to include an observer in the algebra because the static patch allows for gravitational dressing of operators at infinity.

5. When matter and charges are included in the static patch, the algebra is modified. For weak coupling, the Hamiltonian constraint has to be replaced by a combination that includes the observer's Hamiltonian. In theories with gauge fields, one would also have to consider charge constraints. However, for gauge-invariant operators, the charge of the observer is not an issue.

6. The workshop concluded with expressions of gratitude to all participants and group speakers for their contributions and stimulating discussions during the week-long event.
