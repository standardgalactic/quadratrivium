In this chapter we're going to talk about scale-free networks and their properties.
So last chapter we talked about random networks and how they are different from real world networks.
As it turns out most real world networks are scale-free and so we'll visit a little bit about
what that means and what kinds of networks are scale-free.
So where did the scale-free property come from?
Here we have a very beautiful visualization of the worldwide web at the beginning of the 21st
century and you can see that we have a lot of different web pages that only have a couple of
links and then we have this really concentrated area here where we have some web pages that have
lots of different links. Now back in 1998 researchers wanted to study the worldwide web
and see if it followed how random networks are set up. But interestingly enough as they did this
and by the way in order to do this they used what's called a crawler to automatically crawl link
to link all over the worldwide web and what they found was actually the web doesn't behave like
a random network at all because remember in a random network we would have the case where no
matter which web page you decided to choose it would have about the same number of links as any
other web page that you might pick but that's clearly not the case here. We have if we pick
a particular web page it might have a few number of links it might have somewhere in the middle
and it might have a ton of links and so this was an interesting discovery and as it turns out
most real world networks have this scale-free property they are not random at all. So the
first property of scale-free networks we want to talk about is that of a power law. So like I said
in order to gather all of the web pages and their connections on the internet we'd have to crawl through
over three billion documents. We could have a robot do this for us and this is actually what
Barbashi and his assistants did back in the late 90s so they were expecting to see this
degree distribution which we talked about last time where most of the nodes have the average
degree of the network and so you don't really have any hubs they expected to see that if they
chose a web page it was probably going to have the average number of connections but obviously
if you even think about how you use the web on a day-to-day basis you're probably only going to
a few different sites and only sometimes are you wandering off out into the weeds looking at sites
that aren't heavily linked so you might use your search engine maybe check your email or social
media but you tend to go to the same sites over and over again and these sites tend to have a lot
of activity and also are linked by a lot of other sites. So what kind of behavior do we see? Well
we've talked a little bit about this before but what we really observe is instead of what's this
called a Poisson distribution we see a power law distribution and actually what we're looking at here
is what's called a log log plot of all of the incoming links on web pages and then all the
outgoing links on web pages and what's plotted here this line here with the dots represents that
power law and this line here represents the bell curve the Poisson distribution
and the reason it looks like this and not like a bell curve is because we plotted it a little
bit differently specifically to illustrate that for the most part the actual behavior of the
web pages is that they follow a power law which is pretty much consistently higher than the bell
curve so we'll talk about this a little bit more but what this is illustrating is that if you take
a look at the number of nodes that have a very small degree you're going to see that a scale-free
network has more nodes of a small degree than that of a random network so the line is higher here
when you get out to about the average degree you're going to see on a random network that more
nodes have that average degree than do in a scale-free network so the power law is below the bell
curve and then when you start looking at nodes with very high degree you can definitely see
that in a network that follows a power law you're going to have way more nodes
with these high degrees than you would in a random network so the probability of finding a hub in a
scale-free network or a real world network for the most part is going to be much higher than in a
random network so this power law follows something called the 80-20 rule and so if you haven't heard
of the 80-20 rule this comes from the history of Wilfredo Pareto who was an Italian economist who
also dabbled in political science and philosophy so in the 19th century he observed that in Italy
there were a few wealthy individuals that earned most of the money and the majority of the population
earned small amount of money and by making this observation he observed this power law distribution
so this is the same plot that we've been seeing for our scale-free networks so where we're plotting
the degree on the x-axis and the number of nodes that have the degree on the y-axis that we see a
lot of nodes that have small degree and only a very few nodes that have a very high degree
and then those are our hubs and this is something that we hear in business and this is something
that we hear sometimes on a day-to-day basis like 80 percent of the decisions made are happened during
20 percent of the meeting times well the same rule applies to networks so for example you might have
that 80 percent of the links on the web point to only 15 percent of the web pages or in a network
of citations you might have 80 percent of citations going only to 38 percent of scientists
you also see this in the actor network so 80 percent of links in hollywood are connected
to 30 percent of the actors so this power law that we observe in scale-free networks
helps us understand the nature of hubs and what we expect to observe if our network is scale-free
so let's talk a little bit more about the hubs in a scale-free versus a random network
so recall that hubs are those very highly connected individuals or web pages or what have you
and hubs tend to continue to pick up different nodes as they're added to the graph so here we have
plots of what the degree distribution looks like in a random versus a scale-free network
we've looked at this before but let's talk about it in a little more detail again so in green we
have the random network degree distribution where again most of the nodes tend to have the average
degree and in purple we have the power law distribution where we have tons of nodes that have
a small degree and very few nodes that have a large degree and to do a little bit further
comparison which we saw on the worldwide web example if we transform this into what's called
the log-log plot we get a line for the power law distribution and this green curve here
for the random network distribution and here we can really dig into the differences in behavior
so if we're looking at nodes that have small degree so just individuals that aren't that connected
they're going to have more individuals with a small degree in a scale-free network than you are
in a random network hence the purple line is above the green curve if you start to look at
nodes that are close to the average degree you will probably find more nodes in a random network
that have the average degree than you will in a scale-free network and finally as we start to
look at nodes that are very highly connected the hubs then we're going to have a much higher
probability of seeing hubs in a scale-free network that follows a power law distribution
than we are in a random network and that's illustrated by seeing the power law line above
the curve again interestingly enough the road network in the united states kind of follows
the same distribution as a random network so you tend to see that most nodes have the same
number of links if you think about the layout of intersections and roads that's about how it goes
but the airplane transportation network actually follows a power law so you tend to have tons
of connections going out of and coming into the large cities that are hubs like l.a. chicago new
york and then not that many connections for example in amarillo so if you're looking for
faces to put with each of these distributions you could think about the intersection network
versus the airplane flight network the other thing we want to understand is that as we increase the
size of a scale-free network what we're going to see is that the largest hub actually has the
potential to be a lot bigger which i think makes some sense so if we for example compare one of
the networks that you did in your first assignment to the worldwide web you would definitely see that
those hub websites on the worldwide web are much higher in degree than the hubs that you found in
your first assignment we actually don't see this behavior in a random network first of all because
we don't have hubs and also because degree is going to remain average it doesn't really affected by
the largeness of the network you'll see a larger average degree but it will still be the average
degree so where did this idea come from what does scale free actually mean
i've been talking about scale free in terms of well that's how most real world networks are
but there's a little bit of history there so we've already said that networks that have a
power law tail in their degree distribution are called scale-free networks and the name
actually comes from physics again it's a lot of overlap specifically as the book tells us
a branch of statistical physics called the theory of phase transitions
so we talked about getting that giant component where we have a large connected component in a
network that has a little bit to do with why it's called a scale-free network so on a random network
when we have this critical point and this transition we have a scale by which we can measure
the degree of choosing a random node the degree of a randomly chosen node so let's take a look
at what that means so in a random network if you randomly choose a node the scale by which
you can interpret the degree or expect a specific degree is that of the average degree of the network
so the average degree of the network provides the scale such that if you pick a node at random
it's going to be within some margin of this average degree in a scale-free network that
follows this power law distribution the average degree doesn't really serve as a scale because
if you think about if you pick a node at random like I was talking about with that pretty picture
of the worldwide web then we don't really know how close to the average degree that node is going
to be it could be a lot smaller it could be a lot bigger we don't have a scale by which we can expect
to see any particular degree on a node and so we can see the way in which different real world
networks exhibit this scale-free behavior or don't so if we look at this plot of scale behavior we
can actually see that if we look at a power grid it actually follows this but all these other
networks the standard deviation of the degree of a randomly chosen node
could be different depending upon the type of network that it is so the question is how universal
is this property this scale-free property in real world networks are all real world networks
scale-free are only some of them scale-free and how do we know whether or not it's scale-free
so again we bring up this image of the worldwide web as a reference
that actually one of the ways to determine whether or not a scale-free is through a visualization
so by looking at this we can automatically see we have this
case where only a few web pages have lots of links and most of the web pages don't really
have that many links we can also plot a degree distribution so for example if we look at
a network of citations we can see that we have this power law distribution
so most of the papers are written by some smaller percentage of the scientists involved
we can also see that this is true of online communities when we plot the degree distribution
so in this case we had an online email community where nodes were users and the links were emails
between them we plot the degree distribution of the nodes and can see that it definitely follows
that power law you see the same thing in connections on twitter for followers and friends so in blue we
have the out degree plotted so that would be people's friends and in red we have the indigree so
that would be people's followers both same thing parallel distribution scale-free network
where we have a small number of hubs and a large number of nodes that only have a few connections
we observe the same thing on facebook as well both at the global and the us level
finally a very popular example of a scale-free network would be that of the the actor network
so if you look at imdb you can see that if you look at actors as nodes and links where the actors
were in the same movie that you again have this power law distribution so you tend to see the
same actors casted together in a lot of the same movies however not all networks are scale-free
so things that we can observe in science like bonds between different atoms and different materials
neural networks in different organisms and the power grid actually are not scale-free
they tend to be more like the random network that we talked about so this hopefully provides
a nice guide for your reading and better understanding of the difference between
scale-free networks and random networks and different examples of each
