1. **Scale-Free Networks**: These are networks with a degree distribution following a power law, meaning that there are a few nodes with very high degrees (hubs) and many nodes with fewer connections. This contrasts with a random network where the probability of a node having a certain number of connections is evenly distributed regardless of scale.

2. **Historical Context**: The term "scale-free" originates from statistical physics, specifically from the study of phase transitions. It refers to the fact that in such systems, there is a critical point beyond which a small change can lead to a large effect (a giant component), and this concept has been applied to networks as well.

3. **Average Degree**: In random networks, the average degree serves as a scale to predict the expected degree of a randomly chosen nodeâ€”nodes are likely to be within some margin of this average degree. However, in scale-free networks, due to the power law distribution, there is no specific scale; the degree of a randomly chosen node can vary widely above and below the average without following a particular pattern.

4. **Real-World Examples of Scale-Free Networks**:
   - **World Wide Web**: A few web pages have many links, while most web pages have only a few.
   - **Citation Networks**: Few scientists publish a large number of papers, while most authors contribute fewer papers.
   - **Online Social Networks (OSNs)**: Users tend to interact with a small set of others, resulting in a power law distribution for both incoming and outgoing connections (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).
   - **Actor Networks**: A few actors are cast together in multiple films, while most actors appear in fewer movies.

5. **Non-Scale-Free Networks**:
   - **Social Bonds**: The distribution of bonds between individuals in a society is often more uniform and less scale-free compared to online networks.
   - **Neural Networks**: Connections among neurons in biological organisms are typically not scale-free but follow other patterns.
   - **Power Grid**: Electrical grids tend to have a more uniform distribution of connections, avoiding the formation of hubs.

6. **Determining Scale-Freeness**: The degree distribution of a network can be visualized or plotted to determine whether it is scale-free. A clear sign of a scale-free network is a power law distribution in this plot, indicating a small number of highly connected hubs and many nodes with few connections.

In summary, scale-free networks are characterized by their degree distribution, which follows a power law, resulting in a small number of highly connected nodes (hubs) and the majority of nodes having fewer connections. This contrasts with random networks, where the degree distribution is more uniform. Real-world examples of scale-free networks include social media networks, the World Wide Web, actor collaboration networks, and citation networks, among others. Not all networks are scale-free; many real-world systems exhibit different patterns of connectivity.
