Checking metauni/Lecture 1ï¼š Invitation to topos theory.txt
 Today's seminar focused on the connections between different ways of understanding computational processes, particularly in functional programming languages like Haskell. The discussion revolved around three related concepts:

1. **Equations as constraints on programs**: In a functional programming context, equations can be used to specify properties that programs must satisfy. For example, you might have a program that takes integers and always outputs integers less than three. These equations form part of the input-output behavior of the program.

2. **Type theory with propositions as types**: This is where we move from first-order logic to higher-order logics. In type theory, propositions can be seen as types, and proofs of propositions can be seen as values of that type. This perspective is important in understanding the power of functional programming languages, as it relates to the Curry-Howard correspondence.

3. **Topoi and geometric morphisms**: A topos is a category with certain properties that make it resemble the category of sheaves over a space. Geometric morphisms are special types of functors between topoi that preserve these properties. The significance of geometric morphisms lies in their ability to move models of theories between different topoi.

The seminar also mentioned upcoming talks in the series, including discussions on the Currie-Howard correspondence and monads in category theory and computer science.

The lecture emphasized that while the connections between these concepts are deep and interesting, they can be challenging to articulate clearly and may require a nuanced understanding of both category theory and type theory. The seminar aimed to explore these connections further, although some aspects, particularly those related to geometric morphisms, were acknowledged as areas where more clarity is needed.
