Processing Overview for Science, Technology & the Future
============================
Checking Science, Technology & the Future/Joscha Bach - Agency in an Age of Machines.txt
1. **Blockchain and AI**: The conversation started with a discussion about blockchain technology and its role in coordinating AIs, as well as concerns about whether Blockchain is distracting Ben Goertzel from his work on OpenCog and other AI projects. It was suggested that the design of blockchain protocols is an AI problem itself, which could be better tackled by AI systems.

2. **Bootstrapping AI**: There was a debate on whether blockchain is necessary for bootstrapping AI. Some believed that bootstrapping AI capable of inventing blockchains might be more straightforward without the dependency on existing blockchain infrastructure.

3. **Stuart Armstrong and Aligned AI**: The discussion shifted to Stuart Armstrong's new work at Aligned AI, where he is focusing on concept extrapolation. This research aims to understand the space of aesthetics, particularly in the context of bio-aesthetics and the possibility of coordinated agents at a planetary or even a cosmic scale.

4. **Gaia and Anthropogenic Climate Change**: The conversation touched on the idea that Gaia, the Earth's ecosystem, might have designed insects like us to eventually extract carbon from the ground and release it into the atmosphere. This perspective sees humanity as an intended or unintended part of Gaia's long-term plan, and our current actions as a way to fulfill this role, albeit with potentially detrimental consequences for ourselves.

5. **Teaching Rocks to Think**: There was a lighthearted moment where the idea of teaching rocks to think was proposed as a form of retaliation against Gaia, given the Earth's role in trapping carbon and leading to our current predicament. This suggests a playful or provocative approach to interacting with nature, as seen through the lens of a transhumanist perspective.

6. **Monica Anderson's Talk**: The conversation concluded with a reminder that Monica Anderson would be giving a talk on "The Red Pill of Machine Learning" and invited attendees to either stay for the presentation or take a break before returning for it.

7. **Pills and Reality**: There was a humorous exchange about different types of pills (blue, red) and how to approach reality, suggesting that perhaps a combination of different perspectives is necessary to understand complex issues like machine learning and AI.

8. **Final Notes**: The host indicated that there was time for a comfort break before Monica's talk and invited everyone to return for the next session.
