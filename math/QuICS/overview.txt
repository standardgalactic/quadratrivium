1. The problem of quantum majority vote can be reduced to solving a semidefinite program (SDP) when the inputs are tensor products of lower-dimensional states with equal dimensions. This SDP has a block diagonal structure, which simplifies the problem significantly.

2. The approach presented can solve instances like the quantum majority vote by representing the solution space as a linear combination of diagrammatic representations, reducing the complexity from potentially large matrices to only 120 variables in this case.

3. The method can be applied to other problems that exhibit similar symmetries, such as the problem of finding a function's majority value over a quantum domain. This includes cases where the input states may have small perturbations or rotations.

4. Open problems and potential research directions include:
   - Extending the algorithm to work with arbitrary qubit states (not restricted to tensor product states).
   - Considering non-symmetric functions and multiple outputs.
   - Exploring whether the shoe transform is necessary or if there are alternative methods like generalized phase estimation that could be used.
   - Connecting the method to regular query complexity and extending it to quantum cryptography applications.

5. Current work involves extending the reduction from SDPs to linear programs to cases without assumed symmetries, leading to more general semi-definite programs.

6. The research has implications for understanding the trade-offs between different complexity measures and could potentially lead to new algorithms with improved query complexity or other resource usages in quantum computation.

In summary, the presentation covered a novel approach to solving quantum majority vote problems by leveraging symmetries and reducing the problem to smaller linear programs. It also highlighted several open research questions that could lead to further advancements in quantum computing and complexity theory.
