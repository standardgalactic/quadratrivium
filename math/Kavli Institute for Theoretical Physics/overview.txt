1. The modular bootstrap approach to computing three-point functions in CFTs, which can also be applied to the study of black holes, is robust and provides expected results. Adding more structure to the solution might lead to new solutions that could cause issues if they dominate over the existing ones.

2. There are no known solutions with one side for the black hole geometry in the context of AdS/CFT. The solutions we have (one-sided, two-sided with defects) are consistent with expectations based on the holographic principle and the bootstrap approach.

3. The expectation is that for black holes in n=4 supergravity, there is essentially one microscopic state per black hole mass. However, in a toy model like LLM geometries (which are approximations to black holes), one could explore how sensitive the three-point function computations are to the details of the geometry by varying the Young tableaus associated with the operators.

4. The universality of the exponential part of the three-point function in the large central charge limit is expected, but the order one prefactor might depend on the specific details of the operator or the geometry. This is an area where further exploration and control over both the gauge theory and gravity descriptions are needed.

5. The banana integral computation in gravity, if it could be set up, would allow us to predict gauge theory results and test the universality of these computations, potentially revealing how much of the result is sensitive to back reaction and operator details.

In summary, the modular bootstrap approach provides a powerful method for computing three-point functions in CFTs and applying it to study black holes. While the current understanding aligns with expectations, there are many open questions regarding the universality of results and the sensitivity to specific details of the operators or geometry when back reaction is taken into account.
