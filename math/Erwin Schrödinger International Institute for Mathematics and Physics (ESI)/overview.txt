 Certainly! Let's summarize the key points from Nigel Hitchin's talk and the subsequent discussion on the application of geometric quantization to index problems, as inspired by Renate Schendera's work and related to the work of Alain Connes and others.

1. **Geometric Quantization**: Nigel Hitchin began by explaining geometric quantization in a very general sense, focusing on how it relates classical systems to quantum systems through symplectic geometry and groupoids. In geometric quantization, one replaces the phase space of a classical system with a complex manifold, which allows for the treatment of quantum effects.

2. **Tantric Groupoid**: The "tantric groupoid" refers to a specific approach to geometric quantization developed by Renate Schendera, which involves considering the space of closed geodesics on a Riemannian manifold as a phase space. This is a non-trivial generalization of earlier ideas.

3. **Index Problems**: The talk moved on to discuss how the tantric groupoid approach can be used to tackle index problems in mathematics and physics, particularly in relation to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. These index problems involve computing quantities that relate the topology of a space (like the space of closed geodesics) to its analysis (like the spectrum of an associated operator).

4. **Heat Kernel and Spectral Theory**: The goal is to compute the trace of the heat kernel on the space of closed geodesics, which gives information about the spectrum of the Laplacian on that space. This is a challenging problem because the Laplacian is not typically defined on the space of closed geodesics directly.

5. **Supersymmetry and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM)**: Bismuth's approach involves using supersymmetry to relate the quantum mechanics of particles on a manifold to the topological features of that manifold. This allows for the computation of the index in a way that is independent of certain parameters, leading to interesting mathematical results.

6. **Local Symmetric Spaces**: The discussion also touched upon how these ideas apply to locally symmetric spaces, which are important in both mathematics and physics.

7. **Quantization and Pseudo-Differential Operators**: The talk mentioned the connection between the tantric groupoid approach and pseudo-differential operators. Robert Yonkin's work with Eric Fenner provides a deep understanding of how these operators can be characterized within this framework.

In summary, Nigel Hitchin discussed a sophisticated and active area of research at the intersection of differential geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, where geometric quantization is used to understand index problems in a way that connects classical and quantum aspects of physical systems. The tantric groupoid approach, inspired by Renate Schendera's work, offers a new perspective on these problems with potential applications to a wide range of mathematical phenomena.
