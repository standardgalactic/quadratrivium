Music
We have on one hand
the word of geometric theories, which is a logical word if you want.
Yesterday we defined a geometric theory as a set of aspects of a particular form
with the influence of that logic.
And on the other hand, we have growth in input, please.
Which are categories of sheets on a site.
And the classifying topos construction allows to make these two words in communication with each other
thanks to the fact that through any geometric theory one can associate a growth in diktotos
in which yesterday we saw that one can build diktotos in a completely canonical way starting from team
by first taking the, this is the standard construction.
You take the scientific side of the theory and then the topos of sheets on the scientific side
satisfies the universal property of the classifying topos of the theory.
We call this fundamental property, it means that the geometric morpheasers from any
protein diktotos sheets, this classifying topos are in categorical equivalence with the models
of the theory in diktotos sheets, naturally in E.
And this basically means that we have a particular mathematical word, some sense, this is the classifying topos
which contains a particular model of the theory, which we can call ut,
which is the model that corresponds to the identity here.
If you take E equal to the classifying topos, then of course you have the identical geometric morpheasers here.
And so to this it corresponds to a particular model of the theory inside the classifying topos.
And this model that we call ut is universal in the sense that all the other models of the theory in other topos
is here, we can risk and take the topos of sheets or whatever topos.
The other models can be obtained from this universal model by applying the inverse image
function of the geometric morpheasers which is in fact uniquely determined by the model.
This is a unida classically, unida argument because this means representability as we
remarked yesterday of the pseudo function of the models of the theory.
So you consider morpheasers of models or isomorphisms of models.
That is T model of A.
Here the morpheasers are homomorphisms, the structural homomorphisms.
I take this as ours.
Yeah, and this corresponds then to morpheasers of between...
This corresponds to, I mean yesterday we saw that there was an intermediate step to prove this
that it was through the Cartesian J.T. continuous factors like this.
And so in fact I didn't explain this yesterday because of lack of time but the natural transformations
here correspond to the morpheasers of models in the sense of sigma structure homomorphisms.
And then from this to that it is completely standard.
Yeah, but I don't know what the convention is, but in Gorten, the GÃ©zier, the morpheasers of
between two dopos there is form a category.
Yes.
And the form between F and G is the form between F lower star and G lower star.
So it reverses the direction.
No, but it is the same thing as also in the other direction.
They are in bi-JT correspondence.
So instead of...
Because here the model is obtained by applying F after a star.
Yes, of course, but instead of taking the morpheasers here, you don't necessarily have to take the
direct image to define them.
You can take it as a joint.
So you can, I mean, define it in this way.
So yes, it's the same.
So this gives some opposition relative to what?
Yeah, of course.
It's not exact, okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I was growing here this picture just to show that material model you want to consider
of the theory inside any topos, in particular in the topos of star,
will be the image of this universal model under some...
A UT is what you call...
MT?
No, yesterday MT was inside the syntactic category.
But what you have to do to get the UT starting from MT, you just apply UNIDA.
Because, I mean, this topology, this syntactic topology is sub-canonical.
So you have UNIDA in this thing here.
And so you can...
So here we have defined the model here, actually.
So UT is just the image of this model there.
And so what you get is that this angle will be asymptotic to UT.
And the angle will be asymptotic to UT, et cetera.
So this picture shows you that basically this is sort of a center of symmetry of the theory.
Because everything that happens elsewhere, in some sense,
is a deformation of something that happens here at this core,
in which, in some sense, the syntax and the semantics of the theory meet.
Because let us recall that in this universal model, whatever is valid is...
whatever is provable in the theory.
So you have this strong completeness that is realized by this model.
Okay, so this is just repeating things from yesterday.
Yes.
If I understand correctly, this UT is actually an object.
Sure.
Well, not really an object, because it depends...
I mean, it is a collection of objects for each sort that you have.
So if you have just one sorted language, you will get one object.
If you have a mini-sorted object, this will assign to each sort of the signature of the theory.
So for each sort, you will have an object.
But in general, you can have many sorts, so you don't have just one object.
It is a model.
So the model is a bunch of...
For modules, for instance, you have a model for the ring and a model for the model.
Well, it depends if you want to keep the ring fixed or not.
If you want to make the ring variable, of course, then the natural thing to do is to choose to have two sorts.
Okay, so now, since we have this assignment, a very natural question to ask is,
is this sort of subjective or objective?
So yesterday, we already gave an answer concerning essential subjectivity,
because we observed that every protendictopos is actually the classifying topos of some theory,
even though, of course, and it is a very important aspect on which the bridge technique is based,
this is by no means canonical in the sense that if you want to find a theory classified by a certain topos,
you have necessarily to choose a particular way of representing that topos.
So you have by no means a canonical cross.
In particular, this means that...
So yesterday, we saw that by choosing a site for the topos, a site of definition for the topos,
given a topos like that, one could write down a theory associated to this site,
which formalizes j-continuous flat functors on C,
and which, therefore, by the Konescu's equivalence is classified by this topos.
But as you can see here, we had to make a choice, we had to choose a site,
and of course, a phenomenon that occurs very frequently
is that you can represent the topos in many different ways.
So there is this essential element of non-canonicity which shouldn't be seen as a disadvantage of the theory,
quite the opposite in fact, because it means that the theory is extremely flexible,
and in particular, capable of unifying different mathematical contexts,
different mathematical theories which share a common semantical core.
Because actually, I mean, now we have understood subjectivity,
but then we wonder if this, to which extent this assignment is, say, injective,
in the sense that when is it the case that we have an equivalence
between the classifying toposes of two different theories.
Of course, remember that since classifying toposes are defined by means of universal property,
they are not strictly determined, but they are determined only after the categorical equivalence.
So when I say that two theories are the same classifying toposes,
I actually mean that you have a categorical equivalence between them.
This is just a classical notion of categorical equivalence.
So you see the two toposes as categories, and then the notion is the normal one.
So you wonder when is it the case that this happens.
Now, the definition, the fundamental definition.
You don't keep the model when you say that.
You just look at the abstract toposes.
Yes, yes.
Yes, because the model depends on the signature.
So in particular, we want to be able to compare theories that are written over different signatures.
But there are some situations where you want, for instance,
the universal model of one theory to be sent to another.
We shall see the case of some toposes.
In this case, you will see that the associated shift answer will send the universal model
of a certain theory to the universal model of a quotient.
So there are situations in which there are these correspondences, but in general, no.
So we give a definition.
T and T prime are said to be morita equivalent if we have equivalent classical toposes.
This is a standard definition.
It is not me that invented the term morita equivalence.
And of course, there is a reason for this name,
because it actually generalizes the classical notion of morita equivalence of rings.
You say that, I recall that, you say that two rings are morita equivalent
when the capital is of left modules over them are equivalent.
And it turns out that you can formalize this.
We shall see it later.
But I mean, just to say that this is really a strict generalization
of the notion of morita equivalence of the classical one.
So this means that we can identify growth and dipthogosis
with geometric theories considered up to morita equivalence.
And so the bridges that I would like to talk about are precisely
about the possibility of using the Kalman classifying toposes
that two theories might share together as a sort of bridge
for transferring things from one to another.
And this transfer I anticipate will be made by considering invariance,
the geometric invariance that apply to toposes.
So here, at this level, and looking at how this invariance
is expressed in terms of the two theories related by the equivalence.
Now, what makes this technique interesting is the fact that in general
the notion of morita equivalence is strictly weaker
than the classical notion of biinterpretability that you had in logic.
So biinterpretability essentially means that you add dictionary
or translate the formulas in the language of the first theory
or the formulas in the language of the second
in a way that this induces an equivalence at the semantic level.
So there are many, many examples of theories that are not biinterpretable
but that are morita equivalent.
So in those situations you don't have a dictionary
so you cannot perform a direct translation between the two theories
but still the fact that the two theories share the same classifying toposes
means that they have a lot in common with each other
so it's a very sensible way to make the transfer between them
or at least the most technically effective way
is really to take this common classifying topos
and use it as a bridge through this invariant approximation.
But in particular they have the same model as a set.
Yes, of course.
I will also discuss the relationship between the fact of having the same set-base models
but we shall come back to this later.
So for the moment I would like to just illustrate the fact that
this connection between geometric theories and classifying toposes
is a very natural one.
Well, in some sense we would like that natural constructions
that we can perform on one hand translate, again translated.
They give rise to natural constructions in the other world
so we would like, for instance,
natural logical construction that we wanted to perform on theories
to translate into interesting geometric operations
that we might want to do on that toposes.
So to illustrate the fact that actually this correspondence is extremely natural
because, for instance, by working with toposes and making operations
on classifying toposes then when you look at these operations
from the point of view of theories you often find things that are very interesting
I will start with a very simple invariant notion
which is the notion of sub-topos
and I will describe how this notion expresses in terms of logic
which is the logical counterpart of the notion of sub-topos.
So here is a result which I proved in my thesis.
So if we have a geometric theory
then the sub-toposis of its classifying topos
are in natural bijection
with the conscience
I will explain what I mean by this
See, I will see there
Okay, so I need to give some definitions
because I don't...
well, and I usually have talked about sub-toposes
but let's just recall the definitions
of what is a sub-topos or a sub-topos
simply what is also called a geometric inclusion
so it is a geometric morphism
such that its direct image is correct.
And what is a quotient of a geometric theory
while it is simply a theory
which is obtained from the given theory
just by adding more axioms
while remaining over the same signature
so you don't change the signature
you just add more axioms.
And what is a syntactic equivalence
while it is the relation
that we find that two theories
over the same signature
when they prove exactly the same
geometric sequence over this.
Yes, exactly, I mean it is the obvious thing
that you want, because of course
I mean if you add the things that are provable
the models do not change
so you certainly cannot expect this to work.
And so this bijection works in the following way
so when you have a quotient of...
so a quotient of t prime
quotient of t
so here you will have
the universal property
of the classifying topos of t
which gives this
and then you can write
something analogous for t prime
and basically you have here
a commutative diagram where here
you compose with this inclusion
and given by the subtopos.
So in particular the domain of the subtopos
will be a classifying topos of the quotient
so you really, you can localize everything
in a most natural way.
Okay, so how does this work?
Well, the proof is not particularly difficult
I will just give the idea
we just used the representation
the syntactic representation that we gave
of the classifying topos of the theory
so let's do all this
you take shapes on the syntactic side
and you use the fact that
the notion of subtopos admits
a very natural site characterization
when I say site characterization
I mean a way to describe this invariant
in terms of a given site of definition for the topos.
So this means that when you
consider subtopos of shapes
in a certain site
this corresponds exactly to the
property of the topologies
J prime on C
which contains
which refines the topology J
very natural thing
Yes, it means that
to obtain J prime starting from J
you just add more topologies
and in fact already from this remark
you can be more or less convinced
about the truth of this result
because here on one hand
you add more shapes
and on the side of logic
you add more axioms
and in fact we shall see that adding axioms
correspond to add little shapes
on the other side
so more precisely here
what we have is that
we have a direct
bijection between
the growth and the topologies
J which contains the syntactic topology
and the quotients
of C
so how does this work
so imagine that you have a quotient
T prime so here it means that
you have added axioms of this form
for instance to your theory
now you can
go on the other side
so here you have to know
what to add
to the syntactic topology
and so here you just have to recall
that flat
flat I mean
here we just have a cartesian
cartesian
JT continues
fanters
which yesterday we remarked
being the same as the geometric
fanters
from this
to any topos key
for the same thing as
the models
and this worked in the following way
a model was sent
to the fanter
FM
which sent
a formula
an incubated formula
to this interpretation
in N
so you have said that
this is the same thing as
asking
this of course
and then
you can consider this monomorphism
in the syntactic category
and basically
requiring
that this
is sent
by
to an isomorphism
by the fanter FM
precisely amounts
to the condition
that M should be
a model for this
additional sequence
and so from this you get the idea
of considering the growth in the topology
generated by
all the
the sieves generated
by things of this form
and so this is how
one direction is defined
and the other direction
well yesterday we
observed that
we gave the definition of this syntactic topology
so
basically
you have
a situation of this kind
so if you have
we described our sieves
on this syntactic category
well so let's just
recreate this
and so starting
from a sieve
here you can
read the sequence
in the following way
you just take
this thing
and so by adding
all the sequence obtained
in this way you will get
your portion so I think it is
pretty clear how it works
of course there are some technical things
to make the tool to completely
exhaust back
I think you should make the
work that it is not completely
straightforward application of what you did
yesterday because when you
go from T to T prime
their syntactic
categories as defined
yesterday are not the same
ah yes of course in the sense that
here we represent
no no of course
here basically I change
the topology in the sense that I represent
the classifying topology of T prime
as a change
on this
but we also know
by the general construction of classifying toposes
that this is also equivalent
to this
so you see that
here we have a different category
so I mean this is another illustration
of the fact that you come all the time
with multiple ways of
representing the toposes
in the sense of multiple
size of definition for the same toposes
it is very very easy
to generate
different possibilities
for
describing the same
okay
describing the same group by different sets of
generating
exactly exactly I mean already Grotendick
made this comparison
he said that
if we
we think
about this analogy group toposes
then
basically different sets
different sizes of definition for one toposes
can be
in some sense a sort of analog of different
presentations for the same group
okay so
the questions
of tape just means that you keep
exactly the same signature
you just add more things over
the signature
the formulas are of course
geometric yes always always
yes so if you do it with
other fragments
it's a very good question
it's a very good question
that I asked myself
some years ago
and this is very interesting because
even if you start
for instance with a theory that lies
in a smaller fragment of geometric logic
there is no
intrinsic way
of identifying
only the toposes that correspond
to them
there are some invariants
for instance you can say that
a topose is
coherent
the notion of coherence was already
present in SGA4
and you can prove that
a topose is coherent
if and only if it is the classifying
topose of some coherent theory
but this is the only thing you have
and this doesn't allow you to restrict
the equivalence
even by this duality to those fragments
so this is interesting because it makes
appear the fact that
really geometric logic is
the fragment that corresponds
to the geometry of
growth and decomposition so it means
that if you decide for instance
to restrict your attention to coherent
toposes because maybe you like the
sum of choice and you are assured
that they always have enough points
when you perform operations
which are as natural as
the sub-topos construction
you come out of that
so you see this is an illustration
of the fact that really
the logic that corresponds
to growth and decomposition is
geometric logic and nothing else
now that we have this duality
we can start playing with it
because in the sense that
another question
when you look at the site
of the
city prime
essentially you are just setting
the objects
are the same but
yes the objects are the same
what changes is the
probability because
probability in t prime
or probability in t
so you are less
yes exactly
and essentially the sites
will be the same
because you are adding
the sieve on a certain object
that sieve is a sequence
that is not derivable
no you have a different notion
of arrow because
so it's a different category
and you have a different notion of probability
but we have received in the old one
in the
ctj
for those in the old one
yes
yes of course
but I saw there could be new statistics
that essentially are covered already
by the one you made
contradictory actions
well you can always do
so in this way you get
a contradictory theory
and this is
how can it have a model
no it has no models
you have a topos
which has no points at all
and which is trivial as a topos
so it's a very important feature
of logic the fact of being able to talk
about contradiction
because I mean it's not a taboo
I mean
it's important it's like
when one works with imagineries
you can add and then you will see
whether it is contradictory or not
but you add so the message of logic
is don't worry add things
and think later
you say
it has no model
I might object
because
the degenerate topos
would be a model
a model
yes
it's not set to be a model
one equals zero
when usually
in logic
they say something has no model
the logician means
non-empty model
yeah non-empty
that's what they mean
but the case of the painting model
would be the degenerate topos
no you can treat
I mean you have this degenerate topos
and you can really study it as an object
and you can also prove
for instance that the theory is not contradictory
by showing that the topos is non-degenerate
I did this for instance
in one of my papers
so I really proved that the topos is non-degenerate
I knew for instance
that this topos always had enough points
and I was able to deduce
that there was at least one point
so I proved
the existence of
one set-based model of a theory
using the degenerate topos
for which set?
well it was a theory
of homogeneous models
for a certain theory of a shift type
so it was a theories
arising in the context of crisis construction
I will maybe say a bit
about this later
ok so now let's come back
to this duality
so in this duality
one of the questions
if the theory is maximum
is complete what happens to the
classifying topos?
well if it is
complete
in the sense of geometric logic
it means that the classifying topos is too valued
and
if this topos
is also atomic
which is something important
to have because if you have
atomicity or at least
you can prove that the notion of completeness
for geometric logic
which means that
any geometric assertion
is either true or
to be forced in the theory
this notion becomes
equivalent to the first
of the notion of completeness
which is not generally the case for any
geometric theory
and for those theories like that
maximum with respect to the
natural order of theories
that it is induced by this duality
but I will come back to this
because here of course the duality gives
a lot of things because
at the level of toposis you have many
structures that you can consider
in particular you have the order between
toposis you can say one toposis
including the other
and so you can wonder what
it corresponds to at the level of theories
and so duality
there is an order between theories
you say
one is
well
let's write like this
one is
smaller than the other
if this is a portion of that
it means that everything
which is proved able to be true
exactly
another way of saying it
so we have an order
at the level of geometric
theories
which are quotients of the given theory
and
knowledge of
elementary topos theory
applied to the lattice of
subtoposis of the given topos
tells us that this order
is actually an hiding algebra
this defines an hiding algebra structure
because at the level of subtoposis
you have a cold hiding algebra structure
so since you reverse
the inclusion
we get an hiding algebra structure here
so it means in particular that you have
a join, that you have a meet
etc between theories
and it turns out that you can even
give a very explicit description
of what these operations are
you also have this
you get an atomic hiding algebra
because there are maximal theories
yes
you can
almost
it is not exactly
but almost
in the sense that for most theories
you can find a maximal one
that
extensively for most
so which operations are available
on the collection of subtoposis
you say that you have a join and a meet
do you have infinite meet
I suppose just
yeah you can also take that of course
and do you have some kind of complement
or this doesn't make sense
do you have this pseudo complement
if you want yes
so this you always have
when you have an hiding algebra
do you have infinite joins also
infinite joins yes of course
if you want to take
here
what do you do
at the level of logic you just put
all the actions
how do you define the join of two theories
when you take the actions of the first
the actions of the second
all of them together
so you get certainly a new theory
provided that it is a set
so yes you can define
is there a simple example
of a geometric theory that does not
admit maximal extension
no but
maybe
I mean I didn't
think about this problem
but I proved that
in many situations I showed
how you can
get something maximal
out of a theory with some properties
but it depends also on which
kind of set theoretic assumptions
you want to make
many choices
yeah that's the point
I mean if you want to do things
completely constructively then
it can be a problem
with choice you get the mathematical point
no not even sure
so in many cases
yes but
I mean I repeat I
haven't really addressed this completely
but I can tell you that in most cases
yes
so you get this
I think algebra structure so of course
we have talked about the join
you can take the meet so this is
you take the things that
are provable in both
separately
and from the fact that
you have a core I think algebra structure
on the lattice of some
topos so between topos
you get also some nice properties
of this
I mean you have
automatically distributivity for these operations
etc so it's
a nice thing to have and
now I don't have the time to write down
the specific accelerations for these
operations but if you are interested you can
find them in my paper
so this is called the
lattice is
all theories
for the moment
my aim is
not really to talk so much about
logic but mostly about mathematics
I mean the kind of
insight on
concrete mathematical structures that
this duality can give so for instance
well just remaining on
briefly on the subject of logic
on the topospheric side
you have the notion of open
some topos or the notion of closed
some topos
so these correspond to
extensions of this kind
so open sub-topos
correspond to adding
geometric sentences like that
and the closed sub-topos
which are complements
of this
are given by
sequence of this kind
always in the empty context
because these are geometric sentences
over the language of the field
so you can see it's very, very natural
both at the topospheric side
and at the logical
level
another important construction that you can
make in topos theory is the
subjection-inclusion factorization of the geometric
morphism so what you can do is
if you have
a geometric morphism of topos
you can always factorize it
as a subjection
followed by an inclusion
a geometric inclusion of topos
so a subjection is a geometric morphism such that
the inverse image is painful
so you always have this factorization
it is a general result
so you can look at
what it is in the setting
of the classifying topos of the theory
because here you have the sub-topos
now it turns out that
these sub-topos can be
identified as the classifying topos
of some theory
which is related of course to the geometric morphism
but this geometric morphism
by the universal property of the classifying topos
is the universal
it is the geometric morphism
corresponding to a model
of the theory in
the topos
here
F
and it turns out that this is the classifying
topos of the theory of
this model
so you see it's very natural and logic
to take all the things
not just in logic because
we made an application of that
even for
non-remotives
we used this kind of construction
to take the theory of a model
even though we did this
in the context of
regular logic just if you are interested
this is the character
Luca will probably
mention this in his talk
so
of course
so
we actually considered the theories
of this kind in those papers
and we showed that
an appropriate version
of the regular syntactic category
of this theory
yelled at something that
is equivalent to a classical
non-remotives
so you see this is just to show that
logic is really not a part
from mathematics
so it interacts very well
with classical mathematical context
sorry
you are amazing
I know what to say
now
so here we have to talk
about open sub-toposis
and we are about to close
the sub-toposis
we have also talked about
the logical interpretation
of this construction
there are of course many other things
to say for instance
there are many constructions
that you can make
many important
local operators that you can
consider on a topos
to produce sub-toposis
so
when you have
a topos and you have
a universe
closure
operation
on
sub-objects
of E
so this means
that you have a thing like this
and
then you have a corresponding
ship
sub-topos of that
and there are some notable
universal closure operations
that one might want to consider
for instance you can consider the double negation
closure operator
this gives what is called
the booleanization
of a topos
so this is called
booleanization
it is a universal way
of making a topos boolean
and you have many other
operations that you can
construct
to construct this object
for any sub-object
you consider the double negation
of that
here
the negation is the pseudo complement
in the hiding algebra in which the sub-object
is
you have a hiding algebra of sub-objects
so you just take this and you take it two times
so you get something bigger
so you define it in this way
you operate in the lattice of
the sub-objects
so this is one example
but of course there are many more
and I mentioned this just because
of the relevance that it has
in the context of
various natural mathematical theories
there is another
construction that
I introduced
which
apparently is
very eccentric
so basically I proved that
given a topos there is always
the largest dense sub-topos
of that
satisfying the Morgan's law
now I am not going to explain exactly
what it means but just to show that
apparently you see
here we are talking about the Morgan law
on a topos
so this indicates that
in this hiding algebra of sub-objects
this law holds
a reversal way of making
a topos
the Morgan
and basically as you can see
here you are doing
the completely toposcoretical
considerations so apparently you don't expect
that when you look at this thing
under the mirror of the duality
you will find meaningful examples
in the context of
particular mathematical theories but actually
the reality is the opposite
because for instance
we proved
with Peter Johnson that
if we take the classifying topos
for the theory of fields
so very simple and natural theory
and we consider the demorganization
of it then this
corresponds under the duality
to a very natural
theory which is the theory of fields
of finite characteristics which are
algebraic over the prime field
so you see this is
I mentioned this just as an illustration
of the fact that even
apparently weird
and remote constructions that you can make
here
might give rise to
naturally defined
mathematical notions
and here since I have talked about
gullinization what does it give
in the context of the same theory
when it gives the fields that are more over
algebraically closed
so you see you get really
natural mathematical examples
if we change the theory
because you might think
what is missing from the organization
to gullinization
the demorganization is bigger
so when you take the gullinization
you get smaller topos
and this corresponds to taking
the fields that are
finite characteristics which are
algebraic over the prime field
and if you want to get the gullinization
you have to add more over the condition
that they are algebraic
logically speaking what is
the rule that is not
satisfied by the
the organization and it's
well the lower excluded middle
because here this is weaker
than the lower excluded middle
the lower excluded middle is this
so this is a weakening
it is an intermediate logic
but this low does not hold
in general the first low
does not hold in general in the height
no no not at all
this is why it really defines
an intermediate class
of toposis
which are called demorganic toposis
and so let's just change
the theory to show that
this fruitfulness
for classical mathematical
situations is just not
completely by chance
it's not peculiar to
better particular theory
if you take the theory of linear order
for instance the gullinization
gives the theory of
dense linear order without any points
which is again a very natural
theory
ok so this is just
to give you an idea
of the fact that
this
correspondence given by the theory
of classifying toposis between
genetic theory of one hand and gullinization of the other
is actually very very natural
so
now
let me
move
to the second
excuse me
when you say that the theory of
you consider the theory of fields
as a geometric theory
what do you mean the usual first term
no it is a coherent
you can formalize
the theory of fields
within coherent logic
you can do it without
changing the signature
figurines we do in it
so it becomes a quotient
of the theory
of commutative range
ok so
now let us
talk about
theories
let us talk about
a class of theories that is
particularly important
in topos theory
at least
concerning the logical understanding
of classifying toposis is the class
of theories of pre-shift type
namely the theories that are
classified by a pre-shift topos
why are they interesting
well simply because
since every growth in the topos
is a sub-topos
of
pre-shift topos
so you can expect
a geometric theory to be a quotient
of a theory of pre-shift type
this is actually true
so basically theories of pre-shift type
you can regard them as the
basic building blocks
from which you can construct
any kind of geometric theory
so in some sense these are the
simplest theories that you might want
to consider and all the others
will be given by an addition
to them
so the definition is
theory
classified
by
a pre-shift topos
so in principle
you don't specify
the kind of
pre-shift topos that
you might want
but it turns out that
this category here
is especially determined
by the theory
in the sense that if imaging that the
p is classified
by
such a topos
then let's look at
what it says at the level of
the set-base models of the theory
well it means that
we are the flat
phantos
like that
but this is precisely
the end
completion of the category C
why? because
flat phantos are just the phantos
that are filtered
co-limits over-representables
so this is basically the filtered
limit
completion of the category C
and it turns out
that you can recover
C from
the
end completion by taking
so C up
to C completion
is equivalent to
the category
finely presentable objects
of this category
and so it's also
finely presentable objects of
this category
yes
so what is a finely presentable
yes I'm going to say
so
definition
so
well I will give it for a model
but it is a general definition
you say that it is finely presentable
when
in a category which has
filtered co-limits when you consider
the
phantos, the co-variant on phantos
and you require this
to preserve
filtered
co-limits
ok so
this is
yeah
so here we have
so this means that
when a theory is of digit type
it is always classified
by
this
because if you just
take the C C completion of
a category, the resulting category
of C C does not change
so you can directly
take this
and this gives a sort of canonical
representation
of the classic type of
notice that yesterday
we have already identified
a subclass of the class of
pre-shift type, namely the Cartesian
theories, because we showed
remember that if T is Cartesian
then
you have that the classifying
topos is
just take
the Cartesian
syntactic category of the theory
and
and this is
so you see it is classified by a pre-shift
topos, so it is a theory of pre-shift type
the interesting thing is that
this class is much
much broader than the class
of Cartesian theories, because it includes
many theories that
are even infinitary, so whose syntactic
form is completely
different from that of Cartesian theories
so I will give just a few examples
so you can consider
a theory of linear order
and for instance
to formalize the notion of linear order
you need a disjunction
because you have to specify that the order is total
so you see we are no longer
in the context of
Cartesian logic, or you can
also consider the theory of
intervals, by interval I mean
a linear order with
bottom and top
and this theory is interesting because
it is classified by the topos of
a simplicial sense, which is
in fact a pre-shift topos
we have many other examples, so
the theory of algebraic
extensions on a given field
this
is an infinitary theory, because
if you want to express the algebraic
condition, then you need
an infinitary disjunction
you have the theory of
lattice order and abelian
groups with a strong unit for instance
the notion of strong unit
also requires
an infinitary disjunction
over the natural numbers
you also have
Alain Cohen and Katia Konstaniev
used
both the
cyclic topos that Cohen introduced
in the 80s and the more recent
epicyclic topos
these are two pre-shift topos
and one can describe
theory of all pre-shift type, classified by these
topos, we did this
in a paper entitled
cyclic
theories, if you adjust the theories
to see what it gives, they are
relatively simple theories
that one can describe
but
simple but not cartesian
which are classified by these
important topos
and so
this is just to
illustrate the fact that
in some sense
these theories form
a huge class
and so
even though apparently
in terms of
syntax they look
quite different from each other
they share many properties
because actually you can
prove various reports about
these class of theories
for instance a very natural question
that you can ask about the theories of pre-shift type
is what about
the classical syntactic notion
of finite presentability
because I can define
you see normally one
in universal algebra one defines
a model to be finitely presented
if there is actually
a formula that presents this model
while the definition that I gave
here is completely semantic
I mean you just
categorical, you work in a category and then
you require a non-fungal to present
the coordinates and you might wonder
whether
there is a relationship between
this syntactic notion of finite presentability
and the semantic one
but let's give a definition
so m
is said
to be
finite represented
if
there exists
a formula
always considered
in the context
a geometric formula
in context
such that
basically
the elements
of the interpretation of this formula
in any model
n
are in natural correspondence
between
the homomorphisms
from the model
to n
so you see this is
for those of you who are familiar
with free structures
this is a generalization because in the case of
where you have two
you just find the notion of free model
and here we allow
any possible geometric formula
so you see we have this
definition
and apparently
there is
a significant difference between the two
but immediately you can realize
that if
a model is finite represented
syntactical in this sense
also finite representable
this is quite easy to show
but the converse is by no means
straight forward because imagine
that you start from something
that is finite representable
in this semantic sense
it is not a priori clear at all
how to find a formula
that presents it
and you have no clue to do this
but we have
a sort of
special
to address this kind of
problems
the bridge
technique
which suggests us
to
work with
multiple representations
of the testifying purpose of
our theory
and
so in the case of our theories of free-shift type
this is very nice
we have
on one end
the classical syntactic representation
of the testifying purpose
and on the other end we have
this semantic representation
I say semantic because
you see the notion of finite
representability that I use here
is the semantic one
so I use this
and I know that it is correct
because we obtain this description
of the classifying purpose by using the semantic definition
so I add that
and now I try to
play with
with this
and I put off
since if I want to embed
this into here
I can do with
genetic embedding but of course
it is going to be
not only if I
put here
so we want to
sort of
pass
from here to here
because you see we start with
a finite representable model
in the semantic sense and what we want to do
is to find something here
here is the formula
so we want to go from there to there
but it doesn't seem feasible
to do it directly
so how to do
so we pass through the purpose
so we start from M
and we have
our genetic embedding that allows us
to regard
M inside the classifying purpose
now
we use the fact that because
this is a pre-shift purpose
the objects of
this purpose of this form
they are very special
they are objects that are
irreducible
what does it mean
an irreducible object in a purpose
when it means that
whenever you have anything more
explained
so you say that A
is irreducible
if whenever you have anything more
explained like this
then the identity on A
necessarily factors
through one
of these arrows
so you see it is a very very strong condition
it is not something that
in fact it is a condition that
characterizes exactly
the representables
up to Cauchy completion
of course if the category is not
Cauchy complete then you could have
a retract
of something
that also is irreducible
without coming from the side
but here you see we have
a Cauchy complete
category
so we know that this is irreducible
then
we can transfer it here
so let's call
the object that we get here
A
and so what we can do is
we know that A is irreducible as well
because of course irreducibility is invariant
so I can look at it from the other
point of view
and
what do you think it will do since I really want
the formula
well I don't yet know that A
is a formula
but I can certainly cover it with formulas
because
every object
in a
purpose of ship
this is a general fact
I mean if you have
purpose of ships on a site
then if you take all
the arrows from the
applied the associative ship kind
to this representable
so I denote it like that
A, J or C
all the objects
of this form
you make C vary
give
no no no
because you have
this is a consequence of the fact that
the little of the preship topos
every object is a co-limit of
that
so
it means that I can certainly
the things that come from
the site they are just
these formulas
and C's
we know that
A is
irreducible
well then
we have such a factorization
but this
implies that this factorization
is monic
but it means therefore that A
is a sub-object inside this topos
of something coming from the site
and you can easily see that
it means that it must come from
the site itself
because this category is closed
under sub-objects in the topos
so we are done
we have found the formula
so you see in a completely
indirect way and we would have never
been able to do it
in a direct way
because you see here we are really exploiting
the geometry of the topos
what if I try to do it by
contradiction
I say there is no such formula
then I keep correct and I contradict
the fact that
I don't think it can
I mean I tried myself
a bit before
and then for me it was a big
surprise to find this result
just by playing with this
I didn't believe at first but then
I understood that in some sense
this is really the right point of view
you see it's very simple and sometimes
you get in this way
in a very simple way
you get a different result
in particular cases you could not prove
so
this shows that the two notions
are
are equivalent
and this is going to be useful
now
for describing
the quotions of
the classifying topos is of quotions
of theories of predictor
and this is useful
because of course it gives us
a way to
get more semantic representations
of those classifying topos
because so far we have just
two ways of creating classifying topos
which in practice are not
very useful unless you are just interested
in logic
the advantage of working with theories of bishop type
is that you can
pretend
in some sense
this category of penalty presentable models
you can pretend that it is semantic
even though it is not actually
because I mean
this correspondence
you can formalize it as
an equivalence between this
and the full subcategory
of the syntactic category
on the irreducible formulas
what do I mean
by irreducible formula
it is a completely syntactic notion
that derives
just by the expression
of the property
of the object
corresponding to the formula to be irreducible
in the topos at the level of the formula
so basically it means that
every
j covering
sieve
on the formula
is trivial
so you see
this is a completely syntactic thing
but
ah sorry I forgot to give you
of course this is a given
and
so you see
you can really switch
from the syntactic
thing to the syntactic
and of course it works in this way
so here you have formula
and
on the other hand you have the model
presented
by this formula
and conversely
and this is a categorical equivalence
so anyway you can
pretend this to be semantic
important because
you see you can identify
finitely presentable models
just by using the semantic definition
usually this is what one does
one doesn't necessarily care
about finding the formula
but for our purposes it's important
to know that there are such formulas
because for making certain computations
it is useful
so now
we consider
portions
of theories of preceptile
so
portions of theories of preceptile
this is an actual
something to consider because
as we have remarked
as any
as any glottendictopos is
some preceptopos
so any geometric theory
is a portion of some theory of preceptile
so
we hope to be able to obtain
a semantic representation
of the classical intopos of these portions
by
starting from
the representation
the double representation that we have
for the theory of preceptile
so we start from this
and
then
what do we do
so we know
by the
the theorem that we proved above
that if I have a quotient
t prime
t prime quotient
c
then it means that I have
another
sub-topos
of the classical intopos content
but now I move here
and I recall
that sub-topos is of such a topos
are just the localizations
of these
so it means that
and here I have a glottendictopology
you see
I would like to be able to
describe explicitly
in terms of
t prime
and t
basically I mean
talking about the t prime is the same thing
as talking about j
but you see that it is not
completely clear
how to go from one to the other
because you see here
the formulas
are so imagine if you have a
formula like that
that you add
to t
in order to form a t prime
how can you find
the glottendictopology
starting from
this
you
even in the following way you suppose
that
these axioms have a particular
form
I mean after all
this assures you
that there should be a way
of presenting t prime
in a certain way
since all the sequence
that come from j
will have a particular form
that will involve these irreducible formulas
necessarily
because you see we are working here
and we are precisely working on
the opposite of that
but the opposite of that is precisely
maybe we can just write it like that
and pass out at this point
so here I am you see
in some sense all the axioms of the theory
should be expressible in terms of irreducible formulas
but this is a bit
a bit strange
because
I mean why should this be the case
well the reason
is that you can cover
every formula
in the classifying topos of the fluid
t which is appreciate type
and cover it
by irreducible formulas
this is the logical translation of the fact
that you can cover
every
every object of the classifying topos
from
with things that come from the sides
so what does it mean
concretely
why it means that I can
cover in this way
so this is
a geometric formula
it means that there exists
a Jt
common in sieve
which is generated
by formulas that are
irreducible
so I will have my
and cover means of course
that
this and this
and the disjunction
of all this
and this gives me the key
because in some sense
you see thanks to this decomposition
what I can suppose
is that
I can suppose this to be irreducible
because
you see we are working inside
the
because keep writing the question
and I can suppose
that my
sequence is something of the form
because here of course I can always
add that so I can suppose
that I can cover
this formula here
by irreducible but then this formula
I can send it to this formula so it will give
a family of irreducible
that go to my formula
so I can suppose that I have
a situation like that
where
where all these
things are
from an irreducible formula
to our formula
and this is the way to make the translation
to calculate J
because
you see we can
exploit precisely this one
and so
I mean concretely
so you see there I adjust
a sieve
basically in
the
in the category C
T
here and by using that duality
this gives me a sieve
on the opposite of
finally presentable models
of the theory
so I have got a sieve
starting from each axiom
of my theory and if I take the growth and
dipthology generated by all these six
well this will be
my growth and dipthology J
you see also in this case
it is not straightforward
you cannot do things directly
you have to pass through this sort of
the composition by irreducible formulas
and I want to remark that it is
by no means clear
even if you take a particular
theory of pre-shift type
that you should have this way of the
composing you see you don't see
these are things that really are
topos magic in the sense that you don't
even in particular cases
full of these situations
toposphere is full of these situations
so I mean growth and dip was
really right in
thinking that the notion of topos
has an immense potential and
in particular the notion of
classifying topos adds
a lot to it because
logic
allows a very refined analysis
of growth and dipthoses
in fact even small
changes that you can make
the signature of a theory
can have a huge impact
at the level of the corresponding toposes
so in some sense the toposes are
very sensitive to logic
and so I mean
we shall see
in some examples
after the break
and then I will give more examples
of bridges of a more
sophisticated nature
to convince you of
the power of this
general methodology
and of the fact that the toposes can
indeed as growth and dip was
claiming and indeed after
significant places
ok so see you later I guess
for now
you
