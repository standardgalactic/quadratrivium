 The discussion revolves around the process of constructing a model for a theory within the context of topos theory, specifically in the realm of pre-shift types. In topos theory, models can be constructed using irreducible formulas that cover all possible formulas within the classifying topos of the theory. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Irreducible Formulas**: The idea is that every formula in the topos can be covered by a set of irreducible formulas. These are the building blocks for constructing models.

2. **Joint Covering by Irreducibles**: For any given formula, there exists a collection of irreducible formulas (denoted as `Jt`) that jointly cover it, meaning that their disjunction yields the original formula.

3. **Sieve and Duality**: A sieve is defined for each axiom of the theory, and duality principles are used to translate from presentable models in the category `C` to models in the classifying topos of the theory. This allows us to construct a sieve on the opposite side of presentable models.

4. **Composition with Irreducibles**: To calculate the growth and dipthology `J` for the sequence generated by a particular axiom, one composes the sieve with irreducible formulas that map to the axiom in question. This process involves adjusting the sieve to account for the logical structure of the theory.

5. **Topos Magic**: The process is not always straightforward and involves a deep understanding of the categorical and logical structures at play. Topos theory can reveal subtle changes in the signature of a theory that have significant consequences for the corresponding toposes.

6. **Potential and Sensitivity**: The classifying topos of a theory captures the essence of the logic within that theory, and even small changes to the signature can lead to different toposes with potentially very different properties. This underscores the immense potential of topos theory for analyzing growth and dipthoses in complex logical systems.

In summary, the speaker is explaining how to construct a model for a theory using the machinery of topos theory, focusing on the role of irreducible formulas in covering all possible formulas within the classifying topos. The process highlights the sensitivity of toposes to changes in logic and the potential of topos theory to provide deep insights into the structure of mathematical theories. After addressing more specific examples, the speaker will continue to illustrate the power of this methodology with additional bridges between logic and model theory within the topos framework.
