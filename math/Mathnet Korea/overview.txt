1. **Quantum State Representation**: In quantum computing, states are typically represented by vectors in a Hilbert space where operators (matrices) act upon them. These operators often commute, meaning their order does not affect the result of their action on a state.

2. **Non-Commuting Matrices**: In some cases, such as with directed graphs or mixed graphs, the matrices do not commute (they anti-commute). This is representative of a system where there are constraints or directions that must be considered, and it does not represent a quantum state.

3. **Embedding Non-Commuting Matrices**: It's possible to embed a non-commuting matrix within a larger commuting matrix. This is akin to extending a small system (with Alice, Bob, and Charlie) into a larger system that includes an environment or additional variables.

4. **Graph States and Directed Graphs**: The larger commuting matrix can be represented as a graph state, where each matrix entry corresponds to a node in the graph, and the edges represent interactions or constraints between these nodes. In the case of directed graphs, there are arrows indicating directionality in the interactions.

5. **Applications in Coding Theory**: The concepts of commuting matrices and graph states have applications in coding theory, where they can be used to model and solve problems related to error correction and information transmission.

6. **Larger System Implications**: By considering a larger system that includes the original operators along with additional ones representing the environment or external influences, we can explore new games or problems. This extends the scope of the original three-party system to one where all four parties (Alice, Bob, Charlie, and the environment) interact.

7. **Independent Sets and Packing**: In the context of graph theory, independent sets are subsets of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the subset are adjacent. The concept of packing refers to the process of filling a graph with as many independent sets as possible. The addition of the environment's node can affect these concepts, but the exact impact on independent set size and packing density remains an open question.

In summary, the talk discusses how non-commuting matrices in quantum systems can be embedded within larger commuting matrices to model more complex interactions, including those with an external environment. This has implications for understanding and designing quantum games and coding problems, particularly in terms of how the inclusion of additional variables affects independent sets and packing within graph theory.
