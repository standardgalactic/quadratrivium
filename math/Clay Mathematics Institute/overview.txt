1. **Singular-core homology obstructions**: The torsion classes in singular-core homologies can provide obstructions to the integration of differential forms over a manifold in characteristic p. This is counterintuitive because the topological properties of the manifold over the complex numbers do not necessarily relate to the behavior of differential forms in characteristic p.

2. **Q-deformation conjecture**: There is a conjecture that suggests the existence of a Q-deformation of the round-core homology, which would be a deformation of this homology theory using coefficients in Z_p^separated (Z-par series Q^-1). This Q-deformation should interpolate between the homologies constructed for all primes p.

3. **Q-deformed affine line**: For the affine line, the Q-deformed round-core homology can be computed using a Q derivative, which is a deformation of the complex derivative involving a new variable Q and its powers. This Q derivative resembles the Jackson Q derivative and depends on the choice of coordinates but should hold in an intrinsic manner, similar to the crystalline-core homology's independence of coordinates.

4. **Challenges**: The main challenges lie in proving that the Q-deformation is well-defined and independent of coordinates, as well as relating this deformation to some form of deformation of algebraic varieties from Z_2 (or another base field) to more universal settings, possibly involving universally Bayesian algebraic geometries.

5. **Open questions**: The talk ends with open questions about how to prove the well-definedness and independence of coordinates for the Q-deformed homology and how to relate this deformation to broader geometric or algebraic contexts. The speaker acknowledges that there might be a simple explanation for these phenomena but is unsure what it is.
