Checking NYLogic/J. Hamkinsï¼šThe surprising strength of reflection in second-order set theory with abundant urelements.txt
1. Joe is discussing his version of second order reflection in the context of KMU (Kanamori's Measure U) and its implications for understanding the structure of KMU plus this principle. He notes that while there has been work on large cardinals like indescribables and Omega Erosion, the exact strengths of KMU plus second order reflection are still open questions.

2. Jason's dissertation showed that if Kappa is nearly super compact within a CFC context, then ADL (almost disjointness lemma) holds in that context. However, the bi-interpretability between KMU + RP and CFC minus plus the largest cardinal Kappa that is nearly Kappa plus super compact is not as straightforwardly strong as the analogous result with just KMU.

3. There is a hope that KMU plus second order reflection might still imply strong results like the consistency of a measurable, but this has not been settled yet.

4. The discussion also touched on the practical aspect of presenting results, with Joe expressing his apologies for the difficulties caused by his unconventional slide presentation due to strong winds disrupting the pages.

5. The conversation highlighted the importance of understanding the relationships between different large cardinal axioms and their implications for set theory. It also underscored the ongoing research in this area, with some questions still remaining open for further exploration.
