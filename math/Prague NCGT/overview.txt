1. In a Banach algebra (or more generally in a Bannock algebra), an ideal can be either right, left, or two-sided. When not specified, "ideal" will mean a closed two-sided ideal.

2. A Banach algebra becomes a unital Banach algebra if it has a modular ideal—meaning for every element \( a \), there exist elements \( u \) and \( a \)-invertible element \( a' \) such that \( a - uau \) and \( a - a'u \) are both in the ideal.

3. In a Bannock algebra, we have notions similar to those in a Banach algebra:
   - Trivial ideals (0 or the entire algebra)
   - Proper ideals (non-trivial and not equal to the entire algebra)
   - Ideals generated by a subset (the smallest ideal containing that set)
   - Maximal ideals (proper and not contained in any other proper ideal, by Zorn's lemma)

4. Every modular ideal is contained in a maximal modular ideal, which implies that in a unital Banach algebra, every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.

5. A key point is that if \( I \) is an algebraic (or simply an ideal in the context of Bannock algebras) and proper, then its closure is also proper. This is useful because it guarantees that in the context of maximal modular ideals, which are always closed, we can talk about their closures without worrying about them becoming trivial.

6. The proposition mentioned at the end suggests that if an algebraic ideal \( I \) is proper, then its closure is also proper, which has implications for the structure of ideals in Banach and Bannock algebras, particularly when considering maximal modular ideals.

7. A reminder to reach out via email with any questions or clarifications about the material covered in the lecture. The next session will continue this topic, so staying engaged is beneficial.
