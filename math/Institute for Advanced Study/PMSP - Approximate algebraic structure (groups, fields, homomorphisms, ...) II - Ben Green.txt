The p theorem, and this is a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
is a really remarkable fact, and in fact this fact is completely fundamental in all
of, this is, at some level this is where the structure is put on these functions.
In any proof of these inverse theorems, we use the following fact again and again and
again to go from something that's combinatorially structured that has satisfied some relation
as in this definition to something that's actually got some algebraic structure, some
some bracket such that, well again this is a silly way of writing it, but the probability
that phi of x equals psi of x, by which I just mean the proportion of points on which
phi equals psi is bounded below by a function that depends only on delta, and here k is,
it also only depends on delta.
So the statement of the theorem is that approximate homomorphisms are bracket linear, at least
on a chunk, and as I say this is somehow the point in the proof of all of these theorems
where you're going from a combinatorial, quite a combinatorial notion to an algebraic
notion, so I regard this as the heart of the proof.
Right, so two things, first of all how do we finish from here, well I shan't show you
that, but let's remember where we got to, if it's still somewhere, oh yes maybe I raised
it, so that's unfortunate, yeah so I'm improving this U3 inverse theorem, I got to the point
where I had these Fourier coefficients that varied in this approximate homomorphism way,
and now I know they're bracket linear, I get to make this r sub h here bracket linear,
and it's not too difficult to go from that to making f itself a bracket quadratic, so
if you've got a function whose derivatives are bracket linear, then the function is bracket
quadratic, so there is an additional argument there, in fact that's the main new contribution
by Terry and I over and above what Gower's did, but I won't go into that, so as I say
with a bit of extra work, this statement, the structure of approximate homomorphisms
gives you the U3, the inverse theorem for the U3 norm, so I'm going to show you the
way that we know to prove this theorem roughly, but I should say that this is a very mysterious
result, the way of proving it I don't regard as very natural and it doesn't give very
good dependencies, so for example we believe that this K should be just logarithmic in
one over delta, that's a result called, that's a conjecture called the polynomial
Freiman-Ruzer conjecture which is very unsolved, and this here should just be polynomial in
delta, this implicit constant here, so we don't know those bounds and what I'm about to show
you is surely the wrong proof, but it is the only proof that we have, so here's a sketch proof,
but the first thing to do is to reinterpret what it means to be an approximate homomorphism,
so we'll look at the graph of that approximate homomorphism where graph means graph in the sense
of freshman calculus, it's just the set of points x, phi of x, where x ranges from one
up to n, and it's a subset of z cross r mod z, so the condition that phi is an approximate
homomorphism is telling you something about this graph, it's telling you that something called the
additive energy of this graph is at least, is almost as big as it could possibly be,
the additive energy is just the number of additive quadruples, e of gamma is the number of gamma 1,
gamma 2, gamma 3, gamma 4, with gamma 1 plus gamma 2 is gamma 3 plus gamma 4, if you just think
about it for a moment that is, it's the same as the definition that I gave you, and now we bring
out what one could call the machine of additive combinatorics, there's a sequence of results
which have been applied in several different contexts, and we're probably here, I don't know
if anyone's, I think someone's going to speak about expander graphs on leagroups,
where you'll see these kind of results being brought out again, there's something called
the Balog Semeridi-Gauer's theorem, an interesting example of a theorem where the authors are not
named alphabetically, that's because Balog and Semeridi proved a weak qualitative, quantitatively
weak variant of the theorem some time ago, and then Gauer's provided a new proof that gives much
stronger information, and the theorem states that if you have, in fact in any group, not even
necessarily a billion, if you have a set with large additive energy, then it must have a chunk
which has small sums at, so there is gamma primed, contained in gamma, which is a large portion of
gamma, such that gamma primed plus gamma primed is bounded above by, well let's say,
at some constant k times gamma primed, where k is, well it's actually could be, I think,
delta to the minus six or something like that would work, so I should perhaps explain this,
what kind of sets have large additive energy, let me just think about subsets of z, here is an
example of a set with large additive energy, I'll take a to be one up to n, union just some other
points, I don't know, 2 to the n, 2 to the n squared, 2 to the n cubed, etc, 2 to the n to the
n, so that set has large additive energy, because there are many solutions to x plus y
equals z plus w inside here, there are none inside here at all, but it doesn't matter,
there are plenty inside there, so what this Baloch Semeridi Gauer's theorem is doing is
extracting that structured component here, and it's, what's meant by structured is has small
subset, so let me define that, here a plus a is defined to be the set of all pairs,
a plus a primed, a and a primed lies in a, and this is what we call an approximate group,
this is an approximate group,
and a, well here, so here it's gamma that's the gamma primed as the approximate group,
it's one possible definition that in the Abelian case that to the doubling constant of a,
the ratio of a plus a to a is bounded by k, so this is a, I mean a k approximate group,
it's scarcely surprising that the the graph of an approximate homomorphism should be an
approximate group somehow, but this is, yeah, so this means that a plus a is bounded by k
times the size of a, so this reduces the study of approximate homomorphisms to the study of
approximate groups, and in the five minutes that remain I will give the very briefest
overview of that subject, first of all I have to say how it relates to what I've been talking about,
so that there is a theorem of Freiman and Ruzer which states that in this Abelian setting at
least, these approximate groups are all of a particular type, so that I'm not stating a
result that's false, let me just state it for subsets of z, although I need it for subsets of
z cross r mod z, so suppose that a is contained in z and has a plus a at most k times the size
of a, I mean if you, I should just remark that, I mean it's worth pausing to think why is this a
sensible notion of an approximate group, I think it's very natural, it just says that if it were
actually a group then it would be closed under addition, and I'm saying that it's not closed
under addition but it's not very unclosed under addition, if you add it to itself it just expands
a bit, then a is contained in a grid p, so p is of the form set of all x0 plus l1 x1 plus up to
ld xd, where the l i range over some lengths l i, and everything is bounded in terms of k,
so d depends only on k, and p, the size of p is not too much bigger than the size of a,
so this is often called Freiman's theorem or the Freiman-Ruscha theorem, an approximate subgroup
of the integers z is basically one of these grids, or a subset of one of these grids,
also known as multi-dimensional progressions, so if you apply you need to generalize that
theorem to subsets of z cross r mod z, which is not that hard, and then you need to apply this
theorem here, and show that if the graph is a grid then it's actually the graph of a bracket
quadratic, sorry of a bracket linear function, that's not obvious that involves a little bit of
geometry of numbers sort of Minkowski's theorems and that sort of thing, so that's all I'll say
about the proof of this, I just want to in the remaining two minutes say that the definition
of an approximate group makes perfect sense, much more generally in non-Abelian context as well,
so if a is now some potentially a set inside some group g, not necessarily a billion,
then we say that it's, or we can say that it's a k approximate group,
well why don't I tell you the actual definition rather than lie, it's a slight variant of this,
so first a is symmetric, if a is in a then a inverse is in a, and secondly that a times a
is covered by a few copies of a, both on the right and on the left, x is some set, x less than
or equal to k, so it's a little bit different, it's actually stronger, it certainly implies that a
times a is bounded by k times the size of a, but it's a little bit stronger, and there's been a
lot of work recently trying to find analogs of this Freiman-Rusier theorem in this much more
general setting, so the Freiman-Rusier theorem was about approximate subgroups of z, so we now have
theorems about approximate groups in other settings like inside matrix groups of fixed dimension and
so on, and I think Jean Bourgan's talk will touch upon that a bit more later in the week,
but I think it's lunchtime. I can take questions, maybe I mean you said that to be some staggered
lunch, so people who don't want to ask questions should go and have lunch, and if they do you can
stay and ask questions or something.
