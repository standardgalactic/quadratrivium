1. **2x2 Matrices Example (Non-Example)**: A non-example because it's not big enough to be a phonomenal algebra in infinite dimensions. It fails to contain the identity element and is not closed under the relevant topology.

2. **Finite Rank Operators Example (Non-Example)**: Another non-example because, while it forms an algebra, it does not include the identity operator and thus is not closed in the space of all bounded operators. It's not big enough to be a phonomenal algebra.

3. **Compact Operators Example (Non-Example)**: Compact operators are a step closer, as they are the norm-limit of finite rank operators. However, they still don't contain the identity and are not closed in the desired topology, making them insufficient to be a phonomenal algebra.

4. **All Bounded Operators (b(H)) Example**: The only way to construct a phonomenal algebra in infinite dimensions is by considering all bounded operators on a Hilbert space H. This includes the identity and is closed under the strong operator topology, making it a phonomenal algebra.

5. **L2(μ) x L∞(μ) Example (Phonomenal Algebra Exercise)**: Multpliers of L²(μ) by L∞(μ) functions form a phonomenal algebra. Here μ is a measure on some set X, and the functions in L∞(μ) act on elements of L²(μ) by point-wise multiplication. This example satisfies all the properties of a phonomenal algebra: it's an algebra, contains the identity, is self-adjoint, and is closed under point-wise convergence.

In summary, to get examples of phonomenal algebras in infinite dimensions, we must consider either all bounded operators or specific classes of operators that are big enough to include the identity and closed with respect to a suitable topology. The L²(μ) x L∞(μ) example is a concrete instance where the operations are well-defined and satisfy all the requirements of a phonomenal algebra.
