Checking MITCBMM/Attention Approximates Sparse Distributed Memory.txt
1. **SDM (Symbolic Dynamic Memory) and Attention Mechanisms**: The presentation discusses how SDM, which is inspired by cerebellar models of cognition, can be related to attention mechanisms in transformers. SDM involves pattern pointers that can either match the address directly or point to themselves, which can be useful in both auto- and hetero-associative systems.

2. **Transformer Architecture**: The feedforward part of the transformer is interpreted as performing a long-term version of attention, which can be seen as a long-term version of SDM. This long-term memory spans across multiple training epochs.

3. **Layer Norm and L2 Norm**: The importance of layer norm in transformers is highlighted. It's shown that layer norm approximates the normalization necessary for cosine similarity, which is central to SDM, and can be seen as an L2 norm operation that puts vectors on a similar scale.

4. **Extensions of SDM**: The presentation suggests several extensions of SDM that could potentially improve transformer models. These include:
   - Vector symbolic architectures
   - Multiple value vectors per key
   - Variants of self-attention with non-identity queries
   - External memory storage techniques

5. **Intersection Approximation**: SDM's read and write operations can approximate attention mechanisms, as the intersection between two hyper spheres approximates an exponential, which is a key component in SDM.

6. **Future Research**: The presentation raises questions about whether the success of transformers across various modalities could be due to their ability to perform a key cognitive operation similar to the cerebellum's functioning. This relationship is explored in the appendix of the upcoming paper.

7. **Biological Mapping**: The biological mapping of SDM to the cerebellar cell types is also discussed, suggesting that SDM could be a plausible theoretical model for how the cerebellum operates.

The work presented has been accepted for publication and will be available as a camera-ready paper within a week from the time of the presentation. The research explores the connections between SDM, attention mechanisms in transformers, and the broader implications for cognitive science and machine learning.
