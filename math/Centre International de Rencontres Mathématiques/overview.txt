Checking Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques/Tom Leinster ： The categorical origins of entropy.txt
1. The discussion revolved around the concept of measure-preserving maps and their role in understanding information loss and entropy within the context of general topological spaces, extending beyond the finite case.

2. Tobias mentioned that he might have considered compositions of measure-preserving maps in his work with John Byers, particularly in the context of polar spaces.

3. The need for a reference measure was emphasized when discussing relative entropy. No specific measure is required other than a laboratory measure against which to compare.

4. The framework can be extended to consider the quantum case, potentially leading to a recovery of concepts like salisentropy or natural entropy (as coined by E. T. Jaynes). However, the exact formulation for higher orders in the quantum context remains an open question.

5. Nicolae Centso's work from 1972 on maximum decision rules, which includes categorical approaches to probability setting and relative entropy, aligns with the categorical perspective being discussed.

6. The extension of the information-theoretic approach to other fields, such as F_p instead of R, was mentioned, suggesting it could lead to a finite polylog or similar functions.

7. A sociological question about how entropy is received by pure mathematicians was raised, with Tom having presented topics in entropy to topologists and acknowledging that while the reaction is positive, it may not lead to a full conversion or dedication to the study of entropy by those in other mathematical fields.

8. Lastly, an amusing aside about the "entropy radiator" in touring cars was mentioned, highlighting the broader applicability and recognition of the term "entropy" beyond its original context in thermodynamics and information theory.
