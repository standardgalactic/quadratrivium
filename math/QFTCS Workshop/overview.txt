1. The introduction of quantum fields rather than particles is motivated by the need for a theory that is consistent with both special relativity (requiring Lorentz invariance) and general relativity (requiring a curved spacetime background). This is because particle concepts become ambiguous and problematic when applied to accelerating frames or curved spacetimes. Examples like the Unruh effect illustrate this point, as it describes the thermal properties of a field as perceived by an accelerating observer, which is more naturally understood in terms of fields rather than individual particles.

2. The algebraic approach to quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTC) provides a rigorous framework for understanding how quantum fields interact with curved spacetimes without relying on a specific metric or coordinates. This approach helps clarify the physical content of the theory by focusing on the algebra of observables rather than states in a particular Hilbert space.

3. While the algebraic approach to QFTC does not directly address the issues surrounding black hole singularities, it is clear that quantum gravity—a theory that unifies general relativity and quantum field theory—is necessary to understand phenomena near singularities. The algebraic formulation of QFTC might offer insights into the behavior of matter fields near such singularities but does not resolve the problem of black hole information loss on its own.

4. The issue of black hole information loss is addressed by considering the algebra of observables at different times. A late-time algebra of observables may describe a mixed state, which is consistent with the possibility of information loss. This perspective avoids the need to consider all possible measurements within a single Hilbert space, offering a more flexible and physically meaningful interpretation of quantum states in the context of black holes.

In summary, the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime provides valuable insights into the physical interactions between quantum fields and curved spacetimes but does not directly solve issues like black hole information loss. For that, a full theory of quantum gravity is required. The algebraic approach, however, offers a clearer understanding of how to treat quantum states and observables in the presence of curved spacetime geometries, including those near singularities.
