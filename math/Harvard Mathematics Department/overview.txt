1. The moduli space of Riemann surfaces, \(\mathcal{M}_{g}\), for genus \(g\) is not compact and has complex topology that is not fully understood. It is known to be singular and degenerate in various ways.
2. There exists a measure on the moduli space which is invariant under the action of the group \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\), discovered by Meuser and Viehweg. This measure is in the Lebesgue measure class.
3. Almost every point in this moduli space has dense orbits under the \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\) action due to this invariant measure.
4. The \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\) action on the moduli space is ergodic.
5. The \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\) action on a holomorphic one-form associated with a Riemann surface (obtained by gluing sides of a polygon) sends periodic orbits to periodic orbits, although the lengths of these orbits may change in a group-equivariant manner.
6. Finding closed orbits in the moduli space can be facilitated by using the \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\) action to move a given holomorphic one-form to a region where a periodic orbit is known to exist.
7. The existence of at least one periodic orbit for any Riemann surface is a known result, but it's not directly proven by classification methods; instead, the \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\) action can be used to generate surfaces with periodic orbits and prove their existence by induction and arguments close to the boundary of the moduli space.

In summary, the \(SL(2, \mathbb{R})\) action on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of this complex space, including the existence of periodic orbits, which are crucial for various applications in mathematics and theoretical physics.
