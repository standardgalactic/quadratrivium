I'm going to discuss some topics related to dynamics and modular space of curves. Curves
here are complex curves or hyperbolic surfaces. So whenever I talk about some results that
I've done is joined with mostly with Alex Eskin and Madi, but I'm not going to discuss
only our results so it will be long before I even prove a theorem or stated theorem.
So maybe I'll start from, okay, so the discussion is about, so there's certain natural flows
that I want to motivate defining this flows, define over some bundles. I won't use this
much over mg, which is the modular space of, say, hyperbolic surfaces or if you prefer
complex curves of genus G. So somehow the topology is fixed and you have different structures
on the surface. Maybe it's a hyperbolic structure, complete hyperbolic structure on this compact
surface of a finite volume or this compact is finite or you have a complex structure
and you have the modular space of all possible complex structures that you can put on a surface
of genus G and then you want to find, we will see how basically deforming the complex structure
of the, actually the bundle here is essential, changing the structure and seeing what happens
to the structure can help you get results about properties of a given hyperbolic surface
or in this case mostly would be a complex curve plus some additional structure.
Before I even, before I define anything or say what I mean, what the flow is, how we define it,
what I mean by dynamics over this, maybe I want to discuss a few problems, a few questions
just to motivate the work that I'll be discussing and so if you have heard any talk about anything
related to these topics, the first example is usually billiards and the trajectory of a ball
and in the billiard table but I don't want to start from billiards so I'll keep the billiards
for the last, as an last example but we will get there. So maybe, so I'll start from a purely
combinatorial question which I mean even though it's a combinatorial question is certainly related
to surfaces, that's why I'm mentioning it, topology of surfaces which starts from basically,
you start from an interval and you divide into n pieces, here I'm dividing into four pieces and
one side of the interval you put, I mean there are different versions of this, you put, so this
small n is fixed but you put capital N semicircles with all the same center for example, this doesn't
have any respect for this, there's nothing about this interval and the other side on each, so if I
did it, well I mean on each interval I will have an even number of, so then I will have a1,
a2, a3 to an and I just put, so somehow n capital N is fixed and a1, you can imagine a1 to an
are somehow random integer points with the sum is equal to n and one side of this interval I'm
putting for ai, I put a1, I put a1 semicircles, for a2 I put a2 semicircles with the all centered
the center of the interval and a2 and an, so to this way given a1 to an with sum is equal to n I
get a shape of, so now I had my half circles here and I added this half circles which depended
on a1 to an but that basically a1 to an determines a shape like this and the question is what is
the probability, so you can start and go around either, I mean at some point you will come back
to the same place but it could cover the whole thing or this could be just a connected cycle,
the of getting a connected cycle or two of them or as n goes to infinity, sorry n it goes to
infinity and sigma ai is equal to n is somehow a random point in the random point where ai's are
integers, so okay so this is a little yeah so you can certainly generalize this kind of questions
very easily into we play with this a little bit you'll see that you can very easily make this into a
question about there's nothing about this semicircles or the way we define this we can start from a
graph and maybe I can I mean you can see even the interval in this it can start from a graph and
you will have you can have n incoming edges and n outgoing edges and and then you have this here
you can have a permutation to join the incoming and outgoing edges and each say if you want to make
the problem easier each incoming edge will go to maybe I have one two three four maybe one goes
to four two two goes to three and of course I can't draw it on the on the plane but it's okay I
drew and I look at it as a graph three goes to two and one goes to four so okay it's just a graph
and then if you have if you assign a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 where the sum of ai's is equal to large capital
and you can basically do the same thing that we were doing here meaning that I can just put
something very similar to that without using circles I can just use this integer points ai's
to draw parallel lines so if I have one and and therefore I'm looking at the number a 1 I'm
putting a 1 lines parallel to the first one and then I have I'm putting a 2 lines and not even
parallel but a 3 a 4 here and here I'm putting again a 1 if a 2 whatever these numbers are
and I'm just connecting and here I'm just using I have now because the sum is capital N I have
capital N strands here and capital N strands here which are joined two different ways so one way
is just the this here it's just without any self-intersections and the other way is through the
lines of the graph so a 1 to a n would determine a loop
and the question is when is this loop
connected or what is the probability of to be more precise probability of getting a connected loop
as basically n goes to infinity so maybe this you choose from a 1 to a n integers uniformly
by restricting that the sum is less than or equal to n
does the probability of getting it it's sort of hard to get something connected and you want to see
what it means is you can put some algebra some conditions on these integers to see
when it's connected and it's not and to get a sense of this you can do it with the simplest
possible graph with two this goes here and this goes here and if you have if I put a 1 a 2 and
a 1 a 2 here
sorry and a 1 a 2 here sorry what I'm getting so so what I'm getting here is that so the loop is
connected if and only if a 1 and a 2 are co-prime so you get asymptotically as n goes to infinity
you get something about the probability of getting a connected arc which is non-zero
which is the probability six over pi squared which you can calculate using elementary number theory
but but as you have more and more intervals and your graph is more probably complicated
then you can't use anything you can't say if this is connected or it has two connected components
if and only if some some you can't easily write it in terms of some conditions in terms of ai
and yeah but as you can see this is of course secretly
there is a surface behind this question and the surface is the surface that you get by
by thickening the graph
which is a we start with it's a ribbon graph
and gluing basically discs to get a compact surface
so for example if I do this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and and this kind of thing is it's related to the
interval exchange math is something that people study a lot and has they have nice properties
but if you if you do it for example and if you thicken the graph this 1 2 3 4 that I have there
and basically glue back a disc to make it a compact surface you get a surface of genus 2
so it for for this permutation that I have or as I'm sure most of you have seen if you do this
kind of graph and you thicken it you get a surface of genus 1
so it's these are questions related to some topological properties of things on surfaces
and so here's the so this is the third question is basically what a generalization of this that
you can start from a surface from a surface of genus g and so you're looking at different maybe patterns
on on sg and a pattern you mean it could be
maybe that's up to now so this sg surface of genus g and here I'm only interested in the topology
of it there's no geometry on it and it could be a union of
homotopic classes of of closed curves so for example you can have this guy this guy
this guy I don't know this guy this guy and maybe some self-intersection in the
between so this would be your gamma and and then you want to see basically so
so whenever you can draw one picture like this and even if these gamma eyes are up to homotopy
you have a very natural action of a very important group on the on the set of patterns of this type
on the surface and the action is by the the mapping class group of g which is the group of
say diffeomorphisms or homeomorphisms here orientation preserving
or homeo up to isotopey acts on the set of patterns of this type
so all I'm saying is that if you have a very complicated homeomorphism and I give you this
picture you can look at the image of this picture on the diffeomorphism it preserve the
type the shape of this and just makes it look that the lengths would be longer but in fact
they're not more complicated if whatever like self-intersection or whatever properties these
have the the new pattern will have the same properties for example if you have a one simple
curve it would be always simple if like 10 of them intersect in whatever way is basically the
same thing topologically you get the same thing if you cut the surface along the edges of this pattern
so and then but okay so this so you have all the patterns of this type which I write as mod g dot
dot gamma topologically and now I wanted so if you want to try to understand and say hyperbolic
surface think hyperbolic surface are just hyperbolic easier hyperbolic surface or hyperbolic structure
here or maybe you have a negatively curved distance function or metric or just something
which is not positive the curvature you can basically look at the statistics of
so you can order
your gammas so these are so an element of a mapping class group is just you can think about
it as a diffeomorphism up to isotope and you can look at the set of order the set of g gammas
and then measure this somehow the complexity of
of g gamma just by if I give you a union of closed curves on a surface you can do it by
one way if it's if you have something which has negative curvature by
by basically the length this is so each because if you have something which has negative curvature
every closed curve has a representative which has the minimum possible length and that's the
length of that curve so that and that's a unique geodesic representing that and then you write this
as whatever if this is gamma tilde l gamma tilde of x where gamma tilde is a pattern
of type gamma and the type of questions are first of all maybe the so the growth of the lengths
or and depending how it depends on x or even more complicated somehow is how the if you have for
example two curves alpha 1 alpha 2 in gamma is the statistics of the ratios of lengths
as as the length of of lengths of subsets as the length of the big guy which is the union of
all of them tends to infinity so and I because I won't have time to discuss these problems in
details and and how you do them I will just say here for example no matter what the complicated
shape that you have gamma tilde is you always get something and I want to compare this with the
with another result that I will mention so the number of gamma tilde's gamma tilde is of type gamma
of length less than or equal to l grows like l to the okay if the you have the genus l to the
6g minus 6 so it can be anything anything you want but of course there are many closed curves on
on the surface there I mean for for those of you who know that if if the length grows
there are exponentially many closed curves on the surface of length of seven equal to l
but the point is that they become more and more complicated in terms of the pattern and in fact
if the length is l you'll likely have square root l set which is section so there's no way to get
things about all this is not about all curves the same way as I should mention this is not about
all these kind of meanders that if you have seen it in I don't know even statistical physics this
is about the ones with like of bounded type in some sense and the same way this these are about
getting estimates about the guys of bounded type no the the type that the topology is not getting
more complicated as the length grows so it's a it's a little bit different from looking at all
possible all possible curves okay so and finally so these are things about about surfaces
that is you have like so the first two are basically combinatorial and the
orthopological and the third one is like fixing you have a fixed hyperbolic structure and you want to
see sub patterns in terms of the length the statistics of the ratios and see if you can
distinguish different different hyperbolic structures based on that or not okay so finally
so these are the problems motivating this so they finally get the billiards
so so the type of there there's several questions which are related to the dynamic
dynamics of a modular space and it's hard to do to say much about them without
without using the modular space and that I mean these are about the behavior of so the general
problem is trying to understand the behavior of the trajectory of a ball in a billiard table
but but this is a very fake I mean this is very difficult and your table maybe if I mean
if you don't put any conditions on it could be anything and this is of course a very difficult
problem there are lots of results that I won't have time to to to discuss but so you have a point
and you hit the ball at this point and then it goes and it bounces off and and the point
and it's in the billiard table meaning that these angles are the same whenever you intersect the
boundary and you want to see what happens to the trajectory to this point and are the closed orbits
are the orbits are the dense orbits are the dense orbits spending a fair amount of time in
all subsets of the billiards so there there are many problems like this but maybe instead of the
the billiard thing first of all the instead of having a smooth thing you can also look at even
at the polygon billiard and and then then whenever the ball goes to one of the so basically the
conditions are the same the only difference is that whenever the ball goes to one of the
vertices it it disappears so you don't continue so there are many finite trajectories there is no
way to continue but whenever it hits the the boundary the angle this angle and the if the
when it reflects the other angle they are the same so another problem which is related to this
is the maybe I want to mention two other problems and then then discuss the
the relations with the dynamics it's called illumination and security problems
on billiards
okay so this one question which is again these are quite old questions that if you have a
you have a room and the walls are made of glass and you have one light source somewhere
does it necessarily make the whole room bright or is it of course if it's a convex set it does
so you have a billiard the problems that might not be convex what can you say and then you have a
point and you're allowing so light means that of course you can there are variations of this question
but light means that you have you're looking at all the rays coming out of one single point
and you allow them to move forever so it goes and then it goes intersects this
then it goes intersects this of course then it goes maybe at some point comes to this corner
maybe not but then there you have all the possible given p so given p you look at all the all rays
starting from p and you are interested in the the possible set of are there points
not covered
by by this one one source light or what can you say about the set of points which are not covered
and in general I mean there are examples of actually
billiards which are not illuminated at one point
but but but there's not much but it's very hard to say what the set that can't be
covered consists of for example in many cases when the billiard and I'll discuss this a little bit
more when the billiard is slightly nice from our point of view then the set of points which are
not covered like end up being finite or at most countable and okay so but maybe before I mentioned
these kind of results I will say so this is one problem
another problem is that maybe you have a source and and it's another point q and maybe there are
many ways of there could be infinite I mean there are infinitely many ways of getting from p
to q maybe but you want to see not only if it's if it can get from p to q but can you
block it can you block p q so by this I mean all geodesics from p to q in the billiard
and whenever you go to this one of the vertices it disappears by finitely many points this is a
so if that can happen for all p and q say the polygon is secure so for example one so because
maybe you don't want the thing from p to reach q for examples of the security guards and if you
have a president and the terrorists and I mean there's all sorts of interpretation but you want
to have finitely many blocks so that any geodesic ray from p to q by this procedure will go through
one of these finitely many points that you can imagine these are hard problems and one maybe
this this looks very that's quite unlikely but the torus or square is is secure
and of course you can do this even on manifolds like if you have a manifold you have two points
you want to block all the geodesics going from one point to another by finitely many points
is it possible that for any two points there are finitely many points that any geodesic between
these two points will go through one of these finitely many points so conjecture is that there's
a lot of actually work on this area maybe I'll just refer to hotkin as a reference
and the conjecture is that so a manifold at least a riemannian manifold and I'm not I'm not sure
if I mean I'm not convinced this is true whether it is secure if and only if it's flat and I think
it's known that if it's flat then it's secure and and there are lots of examples where this happens
that if it's secured and it's flat but but in our setting I mean this is a little
simple little exercise you can do that any two points there are there are lots of all if you
look at all the geodesics in this billyard from any given two points then there are finitely many
points and you can imagine these are basically the middle of this guy and then you can draw some
other juice finitely many geodesics and the middle guys will be the middle of all the geodesics
between these two points simple exercise that you can do but okay so maybe
oh by geodesic I mean raise there's a flat oh here so it's a more general thing about geodesics if
you have a riemannian metric but here geodesic geodesic means this with respect to the flat
structure with r so there are lines of course this is one but they are more complicated ones
because something can go hit the boundary several times right and then end up at the other point
these two points are fixed these two points are fixed and the question is if you can find
finitely many points so that anyway you go from this point to this point you go through one of
the finitely many points and this is yeah this one is very simple to to find but okay so
the
so so I mentioned these these problems the illumination and security problems and the
properties of trajectories of fillers because and they are closely related to
surfaces so in a case so so that we are interested in the case where all angles
are rational rational multiples of pi
the reason is that otherwise we can't say anything
so so in general so these are so in general all these problems are very difficult but
it's even an open problem if you can always find a closed orbit
in a polygon
billiard or even there are interesting partial results but even I think in a triangle
there are results by rick shorts a lot of things are known but but in general it's not even clear
if there there is one single so what is a closed orbit closed orbit as you start and you go but
after finitely many times maybe not the first round but okay after sometime okay okay maybe even
even you come back like this or after sometime you go around more and more and you come back
this angle so it's a closed orbit so it's a periodic trajectory so closed orbit would be
periodic trajectory so so this these are so you can't say anything if you have an arbitrary
polygon basically or it's very hard to get even partial results and but the conjecture or what
happens in maybe I should say first so what happens if if p is a rational polygon
you do get many of them and not only that you get so given l you get roughly l squared
um closed or periodic orbits
so family of periodic orbits of length less than or equal to l which is different from what we had
there uh interesting the it doesn't depend on how many edges your billiard has and and I said I
wrote family here because also in the case of a square you can see this is one closed orbit
because it goes and bounces and it comes back but this is another one so they come in families so
once you have one closed orbit if you move it parallel to itself a little bit they go around
it's another closed orbit so it's it's not about the number of them so when two of them are in the
same family in this way um they we say that they are the same so you have l l square of them of
length less than or equal to l and this is but um so there are some bounds by orbits that refer to
but this is due to maser and eskin the asymptotics and it does use a lot of the things about properties
of the dynamics of the the actions that we are going to discuss on the modular space so
even for that it's not like you look at the billiard and you see where these things are and it's
the conjecture I think by katalk is that for an arbitrary polygon as l gets big you have l
squared roughly of closed orbits of length less than or equal to l but we can't even find one so
I'm not sure where the conjecture is I mean maybe it's just based on analogy with this and and it's
very delicate because I mean you can see or maybe you can approximate the billiard rational
because but these things are not these proper questions are not somehow stable you lose a lot
of information by approximating your billiard um and who
who are you with a little bit more a few more questions
so so given so again if you have them I mean that that's a question for general
billiard but you can also ask the types of trajectories what what so for example there
are some closed hopefully I mean if if the conjecture is right maybe there are closed meaning periodic orbits
for a trajectory of a billiard but you want to know if there are dense ones
or are there ones which are not closed not dense
and even even if you know that so here's a
even if you know that things are either dense or dense or closed the question is
um or can you find nice billiards such that every every orbit is either either closed
or it gets okay so equidistributed which um
the technical term for the bill is the trajectory that spends like if if you have an area alpha
basically it means that if you look at the long trajectory it should spend alpha over the area of
the billiard percentage of its time in that open set so it's doing this the fair way uh it it's closed
or when it's dense it becomes equidistributed and actually so that's I think so there are
examples of such uh n-gons basically regular n-gons
which were discussed by Weech who realized that these regular n-gons are optimal in the sense
and they are very nice but there are examples of so it's maybe I should hear that's very hard
um to to even in the case that the angles are rational multiples of pi
to get to prove that some billiards are are optimal or not
and um so for um so but but the kids but there are things that we know but um
that I think mostly from the case of
so-called L shaped billiards
which is uh done by Kurt
basically you can see when it's optimal and it's if it's uh basically if every orbit is either
closed or dense then the orbits are closed or they become equidistributed so there's a lot of
things we know but unfortunately that's I think that these are the type of billiards that will give
you surfaces of genus 2 and after that it becomes much more complicated to study these things
okay um so um and I should say um maybe a little bit about this the oh no
about the illumination problem um so so there and there are so in the case of again for for
general billiards it's much more difficult but the case that the the billiard is is rational
the all the angles of multiples of pi so there are results by different people
and and also by I think another group of people
that's I'm only and wise but they're all showing that in in some cases uh or
their work for all rational billiards if you have this one source the set of points you
basically cover most of the point on the this rational billiard that is the set of points
which are not covered or like countable or maybe finitely many points
uh okay so so these were the lists of the questions that I wanted to discuss
so maybe I will say a little bit about
um
how these are related to dynamics a modular space of curves
and state some state some results okay so um so the reason that
um so these are the all these problems um
are um can be done for this in a in an easier way or there are ways of approaching these problems
the case where the polygon is a uh is a rational polygon is uh because of a an old but very nice
trick uh is called unfolding
and um so already so okay I'm going to do it for the the simplest case of a square that
we have seen it and you can imagine you can do it for general billiard with rational the
angles are rational multiples of pi so it's the the trick is that instead of reflecting looking at
the reflection of the ball when it goes it hits the the the wall or the light and instead of that
you look at the reflection of your billiard with respect to one edge and then glue it
next to it to the original one and instead of looking at the reflection just continue the path
and so knowing things about this shape is the same as knowing things about
the original billiard and so so the nice thing is that if you so if you start from p and you take
reflections with respect to edges
and then at some point you can for example if you have p you have four of these guys
um
and but then the number of guys that you get is finite because the if because the I mean this
is just a simple exercise because the angles are rational multiples of pi after some time
of doing this reflection it comes back to itself or some multiple of two pi so but I mean you can
do the same thing if the angles are irrational multiples of pi but then you you get a very
complicated space which has like I mean very difficult to understand but what happens is that
if if you have a rational billiard after gluing so you get finitely many of these things and
you can at the end of you can once you do all these gluings this will give you a surface
compact surface if you do it for example for a square you get a torus you get four of them
and you get a torus and and a straight line so and it's a compact surface and it's a flat one
so meaning that straight lines make sense
so from p so for example you get this this guy but if you do it for a more complicated
billiard and you put these next to each other and then the glue
at the at the important thing is that all of this you can you have to do it slightly maybe
more carefully but all of these
you can use the gluing by
that will glue parallel lines
of polygon so so this is very similar to the case of like having a two end gone and then
which is regular and glue the parallel parallel edges of the polygon to get a surface and
okay so so that's what you get so you get if you get a surface which basically which is flat
but it's not quite flat i mean the surface if you do it this way you get a surface of genus two
so you can't expect this thing to be flat even though it looks like it looks like a piece of
piece of r everywhere but the point is that you have to be careful about the when you do the gluing
you have to be careful about having the vertices having a total angle two pi which fails to happen
except for this nice case you get a flat structure with finitely many
singularities where the sum of the so the angles at this this point is more than two pi
it's two pi times an integer okay so
so
so so given a billiard p you do get a
flat surface but this flat surface i mean has a lot of structure and i just want you to think
about the torus case or maybe the simple case of this this l-shaped billiard
so you have finitely many points every everything else is basically coming from
the flats of r2 and in fact it comes with this structure complex structure c because all you're
doing is you are applying you are gluing parallel edges of
parallel edges of some polygon so it actually comes with the complex structure
from c and and and it has even more structure than that so it's a complex structure of c
and it and you also have because you are only for the maps that you are using so the gluing maps
depending on how you choose your
how your your polygon is basically the gluing maps if you are in the nice case that are basically
just moving things by a vector c so not only the complex or plus minus but for now we can
ignore that so the the structure that you have not only the complex structure is preserved
there's a one form dz on c which is well defined and this one form i mean it's
well defined because it's well defined it's the same if your dz plus c is equal to dz even formally
so this defines in fact a one form a holomorphic one form
on a surface of genus g that g depends on the shape of the polygon
and so the main i mean the main reason that this is useful for understanding for example the set
of closed so if if the the set of closed or periodic orbits or not is that a lot of nice
properties are preserved under a natural and there is a natural
action of sl2r on this space that i will just write it down but before i do it
the sl2r is the group of i mean this two by two matrices determinant one
and if you want to see how it acts on sl2r doesn't this doesn't act in an obvious way on the
space of complex curves of genus two or at least we don't know yeah i mean this
this doesn't seem to be such a nice action but if you have a holomorphic one form say which comes
this way from gluing parallel edges of a polygon sl2r does act on c which is r2
so
so if you have this you can just use whatever whatever
sl2 your element of sl2r does to the polygon and you makes it to a different polygon but the
different polygon that in sl2r being parallel is preserved so you can glue the same edges and get
a different uh get a different polygon and one picture of this maybe so this is one case you
can do but one picture of this would be maybe if you have a regular
and regular n gone and you are basically gluing the parallel edges of this
and and you want to see what what happens if you act by sl2r you can act by sl2r maybe by the
e to the t zero zero e to the minus t as a matrix and it becomes one side becomes long
and and the other sides also become long but the basically it becomes thin and long
but uh parallel edges are parallel so you can still glue the parallel edges
and get another structure on the surface and you can do this here
so so maybe to to to fix some notation
and so I want to look at the space of the
of one forms holomorphic one forms on a surface of genus g
and this a1 and ak it doesn't matter I mean they they are very important but the
the they are basically just keeping or keeping the singularity type fixing
a1 to ak and what I try to discuss here is that so first of all there's a natural
and so to our action
on on the space
and there is also if you have this kind of flat structure there is a notion of
there is a notion of you have a complex structure it has a volume form which comes from the
canonical volume form on r2 so if you multiply your holomorphic one form by 10 the area is
multiple by 100 so that's it's natural to look at the guys with one forms area one
with this and an sl2r because this area preserving it preserves this and this is a
and the reason that we have this a1 to ak here of course if you have any holomorphic one form
you can act by sl2r but the singularity type which means the angle at the total angle at this kind
of special bad points the singular points is going to be preserved on the action of sl2r
everything is preserved every all the natural basic things are preserved under this action of
sl2r the topological thing so it makes sense instead of looking at all of them to stratify them
and look at the set of guys with given singularity types and hope that this is kind of a connected
space in terms of this this sl2r action and in fact there are I mean but still you have to
even if you add this data of a1 to ak
this this space is a very mysterious space as a topological space so you're fixing the
singularity type and you're looking at all holomorphic one forms of that of that type and
and some so there are these there are results about how when this thing is connected most of the
time it's connected most cases except for some hyper elliptic issues but so there are there are
some results either old by Zurich and Konsevich and and others about when these are connected and
what can you say about the connected components of them but the topology sorry I want to emphasize that
that the topology of this this h1 to ak is is very mysterious as we don't know I think there's a
conjecture that says that this space is a k pi one but that's that's not known basically not much
is known about this and and the tricky thing about the space is that this is certainly for example
not compact in any way and there are several problems with this kind of space one is that
the surface itself can degenerate the space of modular space of curves is not is not compact but
also the singularities can get close and and collapse and if you fix the type of singularities
collapsing singularities is not is not allowed so so that's the other problem
but so the topology is is it's not easy to understand but
sorry when did I start
okay so
okay so so maybe I'll finish maybe I'll just state one result and then I'll continue
okay so so so here's the here's this space
h1 a1 to ak and we have a natural s2r action here
and and I should also say so this is a bundle I mean it's not a bundle but it's
there is a projection map into the modular space of if the genus of this thing is g
the modular space of curves of genus g or hyperbolic surface of genus g just by forgetting
about this one form and this is but again this projection map is also very mysterious and we
don't understand it so well so so it's a little bit hard to say to translate the results on this
to results on mg because I mean if you have if I give you a complex curve is there's no way to
deform it but this omega at least gives you a way of if I give you a complex curve plus a
holomorphic one form there are ways of deforming it by using this action of sl2r but
but then getting back to mg is not is in general quite difficult so
and so the general problem here is so understanding this action
properties of
sl2r on in general a1ak so for example you can ask dense orbits
are there dense orbits what are the closed orbits so the type of questions that we asked
and these basic questions are basically I mean there's a lot known about these spaces based on
results of generic properties based on results of meser and and veg goes back to meser and veg
about that there exists a measure you all discusses a little bit next time measure on on h which is in
the Lebesgue measure class that I haven't told you about which is invariant under this sl2r
and and and the action is ergodic but for now what it means is that basically almost every point
has with respect to this with respect to this measure has dense
orbits and what I want to discuss next time
is trying to say what every single orbit would look like and and discuss some of the related
results but maybe I should say here that for example knowing every orbit would help you
to understand for example if one single if one single x omega has a periodic orbit but this means
now on the polygon having a periodic orbit is preserved by the action of sl2r in fact
the nice thing about the action of sl2r is that it sends if you if you have a if you have a
holomorphic one form which is basically coming from a gluing pal edges of a polygon if you have a
closed loop and closed periodic orbit on one and you act by sl2 you get another closed loop
because basically this sl2r will send straight lines to straight lines on your surface too
so periodic orbits will go to periodic orbits unfortunately the length is changed
but it's it acts in a it acts on the holonomies by in an equivariant way so if I if you want to
find a closed orbit here you can act by sl2r and try to reach some region
so try to reach a point where you know there are periodic points
and this will give you a periodic point or in the original thing so but of course this is
and then having a closed loop is some open set also in h1 to ak so it's basically you want to
move this by sl2r and get to some place that you know you have a periodic orbit so so actually
the proof of this that you have always a periodic orbit it's not quite along these lines to using
any kind of classification but it's sometimes somehow it's easier to use sl2 to for example
to generate the surface almost to generate the surface and then prove things by induction
close to the boundary and pull it back but basically basically they're having this sl2r action is
I mean help helps it's a big crucial point for getting periodic points okay so maybe I'm yeah
I'll even state the theorem next time
