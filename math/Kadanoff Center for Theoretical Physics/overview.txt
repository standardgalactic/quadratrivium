1. The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) in the context of interacting systems typically assumes that in a given energy window, eigenstates are described by random matrix theory. This implies that each eigenstate can be viewed as a random superposition of states within that energy window.

2. However, for certain interacting systems, especially those exhibiting Strong Chaos Anomalies in Resonances (SCAR) states, this description does not hold for a subspace of excited states. These SCAR states are special and decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space within the energy window.

3. The models that have been found to support SCAR states often have a "pile of subalgebra" that spans this human subspace, which is decoupled from the rest of the excited states. This suggests that the random matrix theory description may not apply to all excited states in these systems.

4. The understanding of scar states and their implications for ETH is still evolving, and there are different versions or interpretations of ETH that address various aspects of quantum chaos and thermalization.

5. The version of ETH discussed here focuses on the reduced density matrix of a small subsystem and requires that the entanglement entropy satisfies both a volume law and agrees with thermal entropy.

6. There are stronger versions of ETH that might include predictions about matrix elements between different states of the same energy, but these require a precise definition of observables within the context of ETH.

In summary, while ETH generally predicts that eigenstates in an interacting system within a certain energy window are thermal-like and can be described by random matrix theory, there are exceptions like SCAR states where this does not hold true. The validity of ETH in such cases is still under investigation, and the implications for our understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization are subject to ongoing research.
