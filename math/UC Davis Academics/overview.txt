1. **Ultrometric Data**: In ultrometric data, each character state (morphological trait, gene sequence, etc.) has an associated measurement of the amount of change from a common ancestor. The ultramicrosopic wing length in insects is a classic example. With ultrometric data, you can construct a unique evolutionary tree using parsimony methods, where you look for the tree that minimizes the number of character state changes (additive trees are a subset of ultrometric trees).

2. **Algorithm to Construct an Ultrometric Tree**: To build an ultrometric tree from a distance matrix:
   - Start with the smallest number in the matrix, representing the shortest time since divergence.
   - Combine the taxa associated with this smallest number.
   - Move to the next smallest number and combine those taxa.
   - Continue this process until all taxa are included in the tree.
   - Place nodes at points corresponding to larger numbers, as these represent longer times since divergence and force certain connections between branches.

3. **Additive Data**: In additive data, the numbers on the edges of a tree correspond to the sum of the character state changes along each path in the tree. These numbers should match the values in the distance matrix. Every ultrometric tree is also an additive tree, but not every additive tree is ultrometric.

4. **Evaluations**: The class evaluations are crucial and need to be completed by the students. A volunteer is required to deliver the evaluations to the department, as they do not trust faculty members to do so themselves.

5. **Lab Work**: Sasha, a teaching assistant for the course, organized the lab on genscan, which was her project.

In summary, ultrometric and additive data both allow for the reconstruction of evolutionary trees, but they differ in the types of measurements used and the assumptions underlying their methods. The construction of such trees is a fundamental aspect of phylogenetics and systematics.

1. **Parsimony vs. Maximum Likelihood**: Parsimony methods (like the UPGMA method) are fast and work well in certain contexts, but maximum likelihood methods, which use a statistical model to find the best-fitting tree for the data, are gaining popularity despite being computationally intensive.

2. **Distance-based Methods**: These methods, despite some negative press, are widely used because they are fast and seem to work effectively in practice.

3. **Bootstrap Values**: Bootstrap values indicate the consistency of a computed tree across multiple resampled datasets from the original data. A high bootstrap value suggests that an edge is consistently recovered across different trees generated by the resampling process, which might lead one to believe that this edge is robust and likely to be part of the true phylogeny.

4. **Misinterpretation of Bootstrap Values**: It's crucial not to overestimate the significance of bootstrap values. A high bootstrap value does not necessarily mean that a tree or an edge is correct; it only indicates that the edge is consistently recovered in simulations with the original data perturbed. The algorithm might still produce incorrect trees, and high bootstrap values do not guarantee the truthfulness of the phylogeny.

5. **Caution with Bootstrap Values**: When interpreting bootstrap values, one should remember that they are a measure of consistency in recovery across different synthetic datasets, not a direct measure of reliability or accuracy of the tree. It's important to use them cautiously and as part of a comprehensive approach to phylogenetic analysis rather than relying on them alone.
