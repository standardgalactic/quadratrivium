Checking pronkedelic/Jiří Rosický - Inaccessible cardinals and accessible categories.txt
1. The speaker discussed how the joint embedding property can be generalized from large categories to small, presentable ones using the concept of a powerful image in category theory. This is significant because it links the joint embedding property with the existence of strongly compact cardinals, which imply the full Embedding Reflection Principle (ERP).

2. The proof involves ultra products or these powerful images, which are accessible and can amalgamate any presentable object into a smaller one if necessary. This is useful because it shows that under certain conditions, you can embed any two presentable objects into each other.

3. The concept of disjoint amalgamation was also introduced, which involves taking the intersection of two disjoint amalgams within a category.

4. The speaker mentioned that while most examples in set theory involving joint embeddings are second-order or higher, there are category theoretic examples equivalent to single first-order sentences with substantial strength. An example given was the need for at least one strongly compact cardinal to handle all possible categories of a certain complexity.

5. The speaker touched upon the Levi hierarchy, which categorizes statements based on the number and type of quantifiers they use. Specifically, sigma-2 statements in the Levi hierarchy correspond to what you want to achieve with first-order logic.

6. A question was raised about whether there are any category theoretic examples equivalent to just a single first-order sentence with substantial strength. The speaker acknowledged that while the example given involves second-order concepts, it is essentially a first-order statement for brevity's sake and can be made precise using proper class assumptions like the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.

7. The speaker mentioned the complexity of defining categories and calculated their complexity in terms of unbounded quantifiers and the presence of strongly compact cardinals, which are necessary to handle all possible categories.

In summary, the discussion revolved around the relationship between joint embeddings, strongly compact cardinals, and category theory, with a focus on how these concepts can be applied to understand and calculate the complexity of different categories. The speaker also highlighted the connection between set-theoretic concepts and category theory, especially when dealing with complex mathematical structures.

Checking pronkedelic/Sam Sanders - The unreasonable effectiveness of Nonstandard Analysis.txt
1. **Nelson's Views**: Nelson was a constructivist and a realist, who developed radical elementary probability theory. He was skeptical of the exponential function and other transfinite constructions, which are central to standard non-standard analysis. Nelson's approach was more about finite approximations and avoidance of infinite processes.

2. **Kahn's Approach**: Kahn developed his own version of non-standard analysis that aligns with his philosophy of traces, which is also a form of realism. His approach is different from the standard treatment of non-standard analysis but shares the constructive aspect of handling infinite processes through finite approximations.

3. **Gandhi-Highland Functional (GHF)**: The GHF provides an example where computational content can be extracted from non-standard analyses in a way that is independent of the choice of non-standard element. This correspondence can be used to relate constructive approaches to computation and probability theory.

4. **Kohn's Traces**: Kohn's work on traces also deals with finite approximations, and his approach can be seen as an alternative formalism that is consistent with a constructive and realist philosophy. His traces can be used to compute or define objects in a way that is independent of the particular choice of trace.

5. **Literature**: Canovay et al and Katz have extensively studied the relationship between constructive approaches, non-standard analysis, and probability theory. Their work provides a detailed exploration of these topics and should be consulted for a deeper understanding.

In summary, while Nelson, Kahn, and others have approached probability theory and non-standard analysis from different constructivist perspectives, there is a shared interest in finite approximations and the extraction of computational content from these frameworks. The work by Canovay et al and Katz offers a comprehensive analysis of these relationships.
