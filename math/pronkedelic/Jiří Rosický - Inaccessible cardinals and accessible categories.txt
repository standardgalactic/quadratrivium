If could be even equivalent to one of those,

So here, but one knows that who can catch principle is stronger

because it implies the actual proper class
of much stronger cardinals than measurable,
for instance, extendable cardinals.

More of it preserves one that has equal limits.
And one that is accessible is one that is preaccessible,
so this is smallness condition, but some complete condition
that this category has one that has equal limits.
So this, of course, accessible means
randomly accessible for some like that.
These categories were, in some there,
theory was created by Makai and Pare in 94,
and they appear in many areas,
and some of these appearances will be presented in a moment.
So these are some category definitions I need.
So this, so another smallness condition
which give me more modell seoretica,
so just this notation, what I am like, set functor,
and download Levenajsko-Lentarski property,
this coming from Levenajsko-Lentsi, or download.
So it means there is a little card in lambda,
having an obvious in your category k,
and a subset of its underlying set,
subset of the card in this modell lambda,
so then you can find sub-object,
substructure of the given structure k,
l, which contains the set,
and this still has card in this modell lambda.
So any lambda-small set is contained
in a lambda-small substructure.
And on the bopeńka principle,
any full subcategory of structure is not only bounded,
but in fact it's preaccessible,
and even it has the lambda,
and Levenajsko-Lentarski property.
This is quite surprising maybe,
because just from set seore,
anything which is full limited structure
such lambda is exact,
but of course you don't know which lambda,
because just it's given by this axiom.
And I lent it from Nagidor
that this is related to unpublished CRM of study,
and one can read it in paper of Nagidor and Vanan,
and that means that this is the same thing.
And corollari,
again on bopeńka principle,
any full subcategory of structure,
which is closed,
and only call limit is accessible,
because you get the smallest condition for free
just from set seore.
Another equivalent with bopeńka principle,
so again,
you take full subcategory of structure,
so it can happen that you have some
boundary call limit in your subcategory,
which are not calculated like in the whole category,
which are somewhat wild.
It can happen,
but on bopeńka principle,
that always some lambda say it doesn't happen,
so those which exist,
I don't claim that exist all in K,
but those which exist are calculated like in structure.
So you see now,
this is what I somewhat mentioned in the beginning,
you see that some very natural questions,
which were open in category seore,
or in some kind of,
I can say, after model seore,
somewhat can be answered,
or can turn out to be equivalent to bopeńka principle.
Yes, when we present,
we did for the first time
a category seore conference,
so one of reactions was,
yes, but those questions
depend on set seore are bad questions.
This is just the proof that this question is bad,
but on the other hand,
you don't know in advance whether it's good or bad.
For instance, why it had problem
that was the most famous use of set seore by shellach,
so...
But I think now people wouldn't tell that, yes?
And now I show you,
it's like this, it's a proof,
it's like that, it's complex of previous things,
that as bopeńka principle
any full subcategory of structures,
which is closed and limit is accessible,
so how one does it,
so it's closed at the limit, so it's reflective.
So this is what I mentioned.
And the reflective subcategory in structure
is co-complete, it has all co-limit,
this is a little bit of category seore.
So it has one very co-limit.
But those co-limit
should be calculated in structures,
so it's closed on the co-limit structure,
so following the previous thing,
it's like corally one.
It's accessible.
This year I would like to mention
that
this large kernel hypothesis,
like bopeńka principle,
can be weakened
if the category K,
this K is always the subcategory,
has a lot of complexity
in layer hierarchy.
That is in joint paper
with John Bulgaria,
Kalec Kasegubar,
Kevin Matajos and me.
And as example of that,
if this category is sigma one
in layer hierarchy,
so that's always true.
I just took
the claim that closed on limit is reflective.
So that's always true.
You don't need any set theory for that.
If sigma two,
that it's true
if there's a proper cast of subcategory cardinals.
But that's only one implication.
I don't say that it's equivalent.
If it's sigma two
and there's a proper cast of subcategory cardinals,
so this is true in this case, reflective.
And if sigma three,
then the problem of extendable cardinals
makes that.
Which is quite interesting
because if you look at some
concrete problem of subcategory categories,
so you can just try to estimate
this complexity in layer hierarchy
and then you can maybe don't need
full strength of open cast principle to do this.
You need something which is richer.
And the same weakening is valid for,
is valid also in
in the other sink.
So another
another fact.
So accessible functor.
So accessible functor is between
accessible categories.
And to accessible means
that it preserve
lambda recovery for some lambda.
So these are morphism
to accessible categories.
These are functors which preserve
lambda recovery for some lambda.
One can always, I don't want to go into details,
but one can always somewhat
to uniformize things
and to find one lambda
that both categories lambda accessible
and the functor is lambda recovery limit.
So one can make it as given lambda.
But
and
now take such functor
and take full subcategory
of the codomain category
which consists of images
of this functor.
And this subcategory
is called
powerful image.
So the image of F is just the image of F.
So the powerful image is the image
crossed on a subobject.
Well, maybe motivating example
for this
is that
you take
functor of free
aberrant groups.
So
it's image
this is accessible functor.
It preserve in fact all polymers
because it's left a joint.
So it's
its image
consists of
free aberrant groups.
But
in this case
it's also powerful image
because any subgroup of every group is free.
So it's in fact not only image
but powerful image.
And this is well known question
well
in category
saying
whether the category of free aberrant groups is accessible.
But maybe model theoretically
it's the question of almost free groups.
So whether
there is free free
and
that's known that
if there is a compact cardinal
then it's true.
So if there is a compact cardinal
then any almost
so this category is accessible
on the other hand
in
under constructability
this is not true.
So this is a theoretical statement
and
that
that assuming that you have
enough it means
proper class of intervent cardinal
so then any powerful image
of intervent cardinal is accessible.
So in some sense it's a generalization
of this fact that having
once intervent cardinal
then free aberrant groups are accessible.
So now
having any such situation
we always need a strongly compact cardinal
which is large enough so you have to assume
that there is proper class of them.
So having a proper class of them
then any powerful image is accessible.
And recently
with Andrew
Group Taylor we weakened the assumption
in both ways
in two ways
in one way is that we don't need
proper class of strongly compact cardinal
and
on the other hand
we don't need to be close
under sub-object this image
but only under pure sub-object.
Yes, maybe I should mention
something because
at the end of my talk
I will come to that
because
quite often if you look at this
Makai pare book so very often
we use elementary beddings
to prove
many, many things
but elementary beddings
just at the beginning
I mentioned that having a category K
somewhat I can
change its presentation
how it's imeditu structure
and some questions are presentation dependent
and some questions are presentation independent.
For instance to be elementary
bedding it depends on language, on presentation.
But
lambda pure
it doesn't
lambda pure can be defined just
in terms of category itself.
Well
omega pure it means pure
this is known from group theory
so this is elementary
respect to positive primitive formula
so this is something which is weaker than elementary
but it can be defined categorically
well just if you are curious
you can just give definition
so
this F is lambda pure
in any side
cognitive diagrams
where these two objects
are lambda presentable
then there is always
morphism inside this
left triangle commute
definition of lambda pure
and somewhat one can view here
because if you take this object
and you take its atomic diagram
so you have some positive primitive formula
which is true here, it should be true here
so it calls the fact that
it's elementary
respect to positive
very formulas in interior logic
but let's just define the terms of the category
so we don't need
the powerful image
but only lambda pure powerful image
because if you take bigger lambda
so of course you have less
lambda pure things
so this lambda pure is a descending chain
and this intersection
are split monomorphism
it's a monophobic retraction
so this theorem is not true for split
but it's true for lambda pure for any lambda
and the reason
somewhat by
we look at that
and independently
in fact it was also proved
by Bonnie and Unger
that any powerful image
and actual function is accessible
if and only if there is a proper class
of homophobic cardinals
so they realize the same weakening
but on the other hand they show that it is equivalent to that
that something is very important
because you see this
whether three many groups are
accessible, it's theoretical
because it sits between
constructivity and large cardinals
but now this statement
that any powerful image
and in fact any lambda pure powerful image
actually accessible
is equivalent to the fact that it's a proper class
of homophobic cardinals
and the reason why this is
interesting is that
you see it appeared
so when I started to mention this abstract
model theory
in fact Shellac introduced
elementary classes
as some classes of structures
which are not defined by
axioms
but that I mean
for instance usually you have a theory
you take all models which satisfy the theory
and you take homomorphism
or elementary bending
of what you want
but here just subcategorial structures
and you put some condition on that
part of this condition in fact says
that this category is accessible
it's course and then it's called limit
and one of the conditions is that it's isofool
which I mentioned in the beginning
that any isomorphism between chosen
structure is chosen
and payment is
payment is a condition
because here you can define
types but since you don't have formulas
you cannot define types using formulas
instead you define focal Galois types
which
they are called Galois because they correspond
to orbit of monster model
and
payment is an important smallness condition
which in some sense says that there is some cardinal
that there are two types
which are distinct on small domain
so they are distinct
and why it's important
is that Grozberg-Vandir improved
that under payment is
the Shellac category conjecture
which is the famous conjecture
is true for successor cardinals
it means in the ten case
whenever you have
successor cardinal
which is sufficiently big
and your
after many classes categorical there
it means that the only object
of that size is
the only one object of that size
so then it's true starting from that time
so they cannot happen
that you have infinitely many
proper castle many jumps
from non-categorical to non-categorical
which
Grozberg shows that a part of this conjecture
somewhat depends on what cardinal
having a proper castle
to become a cardinal so then
this is true
and in some sense
this conjecture
somewhat could smell some set theory
there because it changes
proper class often
so this is why
these powerful images appeared
one it proved that
using
ultra filters
but then we showed this Mike Lieberman
that it can be derived from this Makai Paris ERM
so now I want to show you
another
another
somewhat situation when
some set theory appears
let's say that
you are complete
so all call limits
for instance
groups are local presentable
because you have all call in idea
so these are very nice categories
so I am not going to give
definitions here
for any definition
what say
local and stable model category
one model category is
that somewhat
there is a way how to do
homotopy theory
which was introduced by Quillan
that
you have some ingredients
and then you can make
homotopy category of your category
and stable
it means
homotopy category is special
in fact it is triangulated
and typical example
of such thing is that
you take derived category of a ring
you have a ring, you take complexes of the ring
then you have homotopy category
and then this is stable
and then you get triangulated category
which is derived category of a ring
but what is interesting is that if you take
not simply suggest
which is a spectra
which is totally non-editive spectra
and this stable category
this homotopy category
is seems like additive
because any triangulation is additive
usually this category of course
is not concrete so you go to quotient
of concrete categories
and this category is not nice
in that sense that you have products
or co-products but you cannot expect
to have equalizer or co-equalizer
they are replaced by fibers and co-fiber
so
now in some sense
this
absolute model theory even goes to quotient
of categories
and
the result is that
if you have local variable stable model category
so on the whopping casp principle
any full sub-category
homotopy category
which is close on the product and fibers
this is replacement of the fact
to be close on the limits
so products are limits
you don't have equalizer fibers in stack
so fibers is just to be close on the limit
so it's reflective
I will explain to you the other thing
in moment yes
and this was open problem
for instance for spectra
the standard
say stable model category
and it was open
where there any
they call such categories localizing
so when it is localizing category is reflective
co-localizing category is reflective
so it's true on the whopping casp principle
and also this is
I wanted to avoid too many definitions
but also if you take
it's left orthogonal sink
so it's co-reflective again
so this is something like that
anything close on the column is co-reflective
so you have the trace of that
but here we don't know
where this equivalent to open casp principle
yes I am quite sure
that it sets your reticle
but we are not able to show this
because
usually how one tries to do such things
is that
for instance one
embed something
when such bad things can happen
and you embed it to
to this stable model category
which can be done in brain groups can be embedded here
but then
you should close it under
something called suspensions
if you have chain complex
so suspensions is that you go one stage up
and this is always present here
and those suspensions enlarge this category
so that you lose control over everything
so we are not able to
show that this is your reticle
for both questions
so one of
good properties of category
is there are close under construction of limit type
again I am not going to define
what does it mean
but for instance there are close under products
any product of this category is accessible
one has to be a little bit careful
with those
construction limit type
with those limits
because they should be taken effect
as a limits among two categories
so one has not only object
morphism or natural transformation
and one has two instances
of those say two limits
one is called
Inceptor
which means that between two functions
morphism, natural transformation
or aquifiers
that between two functions you have two natural transformations
and you aquify them
this is similar thing how you equalize
that may equal to two morphisms
so this is just
rough intuition what are called limit type
but that is much more problematic
for concept of call limit type
and one result here
which I did
with Boparé
that accessible categories are closed
which means that these call limits are calculated
like among categories
and the right is call limits of accessible full embeddings
no set theory there
but if you go
to embeddings we could do it
having a proper castle stone in combat cardinal
I give you one example
if there is one open problem
so let's
take such chain
of actual categories
so just set
two which means pairs of sets
set n are n-tuples of sets
and this functor
this functor f
nn plus one always
if you have n-tuple
you take n1 plus tuple by repeating the last
instant
so what is the call limit
the call limit consist of sequences
of sets which are eventually constant
and morphisms are also
eventually constant sequences of morphisms
so this is
a direct call limit of
embeddings not full embeddings
these are not full embeddings
so this category is accessible
assuming the existence of an only galan
astronomical cardinal
but we don't know whether
you need sets theory for that
which is quite silly because it's very
very natural construction
so maybe somebody
with sets theoretical background
could do what we couldn't
so up
to now I always
talked about full sub
categories but
now
let's take something weaker
so let's take subcategories
which are only isofool
just to repeat it
so it means that
if you have
so maybe let's denote it in some way
for instance g
so now if you have
two objects in your category
and then isomorphism
in structures
then in fact it is
so that's an isomorphism
between your object
which goes to that one
this is a very natural condition
because
if you take somewhat any way
how to construct subcategory
for instance you take embeddings
isomorphism are embeddings
you take elementary embeddings
isomorphism are elementary embeddings
and you take some sort of homotopistory
for instance cofibration
so any reasonably definable
sink is isofool
and I told you this isofool
eliminates this stupid thing
that just encode concrete categories subcategory of sets
so now we
have only isofool subcategory
and still it's closer limit
and that is called limit
so it's reflective then
and
and their proof was
model theoretical
and just
it's actually sketched here
because they prove that the subcategory
k is close to an elementary submodel
and how they prove it
so
one takes an object k in k
and one take its elementary submodel
and one wants to show
that it belongs to k as well
so at first
one saturates k
by taking
ultra power
filter
if you want to avoid gca
so you have to iterate that
you have to take iterated ultra power
but just I skipped it
and you know that
this is
saturated
and this is universal homogeneous
so it means that there are lots of automorphism
and they showed
then
this L here
is equalizer of automorphism here
and since this subcategory
so k belongs to k
this ultra power
and the ultra power can be obtained
as a directed call limit of powers
so since our category is close under limit
under production, that is call limit is close under ultra power
so this ultra power also belongs to k
this is isofool
so all those automorphisms
belong to k as well
and it seems close on equalizer
so this L which is equal to automorphism
so it belongs to k as well
so this is remodels theoretical proof
and consequence
of this is the fact that
if it is full subcategory call limit
then that is call limit for this reflective
and
in fact what we did is
adamek
subcategory is we just eliminated
this model theory
and instead of elementary
we used pure embeddings
and we were absolutely happy
with that proof and we
never looked at non-full subcategories
but
it came again that these
non-full subcategories are important
so we wanted to generalize this Makai pitching
from
that is call limit to lentelitis call limit
like we did in this full subcategory
if you want
to mimic this argument
so you also
want to take this ultra power
but since you don't have that columnist
but only capillary columnist
so this ultra is actually capa complete
so but one is ready to assume
that capa is compact
so that you have enough termic on the cardinal
but unfortunately
there are some good ultra filters
also in this infinite context
but
you cannot expect that this
ultra power is universally homogeneous
so you cannot do that
we had some correspondence
this shalak
about that and
we will look at the well-ordered sets
which
you don't have any automorphisms
there because it auto rigid
only automorphism is identity
so you cannot expect that by taking
make one complete ultra powers
you get a lot of automorphisms
so simply this method fails
and this problem is open
so whether
it's true even at the sunset theory event
you can go from full to isofool
so let me just to end
with
something
quite recent
which is again
a kind of
appearances of this
of these powerful images
quite recently Baldwin and
Bonnie put to archive a paper
saying something
about amalgamation properties
and joint embedding properties
so
so joint embedding property
means that having two objects
you can
embed and join to some other object
amalgamation means that you can complete
to a square
you can amalgamate them
and the question was
so they did it with upside elementary classes
so
which had kind of accessible categories
and now you assume
that you have this joint embedding property
for
objects which are small
which are presentable in fact
and they prove that if there is a
strongly compact cardinal
so then this
the new property in fact implies the full
with the embedding property
and they did prove using
ultra products again but it can be done
using these powerful images
and the trick is quite
quite easy
because
you take
a category consisting of such
configuration
so this is say L
and you go down by forgetting
to your category K
in fact K square having just those
two candidates which you want to
to embed
and this function is accessible
and this image is powerful because
whenever you can amalgamate
that
so you can amalgamate in fact anything
which not only some of your missing which goes here
because just you joint embedding
that way
so it's powerful this image
so having
to the cardinal this image is accessible
but you assume
that for any
capable presentable here
they can be amalgamated
but in fact any
there is
those small pairs
so this powerful image contains all pairs
which means that you have
poor joint embedding property
and the same tree can be used also
with amalgamation properties
so this is quite
quite useful
technology this powerful image
and they also looked
at something which is called disjoint amalgamation
it means that these two things
I disjoint here
disjoint amalgamation
which shows that this
in this amalgam is a
intersection of those
and you can do this as well
by somewhat changing a little bit
this category assuming
this visuality is there
using
some kind of limit call
limit sketches and which is again accessible
under some theory and do the same thing
so that's all thank you
applause
applause
questions
thank you very much for that
really interesting so most of the
examples
you've given on the set theory side have all been
either second order
or first order schematic
which you expect with category theorists to do
classes of models being embedded into
each other and so forth
so are there any
category theoretic
examples that
are equivalent
to just a single first order
sentence with substantial strength
which kind of
sentence do you need?
just the
I mean
an actual example is something like
there is a single
cardinal but in terms of
you know a capital filter
rather than focusing on the J
now always
in this result
using what kind of say something about
some categories
so you need this cardinal
should be big enough
so if for instance
if like this group
if everything is really down
so that's enough to have just one
only compact cardinal
and the proper class is that you want to
handle all possible
categories
and that's related
to this complexity
sink in some sense also
that you can allow that having
some easier
situations
I don't know whether it's answered to your question
or not
I should mention also
that the first order versus second order
may not be development distinction
but there's a proper class of
measurables
which sounds like second order proper class
it's equivalent to saying
for every cardinal
so a lot of this is
second order only for the sake of breveti
yeah
are there other questions
comments?
it's an unbounded quantity
I mean exact questions require unbounded
and even one strongly compact
it's an unbounded
the issue is how many
alternatives
sigma 2 statement
in some sense
the issue is that sigma 2 in the
in the levi hierarchy
sigma 2 is
right
right
is what you want to do with first order
you mentioned
the levi hierarchy
I'm not familiar with that
what's the word of the different classes
but you take
appearances of unbounded quantifiers
and how much
you have to change for all
and there exists
yes we think yes
yes I have to say that
I had joined fortunately to
which I tell you was the complexity
it was all like making mistakes there
but it's quite nice exercise
you have some definition category
to calculate it complexity
in some sense
ok
no more questions
thank you
