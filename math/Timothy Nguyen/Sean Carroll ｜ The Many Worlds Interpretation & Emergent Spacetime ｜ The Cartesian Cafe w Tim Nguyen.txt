The good news here is that I can tell you what the many worlds interpretation says
without starting a new slide. So Everett says you should have stopped after you had written down
the two sensible rules of quantum mechanics. Welcome everyone to the Cartesian Cafe. Today
we're very lucky to have Sean Carroll here with us. Sean is a theoretical physicist and
philosopher who specializes in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and the philosophy of science.
He is the Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy at John Hopkins University
and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. Sean has contributed prolifically to the public
understanding of science through a variety of mediums as an author of several physics books
including Something Deeply Hidden and The Biggest Ideas in the Universe as a public speaker and
debater on a wide variety of scientific and philosophical subjects and also as a host of
his podcast Mindscape which covers topics spanning science, society, philosophy, culture,
and the arts. Welcome Sean, how are you doing today? Great, thanks for having me Tim.
It's such an honor to have you here Sean. I'm a big fan of your podcast and you've also been a very
big inspiration to my own podcast. Over the pandemic you put out your YouTube series The
Biggest Ideas in the Universe which was a precursor to your book series by the same name
where you whiteboard big physics ideas on your iPad and I reached out to you on your Patreon
asking you about your setup and you referred me to your blog post which went into the details
and I used that as the template for my own solo videos and now this podcast so it's very fitting
for you to be here where we'll both be virtual whiteboarding now. Poisoning young minds is what
I do best so I'm very proud of that. Great, I wanted to first of all get to know a little bit
more about your professional trajectory. Now most scientists or science communicators fall into two
categories either they're a tenured academic or they fall well outside of academia. Now you spent
most of your career at Caltech and I only learned recently that that was not a tenured position
correct? Your title was that of a research professor and therefore not a tenured associate
or full professor but from what I could observe you basically function in all capabilities as a
research academic. Did not having tenure have any effect on your research or your outreach activities?
It didn't have quite that much impact on those activities. I mean you have to
go back one step before that. I was a junior faculty at the University of Chicago for seven years
in a very standard kind of thing. Tenured track, physics professor, etc. I had brought
interests. I wrote the textbook space, time and geometry while I was still at the University of
Chicago and then I was not given tenure at the University of Chicago which is a surprise to me
and to most other people but it happened sometimes and I needed a decision to make because it was
clear that a large part of that decision was because they were worried that since I had already
written a textbook I wasn't sufficiently devoted to doing research. There were other things I was
interested in doing which can be the kiss of death when it comes to getting tenure. I could
either have just doubled down on doing research and done everything I can to get a tenured job
somewhere and be a regular professor or I could lean into the fact that I like to do lots of
different things and see you know toss the dice and see how well I can do at that at that ladder
By some point in your life you got to do what you like doing. You can't really
try too hard to sacrifice to the whims of others. When you're 20 you got to sacrifice to the whims
of others a little bit but when you're in your mid 30s maybe less so. I went to Caltech which was
I was offered, I had opportunities to get tenured regular faculty jobs elsewhere
but Caltech was the best place that was interested in me and the job that they offered was this
research professorship which is good and bad. It's good because you don't have to do anything
you can just do research that's all you have to do you don't have to teach you don't have to be on
committees a couple committees but not too many. The bad part is that you're not very flexible
you know the good part of getting tenure is that you can do what you want intellectually.
So at Caltech I could do what I wanted with my time but if I started doing too much stuff that
was not what I was hired to do they would lose the slot for me you know what I mean I was there to
do theoretical cosmology and particle physics and gravity and I started drifting away from doing
those things because I had other interests I thought were more exciting in philosophy and
complexity and things like that. I still do the cosmology and gravity stuff but it's a smaller
part of my research so I started looking around they didn't they they were happy to have me around
but I started looking for a job that was a better fit for me and I ultimately ended up at Johns Hopkins.
Well I'm glad that worked out I think most people if they don't get a tenured position
they're done with their research career right so you it's very great that you were able to land
that opportunity for so many years. Yeah no I mean it was very I will always be grateful to Caltech
and to the people there for hiring me in fact the person probably most responsible for hiring me
at Caltech was Mark Hamienkowski who is now my colleague at Johns Hopkins so it all works out.
Oh that's great that's great I'm glad to hear that maybe just one last question before we get to
our main discussion about many worlds. So you're one of the rare people that does both science
and philosophy and it's it's hard to find people that do both I guess there's well there's there's
reasons for that one science and philosophy are quite different subject matters in terms of
content and style you know Bertrand Russell put it simply that science is what we know
philosophy is what we don't know but there's also a pragmatic issue which is that in academia
you're forced to be either a particular kind of scientist say a physicist or a particular
kind of philosopher say a philosopher of science you've managed to do both do you have any opinions
about whether there should be more interdisciplinary work or should that just be left to personal taste
say I think this should be more interdisciplinary work but it's not just a matter of you know
mixing and matching chocolate and peanut butter disciplines and hoping that it tastes good you
know some disciplines have something to offer each other and some don't and some people within
different disciplines would be profited by engagement with others and some would not
the typical physicist who is going about their day writing calculations or collecting data
has zero use for a philosopher okay and likewise most philosophers have zero use for physicists
they're trying you know when you you can't derive ought from is so when you want to think about what
ought is the standard model of particle physics is of no help to you but there are as a matter of fact
questions of overlapping interest so uh Jean Ann Ismael my colleague here at Johns Hopkins she
and I have started up what would be called the natural philosophy forum at Johns Hopkins where
we are trying to bring together scientists and philosophers not just physicists but
chemists biologists mathematicians computer scientists cognitive scientists who have
interests that do overlap in philosophy and what I think is that the organization of academia
and you know that you have humanities and then you have sciences right and there are barriers
to stepping outside of that zone when if you've ever sat in on a hiring committee meeting for a
physics faculty you know how incredibly clearly the lines are drawn between this is what we consider
physics and this is not and what that means is you could do really really good work but it's not
quite inside the corral then you're not going to be considered for a job in that particular place
and certain kinds of work you're not going to be considered for a job anywhere even though it's
really really good if you're a senior person who's already famous and made huge contributions then
you can leap disciplinary boundaries very readily but if you're a young person who is
still fighting just to get a job to get grant money to get students and so forth it makes your
life much much harder if you don't fit comfortably into a single discipline so what we're trying to
do is to make a safe space for people who are physicists computer scientists like I said economists
whatever who do care about the philosophical foundations of their work and for the philosophers
who really want to make sure that they're engaging with the best of modern science when they construct
their philosophical positions I think this is an underserved area right now so it's not just
cool and interdisciplinary it is in particular a place where there's lots of progress that is
potential potentially waiting to be made in the near term and so we're hoping to make it easier to
make some of that progress oh that's that's great that's great to hear anyways okay let's let's
finally get to our main topic of discussion today which is that of the many worlds interpretation
of quantum mechanics you're one of the most I guess visible champions of the theory you've
given lots of talks about it you've written a book about it something deeply hidden and I'm
I'm personally excited to talk about the subject with you speaking for myself you know I've taken
quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in my studies but the foundations of quantum mechanics
isn't really something that ever comes up in a traditional physicist education right right I
mean I don't I don't know of how I would have ever come across many worlds in my own professional
life that's something you kind of have to find on your own so to speak and uh yeah I'm curious
actually how you got interested in it before we dive in and and yeah well maybe just give an outline
of your thoughts and and how you got interested I have to I have to be careful because I could
tell a half hour long story here okay sure okay but you know I I learned quantum mechanics the
completely conventional way solving the Schrodinger equation uh solving differential equations with
boundary values and special functions and all those things no no special questions arose in my
mind about the foundations etc um I was also interested in philosophy even as an undergraduate
but not foundations of physics I didn't know that was part of philosophy no one told me that right
my education was pretty scattershot in many ways um so I didn't directly become interested in many
worlds for a long time I was interested in cosmology in the big bang and when you are a theoretical
cosmologist with any interest in quantum mechanics it is overwhelmingly likely that you will be uh
sympathetic to many worlds almost everyone is you know Stephen Hawking Stephen Weinberg all of
these all these people um Jim Hartle and so forth so and and because it was you know this is an
amusing little anecdote but when Hugh Everett who was the one who invented many worlds in its
current form in the 1950s as a graduate student why did he invent it well John Wheeler who was a
famous physicist who was his advisor gave him the thesis dissertation topic quantized gravity
in the 1950s we didn't realize that was hard so and he didn't make any progress on quantizing
gravity but what he realized Everett was that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics
back then the Copenhagen interpretation assumed that you could separate the observer from the
quantum system and you treated the observer as classical and you treated the system as quantum
mechanical and ever realized that if your quantum system was the whole universe you couldn't do that
so you needed a way to do quantum mechanics that didn't rely on a separation into observer and
system and that's how he ended up inventing many worlds and even though that story is not very well
known to working physicists the sort of the same thing happens in the mind of people who care about
quantum mechanics and cosmology so all of those people including myself tend to be Everettians
but it wasn't until I don't know what year it was but more like 2010 or something like that
that I actually started working on Everettian quantum mechanics at a research level that's because
Charles Siemens who at the time was a graduate student spent the summer at Caltech where I was
and we thought we were going to work together on the arrow of time he was a philosophy
graduate student but we ended up working together on quantum mechanics and he started he came and
he explained to me why Everett couldn't be right and we sat down and really started thinking about
his objections and we ended up arguing that Everett could very well be right after all so
that's how I got into it and that's how I started realizing that there were a lot of
potential ways to make progress in physics if you took this point of view seriously.
Okay great thanks for that background why don't we just dive in and start maybe going to the white
board I thought I'd just start writing a outline and we'll see how that goes but yeah let's go
ahead and get started so I guess maybe the first thing we can do is well let's review the
the well the measurement problem right that's that's sort of like the central problem in
foundations of quantum mechanics how do we understand measurement and the
the sort of the default paradigm the one that's taught in textbooks is the Copenhagen
interpretation and I guess we should sort of review that and maybe state some of the problems with it
and then after that review we can dive right into the many worlds interpretation
and here I guess that's where we'll spend most of our time
talking and we'll go both into the technical and philosophical aspects because I think
there's a lot of well rich philosophical things to consider and we'll see how how far down that
rabbit hole will go um maybe if there's time we'll see maybe we'll talk a little bit about
Bohmian mechanics and how that relates to many worlds because you uh you wrote about it in your
book um and I just maybe well thought maybe that'd be a chance to explore or deeply and then I know
you mentioned maybe we if we have time we could also talk about emergent space time and I gather
that's maybe uh something that's worth talking because I think in all these discussions it's
sort of like personal taste which interpretation you like but I gather with many worlds if you can
kind of get something else out of it then there's a stronger case for it right and I guess emergent
space time is one of those things yeah no I think that's exactly right okay great all right so why
don't we uh go ahead uh I'll I'll let you be in the driver's seat now I think you're right I think
it makes sense to start by you can call it the Copenhagen interpretation but I like I like to
call it the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics because nobody agrees on what the
quantum about what the Copenhagen interpretation is okay you start saying that and it's like
free will and you just get into definitional arguments and it becomes pretty boring but
there is something we teach people in textbooks when we teach them quantum mechanics and so I think
that's worth uh letting people know about so let's call it xbook qm and it comes that you are taught
rules and the rules come in two parts and you're going to tell me how technical I can be how technical
can I be that's but aesthetically as you watch now we've talked about category theory and the
standard model on my podcast so you aesthetically as you are okay so there is a rule that says that
quantum states in quantum mechanics are wave functions you know psi of x but really that's
not right I mean psi of x is a complex valued function of x but that's for a particular case
where you have a particle with position x like maybe you don't have a particle maybe you have a
quantum field or a spacetime or something more complicated so really what you have is a vector
and you write it with this funny notation invented by paul dirac and so this is the state vector
that's an element of hilbert space and that's just a fancy way of saying
the vector space of all the quantum states okay nothing nothing different about that there's an
inner product and things like that and you can be specific about it but it's just the space of
quantum states and there's an equation which is the schrodinger equation and the schrodinger
equation tells you how states evolve in time and it says that there is an operator the hamiltonian
h that operates on the states and that gives you i square root of minus one times the derivative
with respect to time of the state maybe just one interjection here so I guess when people
what you first wrote here right this psi of x when people first learn about quantum mechanics
they've had training in classical mechanics and they think of psi of x to say having to do with
say the probability density of finding where a particle is but in general it's more helpful
to think about this abstract Hilbert space where you didn't write psi of x because say
in things like quantum computing you're just interested in sort of there the Hilbert space
has a different interpretation you're thinking about qubits so so the most general form of thinking
about quantum mechanics is this Hilbert space and that's why we can just write psi without say psi
of x anyways I just thought I'd make that comment yeah I think so I mean there's actually it's a lot
of things to be said about what psi is and whether it's real and things like that but
honestly the only thing even if the listeners here are not very technically inclined but
nevertheless are still listening the only thing I'm trying to get across with these two rules are
there are states and there's an equation that say how the states evolve okay that's that's
what we have so far and what is crucially important here is that this is exactly parallel
to classical mechanics in classical mechanics we have states we have positions and velocities
and we have some equations that tell us how they evolve okay whether it's newton's laws or
hamilton's equations there's different equivalent ways of doing it and so the first parts of quantum
mechanics don't look any different than good old classical mechanics and we wouldn't be
taken aback by this like this isn't weird to us this is what we know how to do it like you know
when we went from particles to waves that was you know we need to adjust our idea what a state was
what equations we actually used but the basic paradigm of there are states and they evolved
with time remained intact okay so quantum mechanics starts this way but then it adds more rules
and all the new rules that do not have any parallel in classical mechanics have to do with the outcomes
of measurements so when you make a measurement different people have different versions of
these rules so you know forgive me if they don't line up with your favorite version but it's the
same basic thing when you make a measurement you don't see the wave function you can't just
measure the wave function you can't just measure the quantum state again this is a hundred percent
different than any classical theory in classical theory you never use the word measurement there's
just the states because implicitly you can measure whatever you want about the states that is not
true okay in quantum mechanics there are certain observables certain measurable quantities so upon
measurement wave functions collapse
and it collapses onto some particular measurement outcome so if you measure the position of a
particle you describe the particle before the measurement with this wave function psi of x
but when you observe the position you see x you don't see psi of x you see that it has a position
and what is the relationship between psi of x and x that is given by the born rule
which says that the probability of measuring x is psi of x squared or there is a more
general form for the more general kinds of Hilbert space etc but the point is that
you're not predicting the outcome deterministically you're only predicting the probability of getting
different outcomes so you talk about psi of x the quantum wave function that's the shape of
the electron orbital if you're a chemist that's the wave function okay it has some physical
tangibility apparently but when you measure it you don't see it you see a position a particle
there in a position and you can't predict exactly what position you're going to see it in
you can only predict the probability of getting it so these new rules on the right hand side here
they have no analog in classical mechanics and they deal specifically with measurements and that's
basically what we teach our students and we tell them in textbooks maybe let me just supplement
what you wrote here with one maybe point of clarification when you wrote psi collapses to
outcome let me just contrast that with this born rule that you wrote which was more in this sort
of continuous setting so what also typically happens is that your wave function psi is really
say a superposition of different outcomes i'll just call them i so i is just this base of all
outcomes i'm writing this as now a discrete superposition and when you do this measurement
then it collapses onto one of you know some particular i i'll call it i prime so this is
the collapse right and then the probability that you will collapse onto this i prime state
in this case i'm running a little running out of space here but this p of x will be
c of i prime or sorry p of i prime will be c of i prime square that coefficient square so that's
that's sort of a discrete analog of what you just wrote there what you wrote there was i guess
maybe position space let's say res what i wrote down below is sort of a more general setting
yeah that's right and that will actually does this fact it's a good fact that you're bringing up
because it will come in later in the following way all physicists learn classical mechanics
before they learn quantum mechanics okay including in history we developed classical mechanics before
we developed quantum mechanics and therefore there is a way that we have of constructing
quantum mechanical theories which is we start with a classical theory and then we quantize it the
word quantize is a verb it makes it sound as if there's some rigorous algorithmic procedure but
there's not there's sort of a set of rules and they're a little vague sometimes but the hope is
that if you have a classical theory you can figure out a or several quantum mechanical theories that
correspond to it in some way but nature doesn't do that nature doesn't start with the classical
theory and quantize it so when you start with a particle that has a position x there's a classical
description of that it moves around newton's laws and then you say oh now i'm going to quantize it
and i have psi of x and i'm going to observe it and i see what x is that language makes you think
that there is something called the position of the particle i mean you put it there in your
equations and you measured it it makes you know why would i deny there's something called the position
of the particle well the answer is until you measured it there was no such thing as the position
of the particle there was only the wave function okay and more generally you can have quantum
mechanical theories that have no classical precursor at all so that's why it's useful to have this
more general setup when you don't sort of presume some classical reality that you're then quantizing
just talk about quantum mechanical theories for their own sake and see what happens i think there
are two big looming obvious problems here one is i didn't tell you what a measurement was
and nobody ever tells you what a measurement is it's not defined that's the measurement problem
the measurement problem is on the one hand the word measurement appears in the rules of quantum
mechanics unlike every other physical theory we've ever invented that's bizarre and number two we
don't tell you what it is there's no rigorous definition of it like on the left hand side there
were math symbols there was Hilbert space there was uh derivatives and the square root of minus one
on the right hand side there's just the word measurement and then you know that feeds into
some other symbols and things like that but it's an ill defined part of the theory like no one in
their right mind could think that this was the correct final theory of the fundamental nature
of reality not because it's wrong just because it's kind of fuzzy and ill defined and the correct
theory of reality shouldn't be like that right so just i don't mean it's probabilistic it's perfectly
okay for the theory to be indeterministic you know einstein famously said god does not play dice
with the universe but he was a very quotable guy einstein and that really wasn't his fundamental
problem he could have lived with the indeterminacy what he couldn't live with was the fuzziness uh
the fact that the the theory was just not well defined so that's the measurement problem and
if you say i just clarified it i really did sorry yeah just clear clear the clarification so i think
when you said the measurement isn't well defined i think i think what i'm wrong i think what you're
saying is that somehow i mean on the one hand mathematically it's well defined in the sense
that it's it's a projection operator but i think what you're alluding to is that um in terms of
making this correspondence between what this mathematical artifice is of a projection with
sign of um maybe i don't know what the right word is but philosophical way of delineating
measurement from everything else um and also the way measurement is typically formulated is that
there's a separation between the quantum part of the system and the classical apparatus i think
that's what you're critiquing as the ill-definedness of the measurement right because from a mathematical
perspective it's just a projection but i think you're you're pointing to something other something
else that's problematic what happens when you do a measurement is perfectly mathematically defined
what a measurement is is not what counts as a measurement like does does a video camera
count as a measurement right does the air in the room count as a measurement
what if i don't have good eyesight you know i look at something does that count as a measurement
and when i'm looking literally with my eyeballs at all of the different atoms in the table in
front of me do they all have wave functions collapsing that's what is not well defined of
course the fact that we treat the measurement or the observer classically that is kind of
a spin-off problem of the fact that the whole measurement process is ill-defined people try
to make it better defined but at the end of the day it's like pornography you know it when you
see it you don't have a definition for it and the problem with that is we're increasingly because
increasingly sophisticated experiments and theories we're moving into a regime where we
don't know it where we see it anymore there are these edge cases we need a better theory for it
okay great that was that was worth clarifying okay so where do we go from here then the other
that's i like to actually highlight two problems one is the measurement problem but the other one
is the reality problem okay i think and i know that in certain circles this is considered charmingly
naive but i think that the job of science is to describe the real world and that there's actually
two statements hidden in there one is i think there is a real world and number two i think it
is science's job to describe it okay uh so it is not clear from these rules of quantum mechanics
whether there is a real world and if so what it is it is clear that we need to talk about wave
functions to get the right predictions out of quantum mechanics but is that wave function supposed
to actually represent reality or is it just the tools it's just a black box we use to make predictions
and it's only the experimental outcomes that really represent reality so both of these are worrisome
in some sense although what you just what you just said there actually isn't unique to
quantum mechanics per se right i mean there's like is a field a real object or is it just a
mathematical artifice i mean you could kind of say that about almost any any or i don't know about
any but many many things of theoretical physics i think you can't fields are real objects i think
most of these questions are very easy okay all right well i okay uh okay i i don't want to go
to that rap at all but you know the whole uh you know newton with uh you know action at a distance
and okay now you say there's a field and you know you can what level of granularity you
want in terms of what's real and what's not good no but but to be a little bit more clear about
this it's a different kind of problem you you can absolutely have ambiguities in classical physics
for example about how you describe reality in the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics
you have phase space you have positions you have momenta and then you have differential equations
that help you evolve the system through time in the lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics
you don't talk about momenta you talk about the action and it's an integral over trajectories
and you minimize the action and your vocabulary for describing what happens is completely different
so you are allowed if it makes you happy to argue about which is real and which is not okay
but they're equivalent they're absolutely mathematically equivalent ways of describing
the same thing so the underlying physical substrate is real and we know what that is
in quantum mechanics we don't agree on what the underlying physical stuff is we don't agree on
any description of it i mean some people think that they have the right answer but
they don't agree with other people who think they have the right answer so that's the reality
problem it's it is a different level of problem in quantum mechanics than in classical got it i i see
okay that makes sense so for example uh cybex like i said it could be the whole world or it could
just be a way of predicting experimental outcomes and there are respectable physicists who believe
either one of those you know this is a legitimate disagreement this is why as i said when we talk
about the natural philosophy form there's a lot of good problems out there that need this kind of
interdisciplinary engagement here you go when you talk about the nature of reality here's a that's
a philosophy question but here is an example where it's staring you in the face in a physics context
and although this has been implicit in what we've been saying but i'll say it out loud
physicists have been ignoring this question for many decades now in the 1920s it was taken very
very seriously in einstein and schrodinger who were against the conventional Copenhagen
interpretation they wanted to hold up uh that problem they wanted to emphasize it hadn't been
solved yet but the whole field moved against them and decided nope nope i'm not listening la la la
everything is solved put it in the textbooks and let's move on and that's been the story uh since
the mid 1930s okay i am let's see this i think this might be a good transition to many worlds
because as i think we discussed previously one of the issues with measurement and the ontology of
all this setup is what what is the nature of measurement and and observation and and in the
textbook formulation they're treated very asymmetrically without a very clear distinction
between the two and in many worlds somehow um you know one of the reasons you're a proponent of many
worlds is it's very uh parsimonious in that sense it's just it's just a wave function and then
everything is subsumed by that right so we should go yeah the good news here is that i can tell you
what the many worlds interpretation says without starting a new slide so here is many worlds and
i'm doing it in red and the entirety of the many worlds interpretation consists of crossing this out
so Everett says you should have stopped after you had written down the two sensible rules of
quantum mechanics the ones that say that there are states in Hilbert space and they evolved
during the Schrodinger equation he says what if you just take that seriously and that means
among other things including observers as part of the wave function right as part of the quantum
description of reality and not having any particular specialness to measurement or
observation at all surely in terms of the well-posedness and rigor of the underlying rules
that's a better formulation of quantum mechanics the question is does it fit the data does it
actually explain what you observe so i mean let me say it in words and then you can tell me whether
or not we should draw pictures or draw equations for it um the thing about quantum mechanics and
the wave function is you have this superposition of many possible measurement outcomes at the same
time so when you say psi of x what you're really saying is that x1 x2 x3 all the different possible
x's have a probability of being observed psi of that x squared and until you make that measurement
they don't yet quite become real there's a hidden feature of quantum mechanics that is not obvious
from what we wrote here which is that different quantum systems do not have separate wave functions
there is only one wave function only one quantum state for the entirety of all the systems that
you want to think about at the same time Everett's original name for his theory was the theory of the
universal wave function and this feature of quantum mechanics comes directly from einstein it was
einstein in 1935 in the famous epr paper einstein padolski and rosin who said you know the following
thing so imagine i have a particle like i don't know here's a pion a neutral pion about that
making us look like we know some particle physics so the neutral pion is unstable it's going to
decay it doesn't last forever and it can decay into different things but for example it can decay
into two photons for example okay but if the pion is just sitting there it's not doing anything
then it's in its rest frame right there's no preferred direction of space or anything like
that so when it decays you can use the Schrodinger equation and you can predict what it will decay
into and what you see is it's two photons that it decays into and both of them are sort of moving
out in a cloud so there's some kind of photon one cloud photons are called gamma for historical
reasons and then there's another cloud i'll give it a different color here's photon two okay gamma
two the point is the prediction is each particle has a wave function that is moving out in a
spherical pattern away from the pion but as we said you never observe these big spherical wave
functions you observe particles have a position so you predict a probability of seeing photon one
coming out at a certain angle photon two coming out at a certain angle etc and both of the photons
could come out at absolutely any angle so you don't know what you're going to see but imagine that
you do measure photon one so here's photon one going out in some direction and you've measured it
you've looked at it and you see it there it is momentum is conserved right so now you instantly
know even though you haven't measured it what is the direction in which photon two would be seen
to be moving it's moving in the opposite direction because the total momentum has to be conserved
and you started with zero total momentum okay so you see it right there the question is the
question from Einstein Podolsky and Rosen is how does it know how does photon two know
what direction to be moving it okay and the answer is that you don't have a wave function for you might
think you have a wave function psi one of photon one and a wave function psi two of photon two and
they're just separate completely separate independent things but that's not right that was wrong
you have a single wave function of both the position of x one and the position of x two
and they are correlated with each other so that if you see photon one going in any one direction
you know that photon two is going in the other direction okay and what worried Einstein about
this is that you could do that detection light years away so this it seemed like the two photons
are communicating to each other faster than light and Einstein who had invented relativity he was
personally insulted by the idea that the photons are communicating faster than light so he worried
about locality and realism he was trying to argue that in quantum mechanics you cannot both have a
local theory with no spooky action at a distance and have a realistic theory where there's really
things going on in the physical world and that was his work yeah so this is actually yeah just
maybe just to clarify a bit because I remember watching your a bit of your biggest ideas where
you talk about this setup I think there you were trying to draw an analogy between long range
correlations where in the typical EPR setup it has to do with measuring spins or at least for the
setup in say Bell's paper studying the bell inequality I think what you were trying to do
was to say actually you can see long range correlations even in classical mechanics because
due to conservation of momentum you know that if you have these two particles going outwards
then merely by conservation of momentum if you know the momentum of one you know the momentum
of the other you're completely correct I'm just trying to cut corners a little bit here just to
get to the fun part of many worlds but you're absolutely correct if there were some fact of
the matter and the Einstein knew this too this was his point this is why the paper was actually
hard and by the way in the EPR paper they didn't use spins they weren't thinking of that way they
used this this is literally oh I see the setup they use bell bell improved it later by talking about
spins it is clear if you talk about spins but anyway the point is sure in classical mechanics
you could say well the two photons move in opposite directions we don't know what direction they move
in but there is some direction they move in and they're opposite okay and that shouldn't bother
you at all the new ingredient in quantum mechanics is you could choose to measure either the position
or the momentum of these outgoing particles and the same fact would be true about the position
and the momentum right if you knew the position of one you would know the position of the other
if you knew the momentum of one you would know the momentum of the other but quantum mechanics says
you can't have simultaneously definite facts about the position and the momentum that's the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle so you can't rely on this classical idea that both the position
and the momentum were fixed ahead of time and we just didn't know what they were and that's
is a whole separate argument for the uncertainty principle but you have to sort of take my word
for it right now right right that's the basic idea that's right you're raising a good point
yeah so it here it has to you know if we go back to this sort of ill-definedness of the
measurement problem if the collapsing mechanism were some kind of physical mechanism say then
this would truly be I guess paradoxical if we believe in locality because somehow the collapsing
of one wave function causes the I don't know what the right verb is but causes the collapse of
the other one and that's problematic yeah okay okay yeah okay okay so whatever it does is he takes
all this big bushel of lemons and he makes lemonade and he says look I'm gonna observe
something let's make it simple let's let's go with a spin okay there's a spin spin up or spin
down spinning clockwise or spinning counterclockwise according to some axis that you picked out and
you know the thing about spin the reason why it's so useful to use even if you're not familiar with
it is there's only two outcomes so you know there's for position and momentum there's an infinite
number of continuum of outcomes spin is either plus or minus that's the only two outcomes it's
literally a bit this is where we get quantum bits or q bits from okay it's a true discreteness there
and so let's imagine that we have a spin it's in a superposition of up spin up and spin down and
we're going to measure it and ever it says you know going along with what we had on the previous
slide we are a quantum mechanical system when you say we're going to measure the spin all you
really mean is that there are some laws of physics that tell you how the observer and the apparatus
etc interacts with the spin we're going to plug those laws of physics into the Schrodinger
equation into what's called the Hamiltonian here which is doing all the work and we're going to
evolve the equation forward in time so before you do the measurement you have a spin
which is in a superposition i'm going to ignore like numerical factors and everything so the spin
is either spin up or spin down although it's actually sorry i shouldn't have said it's either
one of those it is in a superposition of both okay and there's an observer who we say is in the ready
state which means just a fancy way of saying the observer is in whatever state they're in
and they haven't yet measured they haven't yet interacted with the spin okay now in practice
in the real world when we do the measurement like i said we either only ever see it spin up or spin
down with some probability ever it says well look if the spin were a hundred percent up if
there were no part of the spin's wave function that was down then we would want it to be the case
that the observer sees it spin up right that's what would be a good measurement if we knew the
wave function of the spin were a hundred percent down we would want it to be the case that the
observer sees it spin down and the Schrodinger equation for those mathy people in the audience
is linear the wave function only appears once order one on both sides linear equations are
the easiest things in the world you don't need to solve them right you kind of know what the
answer has got to be if when i observe a spin that is a hundred percent up i see spin up and
when i observe a spin is a hundred percent down i see spin down when i observe a superposition
then i must go into a superposition of the system is spin up and the observer saw it up
plus the system is spin down and the observer saw it looking down
this is the prediction of the Schrodinger equation so the point is this is not the controversial part
everyone agrees on what the Schrodinger equation predicts it predicts that the state that you get
by evolving the initial wave function via the Schrodinger equation is an entangled superposition
of the spin was up and the observer saw it up plus the spin was down and the observer saw it down
everyone agrees on that okay but now is when we depart ways because most people will look at this
and they will say that can't be right because i'm an observer i've observed spins before i've never
felt like i was in a superposition of spin up and spin down right having seen spin up and having
seen spin down whenever i've actually looked at spins in the world i always ever see them spin
up or spin down and it's unambiguous and definite i get an outcome i can't predict what one it will
be ahead of time but i get an outcome let's let's just pause here and introduce some terminology
for uh just uh just because i think it'll be good so we had this before and then after so the
process that led from the before to the after right that's called decoherence no it's not sorry
right it's not it's not uh not yet oh sorry that's why i wrote Schrodinger this is just evolution
according to the Schrodinger equation wait i thought decoherence was precisely when you
went from this product state to a non-product state or maybe i'll tell you what decoherence is
ah okay to talk about decoherence we need to admit that we cheated when we wrote this down
because i already told you there's only one wave function for the whole universe
and what i wrote down was a wave function of a spin and an observer so clearly that's wrong
because i ignored the entire rest of the universe okay so i'm going to call the rest of the universe
the environment i'll put it in what we call the just some initial state for the environment
and the environment includes like all the air molecules in this room all the photons in the
world like everything that i'm not keeping track of okay and then what happens is if i have an
a real physical apparatus whether it's a person or a machine or anything like that
and i do this to it the environment is going to interact with that macroscopic thing differently
depending on whether that macroscopic measurement or observer says or sees or indicates i saw the
spin up or i saw the spin down right like if i literally have a dial on a background that
then moves and points to spin up then the photons in the room are hitting the dial in one way
whereas if it moved the other way to spin down different photons are hitting it okay so the
environment also becomes entangled with the spin and with the observer so we have an environment
state that is measuring the spin up in the environment and measuring the spin down in the
environment sorry how are you distinguishing between the observer and the environment in
this setup whatever way i want to it doesn't really matter you see that they have been exactly
parallel in their evolution so the point is that i carve up the world into system observer and
environment okay i think yeah i think right so in in everett's original phd thesis i don't think he
ever uses the environment variable which i think he only has kind of uh system and observer which is
why i sort of maybe jumped the gun a bit when i said uh that was decoherence everett didn't
know about decoherence okay well he had not been invented until 1970 i see okay i was being an
achronistic of course but okay um um so but so by the way that was why everett was kind of a genius
because he kind of saw that it would work but he didn't really have the right explanation
for why it would work so just to very quickly jump ahead and then we can go back and fill in
everett's suggestion is that the reason why you don't feel like you are in a superposition is
because you are not both parts of this quantum state this is a world with a certain observer in it
and this is another world he says this is an interpretive move which you can talk about
philosophically or whatever but the point is that there's not a you that is in a superposition of
observing spin up and spin down there's a version of you that saw spin up and a version of you that
saw spin down and the extra relevance of decoherence is these two parts of the quantum state are
orthogonal to each other so the inner product of the environment spin up with the environment spin
down is zero to a very very very good approximation and that's what guarantees that these two parts
of the wave function will never interfere or interact with each other ever again oh i see they're
orthogonal to each other in hilbert space and so everett sort of made some very fancy arguments
that you are allowed to treat these two different parts of the wave function as separate worlds
post decoherence now that we know about decoherence we can actually just show that you should treat them
as separate worlds i guess if i had just lumped observer and environment as one vector is there
anything to be gained by the i still don't see the gain i get from splitting into two separate
vectors there the o and the e subscript i think i sort of read everett as sort of implicitly doing
that so there's only sort of two tensor products instead of three i'm just wondering do you do
you gain anything by having three instead of two you do it's a practical gains it's a physicist
you know bless your heart ten but you're more of a mathematician so you know you're just looking
at vectors and you know they're orthogonal it's all good but the point is you could imagine
talking taking what we're calling the observer and boiling it down to you know a single qubit
all by itself right just a a qubit in which you have registered whether the original spin is up
or down okay but if that's all you had you could undo the measurement if all you had was a two
state system and a two state observer or maybe a three state observer because there's a ready state
that's a sufficiently small number of degrees of freedom that you can control all of them and you
can reverse the process whereas the environment has more than avogadro's number of photons in it
and so it is impossible to undo the measurement in exactly the same way it's impossible to unscramble
an egg or to unmix cream from coffee it's not because it's literally in principle impossible
it's because it's never going to happen because of the large numbers and the low entropy you started
with and the high entropy you ended up with so there's a physical feature of the environment
namely that it is sort of big and uncontrollable that's what leads to the irreversibility of
this process I see okay so I guess the however you write it the point is that you should think of
this e-vector as having an overwhelmingly more number of degrees of freedom than the rest and
that's okay that's important distinction yeah okay but let's see maybe maybe back to the original
point I was going to make whether you call it decoherence or not the point was that we initially
had basically what's called a product state and so you had basically a system
tensured with everything else and the point is that what has to happen is that with this
Schrodinger evolution now you get this entangled state where you have it's no longer a product
state and that's sort of part of the basic vocabulary of Everett which is that there
there isn't a well-defined state of a subsystem because a subsystem assumes that you can just say
here is my whatever system and then there's everything else but that's that that is a fiction
in this case because now that there are correlations you can't just say what the subsystem is doing
it's doing something in relation to what everything else is doing and so you can't
sort of decouple everything and then once you sort of start thinking in those terms then that's
how sort of the world emerges from that because you have sort of different worlds corresponding
to these sort of different couplings between the subsystem and the environment yeah no that's
right so just to put it at the same point in slightly different terms we raised the two problems
of the measurement problem what is the measurement really and the reality problem what is reality
really and so Everett is a completely 100 percent unambiguous about both of these
reality is represented by a vector in Hilbert space that's what reality is and measurement
is just when a quantum system that's in a superposition becomes entangled with its environment
and as you said in general you're not going to be able to assign individual quantum states to
subsystems of the wave function of the universe sometimes you will sometimes you get lucky
but in general things are going to be entangled with other things and so that is actually a feature
rather than a bug that is saying that there are ways to find structure in the vector that we call
the vector of the quantum state in Hilbert space that we attach to you know different parts of
the world different subsystems and also different branches of the wave function where do we go
from here well so um let's this is so good it's obviously true and I know that you already already
believe it everyone in the audience but nevertheless there are people who doubt it so we could bring
up a couple of the objections so well actually let's let's let's one can define measurement in
terms of these trace operations right and I don't know it might be useful to kind of maybe
take a look at that just to see how when you have a mixture state mixture state like you have here
that sort of the the way that the the partial trace works right so you take a partial trace
over the environment you get this new state of the subsystem that's not a pure state and then
if you sort of look at the way that math works you could kind of see many worlds in that it's
basically becomes a classical ensemble of different worlds and I'm I'm wondering if you think that's
like a worthwhile calculation to kind of look at just to see how this because there's lots of notions
of of probability and superposition floating around and I and and that kind of notion of
many worlds is quite distinct from the kind of superposition of probabilities that involves
complex amplitudes in the quantum mechanical world right so I don't know do you think that's
maybe worth illustrating so let me say some words first and then we can read aside you know I I know
exactly we were talking about I don't usually speak that language because this is uh to me the
difference between physicists and philosophers um there's many different ways to draw that distinction
but one way is physicists are absolutely dedicated to getting the right answer
and you think that's a pretty good thing I'm in favor of getting the right answer you know
like physicists are smart about that but they're so dedicated to it that they're very happy to
get the right answer for the wrong reason whereas philosophers are so dedicated to reasoning and
logic they're a little bit less dedicated to getting the right answer so you know they end up
being anti-natalists or whatever and thinking that all human beings should die but with a really
rigorous argument that follows logically from the premises so that the argument about density
matrices I'll give you a version of it but a simple version of it but it's uh it gets you the right
answer but I don't think it's for the right reasons I think it's it's skipping over the
important physical content there so let me explain let me explain what I mean I'm just
going to once again add a little bit uh to what we've already written so what I'm going to add is
some coefficients we're going to say that there is a complex number alpha in front of spin up
and beta in front of spin down and then those numbers just go along for the ride right and
this is what in conventional quantum mechanics would give us the probability what we want to say
is that the probability of seeing experimentally the spin up is alpha squared so we say p up
is alpha squared and p down is beta squared and of course alpha squared plus beta squared equals one
so you'd better have picked that from the start and so what you can do you know the
calculation that you're alluding to in terms of tracing out the environment and the observer
and looking at the reduced density operator for the system shows that if you do get rid of your
knowledge of the outside world you know that the system is entangled with the outside world but
let's forget that let's think about what we know about the system all by itself well we
find is that it's there's a matrix that describes the state of the system and the matrix has the
properties that its diagonal elements are non-negative numbers that add up to one
and the great thing about non-negative numbers that add up to one is that they obey the axioms
of probability so they look like probabilities of things
so if you're lazy you say therefore they are probabilities of things
that's what they are i'm going to interpret them as probabilities of things
i think that's very much cheating to to do that um there's an when you talk about so there's
there's the famous problem or puzzle for ever readying quantum mechanics which is
deriving the born rule okay because if you go back to our original list of axioms of quantum
mechanics the the Copenhagen approach and many other approaches postulate a probability rule
they postulate as part of the structure of the theory that the measurement outcomes have a probability
of coming true given by the wave function squared that's nowhere to be found in the ever readying
rules the ever readying rules just say there are states and they obey the schrodinger equation
so it is beholden on the ever readying speaking once again about people's responsibilities
ever readyings have an extra task the Copenhagenists don't have they have to derive the born rule
okay right and and you do that in in your book and everett also attempts to do that in his his
paper as well right everett's way of doing it classic case of getting the right answer for
the wrong reasons he absolutely cheated everyone agrees and we we sort of don't talk about that
anymore because again there's an easy the the task of deriving the born rule has an easy part in a
hard part the easy part is why is it the wave function squared rather than the wave function
cubed or the logarithm of the wave function or something like that that's an easy one the answer
is because that's what gives you things that obey the rules of probability the coefficient squared
very naturally are non negative numbers that add up to one that's just what they are so that you
didn't need to work you can work as hard as you want but that's there that's built in it's kind
of obvious it's ultimately Pythagoras's theorem sure yeah and and you want to uh from a mathematician's
point of view you want to preserve the you want to use the Hilbert space structure that's what you
get i mean you could do to the fourth as well and get positive numbers but it wouldn't work as well
with you know having unitary operators and preserve no but the the the norm would not be preserved
under schrodinger revolution if you chose exactly that's that's what i meant yeah exactly yeah so
yeah you want not only numbers that add up to one but to keep adding up to one over time exactly
that's that's what i meant yep so so but so that's the easy part the hard part is why what are those
numbers the probability of in the Copenhagen interpretation we really had the wave function
collapsing in a way that was not compatible with the schrodinger equation it was a different kind
of evolution and there was a is a very frequentist way of thinking about things if you did it a
billion times you would get frequencies that obey the born rules statistics but the actual
evolution is truly and deeply stochastic in Everett there is nothing stochastic about the
evolution it is perfectly deterministic you can't say in Everett i think there is an alpha
squared probability that i will be the person who sees the spin up what you can say with 100
probability is that there will be a future descendant of me to see spin up and there will
be a future descendant of me to see spin down this evolution here from before to after there is no
collapse there's just one part of the way function they're both right the alpha component and the
beta component and and that's uh that's what you get that's right and if you think about it if you
look at that equation you stare at it alpha and beta are just going along for the ride they don't
even affect the evolution i didn't even tell you what they were right but yet i'm supposed to
interpret alpha squared is the probability that experimentally i'm going to see spin up
and beta squared is a probability experimentally i'm going to see spin down i agree that they obey
the axioms of probability but what are they probabilities of that's the the respectable
question yeah and i can tell you the answer i know what the answer is okay tell me i think
everybody's right what really happens in this evolution is that the environment the decoherence
process the environment becoming entangled with the system is much much faster than the human eye can
see it's faster than the human brain can contemplate okay it's faster than the observer can realistically
become aware of what is happening so there's an intermediate step this is the decoherence step
it's still evolving according to the schrodinger equation but it basically sends us to alpha
spin is up observer is still in the ready state observer hasn't changed yet but the environment
has become entangled with spin up and likewise for spin down beta spin is down observer is ready
the environment is entangled okay
this is just a physical reality that we have to learn to deal with and so in that state of affairs
there are according to everett's rules there are now two observers because decoherence has happened
and the branch the wave function is branched in two different possibilities but those two observers
have identical quantum states in particular they each one of those observers is on a branch
but they don't know which branch they're on
so this is what we call self locating uncertainty you know the entire wave function of the universe
and yet you don't know where you are there's something you don't know but it is what philosophers
call indexical uncertainty it is uncertainty about your location in some regime okay and so what do
you do when you have indexical or self locating uncertainty you try your best to be a good basian
and you have some priors so you have some probabilities some credences that once you do
look at the spin and see what it's doing you'll see spin up or you'll see spin down okay and so
how do you assign those credences and there's an argument it's too long to get into right here
but there is an argument that there's a uniquely rational thing to do in this situation and guess
what it's to assign credence alpha squared to being on the branch where the spin is up and credence
beta squared to being on the spin down branch it once once you get that far once you get to
explaining what what the what the self locating uncertainty principle tells you is where the
probabilities come in even though the evolution is deterministic there is a place in the evolution
where you need credences for something and once you have that the math just tells you what the
credences are going to be okay yeah looking at your book I think there were two arguments I don't
know if they're related or not but one was this idea that and sounds very reasonable which is that
in the special case where say alpha and beta have the same norm then you should assign equal
credences to them and then there was some other thing that you alluded to but didn't go into
your book was about if you kind of thought about it from sort of economical terms in terms of
utility and maximizing utility and what a rational agent would do you'd also get the same answer
I'm guessing the latter one is more contentious because you know economics is a contentious field
but but but the the the one where you know sort of you should have uniform priors if you have
uniform coefficients that seems very reasonable and I think I could see how that would lead to this
because if you accept that then in the limit where you say suppose you have alpha and beta
unequal how do you get the alpha squared weight and beta squared weight you can this is a very
sketchy argument but and it was sort of sketched out in your book which is that if you kind of
continue if you think about refining this experiment where you continue splitting over and over so
that things get subdivided and subdivided assuming you could orchestrate it you could sort of
have like basically a refinement such that all coefficients are equal and then if you sort of
work your way backwards you'll see that everything had to have arranged themselves such that you
assigned it alpha squared to one guy and beta squared to the other guy just by sort of if
everything were an equal mesh so to speak they'd all get equal contributions and then the number
of components that contribute to alpha squared is exactly you know the the number of of elements
right I don't know if I made any sense but I I could see why that's you got it exactly right
that is exactly right and and like I said you know spiritually there's no other answer you
could get but that is one way of justifying the answer the the decision theory argument actually
came first it started with David Deutsch and it was quite a clever little argument it was basically
like imagine that when you had different measurement outcomes they made you happy or sad so you
assigned value to getting different measurement outcomes and he said he didn't care whether they
made you happy or sad but once you decide whether they will make you happy or sad and you think that
there is a probability of being happy or sad etc if you want to maximize your utility he was able
to show that you should act as if the probabilities are given by the born rule and David Wallace
later came in and and cleaned up the argument and made extra
strengthening ways to strengthen it and so forth so this argument that I just gave you here is
different but again there's many different ways to get the right answer that we know what the
right answer is the role of self-locating uncertainty was emphasized by Lev Weidman and
Israeli physicist and then Vojcek Zurek who has a different approach and it's not even really many
world's person you know he showed how if you do have these equal amplitudes equal imply equal
probabilities then you can get the whole born rule and so Chip Siemens and I combine these ideas
together to really show how self-locating uncertainty gets you the born rule in exactly the way you
want. Maybe actually one thing that I overlooked when I first looked at Everett's paper you mentioned
it which is that Everett didn't do the right thing in terms of deriving the born rule and
having looked at the literature since then I believe it's because everything he was doing
was basis dependent right and I think that to me that actually isn't maybe one of the
potential overall objections to the many worlds in the sense that let's take a step back for a
second right so we've written everything cleanly in terms of system observer environment and
it's not at all clear to me at least how you make these nice distinctions between
these things and if you're going to start doing computing born rule probabilities
with respect to this decomposition then from a mathematical perspective you run into the issue
of that that decomposition will affect your born rule I believe I believe that's the criticism
whatever its approach right so I know anyways why don't you respond to that yeah I think that I
think the criticism that I have in mind is a different one I mean there are criticisms along
those lines and there are very important questions to think about the criticism I have in mind is
that whatever it does and what subsequent generations did Jim Hartle and Farry Goldstone
and Gutman are examples that I have in mind what they said was the following let's imagine you
kind of are a frequentist let's imagine you want to do experiments an infinite number of times
okay and you take the limit and then you look at the measure on the space of trajectories okay so
there will be some branches where you got spin up every time some branches where you get spin up
with a certain frequency and spin down with a certain frequency and they argue that if you
have exactly the state that we have in front of us that you're doing repeated measurements on
in the limit of an infinite number of measurements the only the set of branches that have the born
rule statistics in other words alpha squared spin ups and beta squared spin downs have measure one
and the whole set of worlds that don't have born rule statistics have measure zero
and they say therefore it is overwhelmingly likely that you will eventually see born rule statistics
the problem is they're cheating because they're sneaking in a identification of a measure with
a probability if we could do that we would have just set it equal to the born rule to start yeah
I'm a little confused because it sounds like you're invoking some kind of law of large numbers
which already assumes a measure maybe that's what you're basically saying yeah it already smells
fishy no but again there is a measure it's the born rule measure that's the measure on the you
know that's that's the metric there's an inner product on Hilbert space the question is when
do you get to interpret it as a probability right and so they they sneak it in for only
things of measure zero but that's still sneaking it in okay that's still making a leap there
and I don't want to make that leap that's that's my most well-known criticism of
Everett's kind of approach I see now what about this thing I mentioned in terms of
sort of the split dependence between system and observer and things depending on on that right
do you have any thoughts on that so that's that is very interesting to me and it is philosophically
very rich terrain to mine I think I think that we we basically see the outline of the answer to that
but there are lots of details remaining to be worked out because look I can just I can forget
about all these spins and whatever like we said and say look I have a vector I call it psi
and it moves around according to this linear equation so it's not even a very interesting
equation just let her goes around some circles that's all it ever does okay I don't see
planets and stars and people and puppies anywhere in there I don't see space you know I don't see
fields I just see a big vector what are you talking about like where does all this
reality the structure of the world come from and more sort of clearly more definitely more more
concretely we did two kinds of decomposition right we said first we could do a tensor product
decomposition of Hilbert space into subsystems spin observer environment and then we can do
a direct sum decomposition into branches right like this branch that branch they're orthogonal
to each other in their environment states and all that stuff who says that those are the right
decompositions to do so in the in the case of the branches this is what is called the pointer
state problem so it's it's most clear when you think about Schrodinger's cat okay you know Schrodinger
had a way of amplifying a two-state quantum superposition to a macroscopic object like a cat
and he he made the cat it being a superposition of alive or dead as a cat person I do the same
thing but with a sleep and awake I just do sleeping gas instead of killing the cat with cyanide
so a cat can be let's say that Schrodinger is right the cat can be in a superposition of awake
and asleep and the point is the thing that Schrodinger was trying to say was not like
isn't quantum mechanics awesome he was trying to say surely you don't believe this he was skeptical
of it this is you know he actually uh said he was kind of regretful he ever had anything to do
with the Schrodinger equation once he knew it was going to be used to calculate probabilities of things
so he says if I'm to take this Copenhagen story at face value when I open the box
the state of the cat changes from superposition of awake and asleep to one or the other
instantly I never see the superposition I only ever see one or the other and that just sounded
wrong to him but the more sophisticated question is why is it that when you open the box the only
states you ever see are an awake cat or in a sleep cat why don't you ever see one over the
square root of two awake plus asleep or one over the square root of two awake minus asleep those
are perfectly good quantum states right and there's an answer to that this is the pointer basis
question why is it that there's a certain very predictable set of quantum states that are always
what we observe in macroscopic systems and the answer is if we observed a cat in a superposition
of two macroscopically different things we would instantly deco here because these macroscopically
different states of the cat would constantly be interacting with their environment
and furthermore once you have a definite macroscopic state once the cat is either awake or asleep
not in a superposition of both then it doesn't keep deco hearing then all the photons just hit
the cat and they either get absorbed or they reflect off and whatever it doesn't matter they
don't treat different parts of the cat's wave function differently they don't become entangled
with the cat so there is a physical reason why certain states are preferred they are the states
that are robust under being monitored by the environment that do not keep getting more and
more entangled so actually uh so i'm not too familiar with the physical processes that you
just described can you repeat again the distinction about uh how we know which macroscopic systems
have or have not decohered or when they when that will happen yes i will draw a picture
sure okay great so we're in a superposition of here is a cat i'm not a good artist but here's a cat
this cat is awake okay and then this cat is asleep
okay all right and we have some photons coming along that's the environment the environment
is everything around us right and the point is that here's a photon that comes along
in the part of the wave function where the cat is awake this photon gets absorbed
when it hits the cat in the part of the wave function where the cat is asleep the photon
just keeps going by so the photons interact differently with the cat in the part of the
wave function where it's awake in the part where it's asleep and it says nothing to do with cats or
awake or asleep or alive or dead it's just when you have a macroscopic system in a in a superposition
of two different positions in space the environment becomes entangled with it when i say the photon
interacts differently with the awake cat and the asleep cat what i mean is the quantum state of the
environment becomes entangled with the cat state okay but then once that happens once i no longer
have the asleep cat once i let's say i'm i branch okay and now i'm in the branch where the cat was
awake right now i can have more photons and they can interact with the cat but they all interact
with the cat in exactly the same way they either bounce off or get absorbed or whatever so they
don't entangle with the cat entanglement is not the same as interaction entanglement is where
different parts of the wave function of one system interact differently with different parts of the
wave function of the other system if the whole wave function interacts in the same way that's not
entanglement that's just interaction so a pointer state is a state that the environment can monitor
all the time without becoming entangled with it and so that those are the states we physically
see in the world that's why physical objects in the macroscopic world look like they have
definite positions in space i see although maybe now this is getting uh this might get
quite philosophical now because uh how to say you just made a claim that uh certain types of states
the the ones that are not entangled with the environment say are the ones we observe that
sounds like some kind of statement about you know consciousness or something of that matter i don't
know um and that also i guess also takes us into i guess one of the let's call it naive objections
to the many worlds which is why don't i perceive the branching how do i make sense of my identity
in this branching world so maybe can you address those those issues uh yeah they absolutely are
philosophical questions so david walis who i mentioned earlier likes to say that the reaction
of philosophers to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics is to say clearly we need
better physics whereas the reaction of physicists is clearly we need better philosophy and that
roughly maps on to people who like bomean mechanics or spontaneous collapse models where
they literally want to change the physical underpinnings the ever ready and say look the
physics is fine we just need to understand what it implies better and so these are absolutely
good questions to raise and the way that i would put it is has nothing to do with consciousness
what it does have to do with is emergence it has to do with the fact that there are patterns
within this wave function or this quantum state that are kind of self-sustaining and
self-describable without knowing all the details in exactly the same way the table in front of me
is an emergent pattern right i know that really it's made of atoms and molecules but
i don't need to know all the atoms and molecules to describe what the table is doing um this
microphone in front of me is also an emergent pattern and we all agree that it makes sense
to talk about the microphone as something separate from the table for various reasons if i push the
microphone the table doesn't move or vice versa right you know they they are part of a description
of the world that has causal efficacy in a way that doesn't require me to know all the details
about what is going on and it turns out that the ever ready in branching is exactly the same
way the reason why branches are well defined the way they are you don't have to do it if you
are Laplace's demon if you knew exactly the state of the universe perfectly you would never need to
talk about branches or anything like that but you wouldn't need to talk about tables and microphones
either because you just know exactly the position of every atom right it is there exists a way of
talking about the universe that is very causally efficacious that requires much less detail than
the full description would that is an emergent description and this is why Wallace's book is
called the emergent multiverse and why there's philosophy to be done here like what exactly
are the conditions under which emergence happens when is it okay are we cheating we worry that we
know the answer we want to get and therefore we're getting it right so we're trying to be as careful
as we can not to get the right answer for the wrong reasons actually let me let me clarify
something you just said because I don't think I understand so you said we don't have to talk about
branching necessarily if we knew everything although I think of the example you just described
as being different in terms of tables and chairs there you know it makes sense that tables and
chairs are emergent concepts because we could I guess describe everything in terms of their
individual atoms whereas in the branching situation that is an actual phenomenon that
happens in the wave equation it's it's not so much about whether we decide to just use that
description it actually happens right so I'm a little I'm a little confused about your how you
relate those those two the only thing that ever happens is that the wave function evolves according
to the Schrodinger equation that's right right in a certain basis it looks like the wave function
branches right why is that the right basis to think about it's the same kind of reason as
why is it sensible to think of a microphone as an object in a table oh I see I see I see what the
emergent is that exactly that splitting between these macroscopic objects right okay and actually
yeah I was trying to think a little bit about this too in terms in terms of
the way many worlds is described because we we like to describe it poetically in terms of okay
there's a branch where say I think this is from your book like where you order pizza or order
Chinese food and that's of course a very macroscopic splitting now let's back up a bit so so we talk
about quantum mechanics it takes its most it's its most visible in the in the microscopic world
where h bar is is large and uncertainty effects actually happen in the macroscopic world it's a
different story we like to say it's because you know h bar is so small and so you don't have to
worry about quantum mechanics when we you know measuring baseballs and things like that so so
my question is how do we go from the splitting of individual electrons in terms of their spin
which is microscopic to talking about the splitting of macroscopic things because sort of a wrong
inference would be just to use an analogy would be to say okay well uh the position of an electron
is uncertain and so since I'm you know an avogadro's number worth of electrons then the uncertainty
of uh of where I am should also be an avogadro's number times h bar so I should be also very uncertain
that's not what we see it's somehow there is a distinction between the macroscopic and microscopic
and the sort of the microscopic uncertainties don't aggregate um and so I'm wondering also in this
sort of if we were to take that analogy to the many worlds case there is uncertainty about
individual spins and I made up of a lot of electrons it's not clear to me that you can go
from that microscopic branching to say oh me as a whole person and all my decisions are going to
branch um yeah how do you how do you think about that sort of emergent macroscopic branching versus
microscopic branching well again the idea of Everett is there is only one wave function for
the whole universe everything really is fundamentally quantum mechanical um when we talk about the
uncertainty on the position of an electron and remember from this perspective there's no such
thing as the position of the electron the uncertainty is just a way that we have of talking about how
localized the wave function is and so it turns out just to answer part of your question macroscopic
objects if I talk about my center of mass coordinate and I plug it into the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle uh remember the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position
to the uncertainty in momentum and momentum and that's a constant right and momentum is mass times
velocity so usually since velocity is how I think about things moving I talk about the uncertainty
of position times uncertainty of velocity goes as one over the mass so heavy objects not only don't
increase their uncertainty they generally have smaller uncertainties than small objects in
things like their center of mass frame but that only tells you the minimum uncertainty it doesn't
tell you why physical objects are localized at all and to do that you need to understand branching
it really is about branching it's a question of when does branching happen and the answer is
when macroscopic objects start to have their wave functions spread out a little bit
they're going to branch because they're going to interact differently with the environment
around them there is a famous example uh the Zurich who I already mentioned uh wrote a fun
article about in physics today um there is a moon of Saturn called Hyperion like many moons of
Saturn is just like a captured asteroid right who knows how long it's been there it's a tiny
little thing it's lumpy it looks like a potato okay and the reason why it's interesting is because
it is sufficiently lumpy that you can show that the way that it tumbles is chaotic i.e. if you only
know its position a little bit and there's some uncertainty in your knowledge of its position
your ability to predict its position a short time later is very very small it will tumble
in some unpredictable way it's kind of like a double pendulum but it's a it's a tumbling
potato instead so much so Zurich points out that even if you knew even if you had localized
the wave function of Hyperion as much as you could within a few tumble cycles it would spread
out all over the place and when you looked at it you wouldn't see a potato you'd see a spread
out fuzzy spherical blob but of course you don't why don't you it's because it's being it's interacting
with sunlight and the cosmic microwave background and all these other parts of the environment
that are decohering it so decoherence really is well let's let's put it this way the environment
really does monitor us and keep us in line if our wave functions begin to spread out a little bit
we branch and rather than actually having a wave function spread out over different positions
we have different branches with a localized version of ourselves on each branch
okay maybe i don't know this is related to the things we talk about but just just another thing
as i sort of tried to internalize this sort of self-branching i i i think one thing that's
hard to come to grips with is you know it's related to the fact that we are composed of many
microscopic things and therefore we are not well defined things it's sort of like the
Siridis paradox when is a pile of sand when does it cease to become a pile of sand as you remove
one grain at a time and likewise you know i could have say one electron on the tip of my thumb
branch i could have maybe a hundred of them a thousand of them at what point am i whatever i
means branching that's one that's like sort of one one question and the second is back to this
pizza and chinese food analogy sort of sort of the the the folk way of interpreting the the many
worlds interpretations that oh you know all all possibilities are are possible and everything
is sort of naively is naively equally probable i'm you know coin flip uh by pizza or by chinese
food of course there's an infinite variety of foods you could order and there there isn't uh
you know there is no uniform probability measure on on an infinite space um how do you think
yeah how do you personally think about sort of some of these macroscopic puzzles but you know
what i just said in terms of the microscopic branching aggregating to sort of macroscopic
things and then sort of how do you really assign weight to all these possibilities when you know
they're not you know uniformly probable yeah you know i think that the answer to the first question
about um when do we qualify something as branching or something like that is approximately as
interesting as the sand pile question you know sure we don't have a definite answer to when you
sand pile when you remove grains of sand who cares when in the real world the sand piles
beg we recognize it a sand pile if there's only a couple grains there we don't and that's the point
in the real world branching can be very vivid and very clear and if it's not then we just don't
care about it that much it is not a rigorous concept it is an emergent higher level approximate
concept and that's okay in exactly the same way that sand piles are okay you can say the same thing
about the table in front of you if i move an atom from it it's still a table right yes but okay
if i kept going it would run out it doesn't matter what point it runs out at the point is that when
it is this is a big table i can talk about it as a big table for the decision making process you
know i i do think like i said when we talk about free will that we are physical systems we obey the
laws of physics you know free will or decision making is not above and beyond the laws of physics
but what that means is that it's not that you make a decision and therefore bring a different
world into existence that's not however it works it might be the different world comes into existence
and on one world it looks like you made one decision on the other world it looks like you
made the other decision but your decision making is parasitic on the world it's not the other way
around you're just obeying the laws of physics there is an interesting physics question embedded
in here which is are there a finite or an infinite number of worlds that's a perfectly reasonable
question we don't know the answer it is plausible either way uh i tend to think there's a finite
number but if there's an infinite number then you just do what you always do when you have
smooth continuous things in math you do calculus you don't talk about the number of worlds between
x and x plus delta x you talk about the measure of worlds between x and x plus delta x and that's
perfectly well defined okay uh great um okay i've asked a lot of questions now i know at some point
you said uh we were going to talk about the objections to the many worlds are there any i
haven't uh raised yet that are still on the table well i think that the one we've talked about the
good ones we talked about the ones i worry about the probability question is a good one
and the structure question is a good one uh you know how do we divide from the mathematical
point of view how do we divide up Hilbert space into subsystems and branches and things like that
i think both these are perfectly good questions that have primarily philosophical implications
like you don't need to understand a lot of new physics to answer them i don't think
you just need to get your reasoning correct to get it right but they're good questions and i think
that uh especially the structure question there's still a lot of room for improvement
the probability question i tend to think that it's just a stubbornness of some people to believe it
or disbelieve it like people who just don't want to believe it or they're gonna the believe it no
matter what and it's hard for them to have a conversation with each other there are a lot of
bad worries about effort and i would almost rather not bring them up because you know why
why bother but you know the the worst version of the argument is you know it's not really a
falsifiable theory because you're positing the existence of all these other worlds which i can't
visit that's a really bad argument because i'm not postulating the existence of all these worlds
that i can't visit what i'm saying is there's a wave function it's an element of Hilbert space
it'll be based the Schrodinger equation i repeat myself because people will keep twisting it but
that is what i'm actually saying the worlds come along for the ride the worlds are there as long
as you believe in Hilbert space you believe in the possibility of all these worlds and as long as
you believe in the Schrodinger equation you believe these worlds will become true in other versions
of quantum mechanics you have to get rid of the world somehow you have to collapse the wave function
and get rid of them right because fortunately for us we we have the slide in front of us where we
can just see on slide four where the basically if you just apply many worlds it's just a consequence
of decoherence so maybe just to try to steal man that bad argument could a person therefore just
shift the buck over to say oh i'm not happy with i don't know let's say decoherence maybe maybe
there that's their objection do you is there do you have anything to to say to that i'm not sure
what their happiness has anything to do with anything what you need to do is propose an
alternative theory and people have done that people have proposed theories where the Schrodinger
equation is not always right where the wave function literally does collapse for example right
and that would not follow the evolution we saw in this um slide and guess what it's testable
you can if you want to falsify everett everett just says the wave function always obeys the
Schrodinger equation all you have to do is find an example of a wave function that is not decohered
not measured or anything like that and it doesn't obey the Schrodinger equation that's a very doable
thing people have been trying to do it they have failed to do it but if they did everett would be
falsified okay um okay any any other uh bad or good objections we uh that's i've given them enough
objections okay okay we mentioned Bohm before i don't know if you want to say anything about
Bohmian mechanics because i think there was an interesting uh there's an interesting analysis
of it which i don't quite fully understand and maybe you can explain which is that um and i believe
it's due to david deutch which is that Bohmian mechanics is somehow many worlds in denial because
it sort of prunes out all these other worlds i don't know if that's maybe too deep but i'm curious
to know your thoughts about that yeah you know look i'm personally not very pro Bohmian in any way
so you really should get a real Bohmian on you know some of them are quite respectable people
i'm not the person to defend the theory but the basic idea is that the motivation is the following
when you do something like the double slit experiment so you send a wave function through
two slits and it interferes interference is a fundamentally wave-like phenomenon right that's
what interferes waves go up and down they interfere with each other sure but then when you measure
the outcome on the screen at the on the other sides of the slits you see a dot it looks like a
particle that is a fundamentally particle-like phenomenon you do not see the wave so Bohm says
following louis de broy by the way who said a very similar thing in the 1920s that's because it's both
there really is a particle and there really is a wave and the way that we would say it in modern
languages there really is the quantum wave function Schrodinger's wave function but there are also
other variables there are particle-like variables okay and i'll tell you why i'm completely unimpressed
by this but then i will tell you a fun story because the story is more interesting than the
than the physics here the reason why i'm impressed is because the world is not made of particles
quantum field theory is a much more these days we know accurate way of thinking about the world
and bohmians still have no good consensus on how quantum field theory is supposed to fit into
their framework bohmian mechanics works very well if you really were in the world of non-relativistic
quantum mechanics circa the 1920s but it doesn't work well for quantum field theory much less
quantum gravity etc people have tried an individual people will say you know they think they know
what's going on but it's just a much less natural fit um here's the story so david bohm was an
interesting character he was a graduate student in the 40s he by all rights uh he was a graduate
student at berkeley his thesis advisor was robert oppenheimer and by all rights he should have worked
on the manhattan project but he was not allowed to work on manhattan project because he was suspected
of being a communist so when oppenheimer went to the institute for grand study after the war
bohm was hired as an assistant professor in princeton's physics department and he was soon
thereafter fired and locked out of his office by the president of princeton because it was the
micarthia era and he was again suspected of communism and he was basically hounded out
of the country he couldn't get a job despite getting letters of recommendation from oppenheimer
and einstein and he ended up moving to brazil okay that's but that's not the that's not the
story the story is for whatever reasons of his own when he was an assistant professor of princeton
he decided to write a textbook on quantum mechanics and he wrote the book and he showed a draft to
einstein and einstein you know in the book back in the 50s you were still thinking even though
like you said when you take quantum mechanics you never think about the foundations in the early
50s they were still thinking a little bit about the foundations right it hadn't completely been
ironed out so he included a discussion of hidden variables of what we would now call bohmian
kinds of theories and in his book bohm says these have been ruled out by a theorem proven by john
von neumann and he cites von neumann's book on quantum mechanics the problem is von neumann's
book was in german it had never been translated and bohm didn't speak german very few american
physicists the time did speak german but einstein spoke german and einstein said yeah i looked up
this proof it doesn't prove that at all and einstein was right einstein was very smart actually
he was a very clever guy he understood all this stuff despite his reputation for you know not
catching on to quantum mechanics and so einstein said look think about this more carefully like
if you don't like it you don't like it but say so for the right reasons and so bone went away and
thought about it and he realized that you could have a hidden variable theory which we now call
bohmian mechanics okay so he wrote it down and the secret was that there is non-locality in it
explicitly so this is why einstein you know as john bell later said the bohmian mechanics solves the
epr puzzle in the way that einstein would have liked least by being explicitly non-local no one
cared so bohm wrote down his theory nobody cared except john bell bell for some reason got interested
in bohmian mechanics and he was kind of embarrassed he didn't tell any of his friends at cern where he
was working at the time but he thought about it a lot and he thought about this non-locality he
he was asking he was wondering you know is this non-locality in bohm's theory necessary or can we
get rid of it can we have a hidden variable theory that is local and uh gets all the predictions
of quantum mechanics and of course he proved that you couldn't that's bell's theorem this is his
famous result bell proved that the predictions of quantum mechanics are going to be different
than the predictions of any purely local realistic theory with definite measurement outcomes
without thing crazy loopholes like super determinism or things like that and so of course we all know
bell's theorem became a big deal people tested it the Nobel prize was given last year for people who
tested bell's inequality bell thought that bohmian mechanics was probably right he thought that we
should at least teach bohmian mechanics in all of our textbooks and when the Nobel prize was given
out the press release said john bell proved mathematically the hidden variable theories are
impossible that is blatantly wrong he was a fan of hidden variable theories he proved that local
hidden variable theories cannot uh agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics so even today
even at the levels of the Nobel prize committee people still don't know enough about the foundations
of quantum mechanics to get these statements exactly right have they have they modified their
their uh whatever my description oh no i doubt it yeah i complain tim modlin complained but they're
not going to listen to us oh that's unfortunate the original question was bohmian in many worlds
would be uh oh right david doge right yeah so look what do it just all do it just saying is i
understand it is the following in ever ready in quantum mechanics reality includes is just described
by the wave function that's the only variable in bohmian mechanics there's two sets of variables
the wave function and these extra particle like variables and and do it says look as long as you
have the wave function there it's going to obey the schrodinger equation it does in bohmian mechanics
the schrodinger equation is unmodified one of the reasons why bohmian mechanics just looks wrong
is because the wave function pushes around the particles but the particles do not push around
the wave function it just seems weird so doge says look you're going to have decoherence you're
going to have branching you're going to have all the worlds that are in everett it's just that
the hidden variables are sort of pointing to one world as special but the other ones are still there
and people could live in them so that's why he says that bohmian mechanics is basically hidden
variables or ever ready in quantum mechanics in denial maybe just to to um make this more explicit
oh i don't want to spend too much time on this but just just to make sure i understand what what
that claim is making i kind of drew the uh the setup of the double slit experiment but if we write
out bohm's equations just at least the shape you don't have to write it out exactly but it's
it's uh it's going to be a partial differential equation
right so where the um let's see where the particles are going to be guided by some
i forget the exact formula but some function of the the wave function and it's going to be a function
of these particles themselves and i think the point is that in the classical double slit experiment
when you think about things in terms of waves there's of course going to be
these uh sort of interference patterns you're going to get but if you had some hidden variables
theories uh with the um with these particles with actual um well-defined trajectories
then i think what the claim that's being made is that say the particle really goes
through uh this slit right here then i think what uh david deutch is basically saying is that even
though the wave function uh lives in uh sort of both um in the world in which the particle goes
the left or the right since in fact the particle only goes through one of them it's sort of like
the wave function uh still has um i guess support on both slits but since the q isn't there then
sort of like you have these ghost wave functions um but only particles that sort of guide the wave
function in in one world so that's that's the sense in which there's all these potential worlds
but since q only goes through one slit then only one of these world is realized and it's extremely
wasteful i'm not sure if i'm saying that quite correctly but that's my interpretation of basically
what he's saying well i think and like i'm not an expert in this because i don't think bomi mechanics
is right but okay uh it's not i don't think it's a matter of being wasteful i think it's a matter
of the rest of the wave function is still there and is part of physical reality so i could call
other branches of it worlds whether or not the cues were there or not
yeah that's right okay um okay maybe let's okay so let's let's move on from bomi mechanics
and um actually i think this might also leave lead into the emergent space time but actually
since you brought up the subject i wanted to ask you again about how to think about many worlds
which was that um we've only talked about quantum mechanics in the hamiltonian formulation but
there's also a lagrangian formulation and that you don't really see that in the course in quantum
mechanics you really only see that in say quantum field theory when you start looking at uh expectation
values of operators and things of that nature um does how does many worlds uh look much different
in that setting or are there any problems in in that setting i mean of course uh you could you
still will have a hilbert space and you can um kind of formally play the same game but are there
any difficulties say i don't think there are any difficulties um the path integral or lagrangian
formulation of quantum mechanics is mathematically identical to the hamiltonian or schrodinger
equation picture of it it's just like the relationship between hamiltonian mechanics
and lagrangian mechanics and classical mechanics there's no difference in predictions or anything
like that there's just different words so it might very well be inspirational or calculationally
useful to think of in one terms or another but there's no physical issue that arises uh from
one picture or another it does by the way get us into where we're going for this final topic here
of immersion spacetime because they didn't quite get to address all of your worries about splitting
up the wave function into subsystems you know we talked about splitting up into branches
which zirak and his friends i think mostly have under control but the original splitting up into
subsystems of system observer environment that's a less well studied question and i think that um
there is the the sort of kind of argument is the same it's a it's a parallel argument where
well what do you want you want an emergent system that you can describe using fewer variables etc etc
that kind of argument still gets you the right way to divide into systems and other systems
but it's trickier and people haven't looked at it as much ashmeet singh and i wrote a paper
audit uh and a couple years ago that we called quantum myriology myriology is the relationship
between holes and parts okay how do you divide up a hole into a part and so the the framework this
is getting back to your to the lyron gene stuff the framework in which we worked was like i've been
talking here uh the schrodinger equation the hamiltonian etc there is a way of thinking about
many worlds that is sort of more in step with a pathogen grow way of thinking which is the
decoherent histories formalism where rather than saying i have a division of the world into system
and environment and i look at decoherence and branching i can have different ways of taking
the evolution of the quantum state and coarse-graining it into uh different things that the wave
function does at different points in time right coarse-graining is just taking a whole bunch
of different possible microscopic behaviors and lumping them together like when we talk about
the table table's a coarse-grained version of all the atoms and so it's more flexible the
the decoherent histories formalism is a little bit more powerful and more flexible i think for
many many purposes it is too powerful like you don't need it you can get by without it and so
people don't study it that much but it's there and it's sort of more in step with this spacetimey
approach of looking at trajectories rather than just looking at states evolving from moment to
moment in time. Actually maybe just one maybe this is too much of an aside but actually one
common i wanted to make that which might be helpful to to listeners is that the path integral
approach looks superficially like a many worlds formulation but it's quite different from the
many worlds of that we've been talking about because those are sort of virtual worlds in the sense
of being a computational artifact but they don't actually exist in any real sense i just thought
i'd maybe throw that out there i don't know how you think about it. Yeah so the way that i would
put it is the following um how many worlds are there is a question we've already asked right
and i have this kind of minimalist approach where i and i've already said it implicitly
if if we don't have decoherence we don't have separate worlds right mathematically i can always
take a vector and decompose it into some of two different vectors that doesn't mean that i can take
a branch of the wave function just decomposing into two different branches and call those two
different worlds if they're identical physical worlds i don't want to do that right i want i
want my physical worlds to be truly different so when i have the double slit experiment like you've
drawn here i don't say that there's a world in which the electron goes through one slit and a
world in which it goes through the other because they can interfere later they're in the same world
it's one electron going through both slits interfering with each other if they had been
measured and decohered they could not interfere anymore so if i don't measure it there's no
different worlds in in my language but i think that people like david deutch speak differently i
think that he would talk about a world in which the electron went through one slit or the other
so there is a little bit of arbitrariness there the path integral formalism of quantum mechanics
which says imagine every possible path where a particle or a field could take from some initial
condition to some final condition and like you said that's a mathematical artifice and i use it
to calculate the probability that i really will observe something ending in a place if it started
some other place and they're not no one is trying to attach reality to all of those paths in the
path integral formulation not even david deutch would do that yeah i think it's it's kind of
unfortunate they you kind of i should take a step back is there maybe this is like not even a
proper question but is there a reason why uh i mean i actually how did phyman even come up with
that analogy of summing over all possible trajectories i mean that has nothing to do with
the many worlds interpretation but nevertheless that was a useful concept to have i'm just curious
if there's any historical relationship between the two or yeah you know i don't know what i know is
sort of like an amusing sort of hand wavy argument that probably phyman didn't use but people use
after the fact to justify it they go look in classical mechanics you can contemplate the
space of all possible paths right and in fact when you do the principle of least action you do
contemplate that space and you say of all these possible paths the particle could take i pick out
one of them as the physically real one the one with the lowest value of the action and you could
say to yourself isn't that a shame to be wasting all those other paths isn't it like just wasteful
to just have all those paths and not do anything with them so to say that a function in this case
the action the action assigned to different paths to say that the function is at a minimum
is to say that it's slowly changing with respect to variations right so the thing about minimum
action paths is that they are very close by in path space to paths that have almost the minimum
action so if you take all of those paths that are near to the classical path and you assign them
a phase right um some complex number of unit modulus so plus one minus one i minus i something
in between e to the i theta as long as that phase is similar they will all constructively
constructively interfere so they will add up together and for very different paths where
the action is changing rapidly then that phase that you assign will generally destructively
interfere and cancel out if the phase itself is the action because the phase is very very
different for very very non classical paths so you might guess that from a wavy point of view
adding up e to the is is a way of using all the paths but at the end of the day giving most of
the weight to the ones near the minimum action yeah i guess maybe in hindsight maybe the way one
could try to retroactively justify this is that really in quantum mechanics there's also an i
in the in the e to the is unlike classical mechanics and you could think of it some overall
paths it's really the superposition principle in the extreme right you're yeah i mean i know that
i know that historically dirac wrote down e to the is for some purpose but it was always vague
what it was supposed to be and fineman literally asked him like what were you doing there and he
goes yeah i'm not sure dirac famously was hard to talk to he wasn't very loquacious so it was
fineman who integrated over all the paths the number e to the is i think though the way that he
talked about it and and derived it was not what was really just like you know like when you drive
calculus for the first time and you divide a curve into like many little small increments and
that's what he did he said it's starting with one moment in time and and integrating forward
to another moment with the ordinary schrodinger equation that is like doing the following integral
i think that was his argument right okay anyway i think that was that was an interesting digression
to clarify certain things quite correct so how did the emergent space time come about yeah i mean
look the good news is we're almost there we almost set everything up already but let me back up a
second to emphasize why ever it matters here because most people don't care most physicists
theoretical physicists even don't really care about what formulation of quantum mechanics you
want to use they all give the same predictions right but as i said different formulations might
inspire or poke you in different directions if you're a bomean or a hidden variables person
or if you're an objective collapse person where you say the wave functions collapse to certain
locations under certain circumstances the formulation of the theory in both cases requires
a specification of what you mean by space time wave functions collapse to certain locations
in space time the variables have certain locations in space time okay ever it doesn't
have space time there it just is a wave function it's just a vector in a really big
hilbert space now you can write it and john wheeler did this you can write psi just like you
write psi of x you can write psi of the geometry of spacetime you can attach a quantum amplitude to
every possible geometry that spacetime can have and you can go on from there to try to
do quantum gravity etc but maybe that's cheating right i mean that's picking a basis you're using
the geometry eigen basis or something like that if you're pure hardcore ever eddian
all you have is a vector in some big vector space and it's exactly the question we were
already asking how do you emerge structure from that abstract vector and we talked about
emerging branches we talked about emerging subsystems right with decoherence and entanglement
and things like that now we're asking how do you emerge space but it's the same kind of thing you
know uh there's a brilliant paper by um kotler runnington and uh no kotler pennington and renard
which said the following thing let's imagine i have a lattice okay so i have a set of points
with spins on them or something like that something very condensed matter of physicsy right like
the eising model like little spins that are interacting with their nearest neighbors okay
i i think i know my favorite way of describing that hilbert space it's just a tensor product of
every one of the hilbert spaces for the individual spins like group them all together by multiplying
them by each other the question is can you go backwards can you start from one giant vector
and say oh yeah i should think about that as a lattice of spins okay well what do you have to
work with like what what what do you have to get a handle on and the answer is the hamiltonian so
now we're we're very late there's only the hardcore listener still listening so i'm going to be a
little bit more technical oh sure of course if that's okay yeah right please so you have the
schrodinger equation which says h psi equals i d by dt psi and psi is an element of some
vector space the Hilbert space okay that's all you have that's the entire theory so in particular
i didn't say that psi is a wave function of anything of space of spins of fields or whatever
it's just a vector it's just all vectors are created equal this is a very high dimensional
version of a vector pointing in some direction in other words there's no preferred basis there's
no preferred representation for this vector except there is one because we have this equation the
schrodinger equation and that has a hamiltonian in it so we can diagonalize the hamiltonian
so we can find a basis in which the hamiltonian looks diagonal and in fact that's just the energy
eigen basis so that means that h n equals the energy for state n times n these are eigen states
of that operator and then the diagonal form of the hamiltonian its elements are just the energy
eigen values so e 1 e 2 e 3 dot dot dot and then zeros okay so when you say and at least in the
context of a finite dimensional Hilbert space when you say here i'm giving you a theory a quantum
mechanical model what is the data what is the information you have to give me and the answer
is the energy eigen values this is called the spectrum of the hamiltonian just the list of
energy eigen values and that's it so the idea here is that you should the reverse engineering
question that you're asking yourself is can you start with nothing but this list of energy eigen
values and say what that physically represents oh yes that's a two-dimensionalizing model right
or a three-dimensionalizing model or it's it's the standard model of particle physics or whatever
so in particular if it's finite dimensional can i find a decomposition of Hilbert space
here's Hilbert space can i write it as a big old tensor product over small Hilbert spaces
where i have a lattice with nearest neighbor interactions oops i don't know what i was thinking
there okay so you have a big lattice small lattice whatever but each one of these little factors
is an h alpha can you do that is there a way to decompose Hilbert space into something that looks
like a graph that that forms a nice two-dimensional lattice or whatever it is a 20-dimensional lattice
whatever and so Kotler Pennington and Bernard proved yes they proved that for a generic spectrum
there's no way of writing the Hilbert space decomposing it into a local form
when there is a local form it is essentially unique you can find it you can reconstruct it
just from the energy eigen value let me just say something like just how i'm thinking about this
very naively if you if you had this temper if you had this tensor decomposition that would
also imply some decomposition in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues so
is it already obvious that you for a generic Hamiltonian you can't have the structure just
because if you did have that structure then basically the eigenvalues of the composite system
would be the you know the tensor products of the eigenvalues of the individual system so
so if you just give me a random list of numbers i'm just not going to have that decomposition
exactly the general rule of thumb here is that nothing here is generic everything here requires
very very special features for the Hamiltonian okay okay so but that's okay like the world has a
very non-generic Hamiltonian sure sure why does it have a non-generic Hamiltonian we don't know
but it does and so the only question we're asking here is if the Hamiltonian
does secretly represent some local physics some notion of space can we find it from just the
energy eigenvectors and their answer is yes i see you know let me let me just take a slightly
different perspective because i think it's related when i was looking into this it reminds me of a
certain viewpoint in mathematics which algebraic geometers like to use which is understanding
geometry from algebra so what you can do is instead of a space think of a space as the
fundamental thing and thinking of the functions on that space as being derived from it you start
with an algebra of quote-unquote functions and then you could think of the points of the spaces
probing that algebra functions because if you have an algebra functions a point gives you a
function on that space which is to the evaluation at that point right so so that's how sort of
algebra can lead to geometry and i and that's sort of maybe an analogy of what's going on here you
have a an algebra given by operators on a Hilbert space and by looking at the spectrum which is
some algebraic data you want to recover geometry so i think they're kind of analogous in that sense
yeah no i think it is very true like this this story that i'm telling you and then just to just
to mention we can do we can go one step beyond this and rather than just looking at Hilbert space
we can actually look at certain special states rather than just Hilbert space specific states
low energy states and we can talk about the geometry of this emergent space so what color
it all did was tell us how to get immersion space but my collaborators and i charles sound sparrows
michalakis are able to do is put a geometry on that space using quantum entanglement but what
i was trying to get to was uh the fact that all of this is brand shiny new and speculative and
could be completely wrong but there also could be much better ways of doing it you know like
this is analogous to what einstein and bohr were doing with uh the photoelectric effect and the bohr
atom long before real formulations of quantum mechanics came along this is very tentative
primitive stuff and i'm sure that it so either it's wrong or there are better ways to do it
those are the two options and so i think there could be a lot of fun math in looking for better
ways to do it so i'm sorry so how do how does this relate to many worlds good many worlds
forces you to ask this question because in other formulations of quantum mechanics you just put
spacetime in by hand many worlds all you have is a vector in hilbert space and you have to ask
how does spacetime emerge ah okay and oh i see so you're you're trying to you're trying to make uh
many worlds even more parsimonious by not starting with the hilbert space attached to some space you're
just saying if i really want to be a hardcore minimalist start with the shortage equation
can i get spacetime from it exactly now by the way spacetime we're a little bit different
i'm letting time be fundamental there it is in the Schrodinger equation um maybe you shouldn't
okay but look one thing at a time right now letting time be fundamental that's right yeah i was
looking to this there's also uh related to this versions in which time can also be immersion
where now that's the whole thing the whole chapter and something deeply hidden so yeah
yeah um yeah right where now you have the analogous to uh apparatuses and observers you now have
vectors corresponding to clocks and they can get entangled and right right right okay so the takeaway
is that um it seems to me that if you want to just um have this ever-readying philosophy
all that is is the Hilbert space and the Schrodinger equation you can push that to its limit
because of this uh research program of going from say the Hamiltonian to a space
yeah that's the goal is to i mean again very primitive and we have a long way to go the
goal is to start with the spectrum of a Hamiltonian at the end of the day say oh look it's
three-dimensional space plus time with the standard model particle physics plus general
relativity any final thoughts on let's see um yeah just this whole subject matter i mean it's very
it's very obviously provocative um i guess they're actually what what percent okay i guess it's
the field has evolved a bit what um in terms of many worlds being uh more mainstream what how
would you say in terms of uh the percentages of people that are in favor of many worlds of
course that's maybe a misleading or not right way to measure things because as we just discussed
the Nobel Prize committee described the uh the virtues of the bell experiment incorrectly so
some majority uh uh decision might not be the best metric but what would you say is the uh
where people lie on on this statistically speaking yeah it's it's an almost impossible
question to answer um most physicists don't care they do not have a favorite interpretation of
quantum mechanics and they get along just fine um the ones who do care the favorite interpretations
will vary wildly depending on their sub-discipline so particle physics gravity cosmology people are
strongly ever-edient people in quantum information theory are often epistemic they just talk about
the predictions and don't talk about reality so they're instrumentalists in some way uh people
in philosophy of science tend to be either hidden variables or objective collapse people all of these
are very rough over simplifications but you can't just say like what do most people believe because
you have to depend a lot on how you draw your boundaries around most people uh actually interesting
in in in terms of the philosophers favoring hidden variables is that so they're okay with
say uh giving up locality yeah yeah look uh tim modlin who is one of the leaders here will say
one spell wrote down his theorem we knew the world wasn't local why are you still fretting
about this ah I see I see and and by the way what I would say I have an idiosyncratic take on this
you know I have all my takes and all my takes are of course correct but I try to at least distinguish
between the ones that everyone else agrees with and those that are idiosyncratic so
is many worlds local or not there are plenty of people including David Wallace for example who
will say that one of the virtues of many worlds is that it is local in a sense right um Bell's
theorem says that you cannot have a local theory that is realistic that is you know not just instrumentalist
but realist that reproduces quantum mechanics if it gives definite measurement outcomes and many
worlds as you don't get definite measurement outcomes you get different measurement outcomes
in different branches okay so that's the loophole so Wallace will say you can just be local what I
would say is the whole worry is backwards I think the starting point is a vector in Hilbert space
and when you say the word locality you mean local in space like we just said a generic Hamiltonian
acting on a vector in Hilbert space doesn't even let you have a notion of locality much less insist
upon it so to me the question is not well Bell taught us that there is non-locality going on
how are we going to deal with it to me the question is quantum mechanics teaches us that
locality is just not fundamental why is it such a good approximation that's the question why does
the world look even a little bit local yeah actually I think there's one thing we maybe
overlooked in this setup which is that there's quantum mechanics and their special relativity
those are a priori distinct fields of study and in quantum field theory we merged them but we
first of all didn't have to and second of all there are Hamiltonians that won't respect
locality or causality right so I think that that's what you're you're you're pointing at well you
know there's locality and there's locality it depends on exactly what you mean I've been
assuming special relativity all along because it's it's pretty good even Newtonian physics is local
in a sense in the sense that you can write down differential equations that are local in space or
you can write down an action and the action is an integral over space time it's not an integral
over many different copies of space time separately interacting with each other so
the the role of locality in non-relativistic theories is much more difficult to get precise
because there's no speed of light barrier and if you do move the earth its gravitational field
changes instantaneously through the universe but still it's obeying a local differential
equation so it depends on what you want to emphasize okay well great thank you so much
for your time Sean this is in a very fascinating discussion I hope this will enable people to
get some technical substance behind many worlds because I think my impression is that most of
the discussions of many worlds is going to be at the level of kind of words and philosophy and maybe
some technical discussion but not to the level that we have gone through so so yeah I'm I hope
this will be valuable for people to see yeah I hope so you know you're absolutely right whenever
we talk about science at a general level we always translate things into words and the translations
are always a little bit imprecise and you know so just a little bit of equations can go a long way
and never it is definitely a situation where once you see the equations once you get it it
doesn't mean that you're going to accept the theory but you see why people might think this is an
interesting way to go great well thank you so much for your time Sean
