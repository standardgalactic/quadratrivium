1. **Middle Convolution & Rank Change**: The middle convolution operation in the context of rigid local systems, as described by Catherine Conlon, starts with a rank two local system and results in a local system of rank n-2, where n is the number of points on the base curve. This is different from the behavior in CATS where the rank decreases by one. In the case of the Penelope six equation, this operation effectively does nothing to the rank because it starts at two and ends at two after the convolution.

2. **Okamoto Transform**: For the Penelope six equation, the middle convolution corresponds to the Okamoto transform, which is a famous symmetry of the equation. The Okamoto transform maintains the rank but changes the monodromy from infinite (or risky dense monotromy) to a finite and more manageable form.

3. **Rigid Tuples & Rigid Triples**: There's also an extension of middle convolution to rigid tuples, which was developed to help realize certain groups as Galois groups using the concept of rigidity. This was particularly significant around 20 years ago with work by Michael Detweiler and others. It allowed for the construction of rigid triples to obtain rigid tuples with more elements, facilitating the study of finite groups by linking them to problems in algebraic geometry through the lens of rigid cohomology.

4. **References**: For those interested in learning more about middle convolution and its applications, the papers by Andrew Obus, Catherine Conlon, Kenny C.W. Detwiler, Jonathan W.S. Wang, and others, as well as Katz's book "Rigid Cohomology and the Geometry of Moduli Space," are recommended resources.

5. **Upcoming Talk**: The next talk in the series will be by Andrew Obus on December 12th.
