Hey everybody today I'm going to be showing you how to shine light directly through solid objects using the laws of quantum mechanics.
Now the particle theory of light introduced by Descartes and also taught by Newton was that light always moves in a straight line
because light is actually made out of tiny little particles and those particles just like any other particle can only move straight from where they're shot out of.
So basically the reason you can't see me when I move this basketball in front of my face is because there's light coming off of my face
the camera's directly in front of my face so the only way that the light can get from my face to the camera is in a straight line
and so if I move the basketball in front of my face the basketball has to block that light
and so there's no way that you can see my face because the basketball is blocking it and that is the particle theory of light
but it turns out that's not exactly true we do know that light is made out of particle like things called photons
but it turns out that these photons don't always behave like particles they also have some wave-like nature
and in that case that means that these particles aren't always going to move in a straight line.
Now these particles of light called photons have wave-like properties but what is it that's actually waving?
If you have one photon how can it also be a wave?
Well nothing is actually waving in the photon what it actually means is that in between the light coming off from my face
and getting measured in the camera the particle behaves like a probability only
meaning that we only have a certain probability of discovering that photon somewhere else in space.
Now obviously the highest probability of finding a photon is usually directly in front of where it got shot out of
so that's why in most cases when I hold this basketball up in front of my face you don't see me
because we have the highest probability of blocking the photons when we have a ball directly in front of where they're being shot out of
but here's where things get weird according to the wave-like nature of light
the highest probability of the location that I can find a photon coming from my face
when I hold this basketball up in front of my face is directly in the center of the basketball
so that may sound weird what I'm telling you is that you should be able to see me directly at the center of this basketball
you should be able to see my face through it
but why don't you see me?
Well it turns out it's only true for things that are very smooth
so for example let me grab a smoother ball like this metallic sphere here
so if I hold this metallic sphere up in front of my face
I'm telling you that according to the wave-like nature of the light
you should be able to see directly through this ball into my face when I hold it between me and the camera
but still you don't see me for some reason
now this should just sound absurd at this point
I'm telling you that light should go directly through the center of any sphere
no matter what it's made of, made of solid steel or anything
light should just go directly through it and come out the other end
but I've just shown you two examples of you not being able to see light coming through a ball
but why not? Does it mean that light doesn't actually have wave nature?
Well no, the reason is because this ball is just too big
because according to the mathematics of it the larger the sphere
the smaller the probability of finding a photon directly in that path at the center of it
so let's just get a smaller ball and see what we can see
so now I have a tiny little ball and we can use a light source like my face or even a flashlight
but now the light source is bigger than the ball itself
so we're gonna have to get a smaller light source
so in order to get this to actually work what you would need is a point source of light
and you can simulate a point source of light by using a laser pointer
so I'm going to be using my laser pointer and shining it on the back wall here
and then I'm going to be putting a small sphere in between here
but it turns out that that tiny little dot of the laser pointer on the back wall there
is still smaller than my sphere
so I need to spread out the light a little bit to get that to be a larger area of light on my back wall here
and I'm going to do that just by using a lens
so to spread out the light you can use a magnifying glass
but I have just a smaller lens here with a higher power
so I'm just going to use this lens here to spread out my laser light
so that it appears larger on my back wall here
for example here's how big it gets now
so we're shining it back here
now we have a large point on my back wall
so all it's done is spread out the area of light here
so I have my laser on the table there
now all I need to do is place a small ball directly in its path
and that's exactly what this is
so I just have a magnetic sphere hanging on a metal wire here
and this is going to be directly in the path of the laser
so now we're just going to look at the shadow of the ball on the back wall here
now if all goes right we should see that the shadow that this ball forms on the back wall
the very center of it will be the brightest part
now let's see if this actually works
okay let's turn on my laser
okay I have a big spot on the back wall there
now let's get my sphere directly in the path
okay it's now shining on the ball
and we can see the shadow back there
let's go get a closer look at the shadow
okay here we go
here's the shadow
now look directly at the center of the shadow
you can see the brightest point of that shadow
is directly in the center
isn't that so weird?
so that point right there is actually called Poisson's spot
and the reason it's called Poisson's spot is because Poisson was a scientist
who didn't actually believe in the wave-like nature of light
he thought it was only made out of particles
and so he mockingly said that if it were actually made out of waves
according to the math that would mean that if you had a perfectly spherical object
then directly in the center of it would be the brightest part of the shadow
and it turns out that that's actually true
but it's kind of a difficult experiment to set up
because in order to do it you have to have a very spherical object
and you have to have a point source of light like a laser
so the question is what does it look like if you're directly in the center of this sphere here
so now to show you something even cooler
the center of the ball is where it's brightest
but I've cut a hole out of it so that it's shining to the back
that's the center of that ball there
so that's the center of the shadow right here
so now if we look through this hole in the back
you can see that you see the laser light up there
and there's no ball blocking it whatsoever
so basically at the center of the shadow
is where it appears that there's no ball in front of the laser at all
that's crazy
so basically it's as though the light is coming directly through it
so what actually happens is as the light comes from behind the sphere
the entire circumference of the sphere now acts like it has a bunch of point sources around it
and so as the light hits all of those point sources
they all constructively interfere directly in the center of it
so you can see when you add up all the waves of the individual point sources around the sphere
that at the direct center is the place where you have the highest amplitude
meaning the most likelihood to find a photon where all the waves add up together
so in this graphic here you can see how when light hits a spherical surface like this
that those waves can actually constructively interfere
so that the center becomes the brightest point
now it turns out that you can talk about Poisson's spot without even mentioning the particle nature of light
but the reason I mentioned the particle nature of light
because in general it's incomplete to call light either waves or particles
you kind of have to talk about both of them all the time
now in this experiment light wasn't actually going through the object
what was happening is that that object was causing a change in the wave properties of that light
such that it caused constructive interference of the light
or it caused the probabilistic wave-like nature of light
to constructively interfere directly at the center such that we had a higher probability of finding photons there
so we kind of didn't bend the light but we bent its wave properties
so that it went around it and we could still see what was behind the sphere
so in a way the light was able to go through it without actually going through it
so
