Checking Young Researchers of Quantum Gravity/An Introduction to Celestial Holography and the flat space limit of AdS⧸CFT - Leonardo P. de Gioia.txt
1. **Table one plus infinity in celestial holography**: The analysis at tree level for the table one plus infinity has been done focusing on positive helicity graphs and considering only half of the currents due to the choice of either taking a holomorphic or anti-holomorphic limit. There are subtleties related to these limits, which are also connected to the helicities of the particles under consideration. Loop corrections have not been worked out yet in this framework, but it is known that in self-dual gravity, W1 plus infinity remains uncorrected.

2. **Benefits of using celestial holography**: Unlike ADS-RFT, which deals with asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, celestial holography is concerned with asymptotically flat spacetimes, which are more relevant for real-world scenarios. ADS-RFT is particularly useful for studying conformal field theories and learning about quantum gravity in a simpler context, but celestial holography expands the scope to include more physically realistic settings.

3. **Reconstructing gravitational bulk spacetime from a celestial CFT**: In ADS-RFT, there is a well-known procedure called HRT (Harlow-Ruv-Takayanagi) bulk reconstruction that allows one to reconstruct the bulk geometry from the boundary theory. However, in celestial holography, this problem has not been addressed yet. It's an important and open question in celestial holography because the principle of holography suggests that the bulk theory should be encodable in some way in the boundary theory.

After addressing these points, the conversation was set to continue with questions from the audience, which would likely delve deeper into the specifics of celestial holography and its applications or challenges.

Checking Young Researchers of Quantum Gravity/Basic Twistor Theory, Bi-twistors, and Split-octonions - Roger Penrose.txt
1. Roger Penrose discussed the challenge of unifying quantum mechanics with gravity, which is not straightforward because the two theories seem to be fundamentally incompatible.
   
2. He presented an argument about how to incorporate gravity into quantum mechanics in a room-sized experiment, highlighting two different approaches:
   - Treating gravity as another field within the Hamiltonian, which is the conventional approach.
   - Using coordinates that follow free fall, leading to a slightly different vacuum state (the vacuum of free fall).

3. Penrose emphasized that the difference between these two approaches becomes significant when considering varying gravitational fields, particularly in systems where an object is placed in a superposition of being at two locations.

4. He pointed out that in the presence of gravity, there is an inherent uncertainty in the energy of the system, which leads to a finite lifetime for the superposition state—a manifestation of the Heisenberg energy-time uncertainty principle.

5. Penrose suggested that the "wave function collapse" might be a gravitational phenomenon, and he believes that immediate experimental or theoretical efforts should focus on how gravity affects quantum mechanics at scales that can be directly observed.

6. He acknowledged that the effects of quantum gravity are significant only at extremely small scales (like Planck scale) or in extreme cosmological contexts like the early universe, which are not directly observable with current technology.

7. The discussion touches upon the practical implications of quantum gravity, such as the behavior of black holes and the fate of a black hole as it evaporates via Hawking radiation.

8. Penrose's argument is that the effects of gravity on quantum mechanics are more immediately relevant to observable physics than the other way around, at least for now.

In conclusion, Penrose's seminar highlighted the complexities of unifying quantum mechanics with gravity and emphasized the importance of understanding how gravity affects quantum phenomena at macroscopic scales. He posits that resolving this could shed light on the wave function collapse, which is a central problem in quantum mechanics.

Checking Young Researchers of Quantum Gravity/Effective Spin foam models for quantum gravity - Seth Kurankyi Asante.txt
 Seth presented a semiclassical analysis of effective spin models in the context of resolving some of the issues in classical gravity, particularly addressing the flatness problem. These models are based on discrete reaction-diffusion systems with weak constraints that allow for an implementation of classical equations of motion for gravity. The advantage of these models is their simplicity, which makes them computationally efficient and allows for a broader acceptable range of values for gamma, especially when gamma is small, which is favorable for the continuum limit of the theory.

Seth's approach uses effective spin formulas inspired by spin models in statistical mechanics but with an eye towards capturing aspects of gravity. These models can be described within both flat (Riemannian) and curved (Laurentian) spacetime geometries, allowing for a broader range of applications and tests of various long-standing open issues in the field.

The outlook includes further exploring the continuum limits of these theories to assess their stability and to investigate the diffeomorphism invariance, which is crucial for understanding area variables that are central to the model. These models also have potential applications in cosmology and could provide a well-defined framework for studying Laurentian models using Picard-Lipschitz theory if one cannot directly approach the Euclidean continuum.

In summary, Seth's work offers a novel approach to addressing fundamental problems in gravity through effective spin models that are both computationally manageable and potentially rich in phenomenological implications, especially when considering area variables as fundamental degrees of freedom.
