 In this discussion, Mike discusses the blurring lines between humans, robots, and artificial intelligence, emphasizing that traditional distinctions may not hold up as technology advances. He highlights that concepts like cancer in humans do not directly translate to robots, as their biological nature inherently includes diseases like cancer, whereas artificial systems operate differently. Mike also touches upon the lack of intrinsic motivation in AI, contrasting it with living organisms that have clear motivations and desires due to their biological makeup.

Mike brings up the idea of info taxes, a concept where biological entities are constantly seeking information to update their representations of themselves and the world, akin to the philosopher Daniel Dennett's ideas. He raises interesting questions about motivation in artificial agents, asking if an algorithm that causes an agent to perform an action truly represents the agent having a care or preference.

The conversation delves into the implications of hybrid biological-artificial systems, where human brain cells cultured with machine learning might exhibit some form of intrinsic caring or preferences. Mike suggests that these chimeric constructions challenge our understanding of consciousness and agency, necessitating new concepts to address how human qualities might manifest in such hybrids.

Mike concludes by acknowledging the rapid pace of change in technology and the difficulty in predicting where these advancements will lead us. He expresses enthusiasm for the brave new cyborg future that is emerging, encouraging listeners to embrace the unpredictable journey ahead. The discussion underscores the importance of evolving our understanding of life, intelligence, and consciousness as we integrate more deeply with technology.
