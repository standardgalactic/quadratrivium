Checking Graduate Mathematics/Edward Witten - Super Riemann Surfaces Revisited [2013].txt
1. **Question on Periods and Super-Remon Surfaces**: The question asked if, given a compact algebraic variety and periods of a holomorphic differential (a great model in the one form), one would expect to get more or less numbers when considering integrals over superamon surfaces. The answer is that you likely have the same numbers because you can reduce from super geometry to ordinary geometry at the cost of introducing poles. Super-remon surfaces can be defined locally by super-conformal mappings, as described by Freedan in the 1985 Santa Barbara proceedings.

2. **Super-Remon Surfaces and Normal Bundle**: The normal bundle to the reduced space from a super-remon surface is H1 with values in T^1/2. There are interesting later papers in the physics literature that explore this further, but the local definition of super-remon surfaces given by Freedan is equivalent to the algebraic geometric definition.

3. **Reference for Further Information**: The speaker mentioned that they could recommend interesting conditions on super geometry in higher dimensions or discuss super-gravity in higher dimensions, but their passion for super-remon surfaces overshadowed those points. They also noted that there would be a coffee break and an opportunity to get tickets for the banquet.

4. **Coffee Break Announcement**: During the session, attendees were reminded that there was no need to purchase tickets for the banquet; everyone could simply come and get their ticket if they hadn't done so already. The break provided an opportunity for attendees to network, discuss the talks, and refresh themselves before the next session.

Checking Graduate Mathematics/Nonetheless one should learn the language of topos： Grothendieck... - Colin McLarty [2018].txt
1. **Vase Formulation and Homology Theory**: In a discussion about the vase formulation and its connection to homology theory, Alexander Grothendieck highlights that the positivity of certain traces can be expressed in terms of intersection multiplicities. This is a core aspect of his work, which can be related to the positivity of certain cycles. However, he notes that proving that this check will always work is necessary for it to count as a proof, and such a proof must be complete.

2. **SGA-7**: Grothendieck mentions that Illuzzi told him that the most essential use was made of SGA-7. This suggests that SGA-7 played a crucial role in his work. However, he also expresses that he had no impression that a proof by the standard conjectures was close at hand, indicating that these conjectures were not easily accessible or proven at the time.

3. **Topoi and Universal Algebra**: In a previous seminar, Grothendieck had been thinking about topos theory and universal algebra, which are connected to his recent talks. He is open to discussing these topics further if they come up in conversation.

4. **Contribution to Mathematics**: Grothendieck describes the ensemble of two consecutive seminars (SGR-4 and SGR-5) as developing from nothing the powerful instrument of topos theory and its perfect application in étale chronology. He considers this his most profound and innovative contribution to mathematics at a purely mathematical level, emphasizing that it's a language worth learning for its practical utility.

5. **Foundations vs. Applications**: Grothendieck compares his approach to constructing houses ready to live in, as opposed to focusing solely on foundational issues. He values the SGA as a foundation that should be so well-established that users of the theory do not need to understand its intricacies to apply its results effectively.

In summary, Grothendieck's work is deeply connected to homology theory and intersection multiplicities, with a strong emphasis on the practical applications of his mathematical instruments, such as topos theory. He values the foundations but ultimately wants these to be so solid that their application can be straightforward and accessible to mathematicians without deep knowledge of the foundational work itself.
