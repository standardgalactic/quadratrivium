So this is on the second part of our seminar.
We did it throughout the year.
So please go ahead.
Thank you.
Now one of my friends.
Oh,
Yeah.
Yes, I mean that they write in the call to me.
This is my father.
So I don't know so why is it not a whatever my audio.
You say this thing is a camera.
Yeah, yeah, but they will be that kind of.
Yeah.
So.
But it's a little bit of a product.
You see a lot in the company later.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, so, because, so if it was just that left or sorry, right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, so if you have your rank one hundred bundle, it is a, it is a buy a
model, but it only has an inner product structure on the right.
And here we're asking for a CFS inner product on the left, so it's an additional condition.
And that would imply that the vector bundle that you get has to be a line.
Because if it wasn't the line bundle, then it would not have.
This way, you want K of gamma B to be C of X.
That only happens at the is a rank one vector model rather than a general.
Otherwise, I mean, it has right and then K of gamma B is the sessions of some locally trivial
or X with five or the end by end matrices.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, we see that's a better one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For sure.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Sorry, don't get fired.
Let's, let's, let's.
Right.
Yeah, that's a big one.
There was a red seven.
It was a seven.
I mean,
I don't know.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Okay.
So what I was trying to say is that this kind of objects are actually
critical.
Because.
You will get.
I don't know.
You briefly explained.
So I understand.
I didn't think.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
No, no.
Sorry.
No, no.
I wasn't talking about.
Yes.
Can you briefly explain to understand how to get the land by the
part, but how do we pull.
Out of the.
Out of the.
In other words,
even if you just stick with that.
That is not true.
We'll get that.
I think.
In Tellan,
And then they said they can do other coolness that we do in the map.
Awesome work.
Who asked that?
There's a room up in Paradise.
How to build a map for a machete?
Let's see that.
Maybe you could add a little bit.
Yeah, if you look at this,
you can see the map.
Okay.
Okay.
So now let's look at the problem to this.
Yeah.
Okay.
Because I thought that correspondence is normally, you know,
not the corporate module on both sides.
In this case, to do.
Yes.
This is what I think that you have a nice battle.
My modules are examples of correspondence, but not the other way around.
So if the random was not one, you wouldn't get a, if I'm not,
but if the random is one, you get a left in the front and the right in the front.
You have a left in the front and the right in the front.
You already have a right and left action on the ground object.
You always have a right and left action.
You have a right, CX in the front.
And it's a land map.
You will have also a left CX in the front.
So we'll have a five on this action.
Okay.
Most general case.
You get the, and you go to the, just be,
you have all the party.
It's a good thing that we might get to just a report.
But it's going to be done back.
Okay.
The battle, the master.
You have only one person.
You always get along.
No, you don't know.
You don't know.
Well,
you have a,
you have a quite a while.
We always have a trivial one line.
But those are kind of two separate pieces of data that are combined by those
can be arbitrary.
Right.
You have to have H star of B, I suppose it should be, you'll pull back of B by H, I suppose it should be.
Yeah, doing that is what you want to do. That is the reason why you want something that is full and will be done.
I just wanted to explain the reason why you want something that is full and will be done.
So, sorry, are you going to have to know about that? Please note that.
You know, my friends are content at the same time by a factor of two, and I'm just wondering what the purpose of the treatment is.
So, if you really have to talk about the gala, why can't you just talk about it?
Why do you have a bimodule? Yes.
Any way.
You can correspond this actually to the cross-pond of the bimodule just by the other side.
But this is more general.
So, I'll satisfy the UCP.
So, you'll just have to satisfy the UCP.
Okay, for the bus to UCP.
Yeah.
That's part of this.
Okay, so the idea was this.
I wanted to show that this thing will come up to the author.
That was the idea.
That's where the CX by volume must be of this form.
I don't need to know.
So, if it's full.
So, here, when I say full, then this problem, but with the right thing, I thought it's going to be that.
So, if it's full, then full, then full, then full, then full, then full, then full, then full.
So, there's no we there.
What's the B?
What is the B?
Well, for the right hand side, I agree.
Okay, here.
This is the one part that corresponds.
It's the one of this correspondence.
So, where the gamma B is the, this is a good description.
And the thing is, this is the general part of it.
So, here, I have a gamma B that was the start of one detection of the bottom bound.
You're too low to report you.
Where are you going to go?
So,
So, what I'm saying is that the last option on the silver screen is this.
So, I am looking at the property of the consumer that corresponds to this.
Well, I was trying to say that they are a lot of them.
Okay.
So, there are a lot of this object because for example, we will include all the cross problem.
This is not an arbitrary question for the sequence of the corresponding.
Well, here, I would say, well, in this meeting,
that is what we think in the name of a chain.
So,
because I am trying to say something.
So, it would be clear.
So,
this is simple, you can go here.
And this can show that it's equivalent.
So,
So, this was part of this.
But then showing that this is equivalent to a property.
The proposition is this part.
This thing is always cool.
So,
I was saying what the meaning of this.
And what the means being.
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
So,
