Checking SuperScript/Intuition for the p-adic metric.txt
1. **Piatic Numbers and Metric**: Piatic numbers are an extension of rational numbers, introduced by the mathematician E.J. Straus. They are defined using a base-p system where each digit can be a non-zero remainder from the division of the previous digit by p (analogous to how decimals work with base 10). The piatic metric, which measures the "size" of a piatic number, is given by 1/p^k, where k is the number of times the base p appears in the prime factorization of the piatic number.

2. **Intuition Behind Piatic Metric**: The piatic metric can be understood by comparing it to the concept of determining the size of a real number by counting the number of zeros after the decimal point. This analogy is useful because Ostrowski's theorem states that for rational numbers, there are only two non-trivial distance metrics: the absolute value metric (used for real numbers) and another metric defined by Straus for piatic numbers. Both metrics must be compatible with the set of rational numbers.

3. **Rational Numbers and Metrics**: The piatic metric is not arbitrary but a natural extension of the distance concept to the set of piatic numbers, which includes the rational numbers. Any metric applied to rational numbers must also apply to piatics since they encompass rationals.

4. **Further Exploration**: The video briefly mentioned that additional examples and a more detailed exploration of what defines a metric (and how it applies to piatic numbers) would be covered in bonus footage. This would include demonstrating how the sum of powers of two can approach negative one within the piatic system.

In summary, the piatic metric provides a way to measure the "size" of piatic numbers, with the understanding that this metric is one of the few non-trivial distance metrics compatible with rational numbers and extends naturally to the piatic system. The intuition behind this metric helps to solidify the concept of piatic numbers as a legitimate mathematical construct.
