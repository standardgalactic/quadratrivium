Checking FOMUS 2016/NaÃ¯ve Type Theory by Thorsten Altenkirch (University of Nottingham, UK).txt
1. **Propositional Truncation**: This is an operation in type theory that constructs a new type from an existing one by "forgetting" some of its elements and ensuring that the remaining elements behave like a set in the context of type theory.

2. **Pi Types (Function Types)**: These are types representing functions, where given a type `A` and a type `B`, the Pi type `P (x : A) -> B` represents the type of functions from `A` to `B`.

3. **Sigma Types (Sum Types or Coproducts)**: These are types that represent disjoint unions or sums of types, where given types `A` and `B`, the Sigma type `P (x : A) + Q (x : B)` represents the type of values tagged with either `A` or `B`.

4. **Inductive Types**: These are types that are built up from base cases and recursive steps, allowing for the construction of complex algebraic structures like natural numbers, lists, trees, etc., within type theory.

5. **Equality Types**: These represent the type of proofs or justifications that one term is equal to another within the context of type theory, providing a framework for reasoning about equality.

6. **Universes**: These are levels of abstraction within type theory that allow for the construction of types of types, types of types of types, and so on, addressing the need for hierarchy in the types we can define.

7. **Constructivism**: Type theory is inherently constructive, meaning that it emphasizes the construction of objects rather than asserting their existence abstractly. Evidence is required for truth, and propositions are represented as types that include this evidence.

8. **Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)**: This is an extension of type theory that incorporates ideas from homotopy theory, allowing for the modeling of homotopical concepts such as weak omega group weights using Caen complexes. It provides a powerful framework for constructing and reasoning about mathematical structures.

9. **Higher Inductive Types (HITs)**: These are an extension of inductive types that allow for the generation of types together with equalities, offering even more expressiveness and power within type theory.

10. **Univalence**: This is a principle in type theory that ensures that types behave well under homotopy equivalences, allowing for unification of proofs across different but equivalent types.

The talk concluded with a mention of the ongoing work in this area, including the author's efforts to write a book that encapsulates these concepts and their applications, particularly in the realm of synthetic homotopy theory.
