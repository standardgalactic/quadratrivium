Checking Quantum Information Society/Locality of Quantum Theory and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect.txt
1. **Hilbert Space and Operator Algebra**: In the context of quantum mechanics, Hilbert spaces represent the state space for quantum systems in the Schrodinger picture, where states are represented by vectors. Operators, on the other hand, can be thought of as transformations or observables acting on these state vectors. In the Heisenberg picture, the focus is on the evolution of operators rather than state vectors, which can be more convenient for certain types of calculations.

2. **Isomer Picture**: This is an alternative representation in quantum mechanics where you don't explicitly use Hilbert spaces. Instead, you work with operators directly and their relationships, which can sometimes simplify certain mathematical structures, especially when dealing with representations that are problematic or when looking for a more local approach to quantum theory.

3. **Local vs Global Representations**: The Schrodinger picture is often globally defined on a Hilbert space, while the Heisenberg picture (and by extension, the Isomer picture) can be more locally focused, dealing with operators and their commutation relations without the need for a global state vector.

4. **Quantum Theory Without Deadwoods**: There's a paper by DRock where he suggests that certain issues in quantum field theory might disappear if one adopts the Isomer picture, which could potentially offer a way to deal with representation problems without resorting to Hilbert spaces.

5. **Causal Sets Theory**: Nicholas Petropoulos mentioned causal sets theory, which is an attempt to build a theory of quantum gravity where spacetime is discrete and points are connected by relations that impose causality and locality. This approach raises the question of whether locality and causality could emerge from more fundamental principles rather than being fundamental aspects of physics themselves.

6. **Final Thoughts**: The talk was well-received, and Kara enjoyed the interactive and engaging nature of the society's event. Nicholas Petropoulos provided thought-provoking questions that sparked further discussion on locality, causality, and representation in quantum mechanics.

7. **Closing Remarks**: The webinar was concluded with a reminder to follow Kara's research on social media, and the hosts encouraged everyone to enjoy their evening and engage with science enthusiastically.

Checking Quantum Information Society/Quantum Simulations And The Difficulty of Solving Many-Body Problems.txt
1. **Quantum Complexity**: Nikita brought up the point that there might exist problems in BQP (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial time) that are also in NP (Nondetermistic Polynomial time), which seems to contradict the deterministic nature of physics as we understand it. However, Peter clarified that factoring, a well-known problem in NP but not in P (Polynomial time), is an example of a problem that is solvable by a quantum computer (BQP) more efficiently than by a classical computer. He also mentioned that while there are problems in NP within BQP, we currently believe that there are no NP-complete or NP-hard problems in BQP.

2. **Quantum Computing for SMEs**: Peter expressed uncertainty about the near future applicability of quantum computing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). He mentioned that quantum computers could be useful for simulation, product development, and optimization, particularly for solving combinatorial problems like those in optimization. However, he highlighted that a scalable quantum computer is necessary, and such devices are not yet available. Therefore, while there is hope and interest in using the first generations of quantum computers for these purposes, it's too early to say definitively which specific SME applications will be viable.

3. **Tensor Network Libraries**: Peter recommended TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) from Google and libraries from the Flatiron Institute as excellent choices for implementing tensor network-based research work. He acknowledged that there might be other good libraries but emphasized the optimization and performance of these two specific ones.

In summary, while quantum computing holds great promise for solving certain types of problems more efficiently than classical computers, practical applications for SMEs in the near future are still uncertain, and the field of tensor networks has robust and optimized libraries available for researchers to use.
