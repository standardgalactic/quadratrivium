Checking Natural Philosophers/Alastair Wilson on Quantum Modal Realism.txt
 Alison Bishop discussed various topics during her conversation, including the applicability of mathematics in physics, the metaphysical implications of quantum theory, and the importance of considering our world-bound events as appropriate focal points for ethical considerations. She emphasized that as world-bound creatures, it is natural for us to focus on events within our own world, advocating for a global solidarity ethic.

Alison's current research project, which she has been working on for 19 years and is the culmination of her work from her undergraduate days, deals with explanatory directionality in physics. She is leading a team at the University of Birmingham, funded by the EU, to explore non-causal and metaphysical explanations in physics. This project aims to understand where explanatory directionality comes from within fundamental physics.

She also highlighted that discussions in philosophy of physics today often involve quantum gravity due to its impact on nearly every aspect of the field. She mentioned that large-scale facts about the universe are a significant area of research, which will likely gain more attention as gravitational wave astronomy develops.

Alison expressed her interest in the intersection of quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and information theory, noting that Katie Roberts is currently working on this topic. She concluded by reiterating the importance of the question of the applicability of mathematics, which she views as the greatest metaphysical problem, and encouraged exploring topics that bear on this question, including anthropological considerations and connections to computation and statistical physics.

In closing, Alison's work and research interests revolve around understanding the nature of explanations in physics, the implications of quantum theory for metaphysics, and the profound question of why and how mathematics applies to the physical world.
