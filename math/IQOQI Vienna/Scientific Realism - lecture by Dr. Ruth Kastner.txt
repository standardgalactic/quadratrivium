So I am very happy to have you here and I hope that you allow another, yet another
interpretation today.
Thank you. Let me just find out if there is any amplification or any ... Can you hear
OK.
So, I guess, the way I'd like to proceed today is spend the first 50 minutes or so giving
a little PowerPoint overview of what I'm going to talk about today.
That overview is necessarily, I think, going to possibly leave you a little, you know, scratching
your heads about some aspects or another.
It's going to kind of be a quick little overview of certain things.
And then we'll have a little break.
And then in the second part, I will go into some more detail on some of the features of
the introductory PowerPoint in a little more depth.
What I'd also like to do is, you know, encourage people to raise your hand if I'm presenting
something and you feel really lost or you have a question, and, you know, I'm happy
to kind of take a minute to address those as they arise since we have a lot of time
and we can kind of relax and straighten any confusions out.
Many times, you know, there are, as a philosopher, I've become aware of how semantics and term
definitions are a huge issue in communicating ideas.
And in fact, my mother, who's a math educator, she's still, she's about 85 now and has about
20 times the energy I will ever have.
One of her, one of the things she has noticed in teaching math is communication and having
a common reference frame for the terminology we're using, and I mean, it may sound like
a silly point, but it actually is crucial.
So if I'm sitting, you know, there are going to be many terms like measurement, absorber,
emitter, atom, you know, things like this that we all have our own ideas about what these
mean, and they may serve as catch points for understanding.
So anytime something like that comes up, you know, and you're not getting it, please
let me know.
I should also, you know, again, thank the organizers for inviting me.
It's a very generous invitation, and I'm really excited to be here.
This is my first time in Vienna, and I guess I should possibly tell a silly joke that you've
probably all heard, but what is a person who, what do you call a person who speaks
three languages, and the answer is trialing, or maybe Dutch, I don't know.
OK, and what is a person who speaks two languages, bilingual, and what do you call a person
who speaks one language, American?
So I apologize for that, and I speak a little French, but that doesn't help here.
So, you know, it's just really exciting for me to be here, and in fact, the other
thing I've learned as, I've done a lot of online teaching in philosophy, where you're
dealing with a lot of writing intensive projects, and a lot of grading, and I have found that
in the US we have many students who are learning English as a second language, and my big problem
is Americans who need to learn English as a first language, so it's not a good situation.
So anyway, let's just proceed with going through this overview.
So basically what I'm going to introduce is, I'm going to talk about the transactional
interpretation, which was originally developed by John Kramer in the 1980s.
What I've done with the, the basic transactional interpretation is I've extended it to the
relativistic domain, so I'm going to be talking about that today.
The transactional interpretation is a kind of a collapse interpretation, and what many
of you have been exposed to in a collapse interpretation are theories, such as the GRW
theory, the Gerard E. V. Weber explicit collapse theory, which uses a modification, a nonlinear
modification of the Schrodinger equation to effect a kind of collapse, and they have
several variants of that.
This is not anything like that, okay?
It's not, we're not doing anything to the basic theory, we're not changing the transactional
interpretation.
It doesn't change the basic quantum theory.
But what it does that's different, crucially different from the basic quantum theory, is
that it uses a different model of the way fields behave.
In a sense, you can, the question is, is TI just an interpretation, or is it actually
a different theory, and that in itself is an interesting question, because certainly
at the nonrelativistic level, it is basically an interpretation, it doesn't do anything
different to the basic theory.
However, arguably at the relativistic level, since the transactional picture uses a different
theory of fields, it uses a different theory of the way fields behave, in a sense you
can say, if you want to be particular about it, that it's a different theory.
However, it is empirically equivalent to the standard theory of fields, and therefore
to standard quantum mechanics.
So it's important to kind of keep that in mind as we proceed, that you may wonder, well,
if I'm going to be claiming to solve the measurement problem, which I am claiming to do, which nowadays
if you say that, people think you must be a crack part.
But so, obviously we cannot do that in standard quantum theory.
We all know if we're dealing with standard quantum theory understood as the unitary
Schrodinger evolution, and that's basically it, other than an ad hoc collapse postulate,
then clearly we do have a problem.
And so what I'm going to try to persuade you today is that this different theory of
fields enables you to define measurement.
So it's a big claim, but you know, and again, the interesting point is that while it's
a different theory of fields, it is empirically equivalent.
So they boil down to basically the same quantum theory.
OK, so just to go back now and look at how TI originated.
Some of you may already know this, but it originated from this specific different theory
of fields.
Has different names.
Some people call it the direct action theory.
Some people call it the absorber theory, and it was originally developed by wheeler
and Feynman, and they had their own reasons for developing it, which is another interesting
historical and interpretive topic that we may get into a little bit later.
What I think what people remember about the absorber theory in my experience is that Feynman
turned away from it, and wheeler turned away from it, and therefore it must be wrong.
It must be garbage, because these very smart guys turned away from it.
So actually it isn't garbage, and they did have certain reasons for losing interest
in it, and we'll talk about that a little bit later.
What I do note here on this first slide is that while people tend to remember that wheeler
walked away from it, it isn't as widely known that in 2003, together with his collaborator
Wesley, he was re-advocating it.
So again, if you want to appeal to authority and worry about whether the geniuses have
decreed that that theory is not worth considering, the fact that wheeler came back to it in 2003
and said we should consider this, he was actually proposing it as a way forward in quantum
gravity, but he did come back to it, I have a quote from that paper later.
So what I'm going to be talking about today is that what we can get out of the transactional
approach is a natural derivation of the Born Rule that emerges from the physics alone.
And what we'll see is that in contrast to what is usually understood, that the idea
is usually prevalent, that in order to talk about measurement we have to go outside the
theory, we have to go that the theory just does not allow for us to talk about measurement
as a process that's occurring among the systems that are described by the theory.
But in fact, in the direct action picture, in the transaction picture, you can do that.
And the key is including absorber response.
So we'll see how that works, and just emphasizing that this is a realist approach,
but it's different from many of the realist approaches you may have already heard about
that does not add any hidden variables, that does not make any changes to the basic quantum theory.
Okay, so just kind of an overview of what I'm going to talk about in the first hour
and whatever I don't get to, we can take a little break and we'll pick up in the second hour.
So I'm going to talk about what it is, what is TI, how TI explains the measurement process.
Then on a philosophical consideration, we're going to talk about what kind of reality
are we talking about in this picture, and we're going to be going back to Heisenberg's idea
of potential.
Then I'm going to talk a little bit about the relativistic extension of the transactional picture,
which I call RTI.
There's a little ambiguity in the terminology, because in my 2012 book,
I was calling this impossible as transactional interpretation.
So that was PTI, but they're basically the same thing.
I call it RTI now just to emphasize that it's relativistic picture.
And then I'm going to talk about how we can understand
that spacetime is something that is emergent through the measurement process
in this interpretation in RTI.
Okay, so TI was introduced by John Kramer in the 1980s.
This is the original reference, which he introduced the basics of theory.
It's based on the Wheeler Feynman direct action theory, or absorber theory.
Now, in this theory, the basic field propagation is time symmetric.
So this is how that works.
And I have a little bit of a diagram later that may help to visualize it.
It's the kind of thing that's really a little bit tricky to visualize
just with the formal discussion, so we'll just look at some pictures in a minute.
But what they showed in the 1940s was basically they were not happy
with the usual classical theory of electromagnetic radiation.
The way that you had to get what you needed
from the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation,
in which you assume that, as we see things,
that charges emit a retarded field only.
In other words, only a future-directed field,
which seems natural in common sense, and it seems to be what we observe.
But they were not able to obtain the observed fact
that charges lose energy when they emit this field.
The way that they obtained that was by imposing this sort of ad hoc free field.
This was Dirac's idea.
And anyway, actually, here's the quote that I was talking about earlier
from Wheeler, where you can see that Wheeler and his colleague, Wesley,
said that Wheeler Feynman swept the electromagnetic field
from between the charged particles
and replaced it with half retarded, half advanced
direct interaction between particle and particle.
It was the high point of this work to show that the standard
and well-tested force of reaction of radiation
on an accelerated charge is accounted for
as the sum of the direct actions on that charge
by all the charges of any distant, complete absorber.
The way he goes on and to laud this approach,
it gives you all the correct phenomena that you need,
but it doesn't actually assign any energy to the electromagnetic field
as an independent object or system.
And so this is, again, the usual radiation story
that we get from the classical standard approach.
It has these ad hoc features that it has a retarded field,
but that you have to also have an additional assumption
of this free field to get the radiative damping
to get the energy loss.
The other thing to kind of take note of
is that a field, the field being generated
doesn't even have units of energy.
It's really only an amplitude.
It has units of the square root of energy.
Clearly, you need something more than just a charge
generating a field to get this transfer of real energy.
So the ways that they were approaching this
was to assume a self-interaction
that in the classical theory led to unwanted divergences.
Or you can impose this ad hoc free field.
It was Dirac's idea that just you don't know
where it comes from or why it's there,
but if you plot this in,
then you get charges to lose energy.
So it had this ad hoc nature,
and that's what Miller and Feynman didn't like.
So that was their motivation.
Also their motivation was to avoid the self-interaction
that in the classical field led to these infinities.
So instead, what they said was,
OK, so we're going to say that a charge,
and here I'm adding that the objects
that can radiate in this manner
are bound excited states.
And this is what I mean by an emitter.
So take an atom and an electron
in an excited state in that atom.
That's really what we mean by an emitter here.
And then other charges in bound states
that can be excited to higher energy levels
function as absorbers.
And this is the new idea
that comes with the absorber theory
that they in fact actively respond
with their own time-symmetric field.
So then there's another assumption
that history has been known as
the light-tight box condition
that is the subject of some misunderstanding
which we can talk about here.
The object in blue there
is the basically kind of a boundary condition
that says that this,
there is no total free field in the universe.
In other words, there's no free field
that's hanging out there that has no sources.
So that's what they call the light-tight box condition.
So the nice thing they saw
is that if you assume that all charges you knit
with this time-symmetric field
and then there is a responsive absorbers
that effectively kind of collectively adds
to this free field
whose total is always zero,
meaning that whatever is emitted is always absorbed,
then effectively you get what we see,
you get a net-retarded field.
So they got what they wanted in that sense.
And the other thing,
well, okay, so here's just a picture
so you can kind of visualize what the idea is.
This is, and these drawings are from the Davies,
Paul Davies papers from the 1970s.
He also developed this theory into relativistic form.
So this is what, if you think of the emitter
and this is its world line,
this is what the time-symmetric field looks like.
So it's got this discontinuity,
it's got the retarded field
and then a phase change in the advanced field
going into the past in that manner.
So then this is a free field
that is actually based on responses of absorbers
and we'll see a little bit more how that works.
And you see that if we superimpose them,
we get only retarded fields
because the advanced fields cancel out.
So that's the basic idea.
So meanwhile, the dividend here
is that the nature of the advanced,
the field of the absorbers
is such that its advanced component
is exactly out of phase as we saw in the picture
and then it cancels the advanced field from the emitter.
But meanwhile, this response field
appears to be a free field,
appears as if it's a free field
from the vantage point of the emitter
and it does constitute this free field
that had to be added in an abhawk way
in the standard theory.
Now this is what it looks like with,
this is a picture from John Kramer's 1986 paper.
So this is what it looks like
with an absorber included
and this is just kind of the idealized case
of only one absorber.
So this is the case in which
this field from the emitter
is fully canceled by this total absorber
and what we get
is we get the advanced field canceled
to the passive emitter.
We also get the retarded field
canceled to the future of the absorber
which is really what we mean by absorption.
So this is why the energy go
and it's a retarded field that is left
and meanwhile this explains
why the energy goes from the emitter
to the absorber and these two fields
are reinforced here.
So that's the basic transactional picture.
Now this is just a way
to kind of see
in a more formal way
how we get what looks like
a free field acting on the emitter
if we consider just
take out this one emitter
that we call J
and don't include it
in the fields
because the idea is that
it's not experiencing
this is the field acting on that emitter
as opposed to the total field.
So the field acting on it
if we assume that it doesn't interact with its own field
so we take it out of the sum
this is all of these time symmetric fields
but then we include the total
again this is zero
but we added it
to all absorbers
and what we get is
effectively a net
retarded field from
all the absorbers
all the other charges
not equal to the one we're singling out
plus what looks like
in advanced field
with respect to that one
charge that we're singling out.
So the idea is that the absorber theory
very nicely gives you
the classical radiation
which claims why a charge loses energy
but in fact doesn't
require any kind
of ad hoc imposition of this
free field.
Ok, so that's the basics
of the wheeler finding picture
that underlies
the transactional interpretation.
So now I'm going to get into
some of the specifics in the terminology
that we use in the transactional picture
according to Kramer
these are his definitions.
If we look only
at the
in practice
look only at
the retarded field
from the emitter
which is our red line here
and that's kind of just that component
the forward component from the emitter
which is the one we know about
so we can call that an offer wave
and that corresponds to
the usual quantity state.
Now meanwhile
the new thing, the new ingredient
that's added by the wheeler finding picture
the transactional picture
is that an absorber
absorbers are going to respond to this
and we can get into this question
of why do they respond
and how do you know when something is responding
in the relativistic version
but for now the basic idea
is that when we're looking at
the total system of emitter
and potential absorbers
when we get responses
they are what constitute
a bra
in the braket notation
and that's called a confirmation wave
of course this is not part of standard quantum theory
however
we have these objects in the theory already
so the nice thing about it is
that TI is giving you something
physically going on
it's a referent for
what we already have in the theory
we have objects like this in the theory
so it's not adding anything ad hoc to the theory
so we can think of this interaction
of the offer and the confirmation
as a kind of a handshake
and in general
one offer wave will set up
many of these responses
because many absorbers will respond
and I call these
each of these handshakes
an incipient transaction
because there are many of them and we don't know
which one is going to be actualized
so I call them incipient transactions at this stage
now at the point
where one of these is actualized
that's where we get real energy
transferring from the emitter
to the absorber that sort of wins
that competition
so we'll see in more detail
how that works in a little bit
so this is again that same picture
so we have the offer wave
we have responses
here I'm only showing one response
but in next slides we'll get to situations
where we have several absorbers
so we get this
offer and response
and just once again we get
cancellation to the pass of the emitter
cancellation to the future
we get a real quantum of energy
going from the emitter to the absorber
so the completed transaction
looks like this
just emphasizing that we've got
energy that
was in the excited state of that atom
then the energy left that atom
and was picked up by the absorbing atom
and actually won that competition
so the other interesting thing
is that what we get out of this
is that the reinforced field
is really two complex fields
this goes back
this is the retarded field from the emitter
this is the advanced field from the absorber
and the reinforcement
is really this
addition in which they become
the fully real cosine function
so that's the other
aspect in which the quantum case
differs from the classical case
because
independently these fields are complex
objects which is kind of one of
the other puzzles of quantum theories
that the
and so on that the offer waves
or the quantum states truly are complex
and this explains how
the complexity
takes both the retarded
complex form, the advanced complex form
to give you the real form that
constitutes the real energy
now if you look at the amplitudes of these
and we'll see this in more detail later
if you look at the product of the amplitudes
we clearly get this from the advanced state
this is from the retarded state
and that's how we get our natural
physical explanation for the Bohr model
and I'll talk about that
more later
so this is an example of
the more typical case where we have
many possible detectors, absorbers
we have
an emitting source
this is how it's kind of applied
the formalism is applied where we have
an offer wave
the component that is absorbed by the detector
C is the projection
of S onto C
and then
so the response that that
absorber generates then
is the advanced
the advanced form of this
so we get this, this is the actual
confirmation that is
sent back to the emitter
or similarly with D
so again if we look at absorber C
the incipient transaction between
the emitter and absorber C
we take the product of those two amplitudes
and that gives us the Bohr
rule for the probability of the outcome C
ok so
now we're going to
look a little bit more specifically at
von Neumann's theory of measurement
and see how TI explains that
quite nicely
so I'm sure you all know this
but just for review purposes
so von Neumann's formulation
specify these two processes
the numbers are a little counterintuitive
but process two he called
the basic unitary evolution
of the Schrodinger picture
in which picture the Schrodinger
state evolves
with time and is the solution to the Schrodinger equation
and it's deterministic and reversible
and so on
then process one
is this nonunitary collapse
that has been ad hoc in the theory
it's indeterministic
and it's irreversible
and so he called this
the measurement transition
and he formalized it
in this way
let me see if I have a better
well I'll get to
the way he formalized it
in a few slides
but as you probably also know
this is the measurement problem
where he said clearly
there seems to be some sort of a nonunitary
process going on
because our quantum theory
is deterministic, it's process two
but when we look at things
we always see deterministic results
and we see them with this probability
which corresponds to some indeterministic process
and who knows
what that is and how that happens
so he talked about consciousness
so here was kind of born
and resort to an external
observing consciousness
that a lot of people
has become very mainstream
no comment
so
back to this specific
case
of the interferometer
we can see that we get the
born rule from that
if we just take the whole
object and just take their product
so we've got this sort of a
line in a bra thing
with each with their amplitudes
the product gives you this weighted projection
operator where the weight is the born rule
so once again
and that's basically von Neumann's
process one
although he sums them all up
so we'll see that
he's got a mix state
because he sums up all these possible
outcomes as weighted projection operators
here's just another
way to kind of visualize
this product out of it
you know, you might say
why are we multiplying these things
it is really kind of
a situation where we have
successive attenuations
we've got the source emitting this
offer wave
then we've got some sort of a filter
that tells us
that not all that offer wave is going to get
to this detector
only this part of it, only the component
that is projected onto that state
the only thing that detector sees
so the absorbers in that detector
emit
generate the advanced form
of what it is they received
which looks like this
when this object interacts
with the emitter
once again the emitter can only detect
only receive this state
so we have to project
this bra onto
that state and so this is where
we get the second
complex conjugate factor
so this is where our product comes from
this circuit which is kind of a heuristic way
to picture what's going on
so this is
more formally now
how this gives us von Neumann's process 1
this is how he formalized it
he said well we start with a pure state
and then somehow we have this non-unitary
process 1
in which we end up with
this set of weighted projection operators
which is a mixed state
in other words it's a proper mixed state
it's not something
that you get by tracing over
degrees of freedom we're not interested in
or something like that
so it's a situation
in which when you have this mixed state
you can tell that a measurement has occurred
and in TI
this is kind of another way to picture
how that process 1
has occurred
we have this offer components
they're going to each of these
different possible absorbers
and the generated confirmations
and that's just a nice handy way to visualize
what these projection operators
and their weights correspond to it
these are incipient
what I call incipient transactions
so in this case
we've had the measurement transition
now you can think of
the von Neumann process as having
two stages that are both
interesting in their
and maybe challenging in their own way
the first challenge is to explain
how we get from a pure state
that just undergoes deterministic evolution
and leads to assuring your cat problem
if you just, you know, keep going
with the unitary
to save the cat
from being in a superposition
we can actually say that
there are absorbers in the Geiger counter
and they really did something
and they really did generate physically
these confirming responses
that gave us this measurement
transition
but now, okay, stage one
so I've gotten a set of competing
incipient transactions
where you can think of it as kind of a lottery
and
there's no way to say
in a deterministic, you know
you can't give a mechanism
for why you get like outcome one
or outcome two or outcome three
you can't say there's any causal reason
or anything like that
the way I deal with this in TI
is to say, well, this is very analogous
to spontaneous symmetry breaking
and we have spontaneous symmetry breaking
elsewhere in physics
which depicts mechanism
in situations like that
where the theory will give us many solutions
for a given initial situation
and there's no causal mechanism
for why nature ends up
in one of those solutions
this is kind of an ubiquitous feature
of physics, really
and so that's why I want to
when people say, ah, but, you know
you failed too, because you couldn't tell us
why one of these became
actualized as opposed to the other
well, you know, if TI
fails on that and so does the Higgs magnetism
in Pennsylvania, any other
cases in physics that rely on
a spontaneous symmetry breaking
so that's kind of where we are
with this, we get
one of these outcomes is actualized
and at that point
the real quantum of energy
will go from the mid or to
whichever one of these absorbing systems
wins that lottery
and actualizes that
that quantum
in, so, just to summarize
so, um
what we already talked about here in the process
one leads to a weighted set of competing
incipient transactions
and each of those
is represented physically by
a projection operator multiplied by the Born Rule
which gives us a nice
physical referent for
the measurement transition
and his process one
so that's how we get the process
one by the responses of absorbers
and I already talked about the
spontaneous symmetry breaking
okay, so we kind of already
dealt with this
and now, and I'll return to that a little bit
so, in this section I'm going to start
dealing a little bit with
what does reality look like
in this picture
if we take seriously
the complexity of the quantum states
and so on, and as you all know
the fact that Hilbert spaces
can have arbitrarily many dimensions
and so on
clearly we've got to be talking about
something
interesting here
the usual case
if you had a single quantum only
and you looked at its wave function
then you could think of this as being a space time logic
and what Joseph Kramer was doing
in his original 1986 paper
he was actually claiming that
the quantum state is real
and it's a space time object
but the minute you get into these
composite systems of more than one
degree of freedom
that each of which has three n
so you have n systems
each of which has three spatial degrees of freedom
so you've got three n spatial degrees
of freedom, well this doesn't fit into space time
so we just have to kind of face up to that
that it does not fit into space time
so how do we deal with that?
well
it's not really that new an idea
Heisenberg was proposing the idea
of possibility
or quantum potential
as being something real
so what I'm proposing then
is that
the classical realm
the observable phenomenal realm
that is well described by classical physics
is really just the tip of the iceberg
so this
the tip represents space time
and
the big challenge is that
it's kind of a strong word
maybe it's kind of an atrocity
to say to a physicist
oh there are things that are real
but don't fit into space time
it's just kind of a weird thing
to say
for many physicists
because physics
to give it credit
physics is an empirical science
and it doesn't countenance
anyone's flight of fancy
about the way they want reality to be
and you have to be able to make contact
with phenomenal, with the empirical world
and so that's the power of physics
in that whatever theory you dream of
you've got to be able to test it
you've got to be able to corroborate it
and show in space and time
and show at least on the tip of the iceberg
that your theory is doing something
that connects with nature
that connects with reality
otherwise why shouldn't anyone listen to you
and I'm all for that
but what I want to argue
and others have said this too
I guess I'm not the only one
is that quantum theory
is arguably in its structure
in its formal structure
in the fact that as we saw
in the previous slide we've got
composite quantum systems that have
3n spatial degrees of freedom
well we don't have 3n spatial dimensions
so I'm just going to suggest
that they are real
but they're just not
they're sub-imperial
so that reality is just bigger than we thought
and quantum theory
is kind of a finger that's pointing outside
what we grew up
what we all grew up with as
I live in a space-time container
we all think we live in a space-time container
and that's it and that's what's real
and what I'm suggesting is quantum theory
is telling us that may not be the case
so
so that's what I just
basically said
so the proposal is to take quantum energies
as physically real
but having a different ontological status
from space-time objects
call them potentia
and the plurals potentie
for those Latin scholars
and this really goes back to Heisenberg
who said that a quantum system
is something standing in the middle
between the idea of an event
and the actual event
a strange kind of physical reality
just in the middle
between possibility and reality
so I think he's really onto something there
and I'm gonna take that seriously
I've also recently written a paper
with Stu Kaufman
and Mike Epperson
where we go into some detail about
why we should take Heisenberg's idea seriously
like anyone who's interested
I can give you that reference
so the idea then
in my extension of TI
which I called possibilities
TI and now I call relativistic TI
what are these offers and confirmations?
they're physical possibilities
in Heisenberg's sense
potentie
the realm of the quantum potentie
is what is described by Hilbert space
or at the relativistic level Fox space
and in addition
those offer confirmation exchanges
that set up the incipient transactions
are also a form of potentie
ok
so
what I'm saying here
is that
actually when you get
your mixed state
when you get your set
of incipient transactions
that is described by
that sum
that's where you can kind of mark
the transition between
the possible and the actual
because we've at least
got a classical probability space
so at this stage
you've got a particular basis
the absorption responses
have defined for you a particular basis
and with respect
to that one basis
you can define a classical probability space
so that tells you you're about to be able to
to transition
from the quantum realm
to the so-called tip of the iceberg
at that point
as I just noticed
ok, so the measurement basis
is defined by those absorbers
and it gives you that process one
and as I already talked about this
as just kind of a quick
looking back at the
actualization of one of those outcomes
again a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking
which you can think of as a generalization
of the usual symmetry breaking
in that it's weighted
so that's how it's distinct from
other cases such as in Higgs mechanism
this is a weighted form of symmetry breaking
so some outcomes
are more likely than others
but yet there's no causal story
about why or how one of those gets actualized
so this is a kind of
a counterintuitive idea
so we could just go back
to the case of Burden's
ass which is a way
of calling
making and using
comment on this principle
for a sufficient reason
that underlies our thinking
due to livenance
where we kind of want to know
well you have to tell me why
this happened and not something else
or in its stronger form
you can't have something happen
unless you can provide a causal
mechanistic reason
basis for that thing happening
and so possibly
what this faces us with
is the idea that perhaps nature
is a volition in nature
I'm not going to get into that in this talk
but it's an intriguing question
and I've talked about that possibility
as an opportunity for free will
which is another big problem
but the idea is this donkey
doesn't really care about
perhaps let's say perhaps
this donkey doesn't really care about livenance
as intuitions or our intuitions
it's hungry so it's just going to start eating
and it doesn't have to give you reasons
so maybe nature is like that too
let's see who we're doing
okay great
so I'll just get into this next part
where I'm going to talk a little bit more
about the relativistic extension
of the transactional picture
this
this is how I have extended
the transactional picture
and it's based on
a very nice work by Davies
the tragedy is
that Professor Davies thinks
that Wheeler said don't do this
so he doesn't want to do it either
it's like
so I actually visited Professor Davies
and told him hey you solved the measurement problem
back in 1971
this is great you're a hero
in direct action theory
and he just doesn't
want to deal with it
and it's a shame because
don't be like that
it's fine there's nothing wrong with it
so I understand skepticism about
the absorber theory about the direct action theory
perfectly legit
but if it's because
Feynman and Wheeler turned away from it
then please reconsider that
because again Wheeler was reconsidering
so
this is work that I should start up by saying
I am self-taught
in quantum field theory
there are gaps in my knowledge
and I'm sure that many of you probably know more about it than I do
so that is great
and please feel free to
let me know what I'm mistaken about
if you see something
then I can fix it
however what I'm going to do is go over
Davies formulation
and what he noted was
that
and this is pretty standard actually
that what we call the Feynman propagator
which is a very standard
object in quantum field theory
that describes
virtual particle
propagation and so on
in a causal
way in what Feynman wanted to be
a causal way that made intuitive sense
and it turns out
that this Feynman
I can get into more detail about how these things are defined
but just as an overview
the Feynman propagator of quantum field theory
is actually can be decomposed
as Davies noted
into a time symmetric propagator
and a free field
for positive energies
so this is actually
the quantum analog
what we saw before
with a retarded field
being a sum of
the time symmetric field
and this free field
that sums to zero
so this is basically the quantum analog of that
in the
and we'll see that comes out of the absorber theory
but this is actually how
the Feynman propagator can be decomposed
and one thing that it does
is it actually kind of deals
with two cases in one
it deals with virtual particles
virtual photons and also real photons
and what
the relativistic development of TI does
is it disambiguates
these cases and it allows you to say
at what point you're dealing with a real photon
and in what case you're dealing
with a virtual photon
and just long story short
it is that when you have
a situation that can be described
only with this time symmetric component
you have virtual photon propagation only
and when you have a situation
that is described by this free field component
then you have real photon propagation
so we'll see that
that's one of the developments
in the RTI
ok
so basically how that got started
is that Davies noted
in his work that virtual processes
virtual particle processes
are described by just this time symmetric part
basically the time symmetric propagator
just has
positive energies propagating
into the future
negative energies propagating into the future
positive energies propagating into the past
and negative energies propagating into the past
and it has a discontinuity
at the particle
world line because
this is what it means for it to be
a bound field or at least not a free field
technically a solution to the
inhomogeneous equation
so that's basically what the time symmetric propagator
is it's actually a time isotropic propagator
so everything is going in any
direction it can
ok so
the next aspect
of what we're going to look at here
that's key I think
for getting TI
from the nonrelativistic to the relativistic
domain
is to explain this issue of
well why are you going to get
why and how are you going to get an offer wave
why and how and at what point
are you going to get a confirmation wave
as Kramer calls
them well to
answer this we need to go back
to the relativistic level
and just consider kind of a standard
scattering picture
where we've got say an electron 2 electron
scattering
and you've got a virtual photon going
between them
well in the direct action
of the theory this process
can be described by the time symmetric
propagator and it's nice because
the Feynman propagator wants to allow for cases where
if you think
of a photon as its own antiparticle
but just to worry about
you know if well we've got
if it goes from here to here
it better be a particle
if this time is before that
time you gotta assign times to everything
ok so suppose this time
was before that time
then the Feynman propagator says well I better make sure
this is a positive energy particle going
from there to there
and the virtual quantum is going from there to there
then I better make it a negative energy particle
because I wanna make sure that the only positive
energy goes forward and it's all this bookkeeping
that you have to do with the Feynman propagator
with the time symmetric propagator
that's all taken care of
because you don't have to specify
there's actually no fact of the matter
about which way the energy is going
if you're just going to say
well you know I'm gonna be summing over
all these possible spacetime positions anyway
so you don't have to do this kind of bookkeeping
and it's already known
that there's an ambiguity
at the level of virtual particles
about which temporal direction you're going in
we never know and so the Feynman propagator
has to allow for both cases
and try to impose causality on it
but with just the time symmetric propagator
we automatically get the physical statement
that we don't know which way
this virtual photon is going
and that's the way they are
it's kind of a nice elegant way
of describing that
so what you get
with this kind of interaction
this virtual interaction
I like to think of it as a necessary
but not sufficient condition
to have an offer wave
or a confirmation wave
so what is it that
is this sufficient condition
well
for one thing you have to have
certain things like you have to have
the satisfaction of conservation laws
for which
you're going to need these things
to at least be loosely bound
so they have to be once again
in a bound state such as in atom
so now we can think
in the transition point
between the nonrelativistic
transactional picture
we think of it like like a coin flip
it's just either or two possibilities
there's either a quantum state there
or there is an quantum state
but when you go to the relativistic domain
in a way
metaphorically what you've got is another option
you've got like a thicker coin
where you can have a process where
it's noncommittal
there's an interaction
but there's no fact of the matter
there's no yes I've got an offer wave
yes I've got a confirmation wave
it's something in between
and that's how to picture
what are these couplings here
where you've got a connection
between the electrons
and this is a virtual photon
bending on its side at the relativistic level
something that the nonrelativistic theory
cannot account for
so now we go to the fact that
there are coupling amplitudes
that characterize these
these contact points
it's basically the electric charge E
so each of these couplings
is an amplitude
it's an amplitude and as Feynman said
I'll have this later on
Feynman actually pointed out
that E, the charge
is the amplitude for a real photon
to be emitted or absorbed
so what
the relativistic TI does
is it takes that and it says yes
that's exactly what that is
and what that means is it quantifies
the probability and they multiply
because it's a mutual thing
the probability that you will get
an offer and a confirmation
is E times E
or the fine structure constant
with appropriate
generalizations and so on
there's factors of agency
but basically E squared is the
fine structure constant
and that quantifies the probability
that in this kind of interaction
provided that other conservation laws
are satisfied and so on
you can get
and say an offer emitted at y
by this electron
and I've doubled them to note now that they're bound states
because you can't do this with free electrons
it violates energy conservation
so let's see
I've got an offer
an offer coming from x
and a confirmation coming from y
so this is probabilistically
it's quantitatively
defined but it's probabilistic again
so
that's kind of an important
point in which we can say
that an absorber
and emitter is well defined
in terms of what
instigates
this process of offer
and confirmation generation
so I'm going to stop there
because you know it's kind of hot
and some of you are about to faint
so we'll just pause
and maybe have a little 10 minute break
and you'll throw some ice on your head
and pick it up
and see if there are any immediate questions
where you can wait till after
because I'm going to put it in the video
so yeah
I have one question
so
well this is what tells you
so
we can get more into that
that's a great question in the second part
but so you still want to know
okay well what you said doesn't answer
for me
at what point absorption occurs
and because absorption
in response of absorbers
is what triggers this von Neumann
non-unitary transition
so then the question is
I think many people are skeptical about this
what they say is
oh fine you're giving me this story about absorbers
blah blah blah blah
I don't know what an absorber is
that's just
I'm just caricaturing
but that's a natural concern
because we've been taught that
no matter what you say
you will never define measurement
but what I claim is
yes we are defining measurement here
it's indeterministic
it's an indeterministic account
so I'm never going to be able to say
at t equals whatever
time point 001
in seconds
you will have a confirmation
and you will have process 1
but we have decay probabilities
which are part of standard physics
and in this theory
they give time-dependent probabilities
that's standard physics
and in this theory
those give you the probability
that the measurement transition will occur
for a particular system
so we can talk
it's a great question
if I enter in the lab
can you pinpoint what the absorber is
and what is not an absorber
or is it a fundamental distinction
between objects that are absorber
those that are not absorber
we don't need to talk about absorbers
or anything
so I'll get into that in the second part
so everything is a system
and we as absorbers
when we observe something
determinant
it's because there was something determinant
so we're determined
we're observing something
that really did happen already
on a microscopic scale
and we don't need to have any fancy theory of the absorber
all we have to say is
we got to that some process occurred
that plot us onto the tip of the iceberg
and the tip of the iceberg
is what our senses can see
and detect us phenomenally
so it's on the tip of the iceberg
and therefore we can phenomenally perceive it
just the way it is
there's no need to say an absorber
as opposed to
anything like that
but we can get more to that
I can't say the philosopher here
so I was wondering in line
which is that
if the domain
of the quantum theory which is submerged
was very real
of the relativistic domain
that is supposed to be equivalent
of counts of all the things on them
exactly
but if I understood your question
I would make that identification
with the tip of the iceberg
being the world of appearance
consenomenal world
and the submerged portion being
eligible to count as
nomenon
consenomenal world
because it is
things in themselves
but in such a way
that they are not observed
they can't be observed
and the quantum theory can point to them
and tell us something about them
so it's a great question in that
I disagree with Kant
in the sense that
he said that nomenon
are intrinsically unknowable
because the way he defined knowledge
was through sense experience only
he ruled out the idea that
an intellectual rational exploration
could give you knowledge about something
but I think that's what quantum theory is doing
so
let's see
I guess you appreciate it
so well
I would like to raise an issue
concerning
this relativistic
this particular
so you
in patient discussions
it's very natural
on quantum electrodynamics
and on the
interpretive
of studying quantum electrodynamics
which granted
of course he is so far
really the only way
of communicating
but we should forget
that the perturbation theory
is just
one
man-made way
of approximation
and there are many many other
nomenon who can study them
in the theories which are
relativistik
but also relativistik theories
in lower dimensions
and in your discussions
so
study models in lower dimensions
and
so
many warming against
attaching too much
reality to
these diagrams
they are just a convenient tool
and
as we see here
there are many many other
ways of
getting the numerical results
but
so
for instance
they have a concept of virtual particles
it may not be
a meaningful concept
beyond this perturbation theory
so also
I think
be aware of this a lot
because it is a really
a old theory of interpretation
or all that in our room
other concepts
but be aware that the perturbation theory
is just one way of studying
sure
great point and I do get your concern
and I do take that
seriously and of course
these pictures are
heuristic entry ways
they are not meant to be taken
literally of course we know there are many many other diagrams
and should we reify
the perturbation expansion
that is a great question
however I would also say
that the direct action theory
of fields arguably
does not rest on any particular
approach including the perturbative
approach
that I think it is a theory of fields that goes deeper
than that in the sense that you can talk about
correlation functions
if you want to be a little bit more
general perhaps
it is a question of
what are these fields
if there are
these are two point correlations
if you have what you call virtual particle
we don't necessarily want to think of it as
the little corpusil plopping along
which I certainly don't
it is more of a connection
and one of the things
that people didn't like about the direct action theory
is that these connections are
non-local
they don't involve
a kind of causal
notion of energy propagation
by way of a field with independent
degrees of freedom
and that made a lot of people uncomfortable
because they were explicitly non-local
so again the way
the actual mechanistic
way in which these processes
work I am kind of agnostic on that
I don't want to cling to any particular
visualizational model
of how these processes work
I don't cling to know that
we think of the direct action theory
in a kind of structural realist way
that something about it captures
at least the structural behavior
of reality at a level
that arguably is pre-empirical
not as sub-empirical
then at least
the descriptions
that we use for these processes
as formulated in theory
do seem to give a nice correspondence
with the von Neumann
measurement transitions
it's a great point that we don't want to
get fixated on
particular visualizations
but I guess
let's take a little 10 minute break
and get a little refreshment
so I guess we'll
resume
so I think
since we just kind of
were dealing with the issue
of
at what point are we getting
these processes
in other words, responses of
absorbers that I've argued
tell you that you have
the measurement transition occurring
we can kind of see
what it looks like here
we can see that as opposed to
a simple scattering
which is in the direct action theory
it's just the
the direct connection
that we have a virtual photon
if you want to think of it that way
but this remains unitary
so the idea is
when you have this kind of process
going on at this level
the evolution is still unitary
nothing has happened
that would precipitate
what we call the measurement transition
of non-unitary transition
now at this point
this depicts a situation
where the non-unitary transition
happens and we're getting an
offer wave
offer and confirmation
and the doubling of the photon line
represents real energy transfer
so the claim is that
at the relativistic level
in the transactional picture
you can really distinguish
between a simple scattering
that's a unitary process
excuse me, unitary
that there's no measurement occurring
in this kind of process
whether or not it's microscopic
it nevertheless
process has occurred
emission and absorber response
that has now triggered
this non-unitary process
so this is a very unfamiliar idea
and especially the idea that this happens
at the micro level
so we don't need to bring in any observers
or we don't have to define anything that's macroscopic
although we can't, we can actually use this
this account to
get an account of
why certain systems can be called
macroscopic and others microscopic
but nevertheless the transition
can occur at this microscopic level
so I'm going to go into
a little more quantitative detail now
if I scribble on this board
we will be able to see it
so we're just good
this is all standard physics
but we're going to be interpreting it
in the direct action picture
so a very standard
quantity in physics
is the transition amplitude
between two states
where you have state B
which is an excited state
for some atomic system
some atomic electron
and we also have a state of the
photon field, the EM field
in which we have n-1 photons
in the field
indicating that one got absorbed
and matrix element for this
process is we have an interaction
Hamiltonian
that involves the vector potential
the electromagnetic potential
and the particle momentum
that looks like this
if you're interested
there's a coupling amplitude here
so unit's here
and we've got a
electromagnetic field
dot p of the electron
so that's the
interaction Hamiltonian
that can affect this transition
so this state is the
let's see the ground state
of the atom
and a state of the field
the photon field with an electron
so this is a matrix element
for absorption
so
when we look at this
the standard thing
standard way to deal with this
is to look at the
there's also a time dependence
that goes along with this
so now
so basically
the time dependence
looks like
zero to t
you have
the difference between
the two energy levels
which are going to come in
so you can't really
IMAGT
and
the frequency
of the photon
so that you have a time dependence
that looks like that
so the standard way to get
the probability for absorption
is to apply the Born rule to this
and square it
and what you get is a time dependent
probability
that if you have any particular atom
in this state exposed to an electromagnetic field
it will in fact absorb a photon
so that's very standard physics
and that's how I want to emphasize that absorption
ati is nothing more than this
ati is absorb
and that's the theory that describes the absorption
now what
the transactional picture contributes to this
is the idea that
here's this little absorber sitting out here
I'm going to call it g
because it's in its ground state
well that absorber doesn't do anything
unless
there is another system
an atom in an excited state
that could emit a photon
so
in standard theory
photons are thought of as
just autonomous objects
that you can send out a photon
and there it goes and it's unilateral
or you can
unilaterally absorb a photon
because it was just always there
so that doesn't happen
in the transaction picture
in the direct action picture
there are no photons
unless you have at least two systems
like this that can interact
and they already know about each other
in this virtual senses
they're already involved
in this direct action
however
in virtue of that direct interaction
they may know
and I'm saying no in just a loose way
I don't really think they're little people thinking
but they have
a way of
acquiring information
let's say
that you can satisfy energy conservation
if
this thing lost energy
so there's at least
a
necessary but not sufficient condition
here for
an emission and absorption to take place
and the whole point of the direct action picture
is that you always have both
so any real photon
for any
real
there's our photon gamma
any real photon
and there's
any
midder
and at least one absorber
otherwise
nothing happens that are no photons
and absorber again
it's just a bound state that is capable of being excited
to a higher energy level state
but midder is just a bound system
that is capable of falling down to a lower energy state
and it's only our justices instead
so
instead of having to square this
the way we explain
that a real photon was created
in the transactional picture
is we take the
transition amplitude for absorption
which is already here
and then we consider also that
in order for that photon exist
it must also be emitted
we can't just absorb it
so the emitted part looks like
it's actually the opposite
let's see
m
k
m
interaction Hamiltonian
and then p
in minus one
because in this initial state
it's in a lower energy state
it hasn't
I mean it's sorry it's in a higher energy state
capable of emitting a photon
but there are fewer photons in the field
because one hasn't been emitted yet
so this is the absorption matrix element
this is the emission matrix element
and it's going to have
a time dependence
that looks like
integrate this
omega t where that's
the difference in the two energy levels
and then
e to the
so what we see is
the transition
transition amplitude
for the emission part
is already the complex conjugate
of the absorption part
and we can work out the final result
if we want to
basically so the probability
that this photon
to be emitted
gamma, which I'm saying has
k
frequency k
probably it's going to exist
multiplying the amplitudes
for the two processes
that are required
absorption
emission
and then when we do the integrations
it turns out
that we get something like this
complex conjugates of each other
it's something like
and they're complex conjugates
so it's square
and so basically if you
is up being a sharply peaked function
and for large times
it approaches a delta function
and you just get Fermi's golden rule
so what you get out of this
and you could look this up in Sakurai
in reference it deals with emission
and absorption gradient processes
so you get Fermi's golden rule
now you usually get it
from squaring
applying a normal ad hoc
to either the absorption
transition element
or the emission one
and you say I'm going to get the probability
for absorption because that's what I'm interested in
or I'm going to get the probability for
emission because that's what I'm interested in
well the direct action picture
says you have to be interested in both of them
because they're both required
in order for you to get a photon at all
so the proper way to take them into account
is multiply their amplitudes together
and lovin behold
when you get that you've got Fermi's golden rule
and you've got the border rule
just by multiplying these two amplitudes
that are complex conjugates of each other
so that's what I mean when I say
that this picture just hands you the born rule
on a silver platter
as long as you take into account that
in order to have radiation
there must be emission and absorption
so the idea is what we get from this
is a time dependent probability
these are just decay probabilities
these are standard
objects in physics
decay probabilities
at least for the excited case
or absorption probabilities
if you're only looking at
either emission or absorption
so there's standard objects in physics
and so it turns out
that because
what this is really describing
is the generation
of a real photon
in other words you've got
this counts as the probability
to have an offer wave
as a probability to get
a confirmation wave
absorption is our CWR
confirmation
going the other way
so that absorption
gives us our confirmation wave
this gives us our offer wave
and so
this is telling us
that the probabilities
we're getting out of this
are actually describing the probability
at any particular time
that you will get
your confirmation and your offer
which is the non-limitari transition
you need
a bit more
to get actual decay
yes, you definitely do
yeah, you definitely do
this is
if you take the limit of large T
I'm not going to claim
to derive for you in complete detail
the fairies golden rule
but for large T
T times
a delta function
of delta omega
minus
h for omega k
so I'm not going to work that all out
here but it's a standard result
and you can look it up in Sakurai
so there's
this thing squared
so there's the transition amplitude
squared which is that basic
probability of the transition
with these two
products
and then you've got
this delta function
and so this turns out to be
this quantity is really a decay rate
so
this quantity is really a decay rate
because it just tells you
some probability per unit of time
and this is all standard physics
and so the only difference here
is that we're interpreting
decay rates
which describe
the rate at which
an excited object
will decay
or the rate at which
a ground state or lower state object
will be excited
that actually they describe
the probability
that you're going to get
the non-unitary transition
because in this theory
that's the only way you get
any photon to happen
that's the only way you get
so this is the probability
this is all probability that we're going to get
this real photon emitted
and absorbed is also
the probability
for non-unitary transition
non-unitary
and it happens at the microscopic
level so that's the key
so this is what isn't
it sounds like maybe a strong
push this up
is that better?
so
this is what's sort of
missing in standard theory
you're sort of right in front of you
but you don't interpret it that way
because at this point
you're just applying a
born rule because
born fought in a footnote
realize that you need to square
the wave function to get the probability
just the probability
the wave function itself
complete mystery
it's totally ab hoc and it works
why does it work?
the direct action theory
seems to tell us why it works
because
if you look at it in the sense that
you're only getting a real photon
when both these processes occur
and how nice that the processes
the amplitudes are already
complex conjugates of each other
and you just multiply them together
then you get the born rule
this approach tells you
why any time there's a situation
in which the probabilities tell you
that it's overwhelmingly
likely
the k-rates tell you
it's overwhelmingly likely that in my lab
in this apparatus
when that laser got turned on
that when my watch tells me
5 seconds have gone by
I've had X photons
emitted and detected
the physics is telling you
that was the probability that you had
measurement transitions
with each of those
so the physics is already telling you
yes the non-unitary transition occurred
because you got
your probabilities
it's overwhelmingly likely
that by the time you went back and looked at your detector
those little spots you saw
are real
and they're really on
the tip of the iceberg
so this is the probability that
back to our little iceberg picture
that there were processes going on
between the midder
and the absorber
and they were
in direct contact in a sense
with this non-local direct action
and at some point as governed by
the probabilistic decay rates
that photon got emitted
bam
and there's really something up there
in space and time
and that's why you see it
so
I like it, I mean it's
what's not to like
maybe what's not to like is
that the direct action
theory has got this non-local
aspect to it, yes
so there's only ever
quantum
quantum
what would be down here
would be
what I'm calling the virtual photons
so all of this here you've got
found electrons
you've got
what I call
in the direct action theory
is the direct connection
so there's a field there
whatever you want to call it
field correlation
that's real, it's physically real
it's just not going to be something
that will trigger the measurement transition
and possibility
so you've got all the things that go on
things that are described by the unitary
processes
all the quantum unitary processes
are still real
but they're not
they don't result in phenomena
directly
in this picture
the ontology is that of waves
so
again
that's something that
perhaps it is not obligatory
but I think that's the most natural way
to understand it
I know that when Feynman formulated
his sum over paths
he had a particle picture in mind
and he had the idea of a particle
exploring all possible paths
but the way in which
these paths have to
add and they're adding
and so that's why I think
we're looking at a wave-like behavior
at an ontological level
so that
if you want to talk about
wave particle duality
where you get the particle wave
phenomenon
is where you have
say you're in your lab
and you've got
a detector
several detectors
say you're doing a Stern-Gerlach experiment
and you've got a system
and you've got detector A
and detector B
well at some point
when you get this measurement transition
which is governed
by these kinds of probabilities
so you can know based on the materials
you're working with and the energies you're working with
in what period of time you can expect
to get these phenomena
and get the measurement transition to occur
and so that's why
when we're dealing with lasers and very large detectors
which have a large number of absorbers in them
we're virtually assured
that the rates are such that
within a few minutes
we're going to get stuff because
that's what the probabilities were telling
so then what do we get?
these little localized phenomena
well those are the particle-like phenomena
but there
my preference is the idea that
the ontology is really waves
and that the particle-like phenomena
occur from the discreteness
the fact that you've only got
say a field that has
you know
one
you've got field excitations
that go in units of
number of photons that the field can have
well suppose you've just got one
of excitation
that can only deliver one photon
well
you've got two basic macro absorbers
here that are responding
and they are contributing
of their contributing to cancel out
the advanced
fields from the emitter and so on
so they definitely contribute to this whole process
however only one of them can win
this is the collapse so this is that second stage
which I view as symmetry breaking
and when it does
only one of these
it's basically a
a single molecule
or whatever excitable bound state
is the one that wins that competition
is the one that will change
this chemical nature
to result in a phenomenon
that could eventually be amplified
to the point where you can see it
which is kind of what takes place in photographic film
you know that's why
we see an image there's a latent image
in photographic film
at the microscopic level
and it's at that point where we know a photon
has been absorbed even if
we don't have to talk about what is observation
you know what
how do I define measurement
is what I can observe
you don't have to ask those kinds of questions
all you have to do is say
when these probabilities dictate
it's overwhelmingly likely
that this transition
described by the probability has occurred
then it has occurred and
usually you can spot some consequence of it
but even if you can't
you can know that
physics isn't lying to you
and that what we call measurement
has happened
and the other way to think about
this whole measurement thing
that has gotten so mystified
is to think about
I mean this is the way I like to think about
so what measurement
the idea of
how do observers
play into measurement
return measurement
so
what we know that
when we're around
and we're in a lab and we're doing observations
we can say that we're doing measurements
so we can say that
observers
we as observers
are sufficient
we're sufficient to say
that measurement is occurring
sufficient for
measurement
but the important thing is not
necessary
we're not that important
but we're just not really necessary
and I think that this little
simple logical point has been very confusing
because it is absolutely true
that when you're walking around
and you've got sense organs
which are basically absorbers and emitters
but functioning as absorbers
then clearly there's light
and clearly if I'm an absorber
then I'm getting a photon here and there
and lots of photons
and that enables me to construct
an image of phenomenal reality
and I'm participating in measurements
but I'm not necessary
it's not that important
so it's sort of like
now think of a rough analogy
so eating
that's a different action
eating habits when
humans are at dinner
who is at dinner
so that's definitely
sufficient condition
for humans
before eating to be taking place
taking place sufficient
but look at a Venn diagram
so
it's too small
so this is our eating
Venn diagram
so
humans
eat dinner
but there's also
an amoeba
dining on a
bacterium
insume bacterium
is constitutes eating
ok, so this is a simple logical point
so the same thing applies to measurement
basically the same
the same circle
humans in the lab
or anywhere
we're participating in measurement
but
Adam
absorbing photon
the real energy of the photon
the winning of the transaction
whatever
actually even just generating the confirmation
but not being the one that receives the photon
that constitutes this measurement
so the term measurement
it has these anthropomorphic connotations
that make it all confusing
but really all we mean
is non-unitary transition
so it is going on
when we are around
measuring things
it's also going on
when those conditions are satisfied
between microscopic objects
so that's the basic idea
and I think
I hope if I'm not mistaken
this allows us to
answer the concern
about ok, well
absorbers do this
and when they do that, that's measurement
and a lot of people are very skeptical
they expect infinite regress
because that's what we get everywhere else
in quantum
there can't really be a solution to the measurement problem
there's got to be something wrong with this
and I understand that
but in fact
it is quantifiable
that it's quantifiable
according to standard physics
and all we have to do
is have a model
in which
in order to have a real photon
existing at all
we must have both the emission
and the absorption
that they're both crucial components
of the creation of a real photon
that they're part of
and then in the math
I mean the mathematics of that
is presented very nicely by Davies
I can get a little bit more to those technical details
later if people want to see that
how the
absorber response
constitutes this free field
that plays the role
of in the classical real refinement theory
of that free field that's responsible
for the loss of energy
that's nothing other than the real photon
that is created that goes from the emitter
to the absorber
so that's sort of the
quantitative aspect
of how we get a measurement transition
does anyone want to
have any more concerns or
yes
so in quantum optics experiments
people send photons
and they say they use photons
to encode quantum information
or whatever
but these you will not say that they are real photons
because you have the
they involve the emitter
oh no, I mean
I can have this situation
and you can do any kinds of experiments
you want
in interesting optics experiments that involve
coherent states
interesting states
of the field
and you can create any state of the field
that you want
but still have the direct action theory
apply
so it is empirically equivalent
so the idea is
you are going to have any emitter somewhere
so you are going to have like a laser
or something whatever
and then you can have whatever kinds of systems
uncertain teams
scattering which would be unitary
so you can have interactions in which
you can have scattering
the photon might go in several possible ways
put it in a superposition of paths
and that is certainly part of it
so I mean whether or not
you are going to get
a transition
non-unitary transition
is simply described by these probabilities
so if you had objects
in your experiments
that would be interesting though
coherent state
or something in which the photon was
you are going to see
interference effects
things that are available only from unitary
you certainly can do that
and the way you do it is by making sure
that the materials
in this box
whatever materials are using
in your experiment are such that
the probability
that one of them is going to
everybody that is basically what you do in the lab
when you preserve
the non-unitary behavior at any stage
of your experiment
you are simply working with the kinds of materials
that are not going to trigger
this collapse
I mean like this is amplitude
as you can tell
any state has
a fine amplitude
and you have other states
and to save a collapse you need to
solve the measurement problem
and the measurement
and the measurement
you could have taken another state
it would not have been like it could have been
any orbit in the lab
and it would only collapse in one place
for example
well I mean you can take any system you want
and based on
the applicable transitions
you can find out
whether the particular system you are looking
at is going to trigger that transition
or not
within some reasonable time frame
and how do you do
well I mean
these kinds of amplitudes
I mean you can have an amplitude
to transition between two states
that is very rare
a very rare one
so if you want to foil collapse
in an experiment
if you want to sustain unitary
then you need to work with such that
in a Fermi's golden rule
for whatever materials you are working with
there is a really tiny decay rate
you know
a lot of materials are just not going to decay
for a long time
we are not going to absorb for a long time
and I think that when you work
with these materials in the lab
I mean anyone
it's common sense really
if I want to
make this photo on an interesting super position
such that unitary is preserved
in some part of its
process
in a detection screen
then I sure don't want to put a detection screen
there
putting a detection screen
here which would give us a which way
measurement
is precisely because the materials
in that are going to have a high
transition probability
so that within a minute
being you foil
you screw up your interference pattern
because you put something
accessible to the photon
such that you are going to get collapse
there, that's why you get a which way measurement
instead of a both ways measurement
but it's not for use
with this I mean we cannot
let's say you flip the polarization of the photon
using wave wave
this amplitude is equal to 1
that's the point of the
interactions to completely same
one state with the problem state
but it's not a measurement
it's just a unitary
so you cannot blindly use this rule
in this
well enough blindly
using the rule, if you want
are you saying you would like to effect a unitary
polarization flip
you can do that
there's nothing about calculating
this that precludes
using materials that will
unitarily rotate the polarization
but you would not do that
by putting a hunk of absorbing
stuff here, I mean you would have
a force field, you would have
a magnetic field, a stirred-gerlock apparatus
whatever that's not
made of a bunch of absorbing
materials
so I mean you do whatever you want
and you can do whatever unitary
transitions you want
no physicist would say, well let's see
I'm going to take an experiment
and I would like to put a photon in
and I would like to unitary
change its spin of polarization
great
well no physicist is going to say
let me calculate this
I didn't put any absorber
here
so that probability
would not apply to anything
in this part of the experiment
it's only when you're
looking at particular systems
that can emit
this has some probability of emitting
but
where it's going to end up is governed
by whatever materials
you're using
or the ones
whatever kinds of transitions
can happen in that material
that's what you're going to be calculating
in a probability of
so I mean it's not like I'm saying
you should do this calculation
when it doesn't apply to this part of
no of course you can have unitary
processes
it's just that when you're
looking at where did my detection happen
what am I going to do when I want to
detect a result
that I can write down
those are always happening
because something like this
this decay rate happened
because the photon
was emitted here and then
detected at the final spot
and that's what the probability
applies to
this is just a very simple example
that only deals with
a simple emitter
and an available absorber
somewhere in its vicinity
and where there is no intervening
forces
that's certainly if you want to think
about those kinds of situations that
involves much more complicated calculation
so I would like to know
this sort of
absorption is in a sense
absolute
but there is a wrong way
to describe this unit
from somebody who would be able
to trace
all degrees
I'm going towards
kind of being a friend situation
so I would like to know what is your take
that's sort of what Schrodinger called the damn quantum jumps
and what they are
when you have a fox state
so it's well known that the fox state
is basically an excited state
in the field with
for simplicity one photon
which we'll mention in the case
well it's notorious that
in a situation where you know
you've got one photon
you've managed to detect it later
absorb it
you also unfortunately cannot say anything
about when it was emitted
or when it was absorbed
in its proportion to its energy
but it sits in uncertainty relation
so there is actually
an uncertainty relation that accompanies
particle number
particle number
and phase
uncertainty relation
where phase is related to time
you can tag the behavior
of the process
or the wave or whatever
to a time index
and that quantum mechanics
tells us that the generation
of these states
with well defined
photon number
quantum number
are completely unpredictable
they have no defined phase
when we have a wave
like a classical EM wave
with very well defined phase
we only get that because
we're working with a quantum state
of maximal uncertainty
as to how many photons
there are in it
those are the coherent states
and so called coherent states
there's no factor of matter
about photon number
so what these actually deal with
the situations where atoms are
within this time uncertainty
of their decay process
if you sort of map it
if you sort of say okay well
here's time
and the probability
that
at some time there's a decay rate
fairly constant
according to Fermi's golden rule
that
when you're in a time zone
that's or maybe it's exponential
I should know that
in some characteristic time
in say a half life
say tau
so you're dealing with a real atom
here's an excited atom
e excited atom
and
this electron
also has an absorber
at least one absorber and that's why
it can even think about decay
well there's this period of uncertainty
where there is no factor of matter
about whether this thing is decayed
and there are actually ways to store coherent states
because you've got an atom
that's actually sort of
in a superposition
of having excited
and unexcited
because it's within this uncertainty
range of at a particular time
tau
if there's like half
then it's really
in a superposition
and that's all we know
so that's the sense in which
when we're in this
time constant period
where there's really very clear
uncertainty about whether a given
atom is decayed or not
or a given atom is absorbed or not
they really are in these superpositions
and that's how people create these interesting
optics experiments
where they're actually storing these kind of
states that again the field
has no definite number
of photons in it
and it's when we're in the zone
no clear factor
the matter about whether decay
whether emission is occurred or not
that we get these more exotic states
but again
you can predict it so that you can say
well by the time I've gotten
to here where the probability
is almost one
call this tau f
then I can be pretty sure
that the thing has decayed
but that's the only sense
we can never say oh I know
it's decay now
that's part of the uncertainty
after this tau f
it's decay for everybody
it's no way to re-coher the thing
it's just absolutely decay
well
when you have a phenomenon
such as when you can detect
that an absorbing atom
is in an excited state
when there are ways of seeing
whether one of your absorbers is excited
then you can trust
especially when your
your process
occurred in such a time
that its probability of decaying
was overwhelming
that's what the physics tells you
then yes
and you have company evidence
that another system became excited
then those are measurement processes
that yes with probability one
the measurement transition occurred
within this time scale
so if I may now be more specific
in the bigger kind situation
would you suggest
in this interpretation
that the state
of the frame
is inside and performs dimensions
at the end
collapses
in each other see and sense collapses
and it's not possible to re-coher
well yeah I mean I would say
according to this analysis
if you have some kind of unstable atom
in your Geiger counter
and apply physics to it
then you will get decay rates
for in one period of time
will this decay
so you have in this
within one hour
but
the other issue is
that
when you have a macroscopic system
this is something I've dealt with in another paper
the more absorbers you have
the more
likely it is
that decay has occurred somewhere
because you're basically
let me just kind of lay this down
as duly as I can
so when you've got
the cat in the box
and you've got a Geiger counter
let's say you've got this Geiger counter
it's composed of a large number
of absorbing atoms
so for only one
if you were only dealing with one
absorbing atom
you would have this nominal transition rate
but once you've got a lot of them
that actually
raises the probability enormously
that within a much shorter time
you're going to have at least one of these guys
confirm
and you're going to get your measurement transition
so how that works is
suppose we go back to
let's see how I'm just erasing this stuff
is there an eraser?
so
oh well
let's see
okay
so
if we go back to
our basic little interaction
and think of
these things are bound
perhaps these are
bound currents
so this excited electron
we'll call it E
and call this a ground state electron
so once again
the basic probability
that we're going to get an offer and a confirmation
and a non-nevateric transition
is given by the fine structure constant
which is basically
the square of the
electromagnetic charge
and it turns out to be about 1 over 137
so this is a pretty small number
it's about 0.007
something like that
so if you've only got one of these
because you've got one unstable atom
absorbing atom
then the possibility
and this doesn't involve the transition rates
and the time dependence
but because I haven't put in the transition probabilities
but this is your basic coupling probability
that
the Feynman called the basic probability
to enable or absorb a real photon
so this is kind of a
a local bound on how
likely or maybe an upper bound
on how probable these processes are
but we'll just use it as a very rough approximation
so suppose the probability
was that within an hour
there was this chance
that it was going to
generate the measurement transition
but that's very small
but the minute you start having larger systems
larger absorbing systems
so we
we can look now at
that change, we can look now at the probability
let's
look at the complement
so the probability that no confirming response
no absorption
happens is going to be
one minus this, this is just the complement
so the complement that
this is the possibility that we do get
the transition, this is the probability
that we don't, so it's the complement of it
so it turns out to be
about 0.993
pretty darn high
so it's very likely that nothing's going to happen
in that situation it's going to remain unitary
there's going to continue to be superpositions
and so on
but that
suppose we have something
that counts as a detector
let me see
ok
so it's the probability that
we've got now n
of these absorbing systems
probability that in n of them
there will be no
confirmed
response
it's going to be the same thing
the same number
in n
so I'm just independent probability
so as I increase my detection
apparatus
such that it's made of
bunch of atoms that can potentially absorb
the probability that none of them will
absorb is this
large number to the n but this is going to get
smaller as n increases
so it turns out that
when you start having macroscopic
objects like a Geiger counter which is designed
to be detector it's designed to absorb
so that n is getting
to be really really large
I'm just plugged in some numbers
like say 10 to the 23
absorbing systems in it
and when you get
that the probability
basically goes to zero
so what that means is
with that many systems in it the probability
that it will not trigger
the measurement transition is zero
so basically that means
that the probability that it will
is one
so
that's kind of an argument
why
when you're dealing with
a system like the short of your cat experiment
even if you've got
nominally
an unstable atom whose half life is
an hour or half an hour or whatever
that only
is for
they may do it for
an absorbing shell
and not sure how
they do that calculation
but
I think that if you take into account
the macroscopic
objects here
then the macroscopic absorbing objects
then we say in a certain time
rather than just being the probability
being very small
that there will be a measurement transition
the probability that there will be
confirmations by at least one of those
is
approaching unity
so that's why in this picture
it's overwhelmingly likely
that you're going to get collapse
at some point in this box
real
object to have 1023
and real
atoms
half lives
so this is kind of
in reality
this can be measured
it is not zero
and even if we want
to say
this particular analysis
wouldn't apply to
the level of the
emitting atom
the fact is that
you could still have
a factor of the matter
suppose
the atom itself
is in that superposition
so you can have it
the atom
would still be
excited
plus
decay
so there's still
a time
dependence to this
but nevertheless just as before
even though there's a high uncertainty
as to the time period
so it's got a very slow time constant
but nevertheless
so the direct action theory gives you
is that
there is a fact of the matter
when this thing does decay
so it's not the case
that anything else in the box
or the Geiger counter
could
when there's a confirmation
that's described not by an amplitude
but by a probability
so that's the difference here
you've got
the atom in a superposition
the claim is that the superposition
is confined to the atom
because when you've got
in order to have that real
whatever it is decay product
you must have a confirmation
and the existence
of a confirmation always comes
with the corresponding offer
there's a mutuality there
and that is described by a probability
not an amplitude
so there's a well defined probability
here once again the applicable
decay rate
which may be a long one
but because there's a probability
in the standard unitary only approach
the amplitude of decay
is described only by
it's described only by an amplitude
because it's unitary
the difference here is that it has a well defined probability
so just as in this same picture
you've got say this picture
and
got the unstable atom here
and then you've got potential absorbers
there's a well defined probability
for this
offer
confirmation to occur and that's the difference
is that you've got
the square
of something
just symbolize it with that
there's an actual square
of these factors
the transition amplitudes
and alpha
so you've got
transition amplitude
initial final
the perturbation that's causing the instability
so you've got a probability here
so even though
there's a long time constant
uncertainty
about when it will decay
there's an actual well defined probability
that
there's a non unitary transition
and so the difference
is that the choices are
for some period of time
which you can't predict up to time t
it's in the
superposition
so
it's an excited
plus
state
there's a well defined probability
that after that
it will
have decay
there's uncertainty but it's a probabilistic uncertainty
it's not an amplitude
it's not a unitary process
so I hope that clarifies
the difference as to
why we can say that
at some point
at the level of the decaying atom
it has a real probability
of decaying
and the probability doesn't just come from
an ad hoc squaring
the board rule
well I don't know where the cut is
but I'm just going to square it
it's an actual physical process
that forces us to square
this process
because there are real absorbers
whose participation is required
in order to have that happen
so it's a probability rather than an amplitude
so that's why there's a determinant
matter of fact
you said that this
offer of conglomation occurs
so I really wonder
is it a mathematical concept
just to verify the mathematics
behind this
or is this any kind of physical idea
of the current if yes
then what do you mean by it occurs
I do mean
that a field is generated
so I mean that a physical process
is generated
that is
this response of the absorber
coming back to
back up at the top here
let's see
let me get that
so this picture
he had it in a kind of a backwards order
the picture B
is the basic
time symmetric
this is the basic
time symmetric connection
between fields
but
this only exists
if there is absorber response
so it's a physical field
and when it occurs
and that's a probabilistic
it's a probabilistic situation
so it's uncertain
but described by a well defined probability
basically the Fermi's golden rule
and when that field exists
we get this physical
process of cancellation
of the advanced fields
and cancellation of retardant fields
beyond the absorber so we get
the real full energy field
that is the real photon
without the absorber response
we don't have this
and we only have this time symmetric field
and that's what I think of as a virtual photon
no real energy is transferred
it remains unitary
but nothing like
what we have in physics
where we have this
some kind of
of response
things like resonance
and something that is nothing
concerned with the time delay
energy and all these issues happens
because here is some kind of communication
between two systems
and at least in classical
ideas
you have some
some time delay
and so on
some energy
it's very non-classical
it's very non-classical in the sense
that these processes
are not really
taking place in a space
in a way that can be tagged to a time index
in the process
so that gets to questions
of how are we to understand
the claim that
there can be real physical processes
I hope I can find this
that are not
amenable to a space time
description that can't really be thought of
as occurring in space time
and actually
so this is sort of like
with your classical fields
you have everything indexed
to space and time
in a causal way
my proposal
is that quantum theory is describing
empirical processes
and we all know quantum theory
has nonlocality
and so on
it already has these features
that challenge those classical ideas
of cause and effect
and the structures of relativity
so this is one of them
that does these kinds of
field interactions
that I claim are physically real
but that are precursors
because they are precursors to space time events
they themselves cannot be
tied to time indices
in the usual way
they can be tied to time indices
if you're in the Heisenberg picture of operators
and so on
but it is possible
to at a certain level
but certainly
with the question of
how am I going to explain
why and when and how
or at least why and when
there is a response
that's indeterministic
it's fundamental
so you give up space time
but you preserve mathematics
so it's kind of priority
of mathematics over
well I see it that way
I see it as
Heisenberg was forced
to just kind of give up classical model making
and when he did that
he came up with this mathematics
that described the empirical phenomena
that he was seeing
so he didn't even
he didn't know what a matrix was
but what he, you know
the brilliance in my opinion
is that he said
okay I'm not having any success
in making a picture of what's going on
I don't see, I can't visualize what's going on
but if I just look at energy levels
discrete energy levels
and the way they relate to each other
I get these laundry lists
that was the math
that was the theory
through Heisenberg
who was able to kind of have a beginner's mind
and just go okay I don't know what's going on
but here's the math
that seems to describe the phenomena
so rather than prioritize math
because certainly we can come up with any old
crazy mathematical theory we want
that has nothing to do with anything
but quantum theory in my view
was a theory that is a mathematical construct
that worked
and that's why I'm motivated to say
well maybe it's describing a structure
even though it can't be a space-time structure
but that's kind of the idea
this gentleman is going to
this speculation
you say that the structure
and it's weird but
there's no possible way
we can ever measure it
so I wouldn't say that the structure
is weird but it is like
a concept to
explain
fixed attack in reality
but it still has this
but it still has this
weak point like
it cannot explain
which of these
positive states
are weird as
so it is
well see it's definitely a weakness
we could have the same concern
about the Higgs mechanism
if you're not happy with the idea
of spontaneous symmetry breaking
then that would be a reason to reject the Higgs mechanism
and not to reject it
but say that it's not a complete
theory and it has to be
in mind or something like that
yes
but I don't understand
how this is method
in interpretation except
that it explains
the one rule
this is the only thing
that is better
because it explains
the one rule but I think
it's
more realistic
well again that goes to
and I thank you for saying
that it explains the one rule
because if that's all it did that would be great
I'm happy with that
I understand your concern about
am I building a little castle in the air
here and I don't ever want
to do things like that however
I think that
it's a reasonable idea to suppose
that if a different theory
of the way fields work
can explain
what is I think kind of an anomaly
of the original theory where it's just
oh there's this born rule that
God it works and I don't know why
and I don't know at what point we should apply it
if you have a theory of fields that then
answers those questions
and also
provides reference
for quantities in the
theory such as the advanced states
the dual states that are just
mathematical machinery
if it seems to be
it's kind of an inference to the best explanation argument
that there are things about
the theory that we don't understand
why does it work so well
why does it have these strange non-local features
why do you have to use
the born rule
at what point is there a measurement
if you have a different
picture of the way fields behave
that can answer all these questions
and to me seems like a fairly consistent
natural way
then that would be kind of an inference to the best explanation
and it's not observable dependent
I mean Copenhagen is very much
I have
well I have a paper
called Beyond Complimentarity
that is a fairly sustained critique
of Bohr's statements
and I argue that he actually
really said a lot of inconsistent things
and I don't think that
that picture
really holds together in a kind of
fundamental way
I mean in contrast this is a statement
about the way fields behave
it's hard to visualize
but
it's sort of like if you think about
how many of you have read the book Flatland
it's a little parable
about
shapes that live in a flat world
and from there
all of their experience
is two dimensional
and so at some point
this one guy who's a square
who's an upstanding well-behaved citizen
is visited by a sphere
this guy lives in
higher dimensional realm
and the sphere gets a lot of flak
from the square
for lying and trying to put
something over on him and trying to trick him
because he's doing all these crazy non-local things
and
I think it's a good analogy
because the square is used
to certain kinds of explanations
and the sphere can do things
that challenge those forms of explanation
and don't make any sense
and so eventually
the sphere actually resorts to kicking the square
out of Flatland
and the square is forced to get out
oh my god there's more to reality
than I could ever perceive or suspect
and of course then he comes back
and then they put him in jail at some parasy
and then at some point the sphere
goes to a hypersphere
there's a key point in the sphere
that is a four-dimensional sphere
and says
oh no
so it said
the sphere is challenged by
the square's grandson
the grandson says hey
if there can be beings like you
then that means there could also be
four-dimensional beings
that would be larger than what you can experience
and of course the sphere got very upset
very indignant about that
that's a stupid idea
and the moral I guess
I could be completely wrong
and this might be completely delusional
but I think that an interesting
way to explore quantum theory
realistically
it is to say is it just simply referring
to stuff that is
precursor to spacetime
this spacetime has to be the whole story
and I'm not the only one
with this possible delusion
Anton Zeilinger has recently
I don't know if I have a quote in front of me
but
he recently proposed that we should
perhaps
subject the concept
of space and time
to the same kind of critical evaluation
that we have other concepts
that we may have had to let go of
so
it's something to think about
that there may be processes
that are very real
and by process there was always white head
I mean white head is very hard to read
but
who long ago
was talking about process philosophy
and the idea that
reality is more than just
isolated phenomena
that there are these processes
now I depart from his account
in the sense that
I don't bring in experience
and consciousness as a fundamental ingredient
of these processes
so my approach could be seen as
kind of radical
in the sense that I'm saying
I think quantum theory is pointing to
real physics
real physical processes that are simply
outside
the space times construct
but I'm more conservative and stodgy
and viewed as a real reactionary
by the people who are claiming
that quantum theory tells us
that consciousness is vital
and that you need consciousness
and the reason I reject that is because
invoking consciousness as a means
of defining measurement doesn't work
it doesn't work
I think it's neither necessary nor sufficient
because the Wigner's friend argument
already
Wigner's friend argument
already tells us that
there's just an infinite
regress what counts as your external
conscious observer
it's arbitrary
and you can never say
at what point measurement has occurred
I think with this account
you can give a physical account
that has well defined probabilities
that measurement has occurred
it still
maybe feels deficient to some of us
who feel like
there should be
a very clear causal
account that can be tagged
to a time index and so on
but that I would suggest
is the nature of the quantum
reality
is that it is fundamentally
unrealistic
and this is why
I think Heisenberg wanted to
refer to it as this realm of possibility
that is sort of in between
maybe just an idea
that we might have
it's in between just an abstract idea
and the concrete spacetime
phenomena that can all corroborate
to make that distinction
more clear
it's not idealistic in the sense that
I don't want to claim that
there was a criticism of this idea by
Quine
who critiqued the idea of that possible
fat man in the doorway
that not everything you just
randomly cook up
has some physical reality
or physical significance
but I think quantum theory is specifically
a theory of those objects that do have
physical reality
but just not spacetime
phenomenal reality
so
for what I understand
the difference between
realism
and idealism
is a subject that
the reality is created
by ideas
and realism says that
ideas are a product
of reality because
when a human way
exists in reality
and because of some
evolutionary processes
that developed to a stage
where it's called this
ideas
yes
and from this part of your
don't think that it's more realistic
than compagated interpretation
because
unobserved parts
are like unobserved
very wave function
in compagated interpretations
so
yes
bor was interesting
about that
he called the wave function
unobservable and abstract
and yet he would say things like
it is only when it interacts
with
concrete things
that it becomes
and that hasn't explained what the interaction is
so I think a lot of
it was sand waving
so I don't want to be compared to the
co-pregnated interpretation
but I think he was
kind of in denial about
I think he was very anti-realist
about in other words
what he did was
he implicitly required
that real means
tip of the iceberg
that real means classical
I don't think he ever came out and said that
but when you look at what he says
he implicitly kind of required that
so when he talked about the wave function
he really
said abstract
he meant that it was not physically real
now what I'm saying in contrast is
the stuff going on
in the iceberg is just as real
as what the Titanic ran into
I mean physically real
they couldn't see it
but we run into quantum theory
we can't get away from it
we physically run into quantum systems
and that's why we had to develop quantum theory
and if they weren't physically real
then we didn't need to
we would never have had quantum theory
but we could have developed
a completely different theory
which leads to the same
physical results
so
yes
we would have had to have some theory
that accounted for the phenomena
that are observed from quantum systems
and so I argue that
those quantum systems are real
whether we like it or not
they're real
and I just suggest we need to expand our notion
of what real means
that real means more than just
the space time level
we just drifted from
the lecture to the discussion
so once we have another break before
oh sure, yes
if you would like we can just continue
it's up to you guys
it's cooler in here
people aren't fainting anymore
so I'm happy to chat
so
there are not many questions
if you are not fine
we can continue with a few questions
it's up to you
if anyone is really
just feeling completely confused
and unhappy then I would love
to try to deal with that
so you won't go away
and students
can join them
and they can help
there are few questions more
as you have questions
gentlemen, back there
oh, they were okay
thank you for keeping track
just to clarify what you mean by process
um
well
the objects, I mean to tie them
to mathematical quantities
this time symmetric propagator
I view as a process
I view it as something that is
physically going on among systems
so I view
these are really field correlations
they are a kind of field correlation
in that sense
I'm going to be agnostic
but I don't presume
to tell you the fields are made of this
and there are substances
I don't know
I'm more of a structural realist
but what I'm saying is that
I think these entities are real
I can't visualize them
I can't tell you what they are made of
I can characterize them
as possibilities
as dynamicity
to them
but then for any kind of dynamic
so processes in standard ways
maybe we should
you need to do time
so how do you
how do you
I would say that
I wouldn't just send to the idea
that dynamicism means
a space time index
so you can have
I think you can have
dynamical things going on
but
this requires an expanded
meaning or interpretation
of what we mean by dynamic
because actually
look at it the other way
there are many people who believe
in either a block world
or in a deterministic system
in such a system
and that's it
suppose we think space time is unfolding
in a deterministic manner
and we think that
that isn't
people have argued
there's a philosophy
who had a very sustained argument
that
those kinds of processes
are just
they're pseudo dynamic
because they're inevitable
they're just sort of
it's like unrolling
a role of events
that's already been decided
and the time index
just indexes how far
you've unrolled it
and one can make a case
that's only sort of an apparent
dynamics
that it's just kind of
there's no real change
it's just nothing that's really changing
it's just inevitable
there's just some set of events
that was already preordained
from the beginning
whether we have a block world
which is all pre-decided
then
we can call that dynamic
but it's just sort of
you know
you can say well god already knows
or someone who could stand outside the process
there's no dynamics there
no real dynamics
because everything is already set
this event is going to happen
at that time
so what I'm proposing is that in determinism
that the real dynamics comes
having quantum systems
and these interactions
that
indeterministically give rise
to spacetime events
and then I think that's a real dynamism
no I mean you can have
a sense of processes
I would argue that
it's harder to
understand the idea of process
when you're not using a time index
but you could think of it
in a less concrete way
by saying suppose I have
a series of numbers
a sequence of numbers
I can say that only six comes after
five and four
so you can still have a betweenness
before and after
you can have a kind of order
I would have an order
I mean it's a partial ordering
I actually go into
how this picture can underline
the causal set picture
of Sorkin and his collaborators
where you have a partial ordering
the causal set being a spacetime
the spacetime construct
that is a growing kind of spacetime
but that contributing to that
there's a dynamic
underpinning to
how events kind of get
wrinkled into that set
so and I don't
this is food for thought
this is stuff I have
I don't claim to have a definitive
fury of
and they're really interesting questions
I would just say that just because
something isn't going on
within the XYZT
spacetime construct doesn't mean
that you can't think of this dynamic
that would be the only way
respond to that
I happen to be a philosopher
who is specializing
in the questions of realism
which is not in the meaning
because I wanted to chime in on that
that the name currently escapes
there is a philosophy paper
from 9 to 191
where he said that real has an existence
in management and independence
I mentioned so
I personally find it very useful
to take existence in the general category
to decide between
real and non-real existence
within the context of real
the time that is existing
mind as an object
or sort of independently
and non-real existence
to be defined as an existing subject
mind or sort of independently
that brings us to
the idealism versus realism
distinction
that in my view
the two most important ideas
are partially and cannot
there is
a fundamental difference
between the idealism
that is done in all real objects
it is just God
that provides the consistency of our phenomena
there is to come to the process
of the things themselves
and
that is a main distinction
but what both partially
and cannot share
is physical anti-realism
which is that everything physically
independently
What was that last thing you checked?
Everything physically only exists
observably, independently
as the first thing
that is going to be applied
to the physical which we went with
in the normal world
so in that respect
I have to sum object to your physical real
it sounds to be like a contradiction to me
but we are just interested in talking about
physically just an existence
being more real and summed more
well that is really interesting
that involves
a much more subtle
distinction and definition
of terms that I have really
considered
and I don't necessarily want to reject it
that might be a helpful way
to kind of convey these
ideas because I realize
it is kind of surprising
to say that these unobservable
things are physically real
I certainly claim
that they exist
that they aren't
what is described by a physical theory
so in that sense
that's why I call them physically real
that they exist and they're described
by what we think of as a physical theory
but I thank you for raising
those other possible definitions
yeah
I think that something is
so it doesn't mean
that it's physically
not real or something
it's like the example
if you have like two points
in spacetime that
are other space
space like connected
then
the time
already depends on the observer
but
still if you have one
or in Russia observer
in speciality you can
tell the time of a great other
in Russia
observer
and in general
it's kind of more complicated
because
of the complicated structure
space standards
the principle is
the same
and
other
I just said
a different question
you said that
there
in this interpretation
in the technical theory
there
you understand
this is also ok
or things
understand
this is also ok stuff
and
you also have
this in the copy interpretation
but
you can still make the copy interpretation
consistent with
special relativity
just assume
that there is no
information transmitted in
normal processes
can you also do it
with this
in the
oh yes, I mean
the denominator
is basically
applying only to
those processes that are
in this time
and when you have
this special transition
the
the actualization of those outcomes
always obey
relativity in theory
whether it's the part
that gets us
to the truth of the iceberg
always obeys
relativity
so in that sense
it is certainly consistent
and
maybe have different descriptions
of the same events
I don't take that as
meaning that reality is observer dependent
I just think that
relativity already tells us
that we're going to describe
a phenomena differently based on
our frame
and what's important though
is that you do have invariance
you have invariance in relativity theory
that everyone can agree on
and part of what you get from this
particular approach
when you're actualizing
measurement outcomes
is you're getting a spacetime interval
hadn't really gone into this today
but what you're actually generating
is an invariant
spacetime interval
so if you look at
a spacetime diagram
if we think of ourselves as sort of
on the tip of the iceberg
metaphorically
this getting actualized is
an initial event
and an absorption event
and the
transferred photon
provides the structure
that connects those two events
and constitutes that invariant interval
so for instance
if I just happen to be
we can have measurement without people
we can have an absorbing atom
but this happens to be your eye
and the absorber is in your eye
and then this sort of defines a now
when I have an
experience of some
phenomenon
then if this defines my now
then in a sense
this is also actualizing
this is a sense in which there is a very limited form
of what people call retro causality
although I don't like to think of it as retro causality
because it's not traveling
backwards in time
it's part of the
creation, the party actualization
of the spacetime construct
is what's created
is this event in
my present as well as the emission
event in the past
relative to where I am
in the present
and this really kind of harmonizes
with Wheeler's delayed choice experiment
you know that
without being the observer dependent
because this doesn't have to be a person
I mean it could be an absorbing atom
that whenever this absorption happens
as described by well-defined probabilities
you get spacetime
intervals actualized
and those are invariants
so in that sense they're not observer dependent
they're not frame dependent
although different people once they can
know about these events
through auxiliary light signals
can all corroborate that these events happen
but they'll describe them different
so yeah
I was just wondering
and you can clarify
what is the ontological difference
between the metadata observer
and the waves
can the metadata observer also be described
by the awful way of thinking
good question
that I forgot to cover
yes they are
if you're dealing with say microscopic
emitters and absorbers
they are bound states
so they are, you can think of them as
we've got a nucleus
system of if you like
offer waves
they're quantum states
they're in the submerged portion of the iceberg
now if you've got one or more electrons
say you've got a hydrogen atom
this you can think of as a bound
electron offer wave
so suppose it's in its ground state
it's an offer wave
but it's bound
and the fact that it's bound
is what allows it to serve
as an emitter
in its ground state
because that would violate conservation
and similarly
if you've got an absorber
you've got a same system
where it's in an excited state
it's a bound system
and it can serve as an emitter
because it has eternal degrees of freedom
that can drop down to
and so on
so that's the key difference
between emitters and absorbers
and offer waves
and if you've got a photon
offer wave like this
this is an object
that can receive a confirmation
and constitute
that projection operator
that signals that a measurement has occurred
and the distinction also is
that this photon
offer wave
when there's emission and absorption
we have the offer and the confirmation
we have both of them
meanwhile
these objects
change their eternal states
so the emitters and absorbers
just simply change their internal states
so that's the difference
where you can think of them as bound offer waves
but they're not free
they don't initiate confirmations
like you don't have an electron
going out and initiating
directly initiating an electron confirmation wave
that's another technical issue
that I do go into that in one of my papers
and I can refer people
who want to hear more about that
I can refer you to a paper on that
Any other questions?
OK, so there are no questions
and thank you very much
for being here.
