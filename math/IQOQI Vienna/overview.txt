Checking IQOQI Vienna/Scientific Realism - lecture by Dr. Ruth Kastner.txt
 The discussion revolves around the concept of invariance in relativity theory and how it applies to quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of John Archibald Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Invariance in Relativity Theory**: In relativity theory, spacetime intervals are invariant, meaning they are the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion or choice of coordinates. This is a fundamental aspect of relativistic physics.

2. **Quantum Measurement and Spacetime Intervals**: In quantum mechanics, when a measurement is made (such as a photon being emitted and then absorbed), an invariant spacetime interval is actualized. This interval connects the emission event to the absorption event and is part of the structure that is created by the act of measurement.

3. **Metadata Observer vs. Waves**: The metadata observer in this context can be a person, an atom, or any system capable of making a measurement. The waves being discussed are not just photons but also bound states like electrons in atoms, which can serve as emitters or absorbers of photons. These bound states are quantum systems with eternal degrees of freedom that can change their internal states through emission and absorption processes.

4. **Emitters and Absorbers**: Emitters and absorbers are bound offer waves. They can change their eternal states by emitting or absorbing a photon, respectively. The act of emitting or absorbing is not initiating a confirmation; it's changing the internal state of the system in response to an external influence (the incoming photon).

5. **Photon Offer and Confirmation Waves**: A photon is an offer wave that can be confirmed upon interaction with another system capable of making a measurement. The confirmation wave signals that a measurement has occurred, and this interaction leads to a change in the internal state of the emitter or absorber.

6. **Delayed-Choice Experiment**: This thought experiment by Wheeler illustrates the idea that the choice between which path a photon takes can be made after the photon has already left the source. It highlights the observer's role in quantum mechanics and how measurement outcomes are not fixed until they are actualized through observation or interaction.

The speaker emphasizes that the ontological difference between the metadata observer and the waves is that the former can initiate a confirmation, while the latter (emitters and absorbers) cannot; they only respond to confirmations initiated by the offer waves. The discussion also touches on the idea that different observers can corroborate the occurrence of these events through auxiliary light signals, but they will describe them differently based on their frames of reference.

The speaker offers to refer interested individuals to a paper that delves deeper into the technical aspects of how emitters and absorbers change their eternal states during emission and absorption processes.
