So this lecture is part of an online algebraic geometry course about schemes and in it we
will construct the etal space of a sheaf.
So we introduced sheaves and pre-sheaves last lecture and most people's initial impression
on encountering sheaves as they seem to be a unnecessarily complicated and abstract way
of talking about functions on a space.
So I'll start by giving an example to show why we might want to work with sheaves rather
than functions on a space.
So on the left hand side let's just look at the space of regular functions on the affine
line.
There are two polynomials over the complex numbers and the affine line c just corresponds
to the maximal ideals of this ring.
So we recall that if you've got a point alpha in c it just corresponds to the maximal ideal
of all multiples of x minus alpha.
And we have the Zariski topology which says the open sets have a basis of sets df which
is the set of points where f is not equal to zero, f is some polynomial.
And we also have the regular functions on each open set.
So we have f of df is just all polynomials of the form g over f to the n, so all rational
functions of this form.
So these are the rational functions that are regular on the set df.
So f will have a finite number of zeros, the open set will be the complement of the zeros
and these are functions which are regular except possibly for poles at those zeros.
Now we can do the same for the ring of integers z.
So here we're just going to sort of copy this.
So instead of the affine line well we're going to take the set of maximal ideals.
So we have the maximal ideals of two, three, five and so on.
So this is called the maximal spectrum of the integers and as we will see later it turns
out to be the wrong thing to do.
You should really take all prime ideals rather than maximal ideals but that will be coming
later.
Anyway we take the open sets df and here f is going to be an integer and the open set
is going to be the set of primes such that f is not in this prime ideal.
In other words p does not divide f.
So this is exactly what happened here.
The open set just corresponds to the point such that f isn't in the maximal ideal.
And we're going to define fdf to be the set of rational numbers of the form g over f to
the n where g is some some integer.
So this is exactly analogous to this.
So we're sort of pretending that an integer is a function on this space here and there's
a bit of a difference because here a polynomial is a function on c taking so f as values in
c at all points of c.
Well here it's a little bit more complicated because you might think of an integer as being
a function on spec z and what's it taking values in?
Well here this is just the quotient c of x over the x minus a.
So f naturally takes values in this field.
Well here the field is going to be z over p.
So an integer is taking values in fields but the field varies with the point.
So it's a sort of funny sort of function it's not taking values in a fixed space it's taking
values in a variable field.
And more generally it would be better to think of as taking values in a local ring rather
than a field but we weren't worried about that point now.
And it also this also satisfies the sheaf property.
So in other words it really integers really are behaving as if they were functions.
So for example let's look at the points two three five seven and so on and let's take
a couple of open sets.
So I might take an open set u1 here and I might take an open set u2 here.
And then f of u1 is equal to all functions or all integers of the form a over well we're
allowed a power of two or three in it so two to the something times three to the something.
So we're only lying twos and threes in the denominator and similarly f of u2 is all functions
where we allow twos and fives in the denominator sorry all integers not all functions.
And now if we set u that's u2 if we set u equals u1 union u2 well this will be all things
of the form c over two to the something and now the sheaf property says that if you've
got a number in over this open set so I suppose b over two to the something times five to
the something has the same restriction to u intersection u1 as f of u as as something
in f of u1 then it has to come from some function on this set u in other words an
integer with only twos in the denominator and that's kind of obvious if you've got an
into a rational number with only twos and fives in the denominator and it's also has
only twos and threes in the denominator then obviously it only has a two in the denominator
so this is going to be if we've got this property then it's of the form c over two to the something.
So the sheaf property on this rather funny sheaf turns out to be this basic property
coming from I guess the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and the point of this is you
can now study the ring z by thinking geometrically you think of z as being functions on a space
well obviously for the ring z this isn't going to tell you anything very new about the integers
because it's so well known for more complicated rings this way of looking at the ring geometrically
can be can be very powerful. So a basic theme of sheaves is that sheaves of sets are sort
of very similar to behave in the same way as sets and similarly sheaves of abelian groups
are very similar to abelian groups. So we've only defined sheaves of abelian groups but if you
want to define sheaves of sets you need to modify the definition very slightly which we
won't worry about because we're only going to use sheaves of sets as informal examples.
In particular we can form a category of sheaves of sets in the category of sheaves of abelian
groups for these we want you to find morphisms from a sheaf u to a sheaf g sorry sheaf f to a
sheaf g. So what's a morphism from a sheaf f to a sheaf g well it's pretty obvious what we should
do is for each open set u we should give a morphism from f of u to f of g and moreover
these should be compatible with restriction maps so if v is contained in u then we have maps f of v
to g of v and we have these restriction maps rho and I'm not going to write rho u of v because I
will get u and v the wrong way around. So a morphism consists of morphisms like this for each u
such that this diagram commutes whenever v is contained in u. So this makes sheaves
into a category we've got a set of objects and morphisms between them so the the category
of sheaves of sets over a space is behaves very much like the category of sets it's a
sort of weak model of set theory it's not quite a model of set theory because things like the
action of choice of a bit of a tendency to fail in it. This is called a topos and there's a whole
theory of topos where the idea is you sort of do set theory except instead of working with sets
you work with sheaves over a topological space or something like that and similarly sheaves of
abelian groups that the category of sheaves of abelian groups is very similar to the category
of abelian groups and this is a sort of theme of sheaf theory that when you're studying sheaves
of abelian groups what you do is you try and think of some constructional theorem about
abelian groups and extend it to sheaves of abelian groups. So the first question is what about
exact sequences so we might have an exact sequence a goes to b goes to c goes to naught of abelian
groups which you remember means a is more or less a subgroup of b and the quotient of b by a is more
or less equal to c so we want to do the same thing for sheaves so what what does it mean
for a sequence
naught goes to a goes to b goes to c goes to naught of sheaves
to be exact
well it's completely obvious I mean any idiot can figure out what the definition of this should be
all you do is you say naught goes to a of u goes to b of u goes to c of u goes to naught is exact
for all you I mean this is a very natural definition and there's no other obvious
thing you could have so this must be the correct definition right well actually this is completely
wrong I mean it's it's it's it's it's just um well it's not completely wrong it's half wrong
because that's okay for saying a goes to b is injective but this gives you the wrong definition
for saying the map from b to c is surjective which is really quite surprising I mean it's
very hard if this isn't the right definition it's not at all obvious what the right definition is
and understanding why this is wrong is really one of the fundamental things in sheave theory so
we're going to look at an example to see why this is so wrong so I'm going to take a space
I'm going to take my space x to be a circle and I'm going to define two spaces x one is going
to be the same as x and x2 is going to kind of be a circle winding round it twice
and now I'm going to define a sheave f of x2 is the sections
um sorry not f of x2 f2 of u is the sections from u to x2 in other words if I've got
an open set u f2 of u is just going to be the the maps from u to x2 that that's um sections
and similarly f1 of u is the sections u goes to x1 and now we can see x2 goes to x1 is obviously
onto so we've got natural maps from x2 to x1 and x1 goes to x so we get a natural map from the
sheave f2 to the sheave f1 in the obvious way and we've also got a map from x1 x2 goes to x1
and this map here is obviously surjective
um and if we look at the maps of sheaves well f2 of x goes to f1 of x is not surjective
in other words if you think about it this is just a point
and this is empty because there are no continuous maps from x to x2 that are sections of it I mean
if you if you start by mapping this point up to here and go around you find you you get back
to the other point of x2 so so so f2 of x is actually empty um so well we're talking about
sheaves of sets rather than rather than sheaves of groups here but um we still have this problem
that we've got two different possible definitions of surjective we can either talk about x2 to x1
being surjective or we can talk about f2 of x goes to f2 one of x being surjective and these
are different so this is a sort of um local definition of being surjective
and this is a sort of global way to define things being surjective so so here over each
point of x the fiber of this point of x2 to x1 is is surjective so we're sort of looking locally
if we just look locally at a point then the corresponding um maps of open sets would
would be surjective and this is a global definition and we need to know whether we
should be using a local or a global definition of things being surjective and it turns out that
the right thing to do is to is to work with a sort of local definition
um so how do we do that well
um
suppose we've got a um
any map from a to x where this is continuous then we can form a sheaf by just letting f of
u be the continuous sections
from u to a in other words maps from u to a that um such that if you
take take the map here and then project to get back to where you started and this is
this is always a sheaf so it's a sheaf of sets if a is that is just a set and it's a sheaf of
groups if a has some reasonable um group like structure on its fibers
so we can construct a sheaf from any map from a set a to x and similarly if we've got a map from
a to x and a map from b to x and f is the sheaf of a and g is the sheaf of b then if we've got
a map from a to b making this continuous we get an induced map from the sheaf f to the sheaf g
again in a fairly obvious way um and we now have um um this concept we're going to obviously talk
about a to b being surjective so a to b might be surjective
but um f of x goes to g of x might not be
so this was um just what we had in the previous example um and um what we want to do is sort of
define the map from f to g to be surjective if and only if the map from a to b is surjective
well there's a bit of a problem with this because if we're given a sheaf f um you know it doesn't
necessarily come from a map a so we have the following problem does a sheaf
f come from um a map from a goes to x for some a
and it turns out there's a there's a very nice way to construct a from it um in fact this works
for a pre-sheaf um so we're now going to construct the et al space of a pre-sheaf
f
um and uh what we want to do is um get given some space x construct a space a mapping to it
that has something to do with the pre-sheaf f and first of all suppose we're given a point x in x
we want to know what is the fiber of a over this point x
and um we're going to construct it as follows point of the fiber
is given by
a section um f of f of u for some some neighborhood um u of p
and um we need to put a we need to say when these we these are the same so f um and g
are the same point of the fiber
if f and g are the same near x so what this means is that um the image
of f and g in um
the image of f and g in v are the same for some small v with with p contained in v
so you can think of f uh as being um so we have the point p here
pictures you get a point p here and we've got to set u one and f is in f of u one and
g is going to be in f of u two
and somewhere inside u one and u two we're going to take a small set v and f and g have
to have the same restriction to this set v and if so they're considered to be the same
point of the fiber so if you think of this pre-sheaf as being continuous sections of something
then the fiber is roughly equivalents classes of sections where two things are considered
equivalent if they're the same near p next we have to put a topology on this um
so a base of open sets is given as follows so so suppose we're given any set f in f of u
then um we can form an open set
um for each p in u we take the image
of f in the fiber over p and the union of these all images will be an open set
and these open sets will form a base of the topology um so this gives us a set a to x and
this is called the etal space of the sheaf f
um and what does the the word etal um a map from a to x is etal if for all
for a in a um there is a neighborhood
or um um v of a such that the map from v to the image in x is a homomorphism
so um i'm not going to prove this um because it's rather easy and in fact in sheaf there's
a whole lot of statements that are rather easy to prove just by unwinding the definitions and
i'm going to leave most such statements just as exercises um so the definition of the fiber
sort of says that each fiber is um a direct limit over all the open sets of u if you're used to
doing direct limits um um now the etal space can have a rather strange looking topology you see
it's locally isomorphic to x and that each point has a neighborhood that looks like x however this
is a bit misleading for example if x is a manifold say a real manifold then this says that each point
of a is also locally manifold so a is a manifold well that's really misleading because it turns out
that the the set a can be wildly non-house dwarf um so in the next lecture we'll give some examples
of what etal spaces look like and just how strange they can be
um
