 Certainly! The term "open-closed co-vaudism made out of pipe cleaners" seems to be a description of a project or activity that involves creating a model (likely related to engineering or education) using pipe cleaners, which are thin, flexible wires commonly used for crafts. The term "open-closed co-vaudism" might refer to a specific design challenge or educational concept where the goal is to design a structure or system that can transition between an open state and a closed state, possibly with a co-ventilated and audited (the 'aud' part of 'co-vaudism') component.

In this activity, participants would use pipe cleaners to construct a model that demonstrates the ability to switch between two configurations: one that is 'open' (perhaps allowing for airflow or other functions) and one that is 'closed' (possibly sealing off that airflow or altering the function). This exercise could be aimed at teaching principles of design, structural integrity, transformation mechanics, or even the basics of ventilation systems.

The summary of today's activity would focus on the participants engaging with the material (pipe cleaners) to solve a problem or explore a concept through the creation of an open-closed system, emphasizing the creative and educational aspects of using an unconventional material for such a task.
