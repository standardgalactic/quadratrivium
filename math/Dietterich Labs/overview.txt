1. **Tetrad Introduction**: To make the Dirac equation work in a curved spacetime (general relativity), we introduce a tetrad field, which is a set of four vectors at each point in spacetime that define a local Lorentz frame. The tetrad relates the curved metric to the flat tangent space metric and allows us to raise and lower indices accordingly.

2. **Curved Gamma Matrices**: The standard gamma matrices, which are defined in flat spacetime, need to be "curved" to account for the local Lorentz frames at each point on the curved manifold. This involves finding matrix-valued functions that evaluate to the correct gamma matrices at each point and satisfy the Clifford algebra appropriate for the tangent space at that point.

3. **Spin Connection**: To ensure the theory is invariant under local Lorentz transformations, which are equivalent to gauge transformations in this context, we need to express the spin connection in terms of the geometry of the curved manifold. The metronilic property (the requirement that parallel transport around a closed loop returns you to your starting orientation) guides us to relate the spin connection to the tetrad.

4. **Final Formulation**: By combining the tetrad, the curved gamma matrices, and the spin connection, we can write the generally covariant Dirac action that couples to general relativity. The Lagrangian density is given by summing over all coordinates and inserting the gauge covariant derivative into the Dirac equation, where the gauge covariant derivative includes both the standard spacetime derivative and the spin connection term.

In summary, to successfully integrate the Dirac equation into general relativity, we:

- Introduced a tetrad to relate the curved metric to the flat tangent space metric.
- Curved the gamma matrices to ensure they are meaningful at each point on the manifold.
- Defined the spin connection in terms of the tetrad and the geometry of the spacetime manifold, ensuring local Lorentz invariance.

With these steps, we have a generally covariant Dirac action that couples to general relativity, completing the integration of quantum fields into gravity.
