Checking International Centre for Theoretical Sciences/A New Generalization of Entanglement Entropy by Tadashi Takayanagi.txt
1. **Pursuit Entropy**: This is a new concept introduced by Tadashi Takayanagi to measure entanglement entropy in systems where the thermodynamic description is not well-defined, such as near a quantum phase transition or in finite size systems. It generalizes the holographic entanglement entropy and is defined using a replica trick in a complex contour in the replica number plane.

2. **Thermodynamics for Entanglement Entropy**: Tadashi mentioned a "first law" for entanglement entropy, which relates it to temperature in a way that is analogous to how temperature is defined in conventional statistical mechanics through the first law of thermodynamics.

3. **Complexity of Pseudo Entropy**: The pursuit entropy can be complex in general, but in the context of holographic theories, it always turns out to be real due to the properties of Euclidean passing integrals and replica tricks.

4. **Transition Matrix for Pure States**: The transition matrix that was discussed is applicable only for pure quantum states. For mixed states, there are proposals but challenges arise because mixed states can be purified in multiple ways, leading to different possible definitions of the transition matrix.

5. **Purification of Mixed States**: The purification problem for mixed states is non-unique since any mixed state can be purified in infinitely many ways. This could lead to multiple definitions of entanglement entropy for mixed states, and it's still an open question which definition or approach is most useful.

6. **Finite Size Systems**: The pursuit entropy has been studied extensively in finite size systems, and the results have been consistent with numerical spin calculations. However, extending these ideas to infinite systems, particularly near a quantum phase transition, remains a challenge and an area of ongoing research.

7. **Beta in First Law**: The factor of beta (inverse temperature) is significant in the first law for entanglement entropy. It provides a connection to temperature and thermodynamics in the system.

Overall, the pursuit entropy offers a promising framework for understanding entanglement entropy in systems where conventional thermodynamic descriptions fail. However, there are still open questions regarding its application to mixed states and its behavior in infinite systems. The community continues to explore these topics.

1. The discussion started with the concept of Markov processes, which are characterized by transition probabilities that only depend on the current state and not on the history of the process. This is encapsulated in the memoryless property of exponential waiting time distributions.

2. A Markov process can be described by a set of transition rates from one state to another, which for simplicity are often assumed to be constant (time-homogeneous). In a more general setting, these rates could be time-dependent.

3. The two key pieces of information in the description of a Markov process are:
   - The probability of transitioning from one state to another (transition probabilities).
   - The waiting time distribution that describes when the next transition will occur after the last one. In the Markovian case, this is typically an exponential distribution, which has the memoryless property.

4. For non-Markovian processes, you need to provide additional information: the probability of not having made a transition by time t, known as the survivor function.

5. The classical evolution equation for a Markov process can be generalized to include time-dependent rates and an integral over time, reflecting the possibility of transitions occurring at different times.

6. In the quantum setting, functions are replaced by operators, and due to the non-commutative nature of these operators, there is more flexibility in the ordering of operations, leading to different types of evolution equations.

7. The talk concluded with an overview of the classical evolution equation and hinted at how this would be adapted to the quantum setting, where operators and their commutation relations play a central role.

8. The references provided by the speaker cover topics discussed today, with additional references to be given tomorrow, which will include both classical and quantum aspects of stochastic processes.

9. The speaker emphasized the importance of understanding the classical setting before moving on to the more complex quantum scenario, where the non-commutativity of operators introduces additional considerations.

10. The speaker thanked the audience for their attention and mentioned that any remaining time would be used for further clarification rather than proceeding immediately to the next topic.

This summary captures the essence of the talk on the first day, focusing on the classical description of stochastic processes and setting the stage for tomorrow's discussion on the quantum counterpart.

Based on the transcript provided, here is a summary of the key points discussed in the lecture on the quantum state evolution using the Nakajima-Zinn-Justin (NJL) equation or the quantum Mori projection operator technique:

1. **Perturbation Splitting**: The speaker begins by explaining that the total evolution of a system can be split into two parts, \( pL(t) \) and \( p\rho(t) \), where \( p \) is the projection operator onto the subspace of interest, and \( L(t) \) represents the Liouvillian superoperator describing the dynamics within that subspace. The term \( p\rho(t) \) contains all the information needed to describe the reduced dynamics of the system.

2. **Formal Solution**: The speaker mentions that by playing with identities, one can express the evolution equation in a form that allows for a perturbation expansion of its solution. This involves applying \( pL(t) \) to \( p\rho(t) \) and also considering \( q\rho(t) \), where \( q = 1 - p \) is the projection onto orthogonal complement of the subspace of interest.

3. **Closed Evolution Equation**: The goal is to obtain a closed evolution equation for \( p\rho(t) \), which would suffice to describe the system's dynamics. This is achieved by finding a formal solution for \( q\rho(t) \) and inserting it back into the evolution equation for \( p\rho(t) \).

4. **Evolution Equation Form**: The final form of the evolution equation for \( p\rho(t) \) involves an integral over a time label \( t_1 \), from 0 to \( t \), with the first part being \( pL(t_1) \) and the second part being a term involving an operator \( g \), which represents the time evolution from \( t_1 \) to \( t \). This term \( g \) is a time-ordered exponential of the interaction picture Liouvillian superoperator \( qL(t) \) over the interval from \( t_1 \) to \( t \).

5. **Memory Kernel**: The evolution equation includes a memory kernel \( k(t_1) \), which accounts for the effects of past interactions on the current state of the system. This kernel is constructed using the commutator with the interaction Hamiltonian and the exponential of the interaction picture Liouvillian superoperator.

6. **Complete Positivity and Perturbation Expansion**: The exact evolution equation is completely positive and preserves the norm of the state vector by construction. However, when using a perturbation expansion, it is important to ensure that complete positivity is maintained at each order of the expansion. This is achieved by truncating the expansion at a certain level and ensuring that the resulting structure is completely positive.

7. **Classical Analogy**: The approach used in quantum mechanics has an analogue in classical mechanics, where position and momentum variables relax at different rates, leading to a situation where one variable can be treated as a slow variable while the other is fast.

8. **Historical Context**: The method discussed is closely related to the work of Nakajima and Svansik, with further development by Mori and others in the field.

In essence, the lecture outlines a rigorous approach to solving the evolution of quantum states by using a combination of projection operator techniques and perturbation theory, ensuring that the resulting dynamics are well-defined and physically meaningful.

1. The discussion centered around the concept of freezing a quantum state using strong driving fields to enforce a quasi-conservation law, as demonstrated in NMR experiments.
2. The speaker mentioned that this approach is different from simply echoing out terms with a strong field, as the latter does not necessarily establish a quasi-conservation law and allows for different dynamics depending on the state.
3. The concept of the Zeno effect was brought up, where repeated measurements can freeze a state. However, the speaker clarified that their approach is unitary and does not involve non-unitary projections like the Zeno effect. Instead, the system evolves under respect to global conservation laws within certain subspaces, allowing for dynamics.
4. The question was raised about whether this freezing mechanism could be generalized to other symmetries besides U(1). The speaker expressed hope that a strong drive could similarly stabilize other symmetries, but this has not been explicitly tested.
5. The speaker emphasized that while individual spins may have a lot of dynamics, the global properties of the system are conserved, and the freezing mechanism does not simply freeze all dynamics but allows for evolution within the constraints set by the conservation laws.

With this, we conclude the second week of discussions. We thank the speaker for their insightful talk and the organizers for making the conference possible. We will resume with a summary by Marine at 4 PM and then conclude the conference with expressions of gratitude to all who contributed.
