1. **Introduction to Non-Commutative Geometry (NCG)**: Connes introduced NCG, which generalizes classical geometry by considering algebras of observables that do not necessarily commute. This allows for a deeper understanding of the structure of space and the nature of physical laws.

2. **Geometric and Physical Applications**: NCG has applications in various fields, including algebraic topology, number theory, operator algebras, and high-energy physics. It can describe the geometry of spaces that are not differentiable manifolds, like the space of points at a given distance from a point (the "fat point" geometry).

3. **Spectral Triples**: A spectral triple consists of a Hilbert space, an algebra of observables, and an operator representing the space's geometry. The spectrum of this operator can reveal geometric information about the space.

4. **Riemann Hypothesis and Zeta Functions**: The Riemann zeros are related to the distribution of prime numbers, which in turn relate to the topology of spaces through etale cohomology. This connection is explored through spectral triples and the Riemann data function.

5. **Spectral Actions and Entropy**: The spectral action principle, developed by Chamseddine, Connes, and Louis, relates the geometry of space to the particle content of the Standard Model of particle physics. It was recently shown that this principle is equivalent to maximizing entropy in a second-quantized fermion system for a specific test function related to the Riemann data function.

6. **Non-Commutative Curvature and Modular Theory**: The curvature in non-commutative geometry, such as the Riemann curvature tensor, can be extended to the non-commutative setting. There is a fascinating interplay between this non-commutative curvature and modular theory, which has been explored in collaboration with Henri Moscovici. This interplay leads to computable relations that have been confirmed through numerical checks.

7. **Gauss-Bonnet Theorem**: The Gauss-Bonnet theorem was proven in the non-commmutative setting by Masoud Kalkali and his collaborators, using the finite difference equations derived from the curvature-modular theory interplay.

8. **Asymptotic Expansions**: Work on the asymptotic expansion of the non-commutative curvature-modular theory interplay has been ongoing since the late 1980s and was significantly advanced by Fazad Fattizadeh, who completed the A4 term in this expansion.

9. **Conclusion**: Non-commutative geometry is a rich and interdisciplinary field with profound connections to various branches of mathematics and physics. It provides a powerful framework for understanding the fundamental structure of space and time and has potential applications in resolving deep problems such as the Riemann hypothesis.

The talk emphasizes the unifying power of non-commutative geometry and its remarkable ability to bridge seemingly disparate areas of research, from quantum physics to number theory and beyond.

1. The speaker discussed the relationship between play-by-graphs (PBGs), on-shell diagrams, and amplitude hydrants in the context of planar n=4 SCFT and its momentum blister space representation. They highlighted that while PBGs are building blocks for constructing scattering amplitudes, they do not directly form the full amplitude hydrant due to their non-planarity and non-adjacency. Instead, these PBGs might triangulate into a different geometric structure in the momentum blister space, which is the momentum amplitude hydrant.

2. The speaker mentioned that they are working on extending these ideas to gravity amplitudes in three-level gravity, which differs from planar n=4 SCFT as it naturally includes gravity without any alterations. A key challenge is replacing the double copy (DL) form with a new type of form that would correctly reproduce gravity amplitudes. Some progress has been made, but this remains an open and difficult problem.

3. The speaker emphasized the importance of understanding the positivity and negativity within these diagrams, as well as the symmetries they represent. They expressed a desire to find combinatorial characterizations of the graphs that could be directly useful for calculating mutations or other properties.

4. The seminar was well-received, and there were questions about how to directly work with the play-by-graphs to characterize symmetries, positivity, and negativity within them. The speaker acknowledged that while they have cataloged the configurations that correspond to the denominators of the form, there is still much to understand about the direct relationship between the graphs and the physical quantities they represent.

5. The speaker thanked the audience for their attention and engagement and invited further questions informally after the formal presentation. They also announced that the next seminar would be hybrid and encouraged attendees to stay tuned for more details.
