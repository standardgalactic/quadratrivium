1. **Wick's Theorem**: This theorem allows us to calculate the expectation values of products of creation and annihilation operators in quantum field theory by contracting pairs of fields. There are 5 ways to contract two fields, each resulting from Wick's theorem in the exponential of a quadratic term. For each contraction, you write \( \frac{1}{a} \). So for 3 fields, you would have \( \left( \frac{1}{a} \right)^2 \) as part of your expression after applying Wick's theorem.

2. **Generalization to Multiple Integrals**: We generalize the integral with a quadratic term in the exponential (represented by \( \frac{j}{2a} \) for a single integral) to a multiple integral when dealing with multiple variables and a symmetric real matrix \( A \). This leads to a more complex expression involving a sum over all possible pairings of variables, similar to how Wick's theorem pairs creation and annihilation operators.

3. **Diagonalization**: To evaluate the multiple integral, we imagine diagonalizing the real symmetric matrix \( A \) via a orthogonal transformation. This allows us to express the integral in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A \).

4. **Change of Variables**: By changing variables from \( x \) to \( y \), where \( y = O^{-1}x \), we transform the integral into a product of simpler integrals, each involving only one variable \( y_i \). These can be solved using Gaussian integrals.

5. **Final Result**: After performing the integration and rotating back to the original variables, we find that the result for the multiple integral is proportional to \( \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}x^TA^{-1}x\right) \), where \( A^{-1} \) represents the inverse of matrix \( A \), and the proportionality constant is the determinant of \( A \).

6. **Homework Problem**: Professor Smith suggests doing the integral for a 2 by 2 matrix as a homework problem to understand how to generalize this to higher dimensions. This will help in understanding more complex integrals that will be encountered in the next lecture, which promises to be even more complicated.

In summary, Wick's theorem and its extension to multiple integrals are fundamental tools in quantum field theory for evaluating expectation values of products of fields. Understanding these concepts is crucial for following the discussion in the upcoming lectures.
