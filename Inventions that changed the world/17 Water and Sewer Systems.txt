Consider two mundane acts of everyday life.
We take it for granted that we will have safe and pleasant bathrooms and that we can
go to the faucet and get a clean, fresh drink of water.
But did you ever consider that behind those two acts are a series of great inventions,
inventions that have probably saved more lives than any other technological innovation?
In this lecture, we'll look at both the history of water and sewer systems and how they've
changed the world.
Since the dawn of history, sanitation and fresh water have been constant concerns for
humans.
The practical task of disposing of human experiment was important enough to warrant
mention in the Bible, which advised the practical approach of digging a hole and burying it.
A Hindu task, texts suggested defecating no less than the length of an arrow's flight
from camp.
While this suggestion worked well when humans lived in small, dispersed communities, became
dangerous and unneighborly when people gathered in larger and more concentrated settlements.
Many ancient civilizations understood the necessity of disposing of human waste.
But as we saw in lecture six, the Romans appear to have dealt with the problem on a larger
scale and much better than other societies.
At its greatest extent, in the fourth century AD, the infrastructure of the city of Rome,
its reservoirs, aqueducts, sewers, bridges and roads, supported a population of one million
people.
During the first century AD, Pliny the Elder praised sanitation as the most noteworthy
of all Roman achievements, adding that the world had never seen anything so remarkable.
To Pliny, the aqueducts were, in his words, dispensers of health and comfort.
Another Roman example is the city of Emerita Augusta, which is today the present city of
Merida, Spain, and it was founded in 25 BC.
The Roman city there contained all the components necessary for providing a supply of fresh water
and the removal of excrement.
Five kilometers outside of town, one can still see the prosopina dam that forms the city's
reservoir and the aqueduct, now dubbed the Aqueduct of Miracles, that brought fresh water
into the city.
Within the city, the system illustrates a great appreciation for the value of fresh water.
After the fresh water was employed in a variety of ways, wastewater was captured and reused
as grey water to flush away excrement in the sewer system.
The remains of a public lavatory allow us to see just how intricate the Roman arrangements
were.
A row of more than two dozen toilet openings stretched cheek to cheek above a channel which
the grey water flowed and the grey water carried away the theatergoers' contributions
for disposal in more appropriate circumstances.
Running in parallel in front of those seats is a second channel where fresh water flowed.
When one had finished his or her business, a sponge could be dipped on a stick into the
water and the cleaning of the relevant parts performed.
Given the complete lack of privacy and extreme proximity of the seats, there's no indication
of public toilet inhibition or personal embarrassment, reactions that only seem to arise later with
advances in toilet technology.
Remains of similar technology can be found among Roman ruins throughout the ancient world,
even in the empire's most remote regions along Hadrian's Wall in Northern England.
A thousand years later, in 13th century Britain, though, things were dramatically different.
In that era's most sophisticated structures, castles, toilets comprised of an opening high
up in the wall where a whole bench provided a drafty perch.
From this height, excrement cascaded down the wall into a dry moat, leaving behind a smelly,
unsanitary trail.
Rather than being swept away by a stream of water, though, whose accumulated droppings
were carted off at night by the gong farmer, who disposed of them in dumps outside of town
and then subsequently used them for fertilizer.
On savory as all this may seem to us, practices similar to these were employed in the maintenance
of urban privies into the late 19th century.
In Tudor, England, some wealthy urbanites enjoyed the convenience and comfort of indoor
toilets, as well as the use of wads of woven flax or fluffy tufts of wool treated with matter
or woad to clean and soothe their bums.
Nevertheless, these toilets did not remove excrement from the home, and it merely dropped
the excrement into cesspits, often right next to the kitchen, which then needed to be emptied
and the contents of the cesspits carried away.
Now thanks to her godson, John Hirington, Queen Elizabeth I, not only enjoyed indoor
plumbing, but what may have been the world's first flushed toilet.
One of two remaining examples is on display in the Flushed with Pride exhibit at the Gladstone
Pottery Museum in England.
Hirington's toilet, invented in 1594, is a water closet and it looked like a bench in
a cabinet.
It depended on a manually filled cistern that was positioned above and behind the seat.
When Her Majesty needed to use the WC, she pulled on a handle that opened a plug in the
cistern to fill the bowl beneath the bench.
When she was finished, a second knob was pulled to drain the bowl into a cesspit.
While somewhat more refined, this device was still smelly, unsanitary and inconvenient
since the cistern has to be filled by hand.
Nearly two centuries later, in 1775, Scottish watchmaker Alexander Cummings received a patent
for a flushed toilet with an all-important innovation, an S-bend in the drainage pipe.
Again, relying on a cistern to fill the bowl, Cummings design used a sliding valve to seal
the bottom of the bowl.
When the contents were to be drained, a lever was pulled back and the valve slid back, sending
the water and the waste down the drain pipe.
Water trapped in the S-bend prevented the characteristic stink of the excrement from
wafting back into the room.
This was a great step forward, but unfortunately, feces tended to get trapped in the sliding
valve, thereby clogging it and negating some of the toilet's advantages.
All the basic components of the modern toilet, though, were there, and they just simply needed
more improvement.
So let's have a look at a modern S-pipe, which you can find underneath your sink or behind
any toilet, and it basically consists of this sort of shape.
As you can see, what happens is that with the power of the toilet, the water basically
goes up through the S-pipe here and off and on its way to the sewers.
And because there's always a little bit of water down here, the pipe is basically got
a seal when it's not being pumping water through.
Did not take long for improvements to come, and in 1778, Joseph Brahma offered the necessary
enhancement by replacing the sliding valve with a self-cleaning, hinged, flap valve that
was now used today.
Brahma's toilet needed to be connected to a water source because it depended on a constant
trickle of water to maintain sanitation conditions and seal out the order.
The choice of the British upper class, a working example of Brahma's design, complete with
its original, highly decorative porcelain bowl, is still in use in the House of Lords
in Westminster today.
The general design of Brahma's toilet was kept in production until the 1930s.
So to appreciate what Brahma came up with, let's have a look at this cutaway model of
a toilet.
Now inside here, you have a valve, and you have a float that controls the valve, and
you then have the flap down here which opens and drains the tank and sends water into the
bowl.
So when you're operating it, the float is up, there's water up to about here, and when
you flush the toilet, the chain pulls up the flap and the water drains out of the tank
into the bowl.
When the water is all drained out of the tank, the flap naturally falls back, and when that
falls back and the ball is down, the valve is opened here and the water flows into the
tank, filling it up again until the ball reaches a certain level and cuts off the valve.
Ultimately, however, a toilet is only as useful as the system to which it connects.
The normal aversion for stentious side, little was understood about the true relationship
between sewage and health in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
The removal of human waste might enhance the pleasantness of the home, and was thought
to have some health benefits, but the true risks of contaminated drinking water are completely
misunderstood by 19th century people.
It was within this context of the misunderstanding that two of the most important examples of
modern urban water and sewer systems were developed, one in London and one in Philadelphia.
In both cases, disease played an important role in their genesis.
In 1793, Philadelphia, then the nation's capital in the largest city in North America, was
struck by an epidemic of yellow fever.
That summer, 5,000 of the 45,000 people living in Philadelphia died from yellow fever, and
this caused a state of panic in which businesses and federal offices were abandoned, and more
than a third of the city's population fled to the countryside.
The universal opinion at that time was that the disease was caused by miasma, noxious
air that emanated from rotting organic material somewhere in the city.
Although the city's leading physician, Benjamin Rush, claimed that the source was a pile of
rotting coffee beans on the Philadelphia docks, others attributed it possibly to human waste.
Either way, after the epidemic, Philadelphia was determined to reclaim its status as the
continent's most sophisticated city, but to do so, it would need to take steps to avoid
another outbreak of disease.
One of the city's obvious shortcomings was its water supply, for as the prominent architect
and engineer Benjamin Henry La Trobe wrote in 1797, and I quote, the inhabitants of Philadelphia
drink very little water, it is too bad to be drunk.
Seeking to remedy this defect, the city fathers approached La Trobe and sought his help in
planning and constructing a central water supply system.
La Trobe's design called for water to be drawn from the Skookle River at the foot of Chestnut
Street by means of a steam pump.
The supply of water would then be piped to a second steam-powered pumping station located
in Central Square, that's where Philadelphia City Hall now stands.
Here the water would be lifted by the pump into two large wooden cisterns from which
gravity would then feed the water to the rest of the city through six miles of pipes
bored out of white oak.
With the elegant neoclassical Central Square pumping station at its heart, La Trobe's
system began to supply water in 1801.
La Trobe's design, frequently described as a temple, dedicated to the modern power of
steam and fire, soon became a symbol of the popular belief in a symbiotic relationship
between technology and the public good.
And it hearkens back to the ideas about Commonwealth we talked about in our lecture on Roman inventions.
To celebrate the waterworks classic overtures in 1809, the city commission sculptor William
Rush to create Waternymph and Bitturn, the first publicly funded art in America.
In spite of all this good feeling though, the Trobe system didn't work very well.
From the beginning, the steam engines caused all kinds of problems, not the least of which
was the danger of exploding boilers, and if that was not enough, by 1810 the city's demand
for water had outdistanced the supply provided by La Trobe's system.
Frederick Graf, who had served as La Trobe's former assistant and now the superintendent
of the waterworks, was commissioned to come up with a solution.
Graf chose Fairmount, former site of William Penn's estate, upstream on the Skoukal River
as the new location for the waterworks.
Graf's initial design once again called for steam engine to raise the water, this time
to a hilltop cistern where gravity would then take over.
Like La Trobe, Graf also opted for a neoclassical design for the building, one that would blend
in with the fashionable summer estates that then lined that part of the river.
But again, demand quickly outpaced capacity, and by 1819, Graf had to propose damming the
river.
At the time, the dam he built on the Skoukal was the largest in the world.
When the dam and the new waterworks machinery were completed in 1822, the city's supply
of fresh water was assured.
With no existing waterworks to use as a model for his design, Graf devised a system that
raised water from the reservoir behind the dam to a cistern by utilizing water wheels
that exploited the excess energy of the river to lift the water.
Graf also replaced the old wooden pipes with a new system of iron pipes to carry water
throughout the expanding city.
Over the next few decades, the Fairmount waterworks and the Skoukal dam became international tourist
attractions, two of the largest and most important public works in the nation.
When he visited the city in 1842, Charles Dickens noted, and I quote, Philadelphia is
most bountifully supplied with fresh water, which is showered and jerked on and off and
poured about everywhere.
The waterworks is no less ornamental than useful.
Set in a beautiful park-like setting, the dam and the waterworks were seen as profound
demonstrations of how American character could use nature to tame technology.
In fact, Fairmount Park eventually became the largest city park in the country, an intersection
of nature, community, and technology.
Notable for its time, Philadelphia had approached its need for clean water from a community
rather than an individual or corporate point of view, and this allowed it to secure a source
of pure water.
Fairmount waterworks were so successful that graphs supplied descriptions of the system
to dozens of other municipalities, including New York and Boston.
Certainly, all of this must have gone a long way toward erasing the memory of the 1793 epidemic
that seemed to threaten the very existence of Philadelphia as a city.
While far from carefree, urban life in America during this period was a lot healthier than
day-to-day life in urban Britain.
There in Britain, in 1820, the life expectancy of a child born in a city with more than 100,000
people was just 35 years of age.
A decade later, it had fallen to 29 years.
By 1851, the year in which the majority of Britain's population for the first time lived
in cities, a male child born in Liverpool had a life expectancy of 26.
In comparison, a child born at the same time in a village in Devonshire, the countryside,
could expect to live to age 57.
Clearly, things were going from bad to worse.
At least in part, this might be attributed to the first outbreak of cholera in London
in 1831, and that disease would return to London four more times before 1854.
The 1854 epidemic killed more than 10,000 Londoners.
And it was during this epidemic that a few individuals who had rejected the miasmic theory
of disease found the real cause of cholera.
The disease in 1854 first appeared in the Lambeth and Sutherland districts south of
the Thames, and the epidemic did not quite hit areas of the north as hard.
Nevertheless, on the 31st of August, a furious outbreak erupted in Soho near Broad Street.
127 local people, rich and poor alike, died in just three days.
By the 10th of September, more than 500 were dead, equivalent of 12.8% of the population
in that immediate area.
Dr. John Snow, a local physician who had previously published a paper theorizing that cholera was
a waterborne disease, saw this as an opportunity to test his theory.
Snow plotted the addresses of the deceased on a map and noticed that many of the victims
resided near the Broad Street public water pump.
Snow examined a sample of the water from the pump under his microscope and found white flocculant
particles, which Snow believed were responsible for the spread of disease, although he could
not prove it for sure.
He doubted him, but agreed to remove the pump hamdoll as an experiment.
Deaths decreased sharply, and the outbreak was virtually over by the end of September.
Nevertheless, a total of 616 local people had died.
When a subsequent municipal report investigated Snow's findings, it concluded, and I quote,
�We see no reason to adopt this belief, meaning that they weren't sure that contaminated
water had contributed to the cholera outbreak in the Broad Street neighborhood.�
A year later, a local vicar, Henry Whitehead, published an article in The Builder, in which
he stated, and I quote, �Even in Broad Street, it would appear that little has been done.
There are still open cesspools to be seen.
In the court, so far as we could learn, no change has been made, so that here, in spite
of the late numerous deaths, we have all the materials for a fresh epidemic.
In some houses, the water butts were in deep cellars, close to the undrained cesspool.
The overcrowding appears to increase.� The builder went on to recommend the immediate
abandonment and clearing away of all cesspools, not the disguise of them, but their complete
removal.
None of this happened, and it probably would not have made much difference, because London's
water supply came from the Thames, and in some cases, the water was drawn from the river
downstream from where the sewage entered it.
Without a proven direct connection between disease and water, there did not appear to
be any urgent reason to act.� However, even if that connection was not recognized
then and there, there would prove to be another sufficiently repellent and fortuitous reason
to act.
From the summer of 1858, London suffered what aptly was called the Great Stink.
That summer, low water levels on the Thames caused the metropolis's accumulated excrement
to be carried not into the river, but only as far as the river's margins where it remained
marooned high, if not so dry.
There it simmered, exposed to extraordinarily high temperatures, steadily adding to the
city's funk.
With the miasmic theory of disease still holding sway, sheets or drapes were soaked in chlorine
and hung over windows.
This had little effect on the health or the smell.
Suddenly, with the evidence right under their noses, Parliament took just 18 days to rush
through a bill to provide money for the construction of a massive new metropolitan sewer system,
though essentially for the wrong reasons.
Joseph Bazalgette, Chief Engineer of the London Public Works Department, since its founding
two years earlier, already had a plan for a $3 million project that he had put in front
of municipal authorities.
But at the time, the cost seemed prohibitive.
Now at London, enveloped in the worst kind of stench and with funding available from
Parliament, Bazalgette's proposal was accepted.
Bazalgette's plan called for six new sewer lines, three in the north and three in the
south of the river, running from west to east, more or less parallel to the Thames.
These would intercept the hundreds of existing sewers, streams and rivers that ran into the
Thames in the city, diverting their contents to a point downstream from the city and away
from the intakes of London's water supply.
These 82 miles of main sewers would be eventually supplemented by an additional 1,100 miles
of street sewers designed to replace open cess pits and to prevent sewage from running
in the open gutters.
To keep sewage moving through the system, a series of massive steam driven pumps were
used, each an example of triumphant technology on display and they were shown off in ornate
pumping stations.
Over the next 16 years, the London sewer system and its ancillary elements proved to be the
largest engineering project in the world.
Bazalgette designed it for a daily capacity of 400 million gallons a day, a figure he reached
by calculating a generous maximum for London's current population and then doubling it to
allow for future growth.
The system's construction required the removal of 2.5 million cubic meters of earth and it
consumed 318 million bricks and the whole thing cost a total of 4.2 million pounds.
In the summer of 1865, the system was opened as Prince Alfred, that's Queen Victoria's
son, Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Mayor of London and many other dignitaries looked
on as the Prince of Wales turned a wheel to start the outflow engines at the cross-nest
pumping station.
The final phases of the project included the construction of the Thames embankments, which
not only sped the flow of the river by constructing its channel but also improved street traffic
above ground while housing the underground and other railway stations below.
The Victorian Albert embankment opened in 1870 and the Chelsea embankment was opened
in 1874.
Remarkably, all of this incredible effort had been predicated on a false assumption
that cholera is carried not in the water but in the air by a miasma.
Purification of drinking water was only a secondary concern in the effort to build the
London sewer system.
Ironically, one of the episodes that proved most convincing on the argument over how
the disease was carried was demonstrated by the circumstances surrounding a cholera outbreak
in the east end of London just three months after the Prince had started those engines
at cross-nests.
At that point, much of London was procuring its drinking water from points safely above
the outflow of the sewage, but this was not true of the afflicted area.
But some neighborhoods suffered while others were safe, finally prompted engineers and civic
leaders to change their thinking about how disease was spread.
This new connection between hygiene and health came during an era of important political
change in Britain.
For in 1867, the Second Reform Act was passed, granting urban working men the right to vote.
The conjunction of greater political power and the self-evident benefits of public hygiene
and health projects encouraged the working class to exert far greater pressure on politicians
for more improvement projects.
In the 1870s, Parliament passed two public health acts and included a number of important
provisions requiring towns to undertake a whole set of new steps.
They had to appoint health and sanitation inspectors.
They had to be responsible for furnishing a supply of clean water as well as sewage and
drainage system.
Towns and cities had to work to improve housing for workers, provide paved streets, street
lighting and trash removal.
They also had to be responsible for burial practices and report infectious diseases and
take direct action when necessary.
Once again, we see the introduction of major engineering projects again required political
and social changes in the form of new laws and new government responsibilities.
As I suggested earlier in the lecture, there's a close connection between the large-scale
systems supplying water and sewage and what is possible in terms of toilets and bathrooms.
Through the end of the 19th century, growing public sanitation projects stimulated a series
of inventions related to toilets and bathrooms.
In the 1880s, the essential aspect of the modern toilet, the design of the S-Bend, became
an integrated element with the porcelain toilet bowl.
The enterprising and fortuitously named Thomas Crapper sold millions of toilets with his
name boldly emblazoned upon them.
Public lavatories took on a grand appearance and offered all the modern conveniences, in
some cases including a urinal with a bull's eye situated to help the user avoid unpleasant
splashes.
In competition with Crapper, Thomas Twyford in England produced his own improved water
closet called the Unitus.
His Unitus model was so popular and ubiquitous in some parts of the world, such as Russia,
that its name was adopted by the local language to have the generic meaning of toilet.
However, even though the turn of the 20th century saw the design and modern flush toilets
perfected, access to them was limited for much of the working class even in the most
developed areas in the world.
In rural areas, sewer systems were rarely available.
In urban areas where municipal systems made toilets a practical convenience, shared facilities
remain the norm.
In urban Britain, courtyards behind tenements featured three toilets which were sometimes
used for as many as 70 people who lived in the surrounding flats.
Furthermore, with the toilets being outside, the toilets could be cold and dark, dirty and
rat infested.
This was the standard provision for most of the British urban poor until the 1960s and
even the 1970s.
While many of us would turn up on noses if we were forced to use such cramped and disgusting
facilities, a great many people in the world would be grateful just for them.
Despite the fact that clean water and sanitation innovations may have saved more lives than
any other technology, these improvements are still not available to more than a third of
the planet's population.
According to UNICEF, about 4,500 children under the age of five die every day of diarrhea
contracted due to a lack of clean water and proper sanitation.
That's more than 1.6 million children annually.
Whereas clean water and sanitation are available to more than 90% of the population of Europe
and North America, in Western and Central Africa, less than 60% of the people have access
to clean water and barely a third have proper sanitation facilities.
To some extent, this reflects the reality that even modern sanitation systems are inherently
inefficient.
More often than not, they use clean water running through expensive pipes to propel waste through
more pipes to a treatment plant and that treatment plant uses masses of energy to clean the waste
water before it can be dumped.
Is there a better, more economical, environmentally responsible way?
Certainly the Romans thought so with their aqueducts and sewer systems.
Equally, can we safely recover the energy and or the nutrients in waste as was done in earlier
ages?
Certainly the gong farmer of the late Middle Ages reminds us that this should be possible.
These are important questions and they all indicate that after 150 years there is still
plenty of room for improvement in the flush toilet and the systems behind it.
