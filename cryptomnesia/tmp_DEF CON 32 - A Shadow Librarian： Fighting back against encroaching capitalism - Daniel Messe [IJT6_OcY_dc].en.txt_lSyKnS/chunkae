studied what he called the history of
the common people um I had never heard
of this guy until I'm standing in a
library looking at a couple shelves of
books and then suddenly I'm a big
fan browsing a well ordered collection
of information in media might not help
you find exactly what you want but you
could find what you
need um libraries are great for that and
yeah so are bookstores but in a library
you can borrow the thing and pay nothing
gather your sources yeah yeah sometimes
the shortest distance between two points
is a search on Anna's archive and
suddenly you have an ebook that you
didn't have before but you remember
worldcat you can uh you can set up an
account on worldcat totally free and you
can give it your zip code and now if you
want to see if you can find that weird
and wonderful thing that you need to
read right now you can check worldcat
and it will tell you if it's any
libraries that are close to you
sometimes within driving
distance um
so not only do you want to you know
worry about that but you can also uh
check out your libraries uh collection
of
databases um yeah libraries have got
great collections but depending on your
library they're going to have things
like magazine and newspaper databases
they're going to have business databases
medical databases legal databases you
need forms they probably got your forms
hell lots of libraries have an online
language learning system where you can
learn a foreign language and you won't
have to put up with a guilt trip from a
little green
owl so you may not need any of this
stuff today you might not need it
tomorrow but next week next month who
knows check out other libraries online
or in person this is not meant to be an
exclusive relationship we are not
monogamous here least not when it comes
to the libraries what you do on your own
time is up to you um but is there
something your library is
lacking okay check
another back in the co days a library
set up a thing where you could uh sign
up online for a digital library card
that allowed you access to the ebook and
you know econtent collections in the
databases and stuff there was no charge
for it and in most cases there's still
isn't and that card might only be good
for maybe 6 months or so but hey 6
months might be all you need if you want
to get something that's you know more
permanent almost any Library will offer
you a library card with full borrowing
privileges for some kind of
fee back in the shadows for a moment
remember that there is a thriving ebook
community in other places besides Zed
library and Anna's archive and stuff
check out IRC remember IRC Good Times
those were there's a couple channels
there on Undernet called ebooks and
books that's a books with a zed on the
end of it um you know check that out
easy to use especially if you know how
to use
IRC but outside of all of that today I
would like to offer you a fantastic
opportunity I have a time share no
um I would like to offer you a fantastic
opportunity to be someone else's
librarian listen all of you you're
you're here at Defcon right I think so I
haven't huc inated this bad in ages um
that means oops I think I just got out
of
that there we go that means that you too
have a particular set of
skills you know things and you know how
to find things and you know how to do
things with what you have
learned you know about Torrance you know
about Anna's archive you know how to
break DRM I could have totally put in a
talk topic Where I Stood here talked
about how DRM works on digital library
materials how you could strip that
off and then make those files available
for someone else to get a hold of you
know that may not have access to it I
didn't do that because I think it'd be
boring because I bet I bet many of you
already know how to do that already
and if you don't you can learn it in an
afternoon believe
me but across the United States right
now right-wing legislators and fascists
sorry but I repeat my self there are
effectively Banning books and materials
in libraries and schools is it related
to sex ban it anything to do with the
gtq community that's got to go uh does
it involve a non-Christian deity that
can't have that um but it goes beyond
that some states namely let's see if I
can do this Arkansas Idaho Indiana
Missouri Montana North Carolina Oklahoma
and Tennessee have tried to pass laws
that make multiple aspects of public
librarianship a criminal offense and in
some states they
succeeded in uh in Oklahoma school and
public Librarians are looking at up to
$20,000 in fines or 10 years in prison
for exposing children to obscene
materials whatever the hell that
is in a in a Montana School library and
Museum uh employees face prosecution for
dealing in obscene materials have you
got a Renaissance exhibit coming through
town does it have pictures of naked
people you might go to jail if a kid
comes to the
museum sounds great doesn't
it
so what can you do to help it's very
easy share your skills share the
media now you can take that however you
like you might be thinking oh I I see
what he's saying he's encouraging me to
liberate DRM encumbered materials and
make sure that others can access those
materials uh regardless of the
capitalist unconstitutional
laws and oppressive
governments and you'd be
right
you
or you might think hey he's suggesting I
know what he's saying I he's suggesting
that I should scan and copy and digitize
materials that aren't even available
online and then put them
online and you'd be correct
um
or you might be thinking hey I
uh I know a
kid and they really need to read Ginder
queer cuz they're going through some
 right now man and uh maybe I should
get them a copy of their own because
their state banned that book in public
and school
libraries that's good
too I'm going to close this out with a
uh with a dirty little secret about me
that's not really a dirty little secret
