In
the previous lecture, we considered some of the
achievements of early Greek astronomers, including those of Hipparchus, who, among other things,
measured the positions of stars so accurately that he could tell that the North Celestial
Pole was gradually shifting with time. Hipparchus also made very careful measurements of the
positions of the sun, the moon, and planets, and he could predict their future positions
very accurately from his detailed set of observations. This was very important for
astrologers because though astrology had developed long before the days of Hipparchus,
his superior measurements led supposedly to an improvement in the accuracy of the predictions
of the astrologers. These measurements of the motions of planets were also of central importance
to the development of the Earth-centered or geocentric theory of the universe,
and subsequently Copernicus's sun-centered or heliocentric theory.
Now let's consider the motion of the planets among the fixed stars in the sky. What we mean by that
is that the planets move from night to night, ever so slowly, among the stars. This is not to be
confused with the general rising of stars in the east and setting in the west. That's the diurnal or
daily motion of the celestial sphere caused by our rotation, the rotation of the earth about its axis.
But the planets drift among the stars very slowly from night to night. In this photograph,
you can see four planets, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and Mars, and you can also see a bunch of stars.
If you look at the relative positions of Mercury and this star here, Aldebaran, for example,
you'll see that in the following few nights, Mercury rises relative to Aldebaran. That is,
it's higher up above the western horizon than is Aldebaran. Now Venus and Mars and Saturn also
changed in their position relative to the stars. They moved up or eastward among the stars ever
so slightly as well, and they also move relative to one another. So a couple of nights later,
the situation looks like this. Venus is now quite close to Mars in the sky. Mercury is still hovering
above the western horizon. Aldebaran is way down there, so you see Mercury has drifted eastward
from west to east relative to Aldebaran. Venus, Mars, and Saturn have also drifted eastward.
For example, relative to the stars up here, you can see that Venus, Mars, and other planets are
moving up eastward relative to these other stars. There they are even higher up relative to these
stars, and now the moon has even come into view, and from night to night, it too will drift from
west to east gradually among the stars. Again, not to be confused with the daily east to west
motion of the whole celestial sphere. These planetary motions are very slow. Now if you look
at the planetary motions among the stars, normally they are what's called prograde,
from west to east among the stars. But for a little while each year, each of the planets
goes backwards, that is from east to west among the stars, for a little while. Here's the prograde
motion, west to east, then for a little while it goes retrograde, and then prograde again,
and it can be this s-shaped figure, or it could be a loop in the sky. It turns out that it's not a
straight line because the planes of the planets orbiting the sun are slightly tilted relative
to one another. We won't go into those details, but the point is that the ancients noted this
backward or retrograde motion. Let's take a look at a simulation of the retrograde motion.
Mars is zooming across the sky, or slowly going across the sky, from month to month, December
94, January 95, there's the retrograde motion, February 95, March 95, and then boom, it starts
going prograde again in April, May, and June. So in that simulation you could see both the prograde
and the retrograde motion of Mars among the stars in 1994, 1994-95. We will see in this lecture that
retrograde motion was central to the development of both the sun-centered model and the earth-centered
model of the universe. But first let me explain how consideration of retrograde motion and astrology
has led to a very probable explanation for the nature of the star of Bethlehem, and this explanation
has been provided by Michael Molnar of Rutgers University. Let's look at the written record in
the Bible. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King,
behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying, where is he that is born
king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him,
and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where
the young child was. When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
Now the tendency of most previous scholars when attempting to explain what the star of Bethlehem
was was to seek some sort of object with great visual impact. They generally downplayed the
importance of astrology at that time two thousand years ago. So one idea that has been proposed
is that the star of Bethlehem was a bright comet like this one. So here's this bright comet that
the magi supposedly saw yet it's striking that King Herod and people in the Middle East appear not
to have seen this bright comet. I mean if the magi saw it and it was up in the sky other people
should have seen it yet there is no note of such a bright comet by people of the Middle East. Moreover
comets two thousand years ago were regarded as portents of doom and interpreted to be responsible
for a number of disasters the death of kings not the birth of kings. Comets were objects to be
feared and loathed you know the appearance of the comet would not have been interpreted as the
herald of the birth of a new king you know just wouldn't have made sense. Another idea is that
the star of Bethlehem may have been a bright exploding star a supernova we will discuss them
later on or perhaps only a relatively bright explosion a nova. Here's an example of a supernova
that we will study later on it was a great fiery explosion of a star but a supernova in the Milky
Way galaxy would have been easily noticed not only by the magi but other people throughout the world
and there is no record of a bright star having been seen at that time. The closest people can come to
in finding a candidate is that in China in the year 5 BC a nova or a brightish new star was reported
but you know it didn't seem to be all that spectacular and and nova and supernovae didn't
seem to be of central importance to astrologers or other people at the time so it seems unlikely
that that was the star of Bethlehem. And finally had there been such a bright star
2,000 years ago now 2,000 years later there would be a remnant like this one the crab nebula the
remnant of the star that exploded and was seen in the year 1054. When we look for a remnant that's
2,000 years old we don't find one and that's pretty convincing evidence that the star of
Bethlehem was not a supernova. Most theories now propose that the star was actually a conspicuous
planetary grouping like Mars, Jupiter, Venus being in the same place in the sky or nearly in
the same place in the sky but but such configurations are really a dime a dozen they occur pretty
frequently. I have many photographs of visually striking configurations like this one with the
moon, Venus, Saturn and Jupiter or this one like Venus and Jupiter close together so it's not all
that uncommon that you have planetary conjunctions of this sort and moreover visually striking
planetary groupings did not necessarily point to a king's birth. Indeed the celestial conditions
at the time of most royal births such as those of Roman emperors were unimpressive so clearly people
weren't that influenced by planetary groupings at that time. So another hypothesis that there was no
star of Bethlehem at all maybe it was just a myth to convey the message of the birth of the messiah
but many people do believe that there is a historical basis so it is important to try to
figure out what the star of Bethlehem really might have been.
If you look at the influence of astrology at the time you find that it was huge people were very
influenced by astrology and in particular the magi practiced a certain form of astrology and it seems
likely that perhaps some obscure astrological concept known to the magi but not known to
other people practicing other forms of astrology might have convinced them that the messiah was
about to be born. This is supported by the fact that Herod and the people of Jerusalem did not
notice the star whatever it was they didn't notice it so if they were practicing a different form of
astrology than that of the magi they wouldn't necessarily have interpreted some subtle grouping
some subtle configuration out there to have the impact and the importance that the magi would
have associated with with such a grouping. So Michael Molnar in his book The Star of Bethlehem
The Legacy of the Magi explains his theory for what the star was and I think it's really quite
probably correct. He thinks that the star of Bethlehem was essentially Jupiter moving through
the constellation Aries the Ram near the time of its retrograde motion along with other astrologically
significant conditions such as the presence of the sun in Aries and Saturn was nearby as well
and Mars and Mercury which tend to muck things up were far away they were nowhere in the vicinity
of these guys and moreover Jupiter and Aries were rising in the east just ahead of the sun at this
time there were lots of things coming together supporting this hypothesis and he had this brilliant
insight when he looked at an old Roman coin from just a few years AD and you see on this Roman coin
Aries the Ram looking back at a bright star and he considered what the significance of this might
have been and looking back in April of 6 BC on the 17th in particular Jupiter would have appeared
in Aries very close to the moon in fact we now know that the moon covered Jupiter for a little
while it occulted it so Jupiter appeared in the morning sky in the east in Aries okay it was near
the moon the sun was nearby Saturn was nearby these are all auspicious things it then went along
for a few months in its prograde motion on august 23rd it reversed direction that is interpreted
to be the went before in that passage that I read it went through retrograde motion coming back into
the constellation Aries the Ram it had left that constellation for a while it then reversed its
direction and for a few days stood over that is was nearly motionless in its path because it was
reversing its direction that's when the star stood over the baby Jesus and then it continued along
its prograde motion Aries was then the sign of Judea this was in the east Jupiter Saturn the
sun were all there Jupiter was experiencing retrograde motion the moon occulted or at least was
close to Jupiter it was all there and moreover at that time the prophets were saying that the
Messiah was coming the time was ripe for interpretation of this kind for interpretation
of this kind of configuration so this is Molnar's hypothesis and I think it's a very reasonable
hypothesis for what the star of Bethlehem really was now let's get back and consider the celestial
sphere and the motion of the stars on that celestial sphere and the planets among them
the stars rise and set from east to west so do the planets so does the sun so does the moon
but the moon planets and sun move slowly from west to east among the stars from night to night very
slowly so it's natural to think that the stars are glued to the firmament to this heavenly celestial
sphere that rotates around the earth and that the planets sun and moon might be glued to other
celestial not well to other spheres between us and the celestial sphere in which the jewel like
stars are it's a very natural thing to think of course now we know that it's just a reflection
of our perspective when the when the earth is rotating about its axis but it was very natural
to think of us being in the center of a bunch of spheres an Aristotle had such a geocentric or
earth-centered model and most ancient Greeks believed the Aristotelian view that earth is
stationary and at the center of the universe the stationary earth is key in this model the earth
is sitting there the center of all things and it's not moving it's reasonable to think that the earth
isn't moving if i jump up in the air or if you do the earth doesn't go sailing out from under me
right so if it were moving quickly around the sun the earth should go sailing out from under us
well we now know that it shouldn't because of inertia we'll get to that later that's Newton
all right but it was not an unreasonable thing to think at that time moreover if the earth really
were in motion then the stars should show a parallax or a shift in their apparent position
throughout the year let me show you how that happens if the earth were orbiting the sun
and if the celestial sphere were nearby then at one position of the earth's orbit
Polaris would be along the line to the north celestial pole but six months later
Polaris would be nowhere near the apparent extension of our earth's pole okay look at that
we're looking this way when we look at Polaris from this part of the earth's orbit but we would be
looking in a different direction if we were looking at Polaris in a different part of our orbit
if the celestial sphere were nearby moreover constellations and asterisms would appear to
change shape suppose the celestial sphere is nearby and you've got this little pentagon asterism
from earth position b we're pretty close to this asterism so it looks big in the sky from position
a were considerably farther from the asterism so it looks smaller in the sky so if the celestial
sphere were small and the earth were moving the the sizes of constellations would seemingly change
now the solution of course is that the celestial sphere is really far away it's not nearby that
was the flaw in the reasoning the earth is moving but they assumed that the celestial sphere is
nearby and hence concluded that in fact the earth is not moving because of these apparent
absences of parallax shifts and and changes in shape of the constellations so here's the
Aristotelian model with the stars embedded in the celestial sphere and the planets in their own
spheres orbiting the earth of course there's retrograde motion to contend with so these
spheres cannot be rotating in a very simple manner they have to be rotating in a complex manner
and in the Aristotelian system there were 55 nested spheres influencing each other's motion
here they are here's the earth and here are all these spheres actually only some of them
and it was really quite a complex system but that's what Aristotle felt must be present in the
universe to explain the observed motions of the planets this was a cumbersome system and its
predictive power was pretty limited so what happened next was that Ptolemy a great astrologer came
along and produced a system that was much better at predicting the positions of planets as a function
of time and did not have quite the same complexity as the Aristotelian model Ptolemy's model suggested
that instead of being at the center earth was actually slightly offset from the center of a
planetary sphere so the planetary sphere rotates around us but we're not at the center there is
this deferent and the earth is offset from the center of the deferent and then there's
another point called the equant around which the sphere rotates in a fairly uniform angular way
that is by the same angle per unit time but that would mean that as viewed from earth the amount
that the sphere rotates differs as a function of time because it's the same rate relative to the
equant it's a different rate relative to the earth anyway it's pretty complex but gets worse
to explain retrograde motion planets went along what's called epicycles that were centered on
the deferent and you can see that when the planet was going in one direction along the deferent
and in the same direction along its epicycle those motions reinforce one another and that gives rise
to prograde motion but when the planet was moving in the opposite direction along its
epicycle to that of the motion of the deferent then the two could balance out or maybe even the
opposite motion could dominate leading to an apparent retrograde motion so if you look at
the combination of the motion of the deferent and the motion along the epicycle planets would
generally go prograde but for a while they would loop around go retrograde and then go
prograde again so it's the combination of the motion of the deferent and the motion along the
epicycle which is sometimes opposite to that of the deferent that gives rise to retrograde motion
so if we look here here the motion along the deferent and along the epicycle are in the same
direction but during retrograde motion the motion along the epicycle is opposite to the motion along
the deferent well tolmi's geocentric system gave very accurate results it was complicated but it
gave very accurate results and it lasted nearly 1500 years however people still felt that perfect
reality was represented by a bunch of nested Aristotelian spheres they thought at that time
that the observed world is some imperfect reflection of some underlying perfect reality and this
actually goes back to Plato and that the Aristotelian system had to be the correct one but Ptolemy's
system by his own admission was just a good calculational tool then Copernicus came along
and he presented an alternate hypothesis the hypothesis of a sun-centered universe
he did not let this theory be published until the day of his death actually you know he just
was afraid of what might happen to him if he published such a heretical theory before he was
already dead of natural causes but here's his diagram with the sun in the middle and the planets
moving around it mercury venus earth with its moon circling earth mars jupiter saturn and so on
this idea naturally explains retrograde motion in the following way here's earth's orbit and it goes
around the sun fairly quickly mars goes around the sun more slowly that was known mars takes a much
longer time to complete an orbit around the sun about a couple of years instead of one year so
if you look at the projection of mars among the stars in the sky at one position of earth's orbit
mars would be somewhere out here among the stars a little bit later earth has moved to this position
mars has moved to that position and mars has now among the stars moved in the prograde motion west
to east a little bit later here's the earth there's mars mars is still further along its prograde
path but now look what happens when the earth passes up mars in its motion it's kind of like
you're passing up some telephone poles when you're driving along the highway and their perspective
or your perspective changes you see them projected first in front of you and then behind you so here
we are earth is passing the passing mars and you can see that the projection of mars here is in the
backwards direction retrograde and from here the earth views mars in an even more backwards location
or an even more westerly location so this was east to west motion and then finally when the earth
reaches this region here of its orbit you start getting the prograde motion again if you draw these
little lines connecting the earth and mars at successive locations in their orbits so it's
really just like passing some telephone poles you're seeing them out in front then you're zooming
along and they go whoosh like that past you right your perspective changes and the poles are nearby
so it's relative to the distant mountains that your perspective changes okay the poles shift
direction relative to distant trees and mountains because you've passed them up that is what capernicus
thought happens in the heliocentric solar system now capernicus still needed the sun to be a little
bit off center he didn't have the sun in the center because he used circular orbits and these
circular orbits would not have allowed the changing angular speed of a planet across the sky
during different times of the year because if you had a uniform circular motion around you
you would you would have a uniform angular change in the sky of a planet so he needed
the planets to be on orbits that were not quite centered on the sun they were a little bit off
center and the reason that off center circular orbits worked as well as they did in capernicus's
system is that a circle whose center is slightly offset from the sun is nearly the same thing
as an ellipse especially a nearly circular ellipse
with the sun at one focus now i'll describe ellipses more when i discuss kepler and he found
that the orbits of planets are ellipses with the sun at one focus but a circle whose center is a
little bit away from the sun is nearly the same thing as a nearly circular ellipse of this sort
okay but to get really good agreement with the observations it turns out that capernicus
still needed some epicycles he still needed mars to undergo epicyclic motion of this sort
otherwise in detail the observed position of mars differed from the predicted position
now capernicus's epicycles were not there to explain the retrograde motion that's very important
capernicus's epicycles didn't need to do that because already with essentially circular orbits
around the sun you naturally get retrograde motion through this change of perspective
either when we are passing up an outer planet like mars jupiter or saturn
or when an inner planet mercury or venus passes us up either way you get retrograde motion
in the capernican system so the epicycles were needed as a fine tuning to get the observed
positions to agree very well with the predicted positions well capernicus through these studies
got a pretty good sense of the organization of the solar system and by using detailed
observations he was even able to determine the relative distances of planets the way he did this
is most easily visualized for mercury or venus the two planets closer to the sun than earth is
let's look at this geometrical structure here we are some distance from the sun let's call it one
astronomical unit when mercury or venus appear at their greatest separation from the sun
like that versus say here where they're more along the line to the sun or there
where they're also more along the line to the sun that is when they're separated by the greatest
angular distance that they possibly could get from the sun the geometry shows that this angle
the sun to the planet to earth is 90 degrees it must be 90 degrees at the time that the planet
is separated by its greatest angular distance from the sun because at that moment we from earth
are looking along a line that is tangent to the planet's orbit knowing that angle and measuring
the angular separation of the planet from the sun gives you this angle you know the 90 degrees
and you know this baseline here the distance between the sun and the earth
that allows you to solve both for the earth's distance to the planet and for the planet's
distance from the sun so you can do this for mercury for venus and then using a more complex
technique you can do it for mars jupiter as and saturn as well so using these geometrical
structures plus observations Copernicus could deduce the relative distances of the planets
from the sun and here is his table of distances compared to the modern values mercury 0.38 as far
as the earth is modern point 0.387 venus is 72 percent of earth's distance from the sun modern
value very close to that mars is 50 percent farther from the sun than earth is very similar to the
modern view jupiter 5 and 5 saturn 9 and 9 copernicus did pretty darn well in determining the relative
distances from the sun of the planets in the solar system using geometry of this sort and
figuring out where things must be to be seen the way they are
