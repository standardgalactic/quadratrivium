and archaeology just this is roughly the same period of time that white and
steward are are are trying to overturn the Boazian culture and personality
school in anthropology archaeologists now now enriched by Willard Libby's
invention of radiocarbon dating are now saying you know we can this can be the
opening wedge to making archaeology not just a matter of collecting but we can
now more seriously attempt to do developmental sequencing and once you
start down that path of developmental sequencing you are also starting down a
path of interpretation and explanation and the path moves between 1950 and 2000
in the direction of of explaining or reconstructing lifestyles that it's not
just a matter anymore of showing what beautiful objects were produced in
ancient China or or in ancient Greece but it's a matter of reconstructing
lifestyles including relatively recent lifestyles of peoples and trying to
understand why people produced what they produced why they lived the way
they did why they had the relationships that they had so this brings
archaeology even closer to anthropology and especially in America
archaeology and anthropology have a much closer disciplinary and institutional
relationship than they do in Europe for example but even in Europe
archaeology and anthropology have have have moved in a sort of convergent
path because archaeologists have become increasingly multi-disciplinary and
increasingly use tools and techniques borrowed from physics chemistry
biology material science right there is a for example by archaeologists who
study textiles who collect textiles are able to identify exactly the kind of
loom that was used to make a certain textile when you know the kind of loom
then you know a certain technology and you can put that in a sequence of
technologies and say well this is this kind of loom was only available 2200
years ago in this particular region of the world and and you can then work
backwards and figure out more about that culture then then without understanding
how to look at the specimen of fabric technologically you can read out from
this piece of fabric much more so to give a concrete illustration of this for
example a very a real world illustration of it a historian of fabric
technology looking at a piece of cheviot cloth that was unearthed in central
China and dated to approximately 2000 to 2200 BCE was able to prove that this
had to be made by Celtic weavers now the Celts lived in Western Europe that
raises an interesting question how could there be Celtic fabric in the
Taklamakan desert of China 4,000 years ago and in fact this fabric was on the
bodies of preserved bodies of a man a woman and a child who were clearly
Caucasians both the man and the woman approximately six feet tall and and
light-haired and wearing fabric now the fabric unquestionably traces back to
West European Celts so here we have we see how the technological the application
of technology to archaeological artifacts opens up whole new kinds of
anthropological questions clearly there must have been trade routes
4,000 years ago that that brought Celts to central China and so it was not only
China influencing the West by way of let's say the compass and printing and
gunpowder but the West apparently influenced China as well so between
1959 especially when when Joseph Caldwell called for a new American
archaeology more focused on something like ecological anthropology that looked
at the way cultures adapted that used artifacts to adapt to their environments
at the end of the 20th century archaeologists now are multidisciplinary
collaborative very interested in the way that cultures interact with one
another how do how does cultural change reflect cultural drift analogous to
genetic drift just random change how does it reflect cross cultural influences
this has enormously enriched the the job of archaeologists in 1900 you were
digging up the past in 2000 you're trying to explain the complex processes by
which cultures develop over time so both in the case of archaeology and in the
case of anthropology we see a very substantial conceptual evolution in the
course of the 20th century
