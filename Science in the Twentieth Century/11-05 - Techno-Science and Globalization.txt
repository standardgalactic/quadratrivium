And so, one part of the NSF budget was, I think this may be unkind, reluctantly assigned
to supporting themes in social science and the Institute for Advanced Study after tremendous
controversy in Princeton eventually developed slots for a small number of social scientists,
but the National Endowment for the Humanities was created by Congress in order to channel
resources into humanities research, not on the scale of science research, but humanities
people typically do not need particle accelerators, multi-billion dollar particle accelerators
in order to do their work.
But this gives us some idea of why, this gives you some idea of why I feel that in order
to appreciate science as an intellectual and as a social phenomenon in the 20th century,
you must look at the sciences as a whole.
You must see how the study of social science, the study of psychology and sociology and
anthropology and cognitive neuroscience and linguistics and history also was caught up
in this broad identification of science with knowledge and with truth and driven by the
ulterior motive of applying a physical and life science knowledge that the other sciences
all share in a fundamental characteristic of science.
I want to conclude with this lecture with a discussion of a development that emerged
in the 1960s that has had profound consequences for the relationship between science and engineering
and ultimately the impact on society of technological innovation.
The whole question of what the relationship between science and society should be became
an issue in the United States and in fact it became subsequently an issue in Europe
and is even now at the beginning of the 21st century an issue in almost every developing
country in the world.
It had not been an issue before because until World War II one could see science as primarily
an intellectual activity with the kind of applications that we saw that associated with
engineering which became increasingly dependent on developments in scientific knowledge but
it was industry that was perceived to have a problematic relationship to society.
It was only after World War II and the promotion of the idea that the technological innovations
implemented by industry for a profit motive came from science that all of a sudden the
issue of what is the proper place of an industrial corporation in society which agitated political
thinking and public opinion in the pre-World War II era now moved on and now spotlighted
science well if what those people are doing is ultimately driven by what you people are
discovering then people started asking the question what is the appropriate relationship
between science and society even quite radical political thinkers Marxist thinkers in the
pre-World War II period had privileged science that science was the pursuit of the way things
were and if you interfere with that by imposing Marxist dogma or national socialist dogma
whatever you're just going to it's going to ruin things.
But now people were saying that there is no kind of privilege knowledge and because it
is linked the knowledge is coupled to the way that it gets applied and therefore has
an impact on society.
So in the early 1960s the first academic program called science technology and society was
formed at Cornell University and this program had as its explicit motive to study the relationships
among science technology and society not the impact of science on society but also that
of course but also the way that scientific thinking reflects the social environment and
in between the two technology how is technology kind of the channel through which scientific
knowledge gets implemented what is the nature of that relationship.
