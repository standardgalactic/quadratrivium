Henri Becquerel in 1896 discovered the phenomenon called radioactivity.
Most famously Marie Curie and her husband Pierre became students of radioactivity and
triggered in the early 1900s a frenzy of radioactivity research which revealed the phenomena that
we had described, namely that certain kinds of atoms can disintegrate and become other
kinds of atoms that a radioactive nucleus can split in half and the elements that result
are two different elements, not a broken uranium atom but a whole krypton and a whole beryllium
atom for example that revived the old alchemical dream of transmutation.
Well look at that, well they were premature but they weren't crazy after all, you can
make gold out of lead, you can do that today if you're willing to make the investment,
it will cost you a lot more than 400 dollars an ounce which is I think the going price
of gold but it can be done.
So our understanding of matter had become seriously challenged by radioactivity, the
discovery of radioactivity and that situation was worse in so to speak when in addition
matter was discovered to have this wave particle duality.
Radioactivity I referred to earlier, revealed to us was understood by 1910, 1911 was made
up of the products of radioactivity were alpha, beta and gamma rays and we talked about alpha
rays a bit as the bullets that Rutherford used in order to explore the gold atoms and
then wound up with his solar system model of the atom, the bullets were stripped helium
atoms, there's combinations of proton and two protons, two neutrons and beta rays are
also not rays, they're actually electrons and again by 1912, 1913 it was understood
that somehow when a radioactive nucleus splits that electrons are released from the nucleus,
the electrons come out of the nucleus and they come out with some spread, some spectrum
of energies and then there are gamma rays which are really rays, they are electromagnetic
energy, they are extremely high energy photons, this is a much more complicated picture of
matter than people had inherited in the 19th century and De Broglie's doctoral thesis seemed
to make it worse but in the interval between 1923 and 1925 the quantum sky brightened and
that was because two physicists working independently of each other resolved the entire spectroscopic
crisis, they both came up with new versions of quantum theory that solved all effectively
all of the problems that had accumulated by the early 1920s so that spectroscopy was no
longer the enemy, spectroscopy was once again the explaining spectroscopic data became the
basis of support for quantum theory. Erwin Schrodinger, an Austrian physicist explicitly
built his theory on De Broglie's doctoral dissertation, not waiting for the experimental
confirmation but finding that what De Broglie said made sense to him, he developed what
he called a wave mechanics in which using very elegant features of 19th century white
wave theory of light mathematics, so again we see this evolutionary notion that elements
of 19th century theories which have been transformed in the 20th century, we don't, in 1925 we
don't hold from the wave theory of light as it was in 1830, 1840, nevertheless some of
the mathematical tools used to describe light in the wave theory were adapted by Schrodinger
into a new quantum theory of electromagnetic energy that, that's as I said resolved the
crisis of the early 1920s, a little earlier than Schrodinger, a couple of months earlier
than Schrodinger, perhaps six months earlier than Schrodinger, the German physicist Werner
Heisenberg also formulated a solution, a theory, a quantum theory that resolved the
crisis but on what seemed to be totally different grounds, Schrodinger's theory was what physicists
would call beautiful, it has a mathematical structure that is deterministic and that,
that looks recognizable, that is, it reflects a type of mathematical thinking that was well
developed in the 19th century that everybody learned in graduate school and everyone recognized.
Heisenberg's theory was in a certain sense, and I'm using terms that physicists at the
time used, not mine, was ugly.
