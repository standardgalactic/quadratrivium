that it is not based on experimental evidence and logic alone,
that a combination of logical reasoning, experimental data,
and social and psychological factors underlie theory change.
There is no necessity to replace Newtonian mechanics with relativistic mechanics.
It is a misperception to think that every new theory is better than the one that precedes it,
that there is, to put it slightly differently, that the history of science
is much closer to the history of art than it is to converging on the absolute truth about reality.
We would not, I hope, say that the post-impressionists are better than the impressionists,
that the impressionists are better than the neoclassicists,
that the neoclassicists are better than the Baroque painters.
It is not as if the history of art shows a movement towards the absolute perfect way to paint.
Each one of these aesthetics represents different responses to perceptual experience.
You may like it, you may not like it, but there is no question here of saying
that we are closer to the truth about painting than Leonardo was.
Analogously, we are no closer to the truth about reality, says Kuhn,
than we were 150 years ago.
We have more powerful theories, they are more explanatorily powerful,
but we have no guarantee that these theories are closer to the truth about reality.
They have greater predictive power, they give us greater control over experience,
they give us greater explanatory power,
but explanations have a partially psychological and sociological dimension.
It depends on what you mean by an explanation.
Deductive logic does not, in fact, characterize scientific theory change.
Well, he gives plenty of examples in this short book, qualitatively very well written,
and it was devastating.
This book precipitated this critique of rationality.
It shifted the writing of the history of science from what is called internalist history of science.
Until then, people who wrote history of science wrote about the way that theories developed over time,
from the inside, so to speak.
They described the reasoning of scientists and the mathematical equations that they used,
and then they used this equation, and then they found this, and they did that.
Now it became externalist, putting science in its social context
and trying to explain scientific activity from the outside.
And the same thing happened with technology.
Until the 1960s, the history of technology was overwhelmingly internalist.
So you could write, you could read it, for example, if you wanted to,
a history of shipbuilding, and it would be a history of all of the different techniques that are used
to make better and better ships.
But externalist history of technology looks at the political and social and economic factors
that caused there to be ships at all in this, a shipyard at all in this place.
And all of a sudden we see that science and technology, from an externalist perspective,
have tremendously significant political and social and economic relationships to society.
They are not the pure activities, the pure objective technical knowledge generating activities
that they were depicted as being.
So reason itself is now plugged into a socio-cultural context.
And in the 1970s and 80s, this came to be called, and we've referred to this before, as postmodernism.
Postmodernism is the critique of rationality as the self-evident means
by which human beings come into contact with reality and can create progress for human beings.
The postmodernists say that reason is an ideological device.
The belief in reason is an ideology that all forms of knowledge are ideologies.
They reflect various value judgments.
Even science, even engineering are incorporated into value-rich processes
that have to do with government funding, for example.
Industrial funding with local law, with social laws, etc.
And that, especially in the case of technology.
Now, there had been some externalist history of science in the 1930s,
mostly Marxist, trying to argue that, for example,
science in a capitalist society is different than science in a communist society.
But this had very limited influence.
An American sociologist who died recently, Robert Merton,
wrote his doctoral dissertation in the late 1930s,
arguing that the scientific revolution was,
especially in England, was characterized largely by Protestants,
by doing an analysis of the membership of the Royal Society of London,
showing that there was an underlying religious worldview influence
on the emergence of modern science,
which itself reflects the ideas of the sociologist Max Weber in the preceding generation.
But these were one-offs.
It was in the 1960s that the postmodernists emerging out of this anti-establishmentarianism.
So all of a sudden, history writing becomes a powerful tool for attacking the status quo.
