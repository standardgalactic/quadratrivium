Lecture 19, The Roman Imperial Army
In this lecture, I plan to deal with the second issue on the transformation of Rome from
a republican to an empire, and that's going to be what happened to the Roman army now
that you have an emperor ruling in the capital.
The Roman Imperial Army in many ways is also the creation of Augustus.
It would be reformed and added to over the course of the next 300 years, and as I mentioned
with the political arrangements of Augustus, the Roman Imperial Army also very much traced
much of its institutional history, certainly its tactics and weapons, back into those citizen
legions of the republic, at least since the 4th century BC.
Nonetheless, the Roman Imperial Army was a different institution than it had been under
the republic.
And it's important to put some stress on this because the Roman Imperial Army is to a large
extent a reflection of the larger history of the Roman Empire, and especially it is absolutely
vital to understand the arrangements of this professional army in terms of Rome's dealing
with the barbarians.
Because most of the barbarian peoples did not come into contact with the civilized Romans
of the capital who wrote poetry and the like, they came to contact with Rome through the
most ubiquitous of agents of Rome, and that was the soldiers, the commanders and officers
on the frontier, the various merchants and suppliers of the army.
Their contact with Rome was at a very different level than the literary and artistic traditions
that we associate with Gustus and the great elites of the Roman world.
But what was this army?
How was it different from the republican army?
Well, Augustus made it professional in every sense.
I mentioned in the lectures of the late republic that the Roman legionaries had certainly become
professional in their sense of fighting by the 2nd and 1st century BC, and this had been
taught to them by the very tough wars in Spain.
That the Roman commander Gaius Marius, who had been elected consul 7 times in his career,
that he had drilled the army to a professional level, that with Marius the property requirement
had been dropped, henceforth citizen soldiers who offered themselves for the draft did not
need to have property, did not need to have arms or even the training, this was taken
over by the state, that is the state would issue the equipment, the officers would train
these men to the level of professional soldiers.
That led to a more uniform sense of equipment, a more uniform issuing of equipment, a more
uniform sense of units, they were all given eagles for their legions, that is the diversity
of an army that was equipped and from citizens who offered their own arms and training was
being changed into an army that the recruits were now going to be drilled to a certain
standard and issued the same equipment more or less.
But Augustus made these soldiers full time professionals in that they were paid, an annual
wage they signed on for 20 years if you were in the legions, 16 in the Victorian guards
or 25 in the auxiliary forces, that is you signed on to the army as a career, something
that probably no Roman soldier in the Republic ever did, they signed into the army knowing
they might have six years, they'd have a long campaign, an expedition ahead of them,
they might sign up for another expedition or another war either in the Civil War or
Frontier Wars but in the Imperial Age with Augustus when you went into the army you went
in as a career and it was understood that you would be paid each year, an annual wage
you were paid three times a year, later four times a year, rations and equipment were issued
to you, you had after 6 B.C. there was actually retirement bonus, you received either a cash
bonus or a land in some instances, this was made into a fully professional organization
and in some ways the Roman army under Roman law could be classified as an ordo, as an
order, as a privileged social group in Roman society and based on the pay level they were
extremely well paid, furthermore all of those symbols and traditions of the Republic, the
various military rituals were now focused ever more on the Imperial family, Roman soldiers
always took an oath, a sacramentum, where we get the word sacrament in English, later
changed in its sense by Christian writers, they took an oath of loyalty to their commander
into the Republic, well now with Augustus you took the oath of loyalty to the Emperor
of Augustus and the Julian family and I alluded in the last lecture, one of the reasons why
the heir of Augustus was so important to be an adult male is that the army was taking
this loyalty oath to him as the future commander should Augustus be gone, the Eagles that is
the Aquila in Latin, the standard of each legion became a religious symbol in and of
itself and these Eagles usually were decorated with signs of the zodiac that indicated when
the legion was formed, there were protective animals associated with them such as a boar
or a bull, which was the symbols of strength, many of these units could trace their origin
back to the legions of Julius Caesar, Mark Antony or even earlier into the Republic and
now that these were full time units, they were, they were not, the unit was not disbanded
after an expedition, you entered into a particular legion or unit, you now moved into military
units that had their own history and tradition that stretched back by the year 200 in some
instances for 400 years and that had a very, very powerful effect in socializing recruits
into these units and giving them that professional sense and all of this is part of the reforms
of Augustus to create an army with that kind of loyalty, intensity, professionalism, knows
that it's one and only job is to fight, win battles and hopefully claim your retirement
pay after 20 years of service.
Augustus fixed the number of legions at 28 in 6 BC, there were 28 legions, he had, they
probably represented a total force of about 150,000 fighting men, a legion at this point
had about 5,200 men trained to fight, there were officers and I think there's 43 musicians
in every legion because they have all these complicated trumpets to give signals on the
battlefield, you had scribes, you had medical officials, very, the legion was a mini army
in effect, a legion was essentially, it could fight, it would be the equivalent of a corps
in modern parlance and what it could do.
We know a great deal about the army of the early imperial age, not only because of literary
sources but because of several remarkable relief works, one of them is Trajan's column
that celebrates the Dacian War and I'll talk about the column when we're discussing Trajan
later on but it is an extremely detailed column in Rome over 2,500 figures depicted showing
various aspects of Roman legionary life.
For the war we have an enormous amount of archaeological evidence, there's been tremendous
amount of archaeology done on the Roman frontiers in Britain, in Germany, in France, Roman
North Africa, less so in the Balkans and on the Eastern frontier although that situation
will change in coming decades as more and more work is being done in Eastern Europe
and in Eastern Turkey.
So for the Roman imperial army of the 1st and 2nd century AD we have a wealth of information.
We know that as a fighting force the Romans were still within the republican tradition,
they still depended on the sword as their shock weapon.
The gladius, that 20 inch sword, Roman soldiers were taught to fence in close formations, they
went in close for the kill.
I may have mentioned that we have Celtic Apida towns in southern England that have been excavated,
one of them's Hobb Hill, the other one's Maiden Castle, their Celtic bodies have been uncovered
and some of these are people who are clearly killed by the legion's 2nd Augusta under the
command of the future emperor Vespasian, they show all the sword wounds that you would expect
of Roman swords or they were the unfortunate victims of artillery fires, especially the
arrow shot by the Belistai, the artillery that accompanied the legion.
So the Romans were trained to fight in that fashion.
They now were organized into larger tactical units, this was clearly true in the army of
Caesar, it's often attributed to Marius but I think it was a unit that came out of the
wars in Spain and that was a cohort, a term that we still use in English when we mean
a group of people of associates cohort, cohorts in Latin.
The cohort in Augustus's age was fixed at 480 men, it probably was originally 600 but
as a result of the civil wars and other changes in fighting, the 480 unit was settled upon
as the fixed paper strength of the unit in the imperial age.
One way that's been determined and a number of Roman historians have pointed this out,
I'm not unique in this, is that most Roman city gates built in the imperial age, which
are often built in the form of a triumphal arch, they can handle a group marching 8 abreast
rather than 10 abreast and we think that when they switched from 600 to 480 they were now
marching 8 abreast instead of 10 abreast and I can verify that at least the gate at Nicaea,
you have to be 8 abreast, you're dealing with a 480 rather than a 600 man cohort, I mean
there's all sorts of silly ways sometimes in doing this and my students find me very
strange when I'm ordering to march and I'm careful to collect to also choose students
who represent the height of Roman soldiers, you've got to be between 5 foot and about
5, 3 or 4, we don't want any hulky German types marching through the gate and messing
up our calculations.
In any case, Augustus imposed organizational uniformity on the legions, this was important
after the chaotic civil wars, a certain uniformity in drill and equipment, a completely professional
attitude towards legions, furthermore the legions were still recruited from citizens, they signed
on as professional soldiers for 20 years, 16 if they happened to be in the privileged
Batarian guard, the garrison of Rome, but they were Roman citizens and we have a great deal
of information, statistically nothing the way a modern statistician would want, but
nonetheless we have large numbers of funerary inscriptions that were erected by Roman soldiers,
especially in the Rhineland, and in the Danube, in Britain, where the soldier gives his career
and also gives his name and sometimes place of origin and the inscriptions that we can
date coming from the 1st century AD, that is from the essentially let's say about 6 BC
or 20 BC, somewhere in there, until almost the reign of Hadrian, 117, 138, but most of
them cluster in the 1st century AD, that these inscriptions seem to indicate that the vast
majority of legionaries and officers serving in the western legions, the armies in Britain,
Rhine and on the Danube, were ultimately of Roman origin, they were coming from Italy,
or if they were provincials, they were recruited from very very Romanized areas, the province
of Bytica in southern Spain, Narbonensis, southern Gaul, a certain number of men from
Roman Africa, that is regions where Romans had settled in the Republic, where the provincials
had intermarried, and areas that were very much in Latin in speech, that would change
in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, where increasingly the soldiers would be recruited on the frontier,
these would often be sons of veterans married to local women, or in some instances they
might actually be barbarians or provincials who had gotten the citizenship and get into
the army.
The officer corps, the non-commissioned officers, the centurions, and there were 60 to each
legion, because each legion had a century of, the century was originally 100 men, it's
now 80 men, but each legion had 60 centuries, the centurions, the equivalent of the sergeants,
they were still largely Italian Roman citizens well into the 2nd century, so the armies still
retain that quality of being Roman in its composition of its men, as Latin was the language
of these men when they went in.
There seems to be an exception in the Eastern legions, especially in Syria, in the very
very arid climates, there were efforts to recruit some of the warlike races in the east, people
from Asia Minor known as Galatians, those are the descendants of the Celts, Cappadocia,
or Greco-Macedonian military settlements, settlements that had been set up for Greeks
and Macedonians by the Hellenistic kings, these were families of veterans that had come
in from the Balkans, from Greece, these people were sometimes recruited into the legions,
very often they were enfranchised, that is you get the citizenship, but the condition
is understood, you're going to become legionaries, and part of that recruitment was simply the
fact that these people were more physically fit to hold up to the arid climates, but even
there there were a large number of soldiers brought in from the European provinces, ultimately
from the Italian or from those Romanized provinces in the west, so while it was a professional
army, the legions still were very much the Roman citizens, and if you think of that for
a moment, a good deal the Roman citizen body was serving in the armies, so when the Roman
emperor represented himself as representing the Roman army, that could have been 10 to
12.5% of the citizens of the Roman world, so Italy was still well into the second century,
they're still drafting legions out of Italy, but there was a second component to this army,
and a component in the army that tended to increase over time, and that's known as the
Roman Auxiliary Army, and I've referred to them in earlier lectures, these are the Auxilia
and Latin, which in Latin originally simply meant help, we use the word in English Auxiliaries,
it's or an auxiliary, means a help, they were the help soldiers, these were units commanded
by Roman officers, and the Romans had a long tradition of recruiting allies, in the early
republic it started off with Italians, different italic peoples were in auxiliary units, the
cohort was the basic tactical unit of allied units well into the republic, it was a five
or six hundred man unit, the a la, which means a wing in Latin is a cavalry wing of about
five hundred men, auxiliary units often provided the specialties that the legionaries didn't
have, they were not the heavy infantry engineers, they were the light infantry, the archers,
the slingers, the cavalry forces, they were used in reconnaissance to protect the wings
of the army in battle, they had a number of important and specialized roles, well Augustus
professionalized these units, and the auxiliary army is very much the creation of the emperor
Augustus, these men were not second class soldiers as we would think, they were fully
professional, they signed on for twenty five years, their pay was slightly less than what
a Roman legionary obtained, but it was still a very good pay, furthermore these men would
serve under Roman officers, the language of instruction and drill was Latin, it was imposed
uniformly in the army, their officers were Roman officers, men who were Italian in origin,
many instances came from the highest ranks of Roman society, equestrians and senators,
commanded them as prefects, this would be the title of command for a man of an auxiliary
unit, the many of the centurions were actually Italians or Romans, men who would actually
train legionaries were then brought in to whip up these auxiliaries to professional level,
and furthermore when they finished their service on discharge they got Roman citizenship,
which was an extremely beneficial legal status, and by the best estimate on an average year
at least twenty thousand men a year were discharged from the Roman army, from the Roman auxiliary
army and obtained citizenship, therefore became Roman citizens and their children would have
the rank of Roman citizens and what we think happens, and we have some documented cases
but very often these auxiliaries would settle in the area where they had served for many
years, again intermarrying with local women, and their children, their sons were now available
to go into the legions, so the army, the Roman auxiliary army which perhaps was sixty percent
of the military force of the Roman Empire in Augustus's reign, that the Roman auxiliary
army becomes one of the ways of assimilating provincials into the Roman system, the auxiliary
units were smaller but they too were given specific standards and traditions, often they
were recruited as ethnic units, we know of some, several of them, there were ten very
famous Batavian, these would be people living in Holland today, there are Germanic people,
Batavian cohorts, one was actually an olive cavalry and the other nine were cohorts, infantry
units, they served side by side with the legion, the fourteenth gammona, the twin legion,
they served for many years together, usually an equal number of auxiliary units served
with the legion, so there would be about 5,000 auxiliaries and the 5,000 legionaries who
operated as a coherent force, these Batavians were, they could have represented half of
the tribes adult males for all we know, it's difficult to know how big that tribe was,
these men all went into Roman service, they were, their officers got Roman citizenship,
they took Roman names, many of them on discharge would go back to their tribes, others of them
might settle in Roman provincial towns, so that's very, very typical of it and the Romans
picked out specific people in the provinces and you can imagine the most Barbarian provinces,
Thrace which is today Bulgaria, East Syria particularly the city of Palmyra which we'll
talk about later on which is a great caravan city in the Syrian desert or on the edge of
the Syrian desert, the Gauls, the northeastern Gauls in Belgica, Germans along the Rhine both
particularly Germans that have been brought in and settled by the Romans, all of Berbers from
North Africa as light cavalry, these people were regularly recruited into auxiliary units,
the original plan was to post them far away from their frontiers so they wouldn't be forced to
fight their native people that they would serve with Roman soldiers and oh I forgot above all
Spaniards from northwestern Spain large numbers of Spaniards stationed on the Rhine frontier,
the Romans had a sense that of handling these provincial peoples that were was not too dissimilar
to the way British officers recruited people into the British army of India in after the
mutiny in 1857 the seapoy mutiny where certain martial races as the British would have said
were favored, you know North Indian Muslims, Rajaputs were favored, Gurkars were actually
mercenaries and not part of the Indian army per se but these forces were recruited from
tribal groups and communities that had a long tradition of warfare and now the Romans tapped
into this. The the result was that Augustus forged for the first time in the western tradition
a full-time standing professional army perhaps numbering about 325,000 at the time of his
death and that army which by 235 AD may have numbered as many from 425,000 to 450,000 it's
it's hard to guess we know very little about the Roman Navy we know there's a very substantial one
but we have very little information about the Roman Navy most of it was for coastal defense or
for rivers there weren't any major fleets anymore the Romans essentially had cornered the
Mediterranean and made it their own called the Mediterranean RC, Mare Nostrum, typically Roman
attitude that these military forces were comparatively small to defend the thousands of miles of
frontier to deal with the great variety of barbarians beyond the frontier and to defend an
empire which in diversity and size is really quite daunting at least 60 65 million people live
within the Roman Empire by 100 AD and they were defended by a professional army of about
400,000 and you have to keep that in perspective in the year 100 AD probably 20% of humanity lived
within the frontiers of the Roman Empire the only other state of comparable size would have been
the Empire of China and there again you would have a great bureaucratic state with the kind of
professional army to defend its frontiers especially its northern frontiers so this is a
this is a daunting achievement attained by Augustus and this army would remain a professional force
for the next 300 years and the breakdown of that professional force in a number of ways in the
fourth century is going to be very very closely associated with the demise of the Roman Empire
foremost the legionaries were not only soldiers trained to such a high professional level they
were also superb engineers they were professionals in the sense that every time the Roman legions
moved into an operation the first thing they did was dig warriors don't dig soldiers do and one
of the great achievements of the early modern age was not only just the invention of gunpowder
but also discovering in the Roman military manuals that soldiers should build entrenchments roads
fortifications something that most knights and warriors of the Middle Ages were not really
adept at doing they would get people to do it form most Roman soldiers moved a lot more earth than
through Pila or drew swords the Roman army built an elaborate system of roads that gave the Roman
army strategic mobility these were all weather roads that are still the road systems of Western
Europe canals bridges depots there is a whole sub-study of Roman inscriptions looking at
milestones these roads were constructed largely by military labor especially by legionaries
because they were the type of people who knew how to put these roads in place in the Roman
Republic the armies had perfected a marching camp I described earlier it's it's discussed in
Polybius it's a slightly rectangular camp built to a very regular grid pattern with the north
north south and east west principal road as the axes to orient the camp this would then be applied
to the stone constructions the fortified camps that come in in the second century AD and that grid
plan would survive as the downtown of many cities of Western Europe today these would include such
cities as Mainz, Cologne in Germany, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade all of them were Roman military
bases that at one point were laid out in the traditional camp arrangement and then converted
from a camp into a stone fortress this is again compliments of the Roman imperial army which
was trained to construct that way you can get a sense of how this vast construction program
carried out on the frontier zones could increase the strategic mobility and the advantage the
Romans had over their opponents I give one example of this and that is from 69 AD and we'll discuss
that civil war later on probably in the last week of January the first week of February of 69 AD
the legions on the Rhine there were at that point seven of them decided to march on Italy to put
their own candidate on the imperial throne the army of the lower Rhine and the army of the upper
Rhine sent two columns that would have to march through what is Roman Germany West Germany today
cross the Alpine passes and enter northern Italy by best guess it took between eight and ten
weeks starting in the I think in the first week of February the first column arrived in Italy
within about ten weeks on the Po battle ready followed they were about 45,000 strong followed
by a second column perhaps of 30 to 35,000 men strong two weeks behind think about it that's
something like 80,000 men crossing in the dead of winter across the Alps arriving at the beginning
of spring ready to fight there were not the attrition the losses as you had with Hannibal
the only way that could be done is by the bridge the depot the bridges the depot systems the roads
which would allow you to move forces that quickly and be ready for battle that is a testimony to
the type of organization expected and imposed on the Roman army so not only was it the battle
discipline but all of these associated skills that made the Roman army well still the envy of
most professional armies furthermore as we shall see this army will be an extremely important agent
in Romanization I mentioned the cities that were constructed originally as Roman camps and we'll
discuss that in greater detail but everywhere the Roman army would be stationed on the frontier
against these barbarian opponents initially in temporary camps that evolved into more fortified
permanent structures there was change you cannot help but being pressed by all the tools and material
luxury that went with the Roman army the Roman army would construct bath systems all Roman major
Roman camps show full hot and cold bath systems they would come with more ceramics and tools than
anyone could ever imagine in fact the Roman equivalent of a PX must have been the envy of all the
local provincials and we know that most of these Roman army camps within within a very very short
time had a associated civilian settlement it was called a connovi this was a civilian settlement
which provide all the vices and entertainment that soldiers always need and the Roman military
authorities were probably very good at positioning these connovi the best one is that car nuntum
which was the Roman base on the Danube it's it's just slightly to the east of Vienna today there's
the Roman military camp where the legions were stationed and which developed eventually into a
permanent structure and then even into a city and there's a connovi which was the civilian
settlement and I've walked it and as far as I can tell by my brisk walk a Roman soldier could
walk down there on a three-day pass and have a great time but there's no way a Roman legionary
could sneak out at night have a good time and getting back in time for roll call now I can't
prove that but it's just from my own experience the Roman military authorities knew what their
soldiers needed but they also knew the importance of discipline so sneaking out at camp and playing
it up big in the town you'd never be able to pull it off at car nuntum at least but that had a
powerful effect on changing the patterns of life in that area because the connovi brought in
civilians are brought in local people and women there would be intermarriages eventually between
the soldiers and the local women these would be informal unions that could be legitimized as
marriages upon discharge and then those children would be legitimized so you can see the powerful
attraction and force of this in professional army in romanizing the provinces with the
emperor subtenius virus in 193 211 the soldiers are actually allowed to marry officially while on
service some have seen that as a major change I don't based on our best evidence from looking at
modern professional armies maybe about half of the roman army actually officially married and
most many a soldier probably prefers not to be married and that allows you to keep a number of
girlfriends on the side at the same time there's there's well that's that's getting into the
private lives of these soldiers and I'm getting a bit speculative but I don't think that that reform
by subtenius virus was responsible for the loss of the of the discipline of the roman army through
the third century through in my opinion the whole of the third century crisis the discipline the
training the professionalism in the roman army was maintained and that kept that army at a very
via high level of efficiency so that with these legions stationed on the frontiers on the Rhine
on the danube the Euphrates along the desert frontiers usually the legions there were stationed in
cities you know back from the the desert area there is no doubt that they had the overwhelming
tactical and strategic advantage the Romans had logistics to wage winter campaigns the Romans
could move into extremely difficult and tough areas put in roads pacify regions that otherwise
would defy roman rule and one could only think of for instance wales if you go through the the
remote districts of wales the roman army could move in their bill roads and pacify wales and I've
always thought the reason that Edward the first could conquer wales and could never get the Highland
tribes under control in Scotland is he had roman roads in Wales but the Romans never bothered to
conquer the northern parts of Scotland it wasn't worth it to him so there are no roman roads to
help poor Edward the first perhaps a simplification but a testimony to the overwhelming supremacy
that this imperial army had over its barbarian opponents and it went very far to prove the
maximum implied in livi's comment that I stated I think earlier in this series is that the Romans
not only knew how to win victories they knew how to use them and that imperial army was not only
the greatest of fighting machines it was also the greatest agent of romanization that the emperors
