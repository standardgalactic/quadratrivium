The overwhelming tradition of the Greeks about these returns was that they had been disastrous and
In that I like to think that we have a memory of a campaign to Troy
Which proved to be overwhelmingly disastrous to the Mycenaean world
weakening the Mycenaean kingdoms and
Eventually seeing the power of Mycenae overwhelmed by not a Dorian invasion, but a Dorian explosion
Finally I want to try to put this into a little perspective
We've been concentrating exclusively on the Bronze Age in the Greek world and we've talked about Crete and Mycenae
We've talked about the collapse of these cultures purely in terms of Crete Mycenae and perhaps Troy
But in fact the collapse of the Bronze Age was not merely a Greek phenomenon
It occurred in the 12th and 11th century around the entire Eastern Mediterranean
For example, we have Egyptian records that speak at this time of Ramses winning victories over people
Who had been attacking the Delta the so-called Sea Peoples
so it looks as if somebody's pouring into Egypt at the same time and
We know of the collapse of Hittite power the great Hittite Empire of Anatolia with its capital Hattushash at modern Boogaz Cuyya
simply ceases to exist
around 1215 BC
So we have a number of
upheavals in the in the late Bronze Age and I think we can
Position the Mycenaeans in this upheaval a little bit more precisely
It's this way
The Sea Peoples recorded in the Egyptian records includes some very suggestive names names that often suggest where people later ended up in history
The Shadana for example
Probably those who end up in Sardinia the Tirsenae who probably end up in Tuscany, Atria, the Etruscans
Among the various tribes mentioned among the Sea Peoples are the Eqwesh and the Danyen and
These names appear to be Egyptian versions or renderings if you will of the names
Which we would recognize in Greek as Ahaioi and Danaoi
or the Danaans
The Achaeans and the Danaans as we would call them in English
These are the names by which Homer
Refers to the Greeks and yet they're turning up amongst the lists of the Sea Peoples
What's happened? I think we've got records here of Mycenaean Greeks abandoned in Greece
Leaving Greece and sailing off elsewhere
The Mycenaean Greeks are then both
Part of the collapse of Bronze Age civilization and part of the cause of it. They suffer its effects and they also contribute to it
Let me finish with two last bits of evidence
Do we have any evidence that might lead us to think that the Mycenaeans abandoned Greece?
They abandoned their sites no longer able to control those populations who had been enthralled to them earlier
One bit of evidence is that the language spoken on Cyprus
Was a dialect of Greek that is also found in the central Peloponnes
Arcados Cypriot
That linguistic similarity would make sense if people from the Peloponnes had gotten their boats and sailed off to Cyprus
That's one possibility
The other is this among the Sea Peoples are a group called the Pelliset
You might be able to guess what place or region they give their name to
The place of the Pelliset is Palestine
They're also known in other records in the Bible for example as Philistines
The Pelliset, the Philistines, Palestine
Here's an interesting thought. When you excavate to the bottom layers, to the earliest layers
Of the cities occupied by the Philistines
The type of pottery that you find there is Mycenaean
And I suggest to you that one possible explanation is that the Pelliset include in their ranks
Mycenaean Greeks
That some people never returned from Troy
Now whether it was specifically a 10 year war and whether they specifically sacked Troy, I don't know
But I think we have enough to believe in a Trojan War of sorts
A cataclysmic event that weakened Greece
And that the rulers of the Mycenaean Kingdoms of Greece either returned to find themselves under attack
Or never returned at all
I kind of like the idea I guess to pull this all together
That Goliath of Gath may have been the grandson of Agamemnon
Pelliset
