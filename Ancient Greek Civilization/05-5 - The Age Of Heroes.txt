So cobbling together both the large story of something like the Trojan War and the returns of the heroes afterwards
with these local stories of heroes
What the epic poets are doing is creating something quite unique. It is a cultural document available to all the Greeks
An epic poem available for all of them
Now we know that this carried on orally as I've said for hundreds of years
All over Greece, but then something dramatic happened around 725
And the dramatic shift is that somebody writes it down
Now when you try to consider the relationship between oral poetry that is to say a poetry of performance that changes every time you tell a story and
A written poem. I think you'll see that they're fundamentally different a written poem is something that you sit down and compose
An oral poem has its own genesis if you will
In fact writing is if you all pardon my expression a kind of arthritis
Applied to oral poetry that is to say
once you start to have written texts the oral poem can no longer keep changing as
Fluidly and as often as it had been doing up until then now it doesn't solidify
Completely straight away. We know that we can look at different manuscripts and different fragments of the Homeric poems hundreds of years after
It was first written down. We know that it was still undergoing some change
But there has certainly been a psychological shift here a notion has been created of a single
monumental version of the Iliad and the Odyssey
So what what's important about that apart from the fact that we have a reality moving to writing?
What I think happens at this time is that the Homeric poems take on a kind of status a kind of
Statue among the Greeks
They become really the nearest that the Greeks have to what we would regard as a kind of sacred text
Now recall the Greeks do not believe in a single God. They do not have a sacred text handed down from their single God
But with the writing of Homer, they do have the writing down of a moral text that they will return to time and time again
There are many passages that you can point to in the poems that I think evoke something of this quality
the way in which the poems begin to serve as
The basis for a code of moral behavior, for example, there is a point in the Iliad when Saupedon and Glaucus
Two of the Trojan heroes meet on the plane of battle and in the midst of the fray
Saupedon turns to Glaucus and he says come on
We are given double portion of wine a double portion of meat
Among the lichens whom we rule we have well watered meadows by the river. We have great power among the lichens
now
Let's go to the four. Let's be in the first line of battle so that any lichens who see us will say
Okay, they're worth their double portion of meat their double portion of wine these leaders of ours. They are not slack
They will fight
In other words the way that a Homeric hero presents himself is quite simply to be twice the size of a normal man
Twice as strong twice as powerful twice as steadfast
What the poems do is by creating such a vivid model for a man's behavior is
To establish this code of honor which is based not upon the guilt of a man
Gee if I do that I'm sinning but rather on his shame if I do that I'm going to be seen to be inferior
The entire focus of this is to create a performance of Valor
Whether it be military Valor or soon as we're going to see in another lecture athletic Valor
But either way you look at it the Homeric hero becomes the basis of what a Greek man is going to model himself on
I
May have given the impression that the poems are two-dimensional that they simply lay out how you're supposed to be and they're much more than that
And so to balance the anecdote of sub-piedon and glaucus. I have to refer to another episode which is also critical in the poems
It's one of the few moments of true intimacy
In the Iliad the Iliad is a poem of war
Tells men how to behave in war and so it has very little space for the world of the family for the community
