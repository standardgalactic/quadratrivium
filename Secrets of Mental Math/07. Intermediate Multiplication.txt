All right, let's do some two-digit multiplication.
Give us a two-digit number.
32.
32.
And another two-digit number.
67.
Take 32 times 67.
You should get 2,144.
How about another two-digit number?
77.
And another two-digit number?
98.
Multiply 77 times 98.
You should get 7,546.
Let's square a two-digit number this time.
Give us a two-digit number and we'll multiply it by itself.
22.
22 is 484.
Another two-digit?
47.
47 is 2209.
Another one?
37.
37 is 1369.
And one more?
43.
43 is 1849.
In our first lecture on multiplication,
we learned how to mentally multiply any two- or three-digit number
by a one-digit number,
and we began the process of multiplying two-digit numbers together.
But there is so much more to say about multiplication.
In this lecture, we will extend these ideas
to learn how to mentally multiply any two-digit numbers together.
We'll do this using five different strategies.
The addition method, the subtraction method,
the factoring method, squaring, and the close-together method.
We learned the essential idea of the close-together method
in our last lecture,
and squaring numbers is a nice special case of that.
We encountered the addition, subtraction, and factoring methods
when we did two-by-one and three-by-one multiplication.
Now, if you've been practicing,
then even though two-by-two multiplication is trickier,
you should have no trouble mastering these techniques.
Even if you haven't yet mastered two-by-one and three-by-one multiplication,
attempting two-by-twos, although it's trickier, I'd say,
is still a worthwhile challenge.
We'll begin with the addition method
because it's the easiest to understand,
and it can be applied to any multiplication problem.
The other strategies are applied in special circumstances,
but when you can use them, they tend to be faster.
The addition method is best utilized
when at least one of the numbers being multiplied ends in a small digit.
With the addition method, you'll round that number down
to the nearest easy number.
Let's take the problem 41 times 17.
Okay, so we'll treat 41 as 40 plus 1,
and so to do that problem, we'll do 40 times 17 plus 1 times 17.
Okay, now, what's 4 times 17?
That's 40 plus 28, 68,
so 40 times 17 would be 680.
Now, when I do a step like 4 times 17,
I may only wait a beat before saying the answer,
but you should feel free to pause me
and work out the answer for yourself.
Okay, so we know that 40 times 17 is 680.
1 times 17 is 17.
Add those together from left to right.
680 plus 17 is 697.
All right, try the next problem yourself.
Let's do 62 times 85.
Our strategy is to start by doing 60 times 85,
and then we'll add 2 times 85.
Now, 6 times 85 is 480 plus 30, 510,
so 60 times 85 is 5100.
What do we add to that?
2 times 85, which is 170.
5100 plus 170 is 520070,
and that's the answer.
Now, the next problem, 53 times 89,
could be done by the addition method.
Let's see how that's done.
We start with 50 times 89.
Let's see, 5 times 89 is 445,
so 50 times 89 is 4450.
Next, we add 3 times 89, which is 267.
Now, the hard part, 4450 plus 267,
adding the hundreds, that's 4650 plus 67,
that's 4717.
Okay, that was hard,
but I think it's easier to do this problem
by the subtraction method.
Here's how we would do it using subtraction.
Here, we would treat 89 as 90 minus 1.
So, we'll do 53 times 90,
and then we'll subtract 53 times 1.
Now, let's see, 9 times 53 is 450 plus 27, 477,
so 90 times 53 is 4770.
Now, you subtract 53 from that,
and that's 4717.
The subtraction method is especially handy
when one of the numbers ends in a large digit,
like 9, 8, or even 7.
Here, we round up to the nearest easy number
followed by a subtraction.
This next problem would be a good candidate
for the subtraction method.
Let's do 97 times 22.
Okay, so here, 97 is so close to 100,
we can't resist.
97 is 100 minus 3,
so we'll do 100 times 22,
then subtract 3 times 22.
22 times 100 is 2200.
If we subtract 3 times 22, 66,
what do we have?
2200 minus 66,
it's going to be 2100
and the complement of 66,
which is 34, 2134.
Now, one way to check your answer
is to do the problem in a different way.
So, like 97 times 22,
you could have done the addition method, right?
You could do 20 times 97
and add 2 times 97.
2 times 97 is 194,
so 20 times 97 is 1,940.
When I add 194 to that,
let's see, 194,
I'll add 194 by adding 200
and subtracting 6.
1,940 plus 200 is 2,140
and subtracting 6 is 2,134,
which was the answer we got before.
But there's an easier way
to check this problem.
This leads to my third strategy
for 2 by 2 multiplication,
the factoring method.
We first encountered this method
in lecture 3
when we learned 2 by 1
and 3 by 1 multiplication.
Here's how we do the factoring method
for 97 times 22.
Instead of rounding 97 up
or rounding 22 down,
I'm going to take 22
and I'm going to pull it apart.
I'm going to factor it as 11 times 2.
So I'll do 97 times 11 times 2.
Now, if you recall the 11's trick,
97 times 11,
let's see, 9 plus 7 is 16,
so 97 times 11 is 1067.
Now I'm going to take 1067
and multiply that by 2.
1067 times 2
is 2,000 plus 67 times 2,134.
So we have 2,134 again.
Let's use the factoring method
on another problem.
Let's try 73 times 42.
Notice that the number 42
can be factored.
It's factored as 7 times 6.
You might say that was rather fortuitous of 42.
This allows us to reduce our 2 by 2 problem,
73 times 42,
into a 2 by 1 and a 3 by 1 problem.
Here, 73 times 7 times 6,
we have to do a 2 by 1 problem,
73 times 7,
then multiply it by 6.
I might even hold onto that 6 with my fingers.
Now, 73 times 7 is 490 plus 21, 511.
And when I take 511 times 6,
we get, that's an easy 3 by 1,
that's 3,066.
Now, the reason I like the factoring method
is that it's easier on your memory,
much easier than the addition or the subtraction method,
because once you compute a number like 511,
you immediately put it to use.
Like all you have to remember,
once you get that 511,
is to multiply it by 6.
Whereas, if you use the addition method on that problem,
like you would do 40 times 73 to get 2920
and 2 times 73 to get 146,
after you computed the 2920,
you have to put it aside and remember it.
So, by the time you've calculated 2 times 73
to get 146, it's possible that after you've gotten the 146,
that you may have forgotten the 2920.
Or worse, it would have turned into another number.
So, by doing the factoring method,
there's nothing to store,
because if you don't use it, you might lose it.
So, that's why I like the factoring method better.
By the way, when doing the factoring method,
you often have several choices for how to factor.
For example, when we multiplied by 42,
I multiplied by 7, then 6.
But I could have instead multiplied by 6, followed by 7,
and that would lead to a different calculating path.
If I had done 73 times 6 times 7,
that would have turned into 438 times 7,
and that would have been a harder way of getting 3066.
You may ask, if a number is factorable in more than one way,
then what order should you multiply the factors?
Now, if you're really quick with your 2 by 1 multiplications,
then I suggest looking at the problem both ways,
and then taking the easier path.
Let's call this idea the math of least resistance.
So, for instance, let's take the problem 17 times 42.
Now, 17 is prime, there's nothing I can do with that.
But 42, I can factor as 7 times 6, or 6 times 7.
Now, typically, I'll try the larger factor first,
because I'd rather use that 7 to multiply something small,
like a two-digit number, than by a three-digit number.
So, I'll do 17 times 7, which is 70 plus 49, 119,
and I can multiply that by 6.
But before I do, let's test out the other number.
17 times 6 times 7.
Now, 17 times 6 is 60 plus 42, 102,
and oh, I get excited about that zero.
102 times 7, that's easy.
That's 714.
That was the math of least resistance.
Here, let's try 67 times 24.
Now, 24 is the answer to four single-digit multiplication problems.
It's 8 times 3, it's 3 times 8, it's 6 times 4, and it's 4 times 6.
You can also split it up into things like 6 times 2 times 2,
but we don't have to go there just using two one-digit numbers.
Okay, so there are four possible paths here.
I could do 67 times 8 times 3, or times 3 times 8,
or I can multiply 67 by 6 times 4, or by 4 by 6.
Let's start to run through them.
Now, 67 times 8, 480 plus 56, is 536 times 3.
All right, then 67 times 3 is 201.
Oh, I like that.
I'll multiply that by 8 and get 1,608,
and I don't even have to look at any of the other possibilities.
The factoring method can also be used with decimals.
I often use this method when converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
using the formula F equals 1.8C plus 32.
Now, what's nice about the number 1.8 is that it's 6 times 3 divided by 10,
and all three of those operations are easy.
So, for example, if C is 26, if that's my Celsius temperature,
then if I want to multiply that by 1.8,
I'll multiply 26 by 6, then by 3, then divide it by 10.
Now, 26 times 6 is 156.
Multiply that by 3, let's see, 300 plus 150 is 450 plus 18 is 468,
and when we divide 468 by 10, we get 46.8.
Now, to get the Fahrenheit temperature, we still have to add 32 to that.
46.8 plus 32 is 78.8 degrees, about 79 degrees.
The fourth and fifth strategy for two-digit multiplication
apply when the numbers are being multiplied close together.
We learned how to do this on paper in the previous lecture.
Now, I want to show you how to do these problems in your head.
So, let's start with my favorite feat of mental math, squaring,
taking a number and multiplying it by itself.
After all, two numbers can't get any closer than that.
We already know the squares of the one-digit numbers, like 7 squared is 49.
Let me show you the method that I use for squaring two-digit numbers in your head.
With practice, you can do these problems faster than someone using a calculator.
We'll start with the square of 13.
Now, we've already learned how to solve this problem by the close-together method,
but let me show you a slightly more efficient way,
at least you'll find the picture to be a lot simpler.
Okay, so to square the number 13.
Now, 13 is not a bad number to multiply,
but what number close to 13 is much easier?
10, right?
So I go down 3 to 10.
Now, whatever comes up must come down.
If I go down 3 to 10 to keep it balanced,
I have to go up 3 to 16.
The first part of my calculation is I do 10 times 16, which is, of course, 160.
Next, all we have to do is add the square of the number we went up and down.
We went up and down 3.
3 squared is 9, and that's your answer, 169.
Here, let's do another problem.
Let's square the number 19.
This time, the nearest easy number would be 20.
So we go up 1 to 20, and if I go up 1 to 20, I have to go down to what?
18, right?
So the first part of my calculation is 20 times 18.
That's just 2 times 18 with a friendly zero attached.
2 times 18 is 36, so 20 times 18 is 360.
Almost done.
All we have to add to that is the square of 1, which is 1, so there's our answer, 361.
All right, let's do another one.
Let's try 48 squared.
Now, this time, the nearest easy number is 50, so we'll go up 2 to 50.
We'll go down 2 to 46.
Now, we have to do 50 times 46.
There are two ways you could do it.
You could do 5 times 46 and attach a zero, right?
5 times 46 is 230.
Attach the zero is 2,300.
Or you could take advantage of 50.
50 is a special number, right?
It's half of 100.
So if I did 46 times 100, I'd get 4,600.
Half of that would be 2,300.
So no matter how you do it, 46 times 50 is 2,300.
Almost done.
All you have to add is what?
The square of 2, which is 4, to get your answer, 2,300, 4.
Now, numbers that end in 5 are especially easy, right?
With a number like 65, you could go to either number, 60 or 70.
You're going to get both numbers anyway.
If you go down 5 to 60, you're forced to go up 5 to 70.
60 times 70 is 4,200.
Add to that the square of 5, 25, to get 4,200, 25.
This was essentially the same shortcut that we learned in lecture one, right?
What did we do in lecture one?
We took the first digit, 6, multiplied it by the next higher digit, 7.
6 times 7 was 42, and then we attached 25.
But what we were really doing was doing 4,200 plus 25.
Okay, this problem is also easy.
Any time the numbers are near 100, that's especially nice, like 97 squared.
We'll go up 3 to 100, down 3 to what?
94.
94 times 100 is 9,400.
And what do we add to that?
The square of 3, not the square of 7.
Some people make that mistake.
Don't do that.
You're squaring the distance 3.
9,400 plus 3 squared 9 is 9,409.
So why does this method work?
Here's the algebraic formula that explains the method.
a squared equals a plus d times a minus d plus d squared.
Here, a is the number that you're squaring, and d is the distance to the nearest easy number.
Now, I don't actually think about this formula as I'm squaring, but it's nice to know that it always works.
The formula works because when we multiply a plus d times a minus d, we get a squared minus d squared.
That causes the d's to go away, and we're simply left with a squared.
Finally, we come to our fifth mental multiplication strategy, the close together method,
which we were introduced to last lecture, and I showed you the algebra behind it.
In this lecture, we'll apply the close together method to more problems
and offer shortcuts for doing these problems in your head.
As its name suggests, we use this for multiplying numbers that are near each other.
Let's start with the problem 26 times 23.
Now, the first step is to find a nice, round, easy number that's close to both of our numbers.
For 26 and 23, the nearest easy number is 20.
Next, we compare each number with our easy number and note how far apart they are.
If 26 is how far away from 26, 23 is how far away from 23.
Next, we're going to multiply 20 by the number 29.
Now, where does 29 come from? I'll give you five different ways to find it.
You can get 29 by taking 26 plus 3, this is what we did in the last lecture,
or you could do 23 plus 6, you'll always get the same thing.
Or, check this out, if we add the numbers 26 and 23 together, the original numbers,
we get 49, and 49 can be split apart into 20 plus 29.
So, the numbers that you multiply will always have the same sum as your original number.
I sometimes call this the push together pull apart method.
I took 26 and 23, pushed them together to get 49, and then pulled them apart.
One of those parts was 20, so the other part was 29.
Or, we can picture it like we did with squaring, very similar picture.
With 23 times 26, I brought 23 down 3 to 20, and now I have to take 26 and go up 3 to 29.
Then we'll do 20 times 29.
I've shown you four of the methods for figuring out 29.
Now I'll show you my way, the fifth way.
Okay, this I think is the easiest in your head.
To do 26 times 23, we're going to multiply 20 by something.
What's that something going to be?
Add the last two digits of the original problem.
6 plus 3 is 9, so I know I'm going to multiply by a number that ends in 9.
Since we're looking at numbers close to 20, that next number is going to be 29.
No matter how you slice it, we have to do 29 times 20.
But now you actually have to do 29 times 20.
29 times 2 is 40 plus 18, 58, so 29 times 20 is 580.
Almost done, all you have to add is the product of the distances.
6 and 3 are the distances.
They multiply to 18.
Add those together from left to right.
580 plus 18 is 598, and that's the answer.
Alright, here's another example with less commentary.
It'll go faster.
Okay, 53 times 51.
Now you could do this by the addition method, but let's try the close together method instead.
What's the nearest easy number?
50.
What are we going to multiply 50 by?
Well, by my way, 3 plus 1 is 4, so we do 50 times 54.
54 times 50 is what?
Well, 54 times 5 is 270, so 54 times 50 is 2700.
You could stop right there and you'd have a great estimate for the answer.
But if you want to get the exact answer, all you have to do is multiply the distances.
3 times 1 is 3, 2700 plus 3 is your answer, 2700 and 3.
The next problem is even easier.
Let's do 87 times 83.
Now both numbers are close to 80.
Let's use 80.
So what are we going to multiply 80 by?
Well, add the last digits.
7 plus 3 is 10, which ends in 0, so that tells me to multiply 80 by a number that ends in 0, 90.
80 times 90 is 7,200.
And now what do you do?
You multiply their distances from 80, 7 times 3 is 21, and there's your answer, 7,200, 21.
Notice that this was the pattern that we saw in lecture 1 when we talked about multiplying numbers like 87 and 83,
where both numbers start with the same digit and their second digits add up to 10 like they do here.
Now let's try the problem 47 times 45.
Here the nearest easy number would be 50.
But both numbers are below 50, so their distances are negative 3 and negative 5.
What do we multiply 50 by?
We're going to multiply it by 42.
How do you get 42?
There are a few ways you can do it.
You could take 47 minus 5, which is what you would have done in the last lecture.
47 minus 5 is 42, or you can use my method, which is add the last digits of the problem.
7 plus 5 is 12, that ends in 2, so I'll multiply 50 by something that ends in 2, namely 42.
50 times 42 is what?
Well, 5 times 42 is 210, so 50 times 42 is 2100.
Next, what do we do?
We multiply the distances, negative 3 times negative 5 is positive 15, and there's the answer, 2115.
Now let's try the problem 43 times 38.
Here the nearest easy number is 40, but one number is 3 above 40, and the other number is 2 below 40.
So what do we do here?
We're going to multiply 40 by something, and that something will live somewhere between 43 and 38.
What am I going to multiply 40 by?
41.
You could get that either by doing 43 minus 2, or 38 plus 3, or you could push together.
43 plus 38 adds up to 81.
When I pull them apart, that's 40 and 41, or just use my method, sum the last digits.
3 plus 8 is 11, so the number in between has to end in 1, so it's the number 41.
Okay, now let's do 40 times 41.
Well, 4 times 41 is 164, so 40 times 41 is 1640.
Almost done.
In fact, right now you've got a great estimate, but if you want to get the exact answer, all you have to add is 3 times negative 2,
which means you're going to subtract 6.
1640 minus 6 is 1634.
Naturally, you'll need to spend some time practicing these sorts of problems,
but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do these problems so fast
that you'll look for opportunities to use the method.
For example, if you had a problem like 17 times 76,
you could make those numbers close together by doubling the first number and cutting the second number in half.
That would give you a problem 34 times 38.
If I said both those numbers are close to 30, I'd end up doing 30 times 42 and add 4 times 8.
30 times 42 is 1260.
When I add 32, we get 1292.
Let's reinforce what we've learned by doing the problem 42 times 48 a few different ways.
Using the addition method, what do we have?
42 is 40 plus 2, so I'll do 40 times 48 plus 2 times 48.
40 times 48 works out to 1920.
2 times 48 is 96.
When we add those numbers, we get 2016.
That works, but maybe it would be easier to do the subtraction method.
With the subtraction method, I'll treat 48 as 50 minus 2,
so I'll do 50 times 42, then subtract 2 times 42.
50 times 42 is 2100.
Subtract 2 times 42, 84.
2100 minus 84 is 2,000 and what?
Compliment of 84, 16, so there's 2,016.
Or you could use the factoring method, right?
You could break 48 into 6 times 8, or various other ways,
but we'll do 42 times 6 times 8.
That, for me, was the math of least resistance.
42 times 6 is 240 plus 12, 252,
and I immediately take that 252, multiply it by 8,
and 8 times 250, that's the number I know, that's 2,000.
8 times 250 is 2,000,
add to that 8 times 216 to get 2,016.
Finally, we could have done the same problem using the close together method.
Both numbers are close to 40, we'll do 40 times what?
42 plus 8, 50, 40 times 50 is 2,000,
add to that 2 times 8, 16, to get 2,016.
In this lecture, you've learned every technique you need
to be able to mentally multiply any two-digit numbers quickly and accurately.
Which is the best method to use?
It all depends on the two numbers that you're given.
If both numbers are the same, then using the squaring method is best.
If they're near each other, or you can make them near each other,
then use the close together method.
If one of the numbers can be factored into small numbers, like 11 and below,
then you should use the factoring method.
And if one of the numbers is near 100, or if it ends in 7, 8, or 9,
then you might want to try the subtraction method.
If one of the numbers ends in a small digit, like 1, 2, 3, or 4,
or when all else fails, use the addition method.
You now understand the methods, but to be able to apply them
will require some practice on your part, which I encourage you to do now.
And to check your work, don't just solve the problem one way,
but try to do it several ways.
You're not only confirming your answer,
but you're training your brain to be more flexible
and to look for better ways to solve a problem.
This is a valuable skill, not just for doing mental math,
but for solving problems in general.
This lecture focused on two-digit multiplication.
Next, I'd like to switch the focus to two-digit division on paper.
We'll do this using the fascinating Vedic methods.
These methods are really cool, and I'll bet you've never seen them before.
I'll see you then.
