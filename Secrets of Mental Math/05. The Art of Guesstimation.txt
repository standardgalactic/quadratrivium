All right, now I'd like to try some mental estimation problems.
Here I'm not going to try and get the exact answer.
I'm just going to try and get close and try and do it pretty quickly.
Give me a three-digit number.
362.
362.
And another three-digit number.
Multiply those together on the calculator.
You should get about 165,000, 166,000 somewhere around there.
Good.
Let's try square roots.
I don't know if your calculator does it, but I think yours does.
Give me a two-digit number, and I'll try and calculate it square root.
33.
33.
Okay, so that should be about somewhere between 5.7 and 5.8.
Yes.
Yeah?
How about a three-digit number this time?
124.
124.
Okay.
So that should be about 11.13 somewhere in that ballpark.
Exactly.
Great.
In this lecture, we'll see how we can apply what we've learned to obtain good estimates.
Using mental estimation techniques, you can come up with approximate answers that you
can use to large problems that we couldn't do in our head because of memory limitations.
We'll also be able to get especially rapid answers to everyday questions where you don't
need to know your answer to the last penny or decimal point.
Let's start with mental estimation of addition and subtraction problems.
Here, we only need to consider problems where the numbers are about the same size, since
otherwise the answer is approximately the larger number.
For example, if my first number is 7 million in something and my second number is 2,000
in something, then there's some and difference would still be about 7 million.
So how do we estimate the answer to addition and subtraction problems in a word rounding?
Suppose you heard the problem 8,532 plus 3,259.
Now with eight digits in the problem, it would be a challenge even to just repeat the problem.
But if we round each number to the nearest thousand, and we can estimate our answer as,
or I listen to the numbers again, 8,532, we'd round that to 9,000, plus 3,259, we'd round
that to 3,000, 9,000 plus 3,000 is 12,000.
The exact answer is 11,791, so it's pretty close.
If you rounded both numbers to the nearest hundred, you'll usually get a better estimate.
Here we'd have 8,500 plus 3,300, which is about 11,800, and that's even closer.
The same idea applies to subtraction.
Rounding to the nearest thousand, our problem 8,532 minus 3,259 is about 9,000 minus 3,000,
which is 6,000.
Rounding to the nearest hundred, we'd have 8,500 minus 3,300, which is what?
About 5,200.
And that's much closer to the exact answer, 5,273.
By the way, it's worth repeating that this is another reason why we like to do our mental
math from left to right instead of from right to left.
Working from left to right forces us to pay attention to the most significant digits.
I find the rounding method to be very helpful when estimating the grocery bill.
As each item is rung up, I will round it to the nearest 50 cents.
So for example, $3.33 would round up to $3.50, or in my mind I just might think 3.5.
But $3.23 would round down to $3.
Okay, what if we're right in the middle?
What about $3.25?
Should we go up or down?
I will either go up or down depending on what gives me a whole number.
So if I'm holding on to $18 as my running total and I have to add 3.25, I'll call the
total 21.
But if I'm holding on to $18.50, then I'll round that $3.25 up to $3.50 so that when
I add those together, $18.50 plus $3.50, I'll have a nice even $22.
Let's estimate the total of the following prices from a recent grocery bill.
All right, actually they're the first few digits of pi, but we can imagine it's my grocery
bill.
Okay, so the first item was $3.14, so I'll think 3.
The next item is $1.59.
Well let's see, $1.59, I think 1.5, adding that to the 3 gives me 4.5.
The next item is 26 cents.
Well, I'll round that to 50 cents, 4.5 plus 50 cents gives me $5.
The next item is $5.35, so I round that to 5.5.
I have 5 plus 5.5 is 10.5.
Finally if the last item is 89 cents, I round that to a dollar to get, let's see, 10.5 plus
1 is 11.5.
The actual total is $11.23, so this estimate's pretty close.
Using this method in practice, the over estimates and the under estimates tend to balance each
other out, and your final estimate is usually within a dollar of the exact cost.
Let's move on to multiplication.
Now here is what the most important thing to know about a multiplication problem is the
order of magnitude of your answer.
Is your answer in the thousands, or the tens of thousands, or the hundreds of thousands,
or the millions?
The general rule of thumb for multiplying two numbers is this.
If the first number has x digits and the second number has y digits, then their product will
have x plus y digits, or maybe x plus y minus 1 digits.
Let me say that in English.
The length of the product is the sum of the lengths, or maybe 1 less.
So for example, if we multiply a 5-digit number by a 7-digit number, then the answer must
have how many digits?
A 5-digit times a 7-digit is going to be a 12-digit number, or maybe 1 less, 11 digits.
So it's a 12-digit or 11-digit number.
So which one will it be?
The longer or the shorter number?
To answer this question, we multiply the first digit of each number.
If that product is 10 or more, then it's definitely the longer number.
If the product of the initial digits is less than 10, then the answer could go either way,
but if it's the longer number, then the answer will begin with the digit 1.
Here, let's look at some examples when we multiply two digit numbers together.
We multiply two two-digit numbers together, how long is the answer going to be?
It's either going to be 2 plus 2, 4 digits, or 1 less, 3 digits.
Which one?
Well first of all, why is that true?
Let me say that for a moment.
If I'm multiplying two two-digit numbers together, the smallest possible answer would
be 10 times 10, which is 100, and that's a 3-digit number.
The largest problem I could have would be 99 times 99.
That's less than 100 times 100, which is 10,000.
So your biggest answer has to be below 9999, which is a four-digit number.
Now let's look at some actual problems.
Let's say 42 times 67, well that's a two-digit times a two-digit, and so it's a three-digit
or a four-digit number, but when we multiply the initial digits 4 and 6, that's bigger
than 10, so we definitely have a four-digit number.
In our next two examples, the initial digits begin with our 2 and 3, so 29 times 36 happens
to be a four-digit number, whereas 24 times 35 is a three-digit number.
When the product of the initial digits is less than 10, the answer could go either way.
On the other hand, if the product of the initial digits is 4 or less, then it's definitely
the smaller answer.
Like in this problem, 17 times 49, the initial digits are 1 and 4, so the product has to
be below 20 times 50, a thousand, so we're going to be left with the smaller answer,
the three-digit number.
For a better estimate of the answer to 42 times 67, we'd round both numbers to the nearest
multiple of 10.
So 42 times 67 in your head, you might say, well, that's about 40 times 70, which is 2,800.
The exact answer is 2,814.
Okay, you tell me.
If we multiply a three-digit number times a five-digit number, then the answer will
have how many digits?
Eight or seven.
It's either in the millions or the tens of millions.
So if I had a problem like 123 times 45678, then since the leading digits are 1 and 4,
their product is 4, the answer is going to have to have seven digits, not eight.
So the answer is in the millions.
Now, if you want to be more precise than that for a good estimate, you might just look at
the leading digits, 12 and 45, 12 times 45.
Let's see, that's 45 times 2 times 6, 90 times 6 is 540.
So I know the answer begins with like a 5 and a 4.
So I think my answer is a little more than 5.4 million.
Sometimes you can estimate large problems without counting the individual digits.
Instead we make use of words that we already have.
For example, something with three zeros is in the thousands.
Six zeros is a million.
Nine zeros is a billion.
Twelve zeros is a trillion.
So for a problem like 3,141 times 5,926, that's approximately 3,000 times 6,000, which is
18 million, because 1,000 times 1,000 is a million.
But now let's turn our attention to division.
Just like with multiplication problems, the most important point is to get the right order
of magnitude.
The rule for division is a lot like the rule for multiplication.
The length of the answer is the difference of the lengths of the numbers being divided
or one more.
This is sort of like the opposite of the multiplication rule.
In the multiplication rule, the length of the answer was the sum of the lengths or possibly
one less.
When we do division, the length of the answer is the difference of the lengths or possibly
one more.
So for example, an 8-digit number divided by a 3-digit number will have how many digits
before the decimal point?
Let's see, 8 minus 3 is 5, so the answer will either have 5 digits or 6 digits.
So which one will it be?
The longer or the shorter number?
The answer for division problems is even easier than the answer for multiplication problems.
Again, we look at the first digits, but instead of multiplying the first digits, we don't
divide the first digits, we simply compare the first digits.
More specifically, if we divide, let's say, the number A by the number B, if the first
digit of A is smaller than the first digit of B, then we have the smaller choice.
So for instance, if I took the 8-digit number, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, divided by the 3-digit
number, 9, 8, 7, 8 minus 3 is 5, so do we have a 5-digit or a 6-digit number?
Well since 1 is smaller than 9, it's the smaller choice.
It has 5 digits.
On the other hand, if the first digit of A is larger than the first digit of B, then
it's the larger choice.
So in this next example, the 8-digit number divided by the 3-digit number, since 2 is
bigger than 1, the number of digits is 8 minus 3 plus 1, which is 6 digits.
If the first digit of A is the same as the first digit of B, then we have to compare
the first and second digit of each number.
So for example, with a 6-digit number divided by a 3-digit number, let's do a few examples
how many digits will be in our answer, either 3 digits or 4 digits, right?
So if it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 divided by 7, 8, 9, since the first number has a smaller
leading digit, it's the smaller choice, the 3-digit number.
Whereas in this next problem, where we have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 divided by 1, 2, 3, since
the first digit of the 6-digit number is larger, then we have the larger choice, the
4-digit number.
And in here, if I divided 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by 1, 6, 1, I now compare 12 with 16.
Since 12 is smaller than 16, it's the smaller choice, the 3-digit number.
So here's an example.
Let's say your town needs $4 million by taxing each home.
$4 million, that's a big number, it's 7 digits long.
And let's say there are 12,000 homes in your town, 12,000 has 5 digits.
Then how much will it cost each home?
Now our answer will have 7 minus 5 or 7 minus 5 plus 1, which will it be?
How many digits?
Well 4 is bigger than 1, so it's the larger choice, it's 7 minus 5 plus 1, 3 digits in
your answer.
And since 4 divided by 12 is about 0.333, the answer will be about $333.
Okay let's try an astronomical calculation.
How long does it take light from the sun to reach the earth?
Since the sun is 93 million miles away and light travels at about 186,000 miles per second,
the number of seconds will be the answer to the division problem, 93 million divided
by 186,000.
My first step would probably be to simplify those numbers by dividing both of them by
1,000.
So now I'm thinking about 93,000 divided by 186.
Now the answer is going to have how many digits?
I've got a 5-digit number divided by a 3-digit number, which means my answer will have either
2 digits or 3 digits, and since 9 is bigger than 1, it's going to be a 3-digit number.
Now as it happens, we can get a very accurate estimate here.
To do 93,000 divided by 186, notice that 186 times 1,000 is 186,000, and that's twice,
exactly twice, 93,000.
So that means that 186 times 500 will be 93,000.
Therefore 93,000 divided by 186 is 500 seconds, or about 8 minutes 20 seconds for the light
from the sun to reach the earth.
Here's another physical estimation problem.
How long is this table?
You may not have a tape measure handy, but your hand is always handy.
Your body is like a walking yardstick, and it's worth knowing things like the width
of your hand from pinky to thumb, or the size of your footsteps, or parts of your hand that
measure to almost exactly 1 or 2 inches, or 1 or 2 centimeters.
For example, in my case, my pinky to thumb length is almost exactly 20 centimeters.
That's about 8 inches, and the length of my index finger from top to bottom is almost
exactly 7 centimeters.
Multiply that by 0.4, that's about 2.8 inches.
Using these, I can estimate the length of this table.
So let's do it.
Each hand length is 20 centimeters, so I'll count by 20s.
20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, just a tad more than 140.
So that's 140 centimeters.
If I multiply that by 0.4, that's about 56, maybe 57 inches.
If I look at the side of this table, I have 20, 40, 60, 80, whoops, I overshot, overshot
by almost the length of a finger, that's 7, 80 minus 7 is 73 centimeters, so that would
be about 29 inches, 28, 29 inches.
The next guesstimation application combines addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.
It begins with a problem that could well appear on a standardized test.
Suppose you write a document and you send it to two proofreaders.
One of the proofreaders finds 25 typographical errors, the other finds 36 typos, and there
were 15 typos that were found by both of them.
The question is, what were the total number of different typos found?
Was it 30, 46, 61, 73, or the answer cannot be determined from the given information?
You may want to pause to think about what your answer would be.
The answer is B. There were 46 different typos found.
Together, the reviewers found 25 plus 36, that's 61 typos, but 15 of those errors were
counted twice.
Thus we subtract 15 from 61 to get 61 minus 15 is 46 typos.
That was answer B.
But now here's a harder problem.
How many errors remain in the document?
Although there's not enough information to answer this question with certainty, there's
a pretty good estimate due to the great mathematician George Poya, author of the classic book How
to Solve It.
If the first reader finds X typos and the second reader acting independently finds Y
typos and there were Z typos found by both of them, then by the logic of the last problem,
the number of different typos reported is X plus Y minus Z.
Poya showed that the best estimate for the total number of typos in the document, instead
of being X plus Y minus Z, it's X times Y divided by Z.
So in this problem, X is 25, Y is 36, that's how many typos each proofreader found, and
Z was 15, the number of typos found by both of them.
So the expected number of typos is 25 times 36 divided by 15.
15 has a factor of 5 and 3, and when I cancel a 5 from the 25 and I cancel a 3 from the
36, I'm left with 5 times 12, which is 60.
So how many typos do we expect left in the document?
Well we found 46 of them already, and Poya estimates that there are a total of 60 in
the document, so we think there should be about 60 minus 46, about 14 typos left.
What's cool about this answer is it does not depend on how long the article is.
So if this document was like the first draft of a novel, 14 typos might be okay.
But if the document was a two page memo, you may want to check it more carefully.
Let's look at the estimation of sales tax or value added tax.
If the tax is a whole number, like 4%, then it's really just a straight multiplication
problem.
For instance, if the purchase of a car was $23,456, then to estimate 4% tax, I take 23,000
times .04.
Let's see, 23,000 times 4 is 92,000, when I divide that by 100, that's $920.
The exact answer is a little over $938.
If the tax is not a whole number, let's say it's 4.5%.
I calculate the tax using 4%, just like we did before, but then I would divide that tax
by 8 to get the additional half a percent.
The reason that works is I'm taking that 4%, dividing it by 8, and 4 over 8 is a half.
So in the previous example, the 4% tax estimate was $920.
If I want 4.5%, I just take that 920 and divide it by 8.
If you divide 920 by 8, you get 115, and if you add that to 920, you get an estimate of
$1,035.
This is similar to the tip that my mother taught me long ago for figuring out 15% tips
at a restaurant.
She would do 10%, then add half of that to get the additional 5% to get a 15% tip.
So for example, if it was $42, the tip would be $4.20, that's 10%, plus half of that $2.10
to get $6.30.
With practice, you'll find these calculations of tips and taxes are not all that taxing.
Thinking of money, let's do some calculations that are more interesting, beginning with
the famous rule of 70.
Suppose that a bank offers you an interest rate of 3% per year.
If you keep your money in the bank, how many years will it take for your money to double?
The rule of 70 says that the answer is going to be 70 divided by the interest rate.
So with an interest rate of 3%, we divide 70 by 3 to get 23 into 3rd, so it'll take
about 23 years for your money to double.
With an interest rate of 5%, you do 70 divided by 5, which is 14.
So it should take about 14 years for your money to double.
Indeed, if you took $1,000, then after 14 years, you'd have 1,000 times 1.05 times 1.05
14 times to get a little over $1,979.
By the way, the reason why this rule works is based on natural logarithm and the beautiful
number E studied in pre-calculus.
But fortunately, we do not need to use any higher mathematics to apply this rule.
Here's another interesting calculation, and although the exact formula requires a calculator,
we can still do some useful estimating.
Besides, it's such an important formula, and it's so rarely taught in school that I feel
obligated to include it.
Suppose you borrow $200,000 to buy a house, and the bank charges an interest rate of 6%
per year compounded monthly.
What that means is that it's charging you 6 over 12, a half a percent interest for every
month of your loan.
Suppose the bank gave you 30 years to repay your loan.
How much will you need to pay each month?
Before I give you the exact answer, let's do some ballpark estimates.
First of all, the number of monthly payments is how many?
You've got 30 years to pay it, 12 months in a year, that's 30 times 12, 360 monthly
payments.
Now, if the bank did not charge you any interest, that's a big if, but if the bank did not
charge you any interest, then your monthly payment would be $200,000, the size of your
loan, divided by 360.
You can simplify this by dividing everything by 10 to get the problem 20,000 divided by
36.
Even mentally, you could divide everything by 4 to get 5,000 divided by 9, or equivalently
1,000 times 5 9ths.
Since we know the fraction 5 9ths is about 0.555, then this would give you a monthly
payment of about 1,000 times 0.555, in other words, about $555 per month.
That's if the bank did not charge you any interest.
But remember, the bank is charging you half a percent of interest every month, so your
monthly payment will be higher than that.
How much higher?
A lot higher.
Okay, what is half a percent of $200,000?
That's the amount of interest you're going to owe in the first month.
Well, 1% of $200,000 is $2,000, so half a percent would be $1,000.
So a quick estimate of your monthly payment would be $1,000 just to cover the interest
for that month, plus $555 to go towards the principal.
At $1,000 plus $555, you get $1,555.
Now this is an estimate of your monthly payment, but it will always be on the high side.
Since after one payment, you wouldn't owe the bank $200,000 anymore.
You'd owe it $555 less than that.
So summing up, we know that our monthly payment must be somewhere between $555 and $1,555.
It would be tempting to estimate your monthly payment as the average of these two numbers.
$555 and $155 have an average of $1,055, which is a better guess than either of these numbers.
So here's a more accurate formula for your monthly interest, but it definitely requires
a calculator.
If the amount of money that you borrow is P as in principal, and you're charged a monthly
rate of I, and you have M months to pay it back, then your payment will be given by this
formula, P times I times 1 plus I to the M divided by 1 plus I to the M minus 1.
Let's look at some numbers.
In our last example, P was $200,000.
The interest rate per month was 0.5% or 0.005, and the monthly payments M was 360.
I'm sorry, that's the number of months is 360.
So plugging that all in, the monthly payment would be given by this.
Now if you use a calculator or even a search engine to compute 1.005 to the 360, that gives
you 6.022, then the entire formula here simplifies to $1,199.10.
So our monthly payment is about $1,200 a month.
This seems reasonable since it's in between our lower bounds and upper bounds of $555
and $1555, and it's higher than the average of those numbers.
I've included additional examples of these problems in the course guidebook.
Finally, I'd like to turn our attention to the estimation of square roots.
The square root of a number, when multiplied by itself, gives you the original number.
So for example, the square root of 25 is 5, since 5 times itself is 25, and the square
root of 100 is 10, since 10 times itself is 100.
Numbers like 25 and 100 are called perfect squares, since their square roots are whole
numbers.
On the other hand, a number like the square root of 2 evaluates to something like 1.414,
which is not a whole number.
Square roots arise in many physical and statistical calculations.
For example, in a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is the square root of a squared
plus b squared.
For example, if we can estimate the length and depth of this table, then we can use square
roots to estimate the length of the hypotenuse, the length of the diagonal that goes from
this corner of the table to that corner of the table.
In statistics, if n randomly chosen people are asked a yes-no question, then the margin
of error on the survey is 1 over the square root of n.
What this means is that 95% of the time, the sample's average will be within 1 over the
square root of n of the true average.
For example, if 100 people are chosen at random and asked if they approve of the president's
policy, then since the square root of 100 is 10, 95% of the time, the results of the
sample will be within 1 tenth or 10% of the national approval rating.
Whereas if 900 people are surveyed, then since the square root of 900 is 30, the margin of
error is 1 over 30, or 3.3%.
So here, 95% of the time, the survey sample is within 3.3% of the national approval rating,
even if the nation has millions of people.
So how do you find square roots when you don't have a perfect square?
Like how would you find the square root of 40?
I like to estimate square roots using the divide and average method.
Here's how it works.
To find the square root of a number like 40, you start by taking any reasonable guess.
Now here, 6 squared is 36, and 7 squared is 49, 40 lives between 36 and 49, so the square
root has to lie between 6 and 7.
And now since 6 squared is closer to 40 than 7 squared is, I'll make an initial guess of
6.
All right, now first step, we divide by 6.
40 divided by 6 is 6 with a remainder of 4, that's 6 and 2 thirds.
In other words, 6 times 6 and 2 thirds is 40.
Now since 6 times, that means that 6 times 6 is going to be less than 40, that tells
me that the square root of 40 is bigger than 6.
And 6 and 2 thirds times 6 and 2 thirds will be bigger than 40, so that tells me the square
root of 40 is less than 6 and 2 thirds.
So the square root has to lie between 6 and 6 and 2 thirds.
So next, we average those numbers, 6 and 6 and 2 thirds.
Their average is 6 and 1 third, that's 6.33, so we'll estimate the square root of 40 to
be about 6.33.
The exact answer begins 6.32, so that's very close.
In this lecture, we've been exposed to a lot of practical methods for estimating addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, square roots, and other physical problems.
In the next lecture, I'll show you how you can do these problems and more almost instantly
when you allow yourself pencil and paper, but using methods that they seldom teach you
in schools.
I estimate that you'll enjoy that lecture quite a bit.
