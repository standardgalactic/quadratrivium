Okay, last but not least, I'm going to try to square a five-digit number.
I'm going to ask for people on the first row to each give me a single-digit number.
That will be the five-digit number that I will square.
I'm not going to beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try and get it right.
A single digit, please.
Seven.
Seven.
Two.
Two.
Four.
Four.
One.
Three.
Three.
Two thousand four hundred thirteen squared.
Yuck.
Here we go.
Alright, 72 times 413.
413 times 8 times 9 is 3304 times 9 is 29,736.
Double that to get 59,472.
59,472 becomes Lip Rockin.
Lip Rockin is 59,472.
Okay, next slide.
It's 72 squared, which is 5184, so I can say five billion.
Take the 184.
Add that to Lip.
184 plus 59 is 243 million.
Rockin, Rockin.
Okay, next slide.
413 squared.
That's 400 times 426 plus 13 squared.
That's 170,569.
Leash up if I need it.
Leash up.
Take the 170.
Add that to Rockin to get 642,569.
Good.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Phew.
Well, here we are at the last lecture.
Let's take stock of how far we've come.
Beginning with little more than our multiplication tables,
tables, we've learned how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide enormous numbers.
We've improved our ability to remember numbers and learned other impressive feats of mind.
You may be surprised at how much you've learned in just the few hours that we've been together.
One of the lessons we've learned is that all numbers are not created equal.
It usually pays to look at your numbers and see if there's something about the problem
that can make your job easier.
Can one of your numbers be broken into small factors?
Or are the numbers close together?
Or can one of those numbers be rounded to give a good approximation, or as the first
step towards getting the exact answer?
For example, before this course, if you saw a problem like this, your reaction might have
been impossible.
I could never do that problem in my head.
But my hope is that now your reaction is, wait a second, there's something I can take
advantage of.
I really can do this problem.
These are close to 1,000.
I could do 997 minus 6 to get 991.
Multiply that by 1,000 to get a great approximation, 991,000.
And then add negative 3 times negative 6, 18 to get 991,018.
Mental math is not hard if you think of the problems the right way.
Or maybe I should say the left way, since it's almost always easier to work from left
to right.
And here's another principle.
Hard addition problems can often be made into easy subtraction problems.
And hard subtraction problems can be turned into easy addition problems.
For example, if your first item costs you $2.34, and your second item costs $4.88, rather
than shy away from the calculation, you might instead start with an estimate.
Let's see, 234 plus 488.
Almost like 234 plus $5, that's 734.
But we know that's a little high, but how high is it?
Well we round it up by 12 cents, so we'll take 734 and subtract 12 cents to get 722.
I'll bet if I ask you to make change from $100, you can easily do it in your head.
Using compliments makes problems you may encounter all the time easier than they were before.
For example, if I asked you to, say, find change for $62.82, okay, from $100, you know
that the dollars add to 99, and the cents add to 100.
So the change will be, let's see, $62, that means the change will be $37, and the complement
of 82 cents is 18 cents.
It's a small difference from what you might have done before, but it can change your whole
attitude towards such calculations.
There are lots of other places in your daily life where you can use what you've learned
in this course, like balancing your checkbook, figuring out your restaurant tip, or your
total ATM deposit, or estimating your grocery bill at the checkout counter.
Suppose you purchase 21 meals for $29 a piece.
What's the total cost?
Okay, quiz.
Which multiplication method would you use to determine the answer to 21 times 29?
The addition method, the subtraction method, the factoring method, the close together method,
or all of the above?
The answer, all of the above.
Let's run through all the different ways to do this problem.
Not only is it cool that we always get the same answer, this is very useful cross-training.
One of the secrets of becoming a mental athlete is that trying a problem more than one way
will make you faster, better, and it's more likely to make the whole experience enjoyable.
Okay, by the addition method, we would break 21 into 20 plus 1.
20 times 29 is 580 plus 29 is 609.
That was the addition method.
By the subtraction method, we would treat 29 as 30 minus 1.
So we'll do 30 times 21 and then subtract 21.
30 times 21 is 630.
When we subtract 21, we again get 609.
Or you could try the factoring method.
We can factor 21 as 3 times 7 or 7 times 3.
When we do 3 times 7, the problem becomes 29 times 3 times 7.
29 times 3 is 87 and when we multiply that by 7, we get 609.
Or if you had factored that as 29 times 7 times 3, 29 times 7 is 203, immediately hit
that with another 3 to get 609.
Perhaps fastest of all would be the close together method where we would say, well,
29 times 21, those are close together, they're near 20, 29 plus 1 is 30, we multiply that
by 20 to get 600, add to that 9 times 1 to get 609.
No matter how you slice it, you pay 609 dollars.
Hey, by the way, suppose you get a 20% group discount on these meals, then how much do
you owe?
Well, to take a 20% discount of 609 dollars, you multiply it by 80%, or 0.8, and we have
a simple 3 by 1 problem.
8 times 609 is 4872, so that would be 487 dollars 20 cents.
Okay, question.
If you take a 5-digit number times a 3-digit number, how many digits are in the answer?
Okay, well, we know that 5 plus 3 is 8, so the answer has 8 digits or maybe 7, which
is more likely, 8 digits or 7.
The answer is, it depends.
If you take what we said about estimating and just assume that each number has an equal
chance of appearing, then you'd probably say the 8-digit number, since if we pick the
first digit of each number at random, then we know from our multiplication table there's
a very good chance that the product of those digits will be bigger than 10.
That'll give us the larger number, the 8-digit number.
But in much of the real world, it's far more likely that the 5-digit number and the 3-digit
number will begin with a small number, like 1 or 2 or 3.
And that, in turn, makes it actually about 50-50 whether you get the longer number or
the shorter number.
It turns out that for most collections of numbers, whether they be randomly chosen street
addresses, lengths of rivers, or numbers on a tax return, there are considerably more
numbers that start with 1 than start with 9.
On average, about 30% of the numbers we encounter tend to start with 1.
About 18% start with 2, going all the way down to just 5% of numbers that start with
9.
Look in your address book and look at all of the street addresses you have.
You'll see way more of them that start with 1 than start with 9.
This phenomenon is known as Benford's Law.
The probabilities that we see are determined by base 10 logarithms.
That is, the 30.1% figure comes from the log of 2, which is 0.301.
And the log of 3 is 0.477, and when you subtract that from 0.301, you get 0.176.
That's the 17.6% figure, and so on.
Benford's Law is actually used by auditors as a way of detecting fraudulent data on tax
returns, and you might use it as a guide for yourself to figure out which numbers you're
most likely to find yourself calculating.
Some people refer to the prevalence of small numbers as the principle of looking out for
number 1.
This is yet another illustration of the other principle that we've mentioned that all numbers
are not created equal.
What else have we learned?
Have you applied the phonetic code to your favorite tax ID number or credit card number?
If not, you should really give it a try.
In the long run, you will save yourself tons of time carrying those important numbers in
your head.
Trust me, you will use the results for the rest of your life, or at least until the next
expiration date.
And speaking of dates, what's the year code for this year?
I hope you know it.
Can you verify today's date using our method?
Just try it a few times, and you'll see how handy it is.
And once you know the method, you can determine days of the week like, oh, let's look at January
1st, 2025, okay, the next perfect square year.
How would we calculate January 1st, 2025?
Let's see.
Now, 2025 is not a leap year, so January will have a month code of 6.
So January 1st, I'll add 1 to that to get 7.
Hey, that's the same as 0, so I have a 0 as far as I'm concerned.
All I now have to figure out is the year code for 2025.
What's the formula?
It was years plus leaps minus multiples of 7.
If I take the years, that's 25.
To get the leaps, I divide that by 4 to get 6.
25 plus 6 is 31.
And now I subtract the biggest multiple of 7.
Let's see, 31 minus 28 is 3.
Add that to my 0, and I have day number 3, which will be Wednesday, right?
That's the day that comes after Tuesday.
My hope is that in this course, you've learned to look at numbers differently, even when
you don't have a math problem to do.
Suppose your hotel room number is 126.
What might you notice about this number?
You might add the digits and realize, hey, that's a multiple of 9, right?
1 plus 2 plus 6 is 9.
You might then divide your number by 9 and realize that it's 9 times 14.
Or you could turn 126 into a word.
Let's see, I've got a D sound, an N sound, and a J sound.
I can make words like Danish, or teenage, or dingy.
Yes, I have a dingy room.
And you'd never confuse it with a number like 125, because 125, you'd remember that
that's 5 cubed, or that becomes a word like tunnel, or toenail, or denial.
Just the act of giving the number a little bit of extra thought like we're doing here
will make it a lot easier to remember.
The same is true when solving a mental math problem.
It usually pays to take a few seconds to really look at your problem and try to find
features that you can exploit.
Here's a nice example of that.
It's a scaled-down version of what the Guinness Book of World Records uses to determine the
fastest mental calculator.
Let me show you how to find the cube root of a number when the answer is a two-digit
number.
For example, if I cube a two-digit number, and the answer is 54,872, then what was the
original two-digit number?
This is actually very, very easy to do once you know the secret.
All you need to know are the cubes of the numbers from 1 through 10.
And most of the cubes you already know, right?
One cubed is 1, two cubed is 8, three cubed is 27, four cubed is 64, five cubed is 125.
And if I skipped ahead and I said 10 cubed, you'd say, you'd say you're welcome.
You'd say 10 cubed is 1,000, right?
So there's really only four more cubes you need to learn.
The cubes of 6, 7, 8, and 9, which are 216, 343, 512, and 729.
Study this table for just one minute, maybe two minutes, until you know it solidly.
And if it helps you, maybe turn those four new cubes into words using the phonetic code.
Okay?
After you've studied it, come back, pause the course now, and come back to me.
Okay.
I'm going to ask you now, can you tell me the cube of 6?
It's 216.
And 7 cubed is 343, 8 cubed is 512, and 9 cubed is 729.
Good.
Okay.
Now, I'll give you a number, and what I want you to tell me is which cubes are on both
sides of it.
For example, the number 20 is between 8 and 27.
In other words, the number 20 is between 2 cubed and 3 cubed.
That would be your answer.
20 is between 2 cubed and 3 cubed.
Okay.
75 is between which two cubes?
It's between 64 and 125.
So 75 is between 4 cubed and 5 cubed.
314, 314 is between 216 and 343.
It's between 6 cubed and 7 cubed.
And 888, that's between 729 and 1,000.
It's between 9 cubed and 10 cubed.
Okay.
We'll see how this will pay off in just a moment.
The other thing I want you to look at on our list of cubes are the last digits.
Look at them.
1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9, 0, they're all different.
Moreover, the cube, the last digit of the cube, either matches the original number or
it's the 10's complement of the original number, right?
1 cubed ends in 1, 2 cubed doesn't end in 2, but 2 plus 8 is 10.
It ends in 8.
3 cubed ends in 7.
And check that out.
1, 8, 7, add up to 10.
4 cubed ends in 4.
They match and so on.
Okay.
Now suppose I cube a two-digit number and the answer is 54,872.
What's the original two-digit number?
Okay.
In other words, what's the cube root of 54,872?
To answer this, we look at how the cube begins and how the cube ends.
First we look at the thousands, the numbers behind the comma.
Here we have 54,000 and 54 is between what two cubes?
It's between 3 cubed and 4 cubed.
Now 3 cubed is 27, tells me that 30 cubed is 27,000.
And 4 cubed is 64, tells me that 40 cubed is 64,000.
Our number begins with 54,000, so it's living between 30 cubed and 40 cubed.
That tells me that the cube root has to be in the 30s.
The answer has to be 30 something.
30 what?
Well, now we look at the last digit of the cube, which in this case is 2.
But we know there's only one number whose cube ends in 2, namely 8 cubed is 512.
That ends in 2.
So if we want our cube to end in 2, the cube root must end in 8, so the cube root is 38.
Okay.
Now it's your turn.
Try to find the cube root of 262,144.
First we look at the thousands, which is 262.
Here we notice that 262 is between 6 cubed and 7 cubed.
So that tells us that our cube root has to be in the 60s.
60 what?
Now we look at the very last digit of our cube, which in this case is 4, and only one
number when cubed ends in 4, namely 4.
So the answer has to be 64.
I should point out that this method only works when we're dealing with perfect cubes.
If we change the last digit of the last problem to 5, it would no longer be a perfect cube.
This cube root would not be 65.
The cube root would still be in the 60s, but the cube root would be a hair bigger than
64.
You'll notice the cube rooting of two digit cubes doesn't really require much in the way
of calculation.
It's more like observation, looking at the number and taking advantage of a beautiful
pattern.
Finally, you should remember that mental calculation is a process of constant simplification.
Our problem may start off sounding hard, but by breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces,
we're making the problem simpler.
Even very large problems can be broken down into simple steps.
I'll illustrate this by doing one last large calculation for you, the squaring of a 5-digit
number.
Now, to verify our answer, we'll need a calculator that can handle 10 digits.
To give myself a random problem here, I put the calculator on.
To give myself a random problem, I have a shuffled deck of cards here.
I've removed the 10s, jacks, queens, and kings, and I'm going to shuffle the cards one more
time here, so you know I'm being completely honest.
And then I will spread the cards out and pick five cards here at random.
I'll even close my eyes as I do this, so here's card one, two, three, four, and five.
So here's the problem, 47,893 squared.
I'm just going to put 47893 on the calculator, and here we go.
Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
I'll break the problem down into three parts.
I'll do 47,000 squared plus 893 squared plus 47,000 times 893 times 2.
Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer.
Here, I'll even tell you something else.
As I've been talking out loud, I've been thinking about how I'm going to do the problem.
Like 47, that's prime, but 893, that's close to 900.
It's 900 minus 7, that's how I'll multiply it by 47.
And I've even done 47 times 7, 329 in my head to sort of, I'm not going to try and
remember that, it's just sort of getting the calculation so that when I do it later, the
answer is going to feel more familiar.
Okay, without any more stalling, here we go.
I'll start the problem in the middle with 47 times 893, that's 900 minus 7, I'll take
advantage of that.
947 is 42,000, 300, 42,000, 300 minus 329 using compliments is 41,971, 41,971, double that
to get 83,942, 83,942 becomes fame brown, fame brown, I'm using the phonetic code,
fame brown.
Okay, great.
Now what do I do?
I say 47 squared, which is 2,209, so I can say 2 billion.
Take the 209, add that to fame, 209 plus 83 is 292, but I see a carry coming, so I'll
say 293 million, brown, brown, brown.
Okay, finally I do 893 squared, that's 900 times 886 plus 7 squared, it's 977,449, re-rope
if I need it, re-rope, take the 797, add that to brown to get 739,449, well let's check
it out, if I square that number we get 2,293,739,449.
So how did I do that last calculation?
Essentially I used the math of least resistance, that is the hardest part of this was going
to be 47 times 893, and looking at those numbers, doing something like a crisscross method,
I said well 893 is 900 minus 7, and I took advantage of that, and certainly the mnemonics
came in handy as well.
So what does it take to get into the Guinness Book of World Records for mental calculation?
A lot more than this, it used to be that to get into the Guinness Book you had to quickly
determine the 13th root of a 100 digit number, the judges would take an 8 digit number, raise
it to the 13th power, and you'd have to reveal the original 8 digit number.
To solve this problem, you'd go through a process very similar to what we just learned
about finding cube roots, but the numbers are considerably larger.
To do it, you'd look at how the 100 digit number began, and which would tell you the
first 3 or 4 digits of your 8 digit number, then you'd look at how it ended which would
tell you the last 3 or 4 digits of the 8 digit number, then maybe you'd do some approximating
for the middle digits.
So if you were willing to memorize about a thousand openings and a thousand endings,
as many people aiming for the Guinness Book are, you might be able to do that kind of
problem without any calculating.
Since this was becoming more of a test of memory than of calculation, a few years ago
the criterion was changed to finding the 13th root of a 200 digit number, resulting in a
16 digit number.
The record is held by Alexis Le Maire, a French computer scientist who once solved this problem
in 70.2 seconds.
Nobody else in the world has even come close.
He was also able to find the 13th root of a 100 digit number in 3.625 seconds, a single
time, essentially the time needed to read the problem and recite the answer.
Every two years there's a mental mathematics competition known as the Mental Calculation
World Cup, which tests the following computational skills, shorter versions of which we've actually
discussed in this course.
You have to add 10 10 digit numbers, multiply two 8 digit numbers, do mental square roots
with answers up to eight digits of accuracy, and do day of the week calculations.
All the problems are presented on paper, but you may only write down the answer.
No intermediate results are allowed.
People from all over the world compete in this international event.
Some of the competitors have memorized their multiplication tables up through 100.
In 2010, the winner was Priyanshi Somani from India.
Most impressive was the fact that she was just 11 years old.
Now I realize that most of the people watching this course are not aiming for the world championships,
but the material that we've covered here should be useful to you throughout your life.
You never know where your calculating talents may take you.
I've received numerous letters from people who've used their calculating skills to improve
their test scores, received job offers, promotions, and other professional opportunities.
Some of the greatest scientists of all time, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, Leonard Euler,
John von Neumann, and Richard Feynman, were accomplished mental calculators.
Let me mention two other lightning calculators that you're probably not familiar with, Zara
Colburn and George Parker Bitter.
Colburn was born in Vermont in 1804, Bitter was born in England in 1806.
Both boys showed tremendous calculating talent at an early age, and both had fathers who
tried to exploit their talents by parading them through the countryside performing for
audiences.
Both boys caught the attention of people who offered them to provide them with free education.
For example, the president of Dartmouth College offered to pay for all of Colburn's education
and living expenses.
And here's where their stories diverge.
Colburn's father, who left his wife and five other children to take Zara on the road, refused
such offers, whereas Bitter's father eventually allowed his son to be educated.
Colburn never really made much of himself, drifted from one career to the next, lost
his calculating talent, and died at age 35.
Bitter, on the other hand, had a long and successful career as a civil engineer, and
eventually became president of England's institution of civil engineers.
You might say that in the end, Colburn was bitter, and Bitter was better.
Both boys had talent, but only one took proper advantage of it.
As Benjamin Franklin said, genius without education is like silver in the mine.
All mathematics begins with arithmetic, but it certainly doesn't end there.
And I strongly encourage you to explore the joy that more advanced mathematics can bring
in light of the mathematical experiences you've had with mental math.
As we've occasionally seen in this course, mental math is rooted in algebra, which is
the foundation of arithmetic.
Your skills in mental math open the doors to algebra, which maybe you can better appreciate
in new ways.
And once you know algebra, the sky's the limit.
You can learn geometry, statistics, maybe even calculus, or my favorite areas of mathematics,
probability, number theory, and discrete mathematics.
In fact, we can get an appreciation for higher mathematics in trying to understand the reasons
behind these calculating techniques.
Another place to exercise your calculating skills, and a fun one, is through games.
As a kid, I loved playing games, and I still do today.
Many of the games involve numbers, like Monopoly or Backgammon.
In Monopoly, I got very good at adding and subtracting through buying properties, paying
rents, and making change.
I think making change was actually my favorite part of the game.
In Backgammon, you do things like count the race, to see how far the checkers have to
travel before they get off the board.
And you calculate things like the probability of leaving a shot, or your chances of winning
the race.
More modern games like Ken Ken, a variant of Sudoku, combines logic with number sense
as a great way to have fun with numbers.
In Scrabble, you can quickly determine the number of points for different words.
For example, if part of our Scrabble board looked like this, and you had to play the
word mental, let's say you played it with M on the double word square and A on the double
letter square, you can quickly figure out that this scores 34 points.
In fact, you almost can't help thinking that mental math is cool.
In each of these games, and many others, by being better at mental arithmetic, you can
play better and win more, and that makes the games more fun.
One of the main messages that I want to leave with you is that you can do it.
Some people lose their confidence in mathematics at an early age.
I'm here to tell you that it's never too late for a fresh start, looking at numbers in a
brand new way.
I hope that our time together has been a pleasant one, so I encourage you to study what you've
learned, have fun with it, and I hope this is just the beginning of a numberful journey
through the world of mathematics.
Thank you.
