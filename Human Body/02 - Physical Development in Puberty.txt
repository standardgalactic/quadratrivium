Lecture 2, Transition to Adulthood, Physical Development in Puberty
With this lecture, we begin our journey, transition to adulthood, covering the second decade of life.
Our first installment will deal with the physical changes of puberty,
which transform the boy and the girl to the woman and the man.
Next, we will look at the effects of sexual maturation and sexual behavior.
Third, we will examine the concomitant changes in cognitive and moral development.
And finally, we will look at the development of the sense of self and the sense of ego identity.
I said in the introductory lecture that focus on adolescence came about in a formal way at the turn of the century.
But of course people, virtually at all times, have been aware of this peculiar transitional period in one's life
where one has one foot in childhood, one foot in adulthood.
And there are wonderful representations in art and literature capturing this period of transition.
The biological changes of puberty in some ways are a continuation of the growth pattern
that is initiated with earlier embryonal development.
And so once again, we have to understand what happens biologically during puberty
as it's being on a continuum of a process of development that goes on essentially through life.
We look at the pattern of growth and we can cluster various bodily systems
because their rates of growth are quite different.
Tissues that are referred to as lymphoid tissues accelerate in growth
so that by the time of childhood they are very much more developed
that they eventually are going to be at the time of adulthood.
So if adulthood represents a line showing 100%, the curve of lymphoid development is higher
and therefore in this case there is a regression as it were
and lymphoid tissues include things like the thymus gland, the lymph nodes and so on.
Now the general pattern of growth shows a very rapid increase
so that growth is very fast early during the first couple of years
and of course it is further accelerated later on
but between the growth curve of early childhood and that of puberty
there's a period of a rather slower rate of growth
so the curve is steep to go upward to start with and then flattens out
and is steep again and reaches its culmination.
Another pattern of growth which is in a way also similar to the lymphoid growth
is the growth of neural tissues whereby you have the development of the brain
for example in the spinal cord racing ahead
and by the time that the individual is 6, 7, 8 years old
the brain has reached more or less its complete adult size
and then development then is not a question of increasing size
but of increasing complexity of function.
By contrast development of the genital system, the reproductive system
lags behind the other systems, it is the slowest to start with
so basically it has a flat curve until you reach puberty
at which point development accelerates greatly.
So this is a good example of when we try to describe how the body develops physically
we have to be aware of a general pattern of development
as well as the more specific patterns of discrete tissues.
What are the schedules of change in development in puberty?
It's important to bear in mind that here again we have a fairly predictable time schedule
but also a good deal of variation in this time schedule.
We will consider first the development of the female
because among other reasons girls enter puberty earlier than boys do
and we will look at four key developmental areas
the height spurt, the way that stature develops
breast development, pubic hair development
and menarche or the onset of menstruation.
Height spurt is the growth of height is the first change
but it is not so dramatic and it is the development of the breasts
that usually are experienced by the girl as her body begins to change.
And the ages of these are more easily seen on these charts
and therefore they consist basically of a range of ages
so that breast development for instance may typically start anytime
between the ages of 8 and 13
and is completed sometime between the ages of 13 and 18.
This means that it is perfectly normal for one girl to begin breast development at 8
and for another girl to start breast development at 13
but all things being equal breast development typically is the first change.
Pubic hair development follows on the heels of breast development
and we will see further examples of this shortly
and that too has a certain normal age range during which it takes place.
The height spurt, the peak growth typically comes in the ages sometime
between 12 and 14 and that's what we often associate
with sort of the shooting in heights and the string being in caricature
of adolescence and so on.
Now menaki or the first menstrual period is often equated
is sort of the quintessential event in the life of the girl who is becoming a woman
but of course that is simply one of many other changes that are taking place
and when menaki occurs also is a function of normal variation determined both by biological
as well as other factors such as nutrition, general level health and so on.
Over the last couple of hundred years there has been an interesting change
in that girls have been having their first menstrual period at increasingly younger years.
This information comes mainly from statistics in the northern European countries
which have kept such good statistics.
So if you look at curves of when on average girls are having their first period
you see that this curve has gone down steadily
but now for the last 30 or so years, 40 or so years
this has become stabilized so that North American girls
typically of middle class background given adequate nutrition and so on
on average have their first menstrual period at the age of somewhere around 12.8 years
and because the sequence of declining age at first menaki has stopped
girls today have their first menstrual period at about the same time as their mothers did.
When we look at the developmental pattern of boys
we see something very similar.
Here again you have the height spurt which in the case of boys comes a couple of years later
and here the earliest change involves enlargement of the testes
but because the testes are hidden as it were in the scortal sac
the boy isn't as aware of the development of his testes as the first sign of puberty
as the girl is of the development of breasts.
But shortly thereafter you have the development of pubic hair
which similar to that of the girl once again is a telltale sign
that this boy is now sexually maturing
and of course there are all kinds of repercussions to how does one perceive this
how does one negotiate this
and this is where adolescents often need help in coming to terms with these changes
they need the education to understand what's going on
so that these become changes that are welcomed at joyous occasions
rather than things to be frightened by or to be anxious about.
The development of the penis in size is a somewhat later development
than what I have said so far
but in all of these instances again we are never talking about a normal single age
where the change begins and a normal single age where the change ends
but rather a range of ages, normal range of ages within which it may begin and may end.
In statistical terms sometimes one can even go beyond these
and still be perfectly normal physically
but if that happens we tend to talk about early and late maturers
and then of course there are extreme examples of pathological precocious puberty
which I will return to later on in this lecture.
Let us now look at the, more specifically the changes that take place
in boys and girls with respect to height.
When we look at a chart showing the cumulative increase in height
that is to say somebody getting taller all the time
the spurt at puberty doesn't really look that dramatic.
The kid is getting taller gradually
and sort of in this kind of configuration there is just a tiny jump.
The second difference which you will anticipate from what we have said already
is that initially boys and girls grow at approximately the same rate
as puberty approaches girls enter puberty sooner
so they get ahead of boys in height.
This is why you have the somewhat odd situation in a middle school
where girls are getting ahead of the boys
and suddenly they look like older than the boys overnight when in fact they are not.
Then boys catch up and on average grow a little taller than girls.
So men generally are somewhat taller than women on average
even though of course there is a lot of overlap
and there are lots of women who are taller than lots of men.
When we look at curves that show the rate of growth rather than incremental growth
in other words not the gradual increasing in height in a cumulative sense
but how much does the person grow for a given period of time
then we see that rate of growth is dramatically high very early
during the first couple of years of life.
Gradually the rate goes down even though the child continues to grow
and then it tends to flatten and when the person enters adolescence
then there is a much more dramatic and discernible spur of growth.
Weight patterns pretty much follow the same sequence as height patterns.
Weight of course is much more dependent on nutritional factors
even though so is height and so is any other type of growth.
Once again I need to reiterate that even though I am focusing on the sort of the biological
and what eventually is going to emerge as the hormonal basis
of how this process is evolving
we are presupposing that the individual is receiving the adequate amounts of nutrition
and healthcare and beyond such physical factors
there is also the need for sustenance, for emotional warmth
and surprising as it may be at least in extreme cases of emotional disturbance or deprivation
we have a serious interference.
We can have a serious interference with the process of growth.
When we look at tables that show the rate of growth
it's startling to realize that by the time a child is 2-3 years old
most 50% of adult height has already been attained
and when we look at the later years
we can see that by the time a girl is 15 years old
she has attained some 99% of her adult weight
and boys by 18 have attained 99% of their adult weight.
Now in some instances an individual may continue growing in height
in years of course later than 15 or 18 or 19
but generally what I have just said
typically describes the pattern for most individuals.
Now there are additional changes and we have to be selective in this respect
how much of these details we need to go into
but this is a particularly important consideration
with respect to gender roles, occupational roles and so on
that are going to preoccupy us in later lectures.
There is very little difference between boys and girls
in terms of physical strength before puberty.
In fact boys and girls don't look that different from each other before puberty
it is a puberty that the divergence becomes short.
After puberty, during puberty both boys and girls
with greatly gained in strength
there is an increase in the number of muscular fibers
as well as the strength of these fibers
but although initially the gains seem to be fairly parallel
gradually there is a divergence so that boys typically end up
with larger muscles, more muscle cells and larger muscle cells
and this is reflected in various tests that have to do
the strength of an individual that can be brought to bear for a particular test.
The same can be demonstrated by other tests
that have to do with the way that one measures the strength of the arm.
Moreover what we are dealing with here is not just a question of strength
but also changes in the physiological system of the body.
This is very important because in order for an individual to exert
this sudden burst of extensive effort
you not only need large muscles but you need the supporting system
the way that the heart and the lungs and the cardiovascular system
the respiratory system supports this activity.
And here again there is no difference prior to puberty
but there is a difference after puberty where among other things
boys develop a higher number of red blood cells per cc than the girls.
This means that the male's cardiovascular system is also geared
to allow for this kind of big muscular effort which is involved
when we lift things, throw things, run in big spurts and so on.
Now we have to be careful that we pay attention to two significant factors here.
Superimposed on this basic biological process that sets boys and girls apart
more so than before at the time of puberty
there is also the consideration that muscular strength and size
is very much a function of exercise.
The more exercise you do, the larger the muscles, all else being equal.
Now traditionally boys have been encouraged, allowed
and for whatever internal motivation or external encouragement
they are far more physically active in the kinds of activities
that involve large muscles and exertion than girls.
So quite a bit of the difference between boys and girls is the result of this.
If you look at Olympic records for example
swimming records by Olympic women athletes now are faster
than Olympic records by men some years back.
Of course Olympic records by men are now faster yet
but the difference between the two has shrank
because with equal opportunities for exercise and equal motivation
then you in a way eliminate this extraneous factor
that is superimposed on the issue of biological change.
We should also be careful that we do not conclude
from these absolutely clear biological advantages
that males have in this respect
that males are caught physically superior to females.
If you consider the fact that women outlive men every decade of life
you could say that ability to live longer
is a better test of physical fitness than how fast you can jump up and down.
Yet another important development
that has sort of psychosocial considerations
although it's in itself a fairly simple biological fact
is that babies are born chubby with a lot of subcutaneous fat
they gradually lose that subcutaneous fat
and the puberty some of this fat is re-deposited
and this is true for boys and girls
but more of it is retained by girls than by boys
particularly in the region of the breasts and the pelvic region and the buttocks
but in the body as a whole
this is why particularly following puberty
females have softer curves
less well-defined muscles
even though they may have very strong muscles
because of this subcutaneous layer of fat which is retained by them
more so than it is retained by boys.
Now given the tremendous emphasis on fitness
as an ideal aesthetic ideal in our culture
you can see how this sort of thing can create complications
for developing girls an issue that I am going to return to
at the end of this lecture.
What is it that is happening sort of behind the scenes
in the development of the reproductive system?
The primary sexual characteristics
have to do with the organs of the reproductive system
and here there is a very rapid and tremendous development
as manifested by gaining weight of the uterus
which sort of races ahead of other genital organs
the testes as we noted earlier also show a sharp increase
the prostate gland in the male will develop
and start producing its secretions
which combined with secretions from other glands
in the male reproductive system
now make it possible for the male to ejaculate
the capacity for orgasm is already present
in boys and girls before puberty
but prior to puberty boys do not ejaculate
following puberty boys ejaculate
and this ejaculate is of course a combination
of both sperm that's coming from the testes
as well as the various nutrient fluids
and the vehicle through which sperm is transported
which is coming from the prostate gland
and other glands in the male reproductive system
the pattern for ovaries is exactly the same
there is also an increase in weight
although it is not as dramatic as in the case of the uterus
now these changes are basically internal
and therefore not visible to the individual herself or himself
but when it comes to the development of secondary sexual characteristics
then those are the obvious signs that the person has entered puberty
and here we have the development of breasts
which follows a predictable sequence
which pediatricians can time and determine
whether this is more or less on schedule
we have the development of pubic hair
both in the female as well as in the male
and of course in the male we simultaneously have the development of the penis
and the scrotophag
so what I want to convey to you is that there is typically
an orderly progression of events
which normally follow a predictable sequence
but also there is a lot of room for variation
now what is it that's making all these changes possible?
the answer is in a word hormones
hormones are chemical substances
that are produced by the endocrine glands in the body
which pour their products directly into the bloodstream
without the benefit of a duct
and these hormones have specific actions on bodily tissues
whose cells pick up the hormones
and it is this process that makes all this change possible
for our purposes of development of the reproductive system
the sort of axis of hormones that are involved
start with the hypothalamus
which is a portion of the brain
which produces a hormone called gonadotropin
releasing hormone
under the effect of this GNRH
the pituitary gland which is also an extension of the brain
produces gonadotropins
in other words hormones that go to the gonads
the testes and the ovaries
and these are two FSH and LH
ovaries under the stimulation of the
gonadotropic hormones from the pituitary
in turn produce in the case of ovaries, estrogens
and progesterone
and in the case of testes, testosterone and inhibin
then there is an additional source of androgen
from the adrenal gland
which is a secondary source for the male
but an important primary source for the female
these hormones are linked together
in a self-regulatory sort of cybernetic system
so hypothalamic hormones
produce or release the pituitary hormones
pituitary hormones
lead to the production of the gonadal hormones
by ovaries or testes
levels of gonadal hormones
regulate the production of pituitary hormones
and hypothalamic hormones
in other words, as the level rises
it inhibits the level of the end result hormones
the gonadal hormones rises
it inhibits the production of more hormones
by the anterior pituitary
it's a little bit like the way that the thermostat works
in conjunction with the heater
as the temperature is at a set point
the thermostat is set at a point
once the heat is used up and declines
it triggers the thermostat
thermostat produces, I mean the heater produces more heat
as the ambient temperature rises
it triggers the thermostat to shut off the heat
as the room gets cooler
then there is more heat produced
so through this very ingenious device
the system regulates itself
more of one, less of the other, less of one, more of the other
now we can put all of this together
and it's a rather complicated system
and see how they are integrated together
we have said nothing so far
what triggers these changes of puberty
because we don't know
something happens in the brain
at the ages that we discussed
and the hypothalamus, sort of the control center
kicks these changes
and as hypothalamic hormones increase
then pituitary hormones increase
and then gonadal hormones increase
and that's where you have the changes of puberty
the hormones therefore come down
are distributed in the body
and they transform the body
and bring about the changes that we are talking about
we have to bear in mind
that the tissues of the body are always ready to react
the tissues don't have to mature
it is the level of hormones
which when it reaches a critical point
that determines the response of the tissues
so in an extreme case
if you were to give a five-year-old child
female hormones
you can have that child develop breasts
and if you were to give a five-year-old boy androgens
you can precipitate the changes of puberty
this is precisely what happens
in abnormal cases of precocious puberty
and perhaps the most dramatic example of this
is the youngest mother on record
a Peruvian girl who gave birth to a child
at the age of five years and ten months
she was subject to this condition of precocious puberty
so despite her very young age
in fact her body had matured
and then of course somebody took advantage of it
and she was impregnated
let's move on now finally
to a consideration once again of the rates
by which people develop
this is a matter of some importance
some individuals will move ahead of others
and will become early developers
if you look at their graph of their growth
they go higher than the standard line
others are late maturers
and it takes them longer
to fit into the same sequence
but unlike the extreme examples I gave you
of precocious puberty
these individuals are not precocious
they are simply on the faster and slower lanes
of this normal developmental pattern
nonetheless this is of some importance for them
because even though biologically it doesn't make any difference
psychologically, psychosocially
a boy or a girl's recognition of himself
herself as mature or less mature
or less developed, more developed
has often important repercussions
on their self-concept body image
as well as behavior
to give you a sense of the range of variation
if you look at three girls
aged about 13
you could find one of them
still very much looking like a prepubescent girl
second one showing some development of puberty
and the third one a fully-fledged
biologically fully-fledged woman
similarly, if you were to look at a set of three boys
who are about 15 years old
you may find that one is still very much an undeveloped boy
the second one is going through the stages of development
and the third one is a physically fully-developed young man
now consider how important athletics for instance are
for boys
and how is the less developed boy
going to compete against the well-developed boy
because they may be the same chronological age
but in terms of their bodily functions
there is a world of difference
one is a kid, the other is a young adult
and so that these are the sorts of issues
that now become significant
not because they are in and of themselves
of biological importance
they are not health issues
but they are issues of psychology and social perception
and the values that we attach to these questions
in terms of who is developing fast
and who is developing more slowly
there have been studies
that further elaborate the consequences
of these developmental patterns
for example girls who enter early puberty
in other words they are fast developers, early developers
tend to be generally less popular with other girls
they are considered to be called sexually precocious
and therefore there may be a tendency
for them to be pushed into sexual activity
they attract more attention
because they are physically more developed
despite their chronological age
they are in some ways less prepared to enter
to go through the psychosocial adaptations of puberty
relative to their friends
because they are still younger than the other ones
since there is so much value placed
on being slim as an object of attractiveness
and because puberty entails a certain amount of weight in gain
and the position of fat tissues
these girls may be more prone to being concerned
about issues of weight and attractiveness and self-image
so as a result they may end up with a somewhat poorer self-image
than others who are developing at a more normal pace
now interestingly because they look biologically more developed
they are more likely to be either interested in
or pushed into court what are perceived as adult behaviors
smoking, drinking, engaging in sexual activity
so in that sense they are of somewhat greater health risk
and as I said, follow from what I said earlier
they also are more vulnerable to being subject to eating disorders
anorexia and the like which I want to dwell on a little bit longer
shortly
fortunately these are for most girls
fairly temporary perturbations
and as their peers catch up with them
and as they over time sort of fall into the mainstream
of the developmental pattern
they are able to deal with these issues of earlier puberty
so that the end result turns out to be perfectly fine adjusted individual
but it does put these girls at somewhat greater risk
greater risk doesn't necessarily mean that something bad need to happen
but simply that it is more likely that something of this sort will happen
with boys it seems to be the opposite
that is to say early puberty, early maturation
seems to provide them with a certain advantage
again this is not explicable on biological grounds
but it's explicable on the grounds of what in our society
in current contemporary American culture
we value in boys and girls and what expectations do we have
physical strength is a premium of high quality
and therefore for a boy suddenly to having these muscles developed
as a result of the puberty changes
greater athletic prowess makes these individuals
typically all else being equal socially more successful
they are deemed as more caught attractive
they have a more positive self-image
but they also on the negative side
like the early developing girls
they be pushed into early sexual activity
smoking, drinking, the kinds of behaviors that are associated
in the minds of some teenagers at least as with becoming adult
interestingly there is some evidence that even years later
in their thirties these early maturing boys
tend to have higher career and status
but in terms of their personalities they tend to be less flexible
whereas the late maturing boys who do not have this sort of heritage
have learned to be more flexible and therefore in some ways
they have more malleable, more adaptive personalities
now you can figure out from this the obverse of everything we have said
so just as early maturation for girls seems to have these disadvantages
late maturation for girls will have certain corresponding advantages
just as the early maturing boy has a number of advantages
the late maturing boy will have somewhat less of these advantages
so it is another excellent illustration of how variance exists
how variance is generated biologically
but the significance of this biological variance is not in the biology
but what we do with it in terms of our expectations
and behaviors of these individuals
now puberty has long been thought of as a time of turmoil
a time of rebellion
and these are issues that we are going to discuss in a subsequent lecture
so I don't want to anticipate that
but let's focus here primarily on the component of body image
body image is essentially an individual's conception of oneself as a physical being
what you think you look like and the valuations you put on this appearance
based on your self perception as well as the perceptions of other people
now it may seem unfair and superficial for us to judge people by their physical appearance
but for better or for worse there is a tremendous amount of judgment of people
on physical appearance that goes on
and interestingly we ascribe to what are typically seen as good looking people
personality qualities that have nothing to do with the way you appear physically
and so what you think of yourself and how dependent you are on other people's opinions of you
are some of the important critical issues that teenagers have to come to terms with
so we have a bridge here from the biological changes of puberty
which more or less inexorably reshape the body
and the psychosocial reactions that emanate from that
which can be for better or for worse
recently and this is something fairly new
two situations have arisen that have added to the high risk quality of adolescent life
now when we discuss adolescence proper as against puberty
we will look at some of the other issues that arise as a result of these changes
but purely in terms of body image there are two situations that we need to expand briefly
before we end the lecture
girls typically between the ages of 12 and 18
typically of middle class background in this country
seem to have become over the last 3-4 decades as we have become more and more aware of this
much more preoccupied with their weight, with their physical appearance
particularly with the issue of thinness as an emblem of attractiveness
now this is not restricted to girls between ages of 12 and 18
but these considerations perhaps in addition to other factors we don't understand
have a likelihood to lead to eating disorders most typically anorexia nervosa
this is a condition that affects roughly 1 out of 100,000 girls
so in its severe form it is not a very common condition
anorexia nervosa cases 95% are female
only 5% are male
in this severe form this is a very significant health problem
and this is a condition that carries about a 20% mortality
so we are not talking simply about being thin but we are talking about being thin at such a level
that 1 in 5 cases over a 30-year period may lead to death
the way that this comes about is that these girls
and I'm going to refer to them as girls because the majority are girls
go beyond sort of the ordinary for better or for worse preoccupations that
teenagers have and sometimes adults have about weight
and suffer severe food deprivation diet very severely
because they feel that they are overweight even though
demonstrably they are not overweight they are underweight
and they have this intense fear of gaining weight
this is a disturbance in their body image
and it's very difficult to reason with them and convince them that they need not diet
because they are already significantly thinner they are less than 85%
of the average weight for their age
yet they seem to be fixated on this
and of course in addition to being very thin
they also suffer other disturbances if they have already started to menstruate
they typically stop menstruating and if they miss 3 periods
in succession this becomes another indication that they are suffering from this anorexia
although I have described sort of the clinical entity
the pathological instance of anorexia nervosa
there are other circumstances in the lives of girls in this age
that also may lead to problems in this area
for example those who are very much engaged in athletic activities
competitive athletes, ballet dancers
those who really not only exercise a great deal but lose a great deal of weight
will also stop menstruating
and that is one of the conditions that you can see something is affecting their system
girls who are under very severe stress
and sometimes through illness and surgery
are other circumstances where the outcome is the same thing
but these people are not suffering from anorexia nervosa for reasons that I explained
now even more recently boys have faced a new health threat
and this has to do with the abuse of anabolic steroids
anabolic steroids are synthetic androgens
which particularly if coupled with exercise
will build up the musculature of the young boy
way ahead of what normally they would have achieved
now just as in sort of a stereotypical fashion
thinness may be very important for a teenage girl's image
of being attractive and acceptable
again in traditional terms being strong and muscular
is tremendous incentive for a boy to misuse these drugs
because they in fact have the effect they are not imagining it
unfortunately the cost is high
in that this has the use of anabolic steroids
particularly over a lengthy period of time
will lead to the shrinking of the testes
hair loss, breast enlargement, possibly sterility
greater likelihood of prosthetic cancer, kidney damage
and psychological disturbances including depression
including extreme aggressiveness and so on
so here is another instance where normal change of events
that have been going on for hundreds and thousands of years
which transform the young, the prepubescent boy or girl
into the mature adult almost miraculously
carry not only these great sources of joy
but also represent dangers if for one reason or another
the reactions to these changes go awry
Thank you
