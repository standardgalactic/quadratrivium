Welcome back and today we're going to begin the first of two lectures on the subject of
shock.
Now this is going to be a complete departure from where we've been because up to now we've
been talking about first responses the inflammatory and the immune response to various threats
then we talked about the threats themselves and today we're really going to be looking
at something that is a result of the inflammation or the invasion or the immune response and
that is a collapse of the system.
This is really the failure of a lot of our responses and we're going to see how the body
can correct this failure and also take a look from the doctor's point of view how as
the caregiver we try to correct this response before the patient fails completely.
So first we really have to define shock which is really pretty straightforward.
It's the generalized failure of the cardiovascular system which is the heart and the vessels
to provide sufficient blood flow to the various tissues and organs and the misconceptions
are the term is used rather loosely it is not sudden fright that's not the kind of shock
we're talking about it's not an external electrical event we're not talking about that kind of
shock either and it's not what we call a cerebrovascular accident either a blood clot or hemorrhage
in the brain that's a stroke not shock it's not a heart attack it's not a myocardial infarction
it's basically again the failure to provide enough blood to our organs and the definitions
going to vary with the organ it depends what organ we're talking about for example the
kidney is going to shut down long before the brain and the heart do and for obvious reasons
you've heard this before in our discussions but it's worth repeating the brain and the
heart are going to protect themselves no matter what no matter what else is going on the brain
and the heart are going to set things up in our system that they get taken care of with
regard to blood flow to oxygen and to nutrients because they have no reserves at all other
tissues and organs like the liver have extra glucose they can use they have reserves and
they can take a little time the brain and the heart are so efficient in their structure
that there's no room for anything else they have zero in the way of reserves so they're
counting on a constant flow of nutrition oxygen and a constant removal of waste products and
in fact there are receptors which I'll show you here this is a schematic of the brain
as seen from the base and also of the heart and the blood vessels there are what we call
Barrow receptors Barrow means pressure and those receptors are very strategically placed
this is the common carotid artery and this is the external carotid artery which goes
to the face and here is the internal carotid artery which branches off and gives no other
branches except to the brain right nestled in that little V are major Barrow receptors
that tells the brain exactly what the blood pressure is just before the blood takes off
to the brain so it's the first to know if there's any question about adequate blood
supply and what it will do is send a series of messages from here through the spinal cord
and back to the heart using various chemical receptors and electrical stimulation to do
whatever the brain wants done it can tell the heart to increase rate and volume and
pressure or if it's getting too high it can do the opposite and tell it to slow down there's
another set of receptors and these are really the major significant ones in the body in the
arch of the aorta just as the blood comes out of the heart this is the place where the coronary
arteries take off and come right back to feed the heart muscle so that bunch of receptors
that are sitting in the arch know also what kind of blood pressure is going to the heart
and it wants to know that too so these two are really the organs that are going to make sure
of their own survival and they're going to do it at the expense of everybody else
and this can lead to some problems in taking care of the rest of the body
let's talk next about cellular shock and vascular shock we have two categories to
always be considering i'm going to define them for you now they're intimately intertwined
and then we'll kind of come back to them little by little as we go through the different kinds of
shock um the decreased blood flow can be viewed from two points of view first there's vascular
shock and we have a fairly strict definition of this but it's going to vary we're talking about
what we call the normal tensive patient a patient with normal blood pressure which for our purposes
will say is about 120 millimeters of mercury over 80 millimeters so what does that mean exactly
if we look at a graph of the heart cycle we have two phases the heart squeezes blood out
that's called systole and it's very fast very powerful and very efficient we really can't
make that much more efficient in terms of the actual squeeze then as the heart relaxes and the
blood flows passively that's called diastole and if you look at this chart you can see the spike
right here that goes up at the beginning of systole and it's very quick in time it's just
a fraction of a second and it reaches a peak of about 120 millimeters of mercury that's how we
measure um pressure and how much mercury a column of mercury this pressure would support
and then immediately after the heart finishes its forceful contraction the curve starts to
decline rapidly and if you notice that little notch that's actually so sensitive we're reading
that's the slamming shut of the aortic valve that gives a little boost to this um uh pressure from
a moment and then it falls off and this whole phase here is called diastole it doesn't go below 80
because that's the elastic pressure of the vessel so they expand to a point when they're normal and
then they slowly come down with their muscular recoil to maintain the pressure and the runoff
now what happens through the whole system is you have here the heart beats going you still see the
little diachronic notch slamming of the valve and then if you go out from the big vessels to the
smaller vessels here's the aorta doesn't change much in the arteries and the arterioles but as
they get smaller and smaller the pressure drops in the capillaries it's fairly low and then in the
veins it gets very low indeed until it gets back to the heart where it gets pumped up again
so now having said all that and you see the basically the the parameters we're talking about 120 over
about 80 if we now want to look at what we want to call shock in a in a normal intensive patient
it's when we have a systolic peak pressure that's below 80 in other words below where our diastolic
pressure was or a mean arterial pressure that's all the pressure under this curve and taking the
mean of that and if that falls below 60 which is way down here then we have to vary that a little bit
if we want to talk about patients who are normally hypertensive patients who run
with a blood pressure of let's say 160 for them shock might occur at 120 because their organs
are used to a flow at 160 and they're not going to tolerate levels of even 120 or 110
so it varies from patient to patient but we're going to always be talking about the
normal intensive patient that's different from cellular shock this cellular shock is the other
end of the spectrum it's the result of vascular shock and that's a failure of cellular respiration
and metabolism so it's the oxygen uptake in use the release of carbon dioxide the burning of
nutrients and the putting away of various products of metabolism that is the place where failure
really occurs the the cause of it is the vascular shock but it's the cellular shock that's going
to determine whether organs are going to fail or not now in our definition we have a few more
words we use if you look at the next slide we talk about impending shock and reversible shock
and irreversible shock these are relative terms and it's hard for us to say clinically
which exactly is happening to the patient it's really going to vary from patient to patient
but impending shock basically is when the blood pressure starts to fall the heart rate will probably
come up to try to compensate for this but we don't have significant even transiently significant
changes or effects on the organ the organs are still getting what they're what they need but it's
kind of a warning sign things are just starting to come down reversible shock we see fairly often
and that is when the shock is severe enough and when we really have to intervene to correct
what's causing it whether this is bleeding or infection or allergy something and i'll tell
you what all those are we're going to go through all the different kinds of shock and we must reverse
that process before we get irreversible damage to the organs so that's reversible shock the border
line that crosses us over into irreversible shock is a very hard point to know about and that's
defined by the stage where nothing we can do to the patient is going to salvage organ destruction
or organ failure and this patient is going to die with multi system and multi organ failure no
matter what we do it's really a self-defining term and it's really hard for us to to know exactly
when that's going to occur and what it actually means so the clinical part of this is not as easy
as just sitting around and talking about the definitions because we're we're always kind of
trying to fudge this and figure out where we actually are the cellular shock components
really need to be looked at it's really the common final pathway all the time in these patients and
if we look at what happens in the cell i'm just going to go through it in detail once
and then we'll just kind of look back and say that's where we are we're in the failure of
the cellular components but basically it occurs when you have either the failure to deliver enough
oxygen or some poisoning going on metabolically that's not allowing respiration at a cellular level
not in the lungs but in the cell itself it's a shift from aerobic metabolism to
anaerobic metabolism you probably all are familiar with that if you go jogging or exercise
you get to a phase where you can sustain yourself we sometimes call it a conversational jog
because you could carry on a conversation without too much gasping kind of know where you are when
you shift to anaerobic metabolism the body can do that it can build up a debt an oxygen
debt and shift to burn other products that don't need oxygen and that's why when you stop jogging
you're still going to gasp for a while if you've been in the anaerobic phase because you have to
repay that debt enough has to go on so that the body can catch up and get back into aerobic
metabolism and with this in shock you're generally functioning in anaerobic metabolism
you build up debts of all the metabolic processes the heart and the central nervous system don't
like this to happen we get into a vicious cycle where the sodium pump fails and the potassium
pumps fail the body is unable to give good signals electrically the muscles are not giving
good signals and things just get out of hand very very quickly there are further impairment
mechanisms and then a whole cascade of problems happen respiratory failure kidney failure and
one of the really bad ones is called DIC disseminated intravascular coagulation disseminated means
through the whole body intravascular inside the vessels and coagulation means clotting
DIC is a relatively new player maybe the last three or four decades where we've really recognized it
and it comes from a very very primitive response where the body says oh my god i'm in trouble
let's stop the bleeding even if there's no bleeding we the body's response to really bad
things is to think it's bleeding to death and in this situation it starts clotting everywhere
the real paradox here is the patient presents with a very odd symptom for someone that's clotting
they bleed they bleed from everywhere into the skin into the intestine in their organs their brain
they ooze blood from every orifice and the reason is this is what we call a consumption
coagulopathy a consuming failure of the coagulation system that sucks up all the many many clotting
factors and uses them up and the patient bleeds so the treatment is equally as counterintuitive
you anti-coagulate these patients you stop the clotting and you can imagine how brave the first
hematologist had to be to find a patient bleeding to death very near death and give them an
anti-coagulant and it worked it's very very much standard practice now we place these patients on
strong anti-coagulants to stop the coagulation until we can make new clotting factors and then try
to salvage the patient it's a very very bad state to be in many many patients die right then and
there the signs the objective signs these patients have low blood pressure they have a fast heart rate
and then their agonal symptom agonal means just before death coming from the word agony and they
get a bradycardia a terminal slowing of the heart that's a very bad sign in shock you want this they
have cold clammy skin funny because you would expect them if they're sweating profusely to have
warm skin but the skin is losing its blood supply it's being taken elsewhere like the heart and the
brain and yet they're sweating as a chemical reaction so their skin is cold and clammy
they're pale they're confused a bad situation so the final common pathway in each of these
is a decreased cardiac output we know that a decrease of tissue perfusion we'll see this again
and again and finally impaired cellular metabolism everything is going to go to hell in the cells
so let's now look at the categories of shock here's a little summary we're going to look at
hypovolemic shock today which merely means low volume then after the next lecture we'll go through
cardiogenic shock which is failure of the pump anaphylactic shock which you now know is immune
mediated septic shock the infected infection response and neurogenic shock which is mediated by the
brain if we look at the body as a tank the body's vascular system as a tank filled with fluid which
in this case is blood it needs enough pressure sorry enough volume to create pressure against
the walls which is the vessels to maintain that pressure during the entire cardiac cycle
now when we lose a certain amount of volume that pressure is going to drop
if you look at this slide this represents the container that the blood is in and if you'll
notice here there is an unused capillary bed and that represents the part of the body that
has no blood going to it at a particular time if you look at this we have the lungs in this part of
the circulation schematic the brain and the heart and they are constantly filled with blood but other
areas in the body the intestines the limbs and so on the skin have blood shunted to and away from
it at different times and the reason for this is that there really is too big a volume and it's too
great a strain on the heart to have to pump to everything so we just pump to different areas
and things are shunted away as we need after you eat most of the blood goes to your stomach and your
intestines and that's why if you try to exercise your muscles feel very cramped and and bad to use
it can give you actually muscle cramping in very specific muscle areas because of lack of blood flow
the hypovolemic shock usually starts when we lose about 15 or 20 percent of our blood volume total
volume and that is about two pints out of 10 pints or about one liter out of five depending on how
you want to look at it so in this one if we lose that much you can see how the the tank just isn't
full it's like the underfilled balloon you won't exert pressure what the body will do in that event
is try to compensate by decreasing and shutting down more vascular beds so that it can maintain the
pressure to the crucial ones mostly again brain heart and then the vital organs the ones that we
do have to feed all the time so think of that shrinking balloon idea to hold the pressure up
the kind of losses we're talking about would be blood loss that could be from trauma from internal
bleeding external bleeding and in those cases if you wait a while that percentage of blood that is
red cells we talked about that how you have red cells and then plasma that percentage which normally
runs about 40 percent if the patient equilibrate you'll see that percentage drop because they've
lost whole blood so initially there wouldn't be much of a change in percentage but the patient
will look more anemic after a few hours on the other hand if that volume loss comes from diarrhea
vomiting sweating or even fluid sequestration which is happens during burns and intestinal obstruction
where fluid is trapped and not available for use the body will try to refill those areas of the
tissues from the vascular system and actually your blood count will go up in a relative manner
because you're dehydrated in the volume of fluid inside the vessels is now decreased relative
to the red cell count so counting blood counts alone can just tell you what kind of loss you're
likely to have but they're all hypovolemic if you look here the circulating blood volume
is less than it should be and more capillary beds are being shut down now the body will try
to compensate as soon as it feels this loss the heart will speed up in rate you'll start
breathing faster because you need to get oxygen into a lower volume to get it to the cells the
patient becomes pale confused they'll be thirsty and this if not a check will go on to death
and so the first thing that happens is this reduction in the size of the volume and to
get things back to normal it may not come back to normal you may have let's say the normal tense
of patient here you'll then drop down to what we're calling shock levels or near shock levels
and you may restore it to a reasonable level that can do the job usually won't come all the way back
to normal and again everything here is being geared to protect that brain and that heart
the liver and the spleen can help too they have extra volume in them and what they can do is contract
and release blood into the circulation they can actually have quite a bit when we remove a spleen
in surgery one of the neat techniques is that we actually clip the artery first and allow the spleen
to empty its blood through the veins before we clip the vein and take out the spleen the kidneys
respond in a very interesting way they release a drug called renin and which increases another
circulating chemical called aldosterone and this retains sodium and the sodium retention
sucks water back and does not allow water to go out in the urine so this is a way that the kidneys
try to contribute to maintaining the volume and this can also lead to renal shutdown the kidneys
will shut off very early in shock almost before anything else when we're talking about vital
organs the kidneys are the ones that become expendable unfortunately the skin of course will
lose its blood supply the muscles the intestines but they can tolerate a very long period sometimes
hours and even days in the skin and the muscles without normal blood supply the kidneys can't
they will shut down to try to stop losing water they're very sensitive to this and they want the
volume to be maintained the brain will release anti diuretic hormone which is a hormone that keeps
fluid and liquids in the body and then the brain and will tell the heart to keep that rate up what
it's really saying is give me blood I want blood and it'll want that rate to go up at some point
we're going to get to the place where there's no further possible reduction so we're here now we've
compensated and we have a blood volume and then we may do something that leads to collapse for
example the patient could continue to bleed and there's no more constriction that can go on we
might put the patient to sleep to try to help them stop the bleeding and the anesthetic agents cause
relaxation of those little muscles that constrict the blood vessels so they'll open up and now what
you get is those areas this is the area represented as the vascular bed that the body voluntarily
shut down this is the vascular bed that was normally shut down and now we have a usually a
catastrophic collapse from this va vasodilitation which is counterproductive to what we want this
is when the system is going to pieces and each organ it will start to lose in sequence its blood
supply because there's just not enough pressure to do it so the primary defenses of vasoconstriction
and tachycardia and this is mediated by adrenaline the epinephrine same drug that gets out in the
blood system that whips the heart to go faster and faster but unfortunately also
it creates a great oxygen debt epinephrine can get speed out of the heart and power but it costs
the heart a lot in metabolism it's not an efficient process and remember then in the end there are no
mechanisms for the brain and the heart to shut down there's nothing in the system that will allow
them to lose blood supply so everybody else will continue to suffer and finally we get to end stage
acidosis build up of toxic products and the patient will die final common pathway again
everything goes down cardiac output resp sorry tissue perfusion and cellular metabolism now
one of the interesting things is before we get onto this is what happens to patients who are
healthy versus those who are sick we as doctors have to do two things first and foremost we have
to stop the inciting cause to stop the bleeding the diarrhea the fluid losses and first and foremost
and just as equally important is to replace the losses and correct the deficits give them back
the blood if they're bleeding give them fluid if they're burned and then correct acidosis and other
losses we do this all at once the real snake here is the healthy patient if you have an elderly
debilitated or really sick patient who gets into this situation we know very early the blood pressure
starts to slip very early the tachycardia occurs early to restore it they look bad they can't hold
on to their vascular vasospasm that's causing the blood pressure to stay up and they actually lose
that tone early on in the game so there are no surprises there they they just drift right down
early in the game and everybody goes oh my god and they rush in and they correct it the one that
really gives us the problem are the young healthy patients the gi on the battlefield he gets wounded
gets a tissue injury causes massive bleeding he's very strong he's in terrific condition
that gi or young healthy guy in civilian life and a car accident who's bleeding internally or
externally can come back to the field station the field hospital or the emergency room on that
stretcher sitting there almost sitting up talking to you chatting with you they look great they may
be a little pale from vasoconstriction but you expect that but their blood pressure is right up
there it's 120 115 their heart rate may be elevated but you expect that they've been wounded
they're in pain they may be excited so there aren't any really good signs and meantime they are
really closing down all the vascular beds everything is vasoconstricted tightly they're
getting blood to the organ systems that they need to and then we decide to do something
if we do nothing and they lose some more blood everything goes at once it bottoms out the patient
will then release all those vascular beds back into the circulation and the blood pressure
will crash they'll go into cardiac arrest and when you try to resuscitate them nothing happens
you can't resuscitate a patient who has no volume because you're depending on passive flow back to
heart to the heart to refill it before the next compression that won't happen so when a patient
crashes because of hypovolemia you won't be able to resuscitate them the next thing that can happen
even if they stop bleeding you then take them to the operating room and you put them to sleep
so you can operate and fix them and again you've paralyzed their vascular bed those muscles
are paralyzed like all the rest of their muscles and again the vascular beds open up
they crash they arrest and you don't get them back so what you really have to do is prepare them
you've got to first of all recognize that they are probably in more trouble than they appear to be
the blood count won't have changed at that point because it's early on so that's not going to help
you if to recognize the magnitude of the injury and then you've got to do what we call resuscitation
before you need to resuscitate them you put in massive amounts of either blood or fluid
fill up that tank get them over full if anything else even before you have type specific blood
get it in there with fluid or plasma which is what we use in world war two a lot
then get them type specific blood get them stabilized there are very few patients who
can bleed faster than you can pump it in if you get four or five lines and major arteries
going in you can get that i'm sorry and major veins going in you can get that blood to where
they need it then you take them to the operating room and then you everything will be all right
you'll be able to fix the patient so you've got to be forewarned and forearmed that this is a very
very serious illness once it gets going you've got to act promptly and appropriately and you'll have
as we have today in our trauma centers a markedly reduced mortality from this problem next time we'll
go on and we'll look at the four other major causes of shock
