Welcome back. Today we're going to continue our study of cancer and begin to look at something
called carcinogenesis. Carcinogenesis is the birth or the development of cancer and to
add to your definitions the carcinogens are those things in our world that cause cancer and they
are divided into the physical, the chemical and the biologic agents that are cancer causing.
We also will talk a lot about etiology which is the cause of any disease and then also epidemiology
you've already heard about and that's the study of large populations and geographical areas looking
at the endemic diseases, epidemic diseases and trying to put together with the populations
what those causes might be. Going back a little bit if you want to talk a little bit about epidemiology
in 1755 we probably had the first connection between cancer and an environmental agent Sir
Percival Pot who was a pathologist in England and who has a number of diseases named after him
noticed that there was a prevalence of scrotal cancers, cancers on the skin of the scrotum
in chimney sweeps and these were little boys usually who wore an outfit, a suit of clothing
and they were tied to a rope and lowered down into a chimney where they swept out all the coltars
and these boys got these skin cancers on their scrotum and it was according to Pot and turned
out to be true the constant contact of the coltar against the scrotal skin was interesting was the
French chimney sweeps didn't get this because they wash their clothes every day and the English
ones didn't so they had constant coltar residues and we can do that now with mice if you shave
mice and put coltars on them we can easily produce skin cancers in mice. About four years later Dr
John Hill in England noticed the association of cancers of the nose and the oral cavity in patients
who chewed tobacco or inhaled snuff he made the connection course didn't know why that happened
but that was noted and then in 1950 there were two sets of investigators who really ended a
very long debate and actually when if you look at the world today it's really not ended but
Dahl and Hill in one publication and Winder and Graham separately noted the relationship
between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and Winder was at Sloane Kettering when I was at
Cornell and he used to come and give the pathology lectures to us and in those days one of the
cigarette companies always advertised a real cigarette and Winder would come in and he'd
reach into his pocket and he'd say smoke a real cigarette you get real cancer and he would crumple
it up and throw it away and he said I love New York you wake up to the coughing of the birds
anyway this is the history of how we found etiologic agents in the cause of cancer
there's a very strong geographical bias and a racial bias in who gets cancer and who doesn't
the geography is rather interesting in Japan there was a very high risk of gastric cancers
probably attributed to eating lots of smoked foods that risk is starting to disappear as
habits change and there was for example a very low incidence of uterine cervical cancer in Israel
probably due to specific sexual practices and circumcision if you look at some of the charts
incidents and these are epidemiologic charts they range from 1930 here to 2000
and in females there's an interesting change in trend for lung cancer and this had to do
probably with the advent of the women's liberation movement right here which made it much more
acceptable for women to smoke and lung cancer rose at a dramatic rate and it was interesting
that the incidence of breast cancer stayed about the same but the death rate from lung cancer
now exceeds the death rate from breast cancer there are more breast cancers still but lung
cancer is so much more fatal that the death rate in women now from lung cancer exceeds that
look at the decline in colon cancer in the decline here in men's colon cancer that came about
because of endoscopy we started looking at colon cancers through the colonoscope it turns out that
almost all colon cancers start in a polyp in the colon and we can take those out through the
colonoscope so now we're getting to these before they're full-blown cancers and we've caused a
huge decline in both incidents and then the death rate of the cancer so there's lots of risk factors
that we can attack lung cancer very very high in Asia where people smoke much more heavily than in
this country for example also primary hepatic cancer cancer of the liver in Asia is very high
because of a combination of something called aflatoxin aflatoxin is a toxin that comes from a
fungus called aspergillus flavus and aflatoxins occur in poorly stored grains things like
peanuts this happens a lot in Asia along with infections with hepatitis b virus we need the two
to give you liver cancer and liver cancer is very common in Asia and Africa and virtually unheard of
here in 30 years i saw one case of primary liver cancer now you've probably all heard somebody say
to you oh my aunt died of liver cancer i can assure you she probably didn't this is the difference
in primary cancer and the metastatic cancer and i wanted to use this as the example where a cancer
starts for example in the breast duct it is then called ductal cancer of the breast or ductal carcinoma
when that spreads to the brain or the liver it's still breast cancer it's not liver cancer if i
take a biopsy of that liver and hand it to the pathologist if it's not really anoplastic or
moderately differentiated at least he'll look at it and say that's breast cancer metastatic to the
liver because you'll see normal liver cells and the metastatic cancer in it most of the time they
can make that determination but it's very rare to see primary liver cancer meaning that the liver
cells was the start of the cancer so we i wanted to put that aside early on here we see a lot of
melanomas of the skin which is a very serious malignant growth in the skin due to ozone depletion
in the southern hemisphere there's a big hole in the ozone layer right over australia and a very
high incidence of both melanomas and also the other two kinds of skin cancer which are due to uv
light we're also having um the uh geographic shifts in this country where people are moving to the
sunbelt spending more time out demographic shifts is what i really wanted to say and they're
spending more time so lifestyle and geography changes are causing increase in this country as
well of much much more skin cancer more than a million cases per year in america especially of
the non-melanoma types there are racial components for example blacks are protected from the effects
of uv light by the melanin which are benign cells in the skin that creates the black pigment
this filters out those lights and so skin cancers in blacks are much much rarer
while Celtic populations have fair skin redhead type complexion and much more easily burned skin
have a much higher rate of cancers of the skin poverty is also linked to cancer
high rates because of dietary factors alcohol and tobacco use sedentary lifestyles once again
just the way it is with infectious diseases is really not good to be poor
the environmental effects of this self-inflicted wound want you to remember that 90 percent of all
cancers are what we call carcinomas let's go back to our slides and remember this
drawing the places that are exposed to the environment the endothelial and the epithelium
on the skin are widely exposed to carcinogens now carcinomas are cancers that are formed on
epithelial elements that's the definition carcinoma is not a general term cancers the general term
if it forms in the mesothelium it's called a sarcoma so a muscle cancer is a myosarcoma
and we have cancers of the skin there are basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma
the lining of the duct of the breast is epithelium that's a breast carcinoma a duct cell carcinoma
now those cells the epithelial cells have the most rapid rate of replication they turn over
fastest and so what cell are they going to have they're going to have lots of stem cells those stem
cells are going to be very very active they're going to be coming up all the time to replace
the cells that are being lost on the skin on the lining of your intestines the lining of your
respiratory tract even the lining of the breast ducts so that these cells are going to have
the most chance for malignant changes exposure to the environment and rapid stem cell turnover
and therefore 90 of our malignancies are going to show up as carcinomas the mesothelial cells
have very much reduced exposure and so sarcomas are much much rarer than the others
there are three big groups of environmental carcinogens chemical physical and biological
and we need to look at those in order remember that there's a lot of problems associated with
trying to pin a cancer on one of these elements as being the causative agent first of all there's
decades of exposure uh and i'm sorry of time between exposure and the development of a cancer
that we can see so what they got exposed to 30 years ago may cause a cancer now how do we make
the connection also the amount of carcinogen is very hard to contact uh quantitate and that's
because again time and we just don't know how much sun did you get uh how much of the cigarette tar
did you actually get and most carcinogens only produce cancer in a very small number of patients
most of the time our bodies defenses will prevent cancer from occurring so again the
connection is very difficult most smokers never get cancer even though this is still one of our
most common causes of death for cancer so tobacco is the world's number one carcinogen and we'll
talk about the chemical group first causes 30 percent of cancer deaths of all the cancers combined
and if you add dietary factors probably 50 or 60 percent of all cancer deaths very very important
carcinogen everything else pales in comparison to this and it's one we have to spend almost no money
on if we got everybody to quit smoking then we probably have 2 000 deaths a year from cancer
instead of 200 000 deaths a year from lung cancer so the money we're spending in research and
prevention uh could be spent on something else if we just get people to stop smoking alcohol
also linked it's another environmental carcinogen and when combined with tobacco is really very
potent in causing cancers of the mouth and of the gi tract and how often do you see somebody with a
drink in their hand who doesn't also have a cigarette these two habits tend to go together
food additives in the dye industry cause cancer of the bladder they get into the blood the industrial
workers get bladder cancers food flavorings can cause cancer certainly saccharine causes cancers
in mice the link in humans is still a little fuzzy i've talked to you about aflatoxin b
cooking methods smoking charcoal produce nitrites which have been linked to some cancers
and there are industrial chemicals that are a huge cause of cancer they come from the
environment not only for the workers but for people in agriculture and people in the general
population these are usually big molecules there are things like vinyl chloride used in industry
here's what a chemical formula looks like use the chlorine a couple of carbons and hydrogen
atoms making this molecule but the big group as a group of chemicals is the cyclic hydrocarbons
and these include the benzene ring and the benzene ring gets combined with other
chemicals and this is without all those other letters on there but basically each joint here
is a carbon and various cyclic hydrocarbons called poly cyclic hydrocarbons are linked to
cancers of many many forms also lymphomas which should be called now as you probably know
lympho sarcomas because they occur in mesothelial tissue those cancers still are called lymphoma
by general agreement they're very controversial but probably herbicides are very important in the
development of them and there's strong industry bias in getting this nailed down very much like
the tobacco industry diesel exhaust fumes are more carcinogenic than non diesel and urban air
pollution is very important in that you're not only smoking but you're heating up those elements
through a fire and then you get the tar products from the tobacco and the urban air pollutants
which are being heated up and everything all chemical reactions go faster when you heat them
up so smokers in the city do worse than smokers in the country medicines for the final group for
cancers they probably produce about one percent of all cancer deaths nowhere near in the category of
tobacco but chemotherapy can cause secondary cancers later the immunosuppressive drugs as I
told you cause lymphomas hormones can cause endometrial and breast cancers in large doses
steroids cause liver cancers and so on there's a just again an entire industry's worth of cancers
and one of the problems is you get down to a chart like this certain cancers have not such a
terrible incidence 14 percent here's the incidence of lung cancer but the mortality is enormous because
it's so so bad a cancer to have uh breast cancer in women causes again more cancer but fewer deaths
it's easier to cure and another factor if you take all these into consideration look what the
effects of immigration are in japan and this is some time ago because things have changed but the
here's the incidence the deaths from cancers of the stomach was out here forgetting the numbers
when these people migrated to california there was a decrease and their children had a degree
decrease and it was very close to the rate of california native carcassians what happens when
people move is they pick up the habits in most cases and the environmental exposures of the new
population they've joined and as they assimilate they tend to either increase or decrease or stay
the same depending on what the environmental causes was were of their kinds of cancer those are the
chemical carcinogens i'm going to just talk for a minute on physical carcinogens the important
ones are asbestos as you know which is a physical injury to the cell it probably spears the
cytoplasm and the nucleus their microfibers and they probably mix chemicals that never
should have been mixed remember we talked about those membranes to keep the chemicals apart
they cause mesothelioma a kind of covering of the lung cancer there's ionizing radiation
which is the kind of radiation that has a lot of energy and can move electrons in a molecule
or in an atom and cause mutation in that molecule or that atom and these are the two really big
ones the the ionizing radiation and then uv radiation ultraviolet light as well as asbestos
it's an interesting controversy asbestos in the ground doesn't really hurt anybody the miners
have a problem asbestos that's probably in walls that are well sealed probably are less
harmful than when you try to remove it because that's when you spread it to the workers we leave
asbestos where it is and seal it off it's probably going to do the most good in preventing
these kind of cancers electromagnetic magnetic fields i have to talk about because it's always
in the paper there's really no hard evidence that there have been cancer increases because of
electromagnetic fields this is still very controversial and nuclear energy is another
one that comes up a lot because of the the fact that radiation is emitted as far as we know in
terms of the industry of nuclear energy it's a pretty clean industry and there has not been
increases in cancer deaths except in places like Chernobyl we did learn a lot about
unfortunately about cancer from our own experience in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that was how long
and how much cancer you're going to get from this kind of radiation we radiated more than a hundred
thousand people and the shortest lag period was about seven years and that was from leukemia and
mostly in children children were the most susceptible total body radiation caused caused
all the tissues to be at risk so radiation in any dose is bad the more radiation you get the
worst it is up to a certain point and i'll talk to that a little bit when i talk about treatment
ultraviolet radiation we now know that both ultraviolet a and b are carcinogenic
finally the third group in this physical chemical and biologic are the biologic carcinogens
and the big player here are the viruses they're called oncogenic viruses uncle means cancer
genetic means causing and they carry dna defects right to the cellular uh excuse me the nuclear
dna in the cell and this of course in this case it would be stem cells and that defect is brought
to us courtesy of the viruses in a very interesting cycle hepatitis b and c are associated with liver
cancers i'm going to tell you in more detail how those viruses work but right now we're just
going to review who the players are what kind of diseases they cause uh the human papilloma virus
papilloma means polyp it's a virus that causes uterine cervical cancer and cancer of the male
genitourinary tract it's highest in women with multiple sexual sexual partners it's highest in
women who are prostitutes or women whose partner had multiple sexual partners so the chance of
getting this virus and the chance of then getting cancer from it goes up with the level of unprotected
sex and what is called in medicine promiscuity meaning promiscuity meaning multiple sexual partners
human t-cell leukemia is an interesting one it's one we don't say here a lot but it is
related to a viral infection and finally hiv causes something called caposi sarcoma this is a
disease it was a very very benign kind of cancer one that wasn't very aggressive it occurred in
the skin of elderly men mostly around the Mediterranean coastline in Italy places like that
and then came hiv and it did something to the nature of that cancer that made it very aggressive
and very virulent so in the framework of an hiv infection caposi sarcoma you know that's a mesothelial
tissue that grows up through the skin caposi sarcoma is a much more deadly cancer hiv is also
linked to non-hodgkins lymphoma as well as hodgkins lymphoma both of which are cancers of the cells
of the immune system we talked about that earlier epstein bar virus is really interesting because
epstein bar virus is everywhere in this country there's a huge population that has had epstein
bar virus infections in the past it's given them relatively mild diseases called mononucleosis
kissing disease but in other environments in other parts of the world they cause cancers
such as lymphoma such as cancers of the nose and the pharynx the back of the mouth in populations
like arctic estymal so there's a lot of factors going on there that are causing this and we're not
clear about most of them finally there is helobacter pylorihy helobacter is a benign stomach
ulcer residing bacterium it's a little rod it lives in the ulcer of the stomach it brings
with it its own enzymes to produce ammonia which neutralizes the acid so it can live
very happily in the ulcer and where we used to treat these ulcers with antacids we now treat them
with antacids plus antibiotics however over the long term they can cause gastric cancer
and this is the only bacterial infection that we know of that's associated with cancer
so the real players in biology as I said are the viruses and we'll look at the specific ways
that they do this so these if you haven't noticed I'm talking about cancers in somatic cells
cancers that occur in body cells and organs that are not germ cell related they're not related to
for example the sperm or the ovum when we talk about genetically transmitted cancers we're talking
about mutations that occur in one of the two germ cells the sperm or the ovum are then transmitted
to the offspring and since that defect is in every cell of that patient then you have something called
a predisposition syndrome any cancer can have at least a two or three fold or two or three hundred
increase in incidents if there's a family history for example there's something called retinoblastoma
a very serious malignancy on the back of the eye occurs in the retina and if you have the genes
passed on from both your parents for this you can have a ten thousand fold increase
getting this cancer and unfortunately occurs in infants it requires usually the removal of the eye
and it is an autosomal dominant gene so it occurs in the somatic cell and it is a dominant
gene meaning you only have to have one mutation to get this I'll talk more about this gene later on
there's something called zero derma pigmentosum zero derma means dry skin pigmentosum means
pigmented these patients have a recessive gene that they get from their parents which impairs
the ability of their DNA to make repairs on UV damaged skin so when they get a sunburn it has
a huge chance of turning into cancer and in fact these people can virtually never go out in the
sun their skin has no repair mechanisms and they need to be completely protected or they will get
hundreds of skin cancers you've probably heard about BRCA1 and BRCA2 sometimes called BRACA1
and BRACA2 these are genes which I'll tell you more about again that are linked to about 5% of
breast cancers so while they really raise the incidence or the chances of the mutated form
leading to breast cancer they don't occur in many patients and then there's something called
the Lee-Fraumini syndrome in which there is an inherited defect in a gene called p53 which is
a repair gene we'll talk about that at great length but when that repair gene is damaged
this increases the chance for cancer in multiple levels of multiple cancers
patients of all kinds get all different cancers when they have the Lee-Fraumini syndrome
now having said all that in this long talk about genetic susceptibility first of all
only about 5% of patients are affected what I mean by that is if you take all cancer patients
only 5% of them have a link to these genetic disorders they're very useful to us because
they help us understand the pathogenesis and the etiology of cancer but now here's the here's the
caveat most patients with a family history never get breast cancer that's number one
number two is most patients who get cancer have no family history when I say most I'm talking about
80% what this means is there's nothing that we can do with family history unless it's very very
extreme that translates translates into how you take care of a patient when I have a patient
sitting across the desk from me it doesn't matter if she's had a family history of breast cancer
or not I will be no less careful in physical exam in ordering mammograms in surveillance of this
patient whether or not she's had the family history now the same goes with all the rest of these so
what we do in medicine in the real world and what we talk about on paper are really two different
things you have to look at every patient as this they could have the disease and except in real
extremes a woman who has mutations in both brca one brca two whose mother had premenopausal
breast cancer who has two sisters with bilateral premenopausal cancer that's different that's first
of all very very rare but it's a totally different issue that patient is going to have to have more
screening finally chronic inflammation if you irritate us enough hepatitis leads to
hepatocellular cancer even cancers of the skin occur more impatient with chronic scars
with long-term burn healing because of the constant turnover rate that occurs
in chronic inflammation and regeneration leading to less time for turnover more genetic
errors and more stem cells coming into play next time we'll take a really close look at the
molecular mechanisms of how all this plays out
