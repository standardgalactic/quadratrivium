AI-generated Abstract

The review critically evaluates Hayakawa's "Language in Thought and Action" (LITAA), highlighting its long-lasting influence and popularity while also addressing its failures in accurately representing general-semantics. Despite its effective communication of certain concepts, the review finds that Hayakawa's treatment creates misunderstandings about general-semantics as a comprehensive system, leading to a lack of integration in discussing key themes. The analysis emphasizes the importance of clarity in popularizing general-semantics to prevent misrepresentations.
