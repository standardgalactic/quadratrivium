It withered under the Republic and it is really not particularly important, though if you were to read some early Roman history
You might see mention of this but in the high period of the Republic
It's not really important and needn't engage our attention here
There was also a plebeian council, but this council also after the Lycinean sectarian laws in
287 granted essential equality to the decisions of the plebs and the decisions of the centurion assembly the
Plebeian council the old plebeian council also withered it really didn't have the kind of significance it once did
So that leaves us with the fundamental institutions the fundamental legislative institutions or deliberative bodies of the Roman people
First the Senate now the Latin word Sanatus is derived from the Latin word Senex
Which means old man?
You'll remember perhaps it's part of that it was the group of old men who governed the state
So to it Rome a body which was in some sense imagined as that of the older or the wiser men had
Prime responsibility in the Roman state, but there is an irony
It was made up originally of patricians and eventually open to all it was made up of ex-office holders
It had the fundamental responsibility of passing treaties
But it could not legislate the Roman Senate did not pass laws and
Rome did not function with a bicameral or even indeed with a multi-cameral
Legislature that is to say issues discussed in one of the other assemblies to which will turn in just a second did not come up to
The Senate for resolution the Senate had no role. Well, it did have a certain kind of role
I'll come to that a minute. It had no formal role in legislation. It could not pass laws
There was then
The tribal assembly now the tribal assembly constituted the Roman people
Organized according to districts
Here was one of the great acts of gerrymandering in human history
There were four districts. So tribe means district tribe does not mean a group of people related to one another
Maybe way way back in Roman history
There was some hint some suggestion some notion that that people living together in a certain area would then act together publicly
Whatever might have been the case once we enter the historical period tribe means district
There were four districts in the city and 29 in the countryside surrounding it
By the time let's say of the birth of Christ the city of Rome was this had about a million people
So all of those people had basically four districts
You see and the people on the outside of the city had about 29
That was always a boon to the wealthy landowners who had managed this system
Its institutional consequences will see in just a second
There was in the second place the centurion assembly the assembly by centuries
Now what exactly is a century? Well, it's a hundred. That's easy enough
Was this originally a group of a hundred citizens organized for some purposes?
Was it a military band of a hundred men?
Organized perhaps for domestic defense in the event that Rome were attacked. We don't really know
We don't really know what the point of the word century is by the time we enter the historic period
centuries were groups of people
grouped by wealth
Now we come back to our censors
Every five years the census the censors try to say that fast the censors tried to assess
The wealth of all the Roman citizens and according to their wealth
It placed them in census classes. It placed them in one of a hundred and ninety two
centuries
Now you'll be asking yourself why a hundred and ninety two and I can't tell you we don't know but there were a hundred and ninety two
centuries
Like the tribal assembly the centurion assembly was also gerrymandered that is to say
about ten percent of the Roman population
Constituted about the first hundred centuries
the remaining ninety or so centuries
Involved about ninety percent of the population now
We're going to see how the Romans voted in just a moment and you'll see with particular clarity why that fact is
Significant all right
so the tribal assembly and the centurion assembly the fundamental voting assemblies of the Roman people the fundamental
assemblies that passed Roman laws
Now how do we start the process?
Legislation could be introduced by the magistrates a consul a pretor could introduce into one of the assemblies a body a piece of proposed
legislation
Bills were then read three times in the Roman forum
They were read from the rostrum in the Roman forum to whatever people gathered if it were a great controversial issue
There would perhaps be lots of people there if it was a relatively minor point
There might be very few people around but the bills were read out three times publicly. Does any of this begin to sound a bit familiar?
I think so
