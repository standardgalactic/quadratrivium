Lecture 11, The Birth of History
Hello again and welcome to the 11th of our lectures in this series on the foundations
of Western civilization.
In the last lecture we talked about drama and about architecture as two of the great
public arts of the polis and in particular of the Athenian polis.
I want to turn today to another of the public arts, to another of the public conversations
that went on in these polis.
I'm going to turn to history.
Now you may say that that seems a bit odd, a bit paradoxical.
I mean, haven't we after all for the last ten lectures been doing history?
Well, that's the way I suppose we have.
What is history?
Well, Volterra once said famously that history is a bunch of lies the living tell about the
dead.
Henry Ford said history is bunk.
The Greeks invented it, so what did they think it was?
What is the point of history?
Now let's say right away, and I've made this point on two or three earlier occasions as
I hope you'll recall, that we can think of history as what happened in the past, and
we can think of history as the way things are remembered, which in a certain sense means
that the events of the past will take on new meanings, perhaps even change their meanings
as we reflect on them differently.
That would be a useful thing to have in mind as we think about the Greeks and about what
they thought history was.
Now let's be very clear, the Greeks did not invent historical mindedness.
When I say that the Greeks invented history, I am saying that the Greeks invented a particular
literary form that we know as history, or that we have come to know as history.
When we talked about the Hebrews, for example, we saw that there was a powerful sense of
historical mindedness among them.
We also saw that its force was prophetic.
You may recall my saying that to some degree the Hebrews imagined a past as a way of charting
a future.
Now we also saw, for example, among the Egyptians a very powerful sense of historical mindedness.
