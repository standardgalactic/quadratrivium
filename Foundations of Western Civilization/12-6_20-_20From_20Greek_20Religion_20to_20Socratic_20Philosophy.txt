Well, there's no question where Sophocles comes down on that, you see, but this is one
of the ways that these kinds of issues were played out before the Athenian public.
All right, so we can make rules, we can change them, we can flaunt them, we can chuck them
around, we can tease them out.
Nothing is finally right, nothing is finally wrong.
Nothing is absolute.
This quest for truth is foolish.
This quest for ultimate reality is foolish.
Man is the measure of all things.
That means me.
I'm the measure of all things.
I measure everything in relation to me.
The aim is not to be right, but to prevail.
If I go into court of law, I'm not interested in justice, I want to win.
Justice is another issue entirely.
That's what theologians and philosophers to worry about.
Gorgia has posed the hermeneutic paradox, nothing exists.
If anything existed, I couldn't know it.
Even if I could know it, I couldn't communicate it.
Everything is relative.
Everything is relative to me.
To that juncture, the Socrates appears.
Socrates wants to vindicate reality.
There is something out there.
It really exists.
He wants to vindicate our capacity to know.
He wants to vindicate our capacity to communicate what we know.
But the Sophists had left an indelible mark.
They had in a certain way handed Socrates his agenda.
Now we'll see at the beginning of our next lecture that Socrates attempts to answer these
questions, partly in the context of the Athens in which he lived, and partly through his
pupil Plato and Plato's pupil Aristotle, moved philosophy off the dangerous promontory
on which the Sophists had left it.
But the durable contribution of the Sophists was to have forced us to ask these nasty questions
about the eternal and the momentary, the true and the seeming, justice and prevailing.
We've been forced ever since to formulate our questions in that way, how the Greeks
answered those questions in the 4th century BC.
We'll see in our next lecture.
Thank you.
