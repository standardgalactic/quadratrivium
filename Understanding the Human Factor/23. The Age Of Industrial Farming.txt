Welcome. I think we now have the background to consider an issue or really several issues
that may have significant impact in the near and maybe longer term future. Much of this
course has been based on looking back to our ancient and prehistoric past. But we noted
in the last lecture that we are now beginning to look more at the present and we're beginning
to use some of what we have covered in this course to make informed speculations about
what might be just around the corner or even well down the road.
In the last few lectures we've discussed a number of new ways of approaching the production
of food and of using the food production system to stimulate other areas of activity such
as medicine by manipulating domesticates and new high tech ways. We focused primarily however
on the way these new approaches at manipulating domesticates make them essential components
in the emerging global food production and distribution system. In less than one lifetime
the actual practice of agriculture at the farm level has changed in a truly dramatic
way. Not long ago the norm in agriculture was the integrated independent farm. Though
large collective farms were established in some countries the bulk of the world's food
was produced by individual farmers engaged in planting more than one crop and keeping
a variety of animals in an integrated farming approach that had sustained much of the human
population for thousands of years. Though it is true that agricultural food production
is the world's largest industry the fact was often overlooked because the practitioners
of that industry were by and large small operators with little individual capital and no global
organizational opportunities. In other words it was a highly dispersed industry. However
technical advances in plant and animal breeding improved techniques of fertilization irrigation
planting and harvesting and the appearance of effective pesticides and herbicides called
for specialization and economies of scale in order to realize the full benefit of the
new opportunities being afforded. It is now common for large farms to grow only one crop
in a given season and livestock often spend their entire lives in huge concentrated animal
feeding operations what we sometimes call CAFOs that we mentioned again in an earlier lecture.
This is a subject that is currently fraught with controversy and is the subject of heated
debate and one which is likely to be so for some time. Please remember that I am a practitioner.
I am a farmer. Someone engaged in this enterprise and not a dispassionate researcher viewing
it critically from the outside but I am going to try very hard to provide you with the best
background information that I can free as possible from my own self-interested position
so that you can find your own place in this debate and generate your own informed position.
In order to gain some perspective on how day-to-day life on the farm has changed let's do another
one of our little mental experiments. Let's try to conjure up in our mind's eye a vision
of old McDonald's farm you know the one with an oink oink here and a moo moo there that's
the one we're talking about. Think about that okay what do you see we can imagine a red
barn and a silo green pastures golden fields of wheat corn oats the fields are lined with
rows of fruit trees that serve as a windbreak and probably some additional items for personal
consumption for the McDonald family there's a garden patch that would feed the family
for much of the year the McDonald's are the proud owners of the land the equipment the
seed and the animals though of course there's probably a pretty hefty loan from the bank
somewhere in that mix as well they're the ones that decide what to plant what to raise
which fertilizers to use and their fortunes will rise and fall with their skills as farmers
the cooperation of the weather their prudence in deciding what to produce and the behavior
of a series of free markets for their various products the McDonald's farm of that well-known
children's song that we just described might be pretty hard to find today now why would
that be well in order to increase efficiency and reduce risk the McDonald's now limit their
animal population to one species they made a self-aware decision to become hog finishers
I just picked that one option out of the air that is they will receive piglets from another
farmer or group of farmers that specialize in farrowing or producing piglets then the
McDonald's will feed these piglets with crops they grow themselves or they'll purchase from
others until these pigs we reach market weight at which time they will leave the McDonald's
farm so gone are the cows that had to be milked every day gone are the horses that seem to have
little utility now that the McDonald's have three diesel tractors the skid loader and an
all-terrain vehicle the McDonald's even decided to get rid of the dog because it bothered the pigs
and that could slow their weight gain okay so it's more specialized place let's take a few minutes
to consider what benefits this new approach afforded the McDonald's for years they'd seen their
neighbors give up farming and sell their land to developers for enough profit to permit retirement
or reorientation into some other business with more security fewer risks less physical work
and more potential for financial gain by making this decision they were able to develop an
association with a major hog producing corporation that was eager to enter into a contractual agreement
with a family like the McDonald's who would then become one of their contract suppliers
the contract offered by the corporation solved a number of the McDonald's problems
making it possible for them to continue being farmers to start with they would have a ready
supply of piglets these little porkers would be the result of mating's done with a highly selected
industrial strain that was result the result of years of careful breeding experiments and careful
breedings at the farrowing operations and then these piglets would be provided to the McDonald's
a contract of the type the McDonald's were signing was the only way they could get their hands
on such highly selected stock the contract stipulated a price for the piglets what the
McDonald's would have to pay and it also guaranteed a price for the animals when they reached the
agreed upon weight that's new a quick glance at the numbers indicated to the McDonald's
that the difference between the price they would pay and the price they would receive would be quite
adequate to cover their expenses service their debt pay their taxes upgrade their equipment
and maybe even keep a little for themselves maybe not a lot but a little this guaranteed price
eliminated the risk of having to take hogs to market at a time when prices may be lower than
they were 20 years ago and that's not an exaggeration fluctuations like that have happened in the
agricultural commodity business often to the ruin nation of farmers so it provided a level of
security and comfort they had not experienced before and it looked as if it would buffer them
from the vagaries of the system that drove so many of their neighbors off the land
of course of course there's no free lunch what did the McDonald's have to give up in order to get
this new level of security well some of the choice about what they would raise where they would get
their stock and other things like that were no longer their province right these things are taken
care of in the contract with the corporation the corporation also had some specific requirements
for what the piglets would be fed so the McDonald's would still grow the crops they wanted but it
really made good sense to grow what the corporation wanted to feed the pigs the McDonald's also had
to follow a regimen of feed supplements including antibiotics that had to be added to the piglets
feed because the corporation had strict guidelines about cleanliness and how the pigs would be raised
the McDonald's had to construct at their expanse a feeder barn that met the corporation's standard
also because the corporation insisted the pigs be kept clean they had to be washed and their
pens had to be washed down regularly this produced voluminous huge quantity huge quantities of liquefied
pig manure not a nice material the state in which the McDonald's lived had strict rules about the
disposal and the handling of such waste so the McDonald's had to do something else they had to
build a concrete manure holding tank and they had to contract with the manure hauler to come
periodically and take away the excess manure that the McDonald's could not use themself on their own
fields the McDonald's also took on the liability for the millions of gallons of this liquid waste
they were storing if it leaked into the water supplies they could be liable for damages and large
fines they still had some risk because if their crops did not do as well as expected they would
need to pay for supplemental feed to keep the pigs going if any of the pigs died or failed to make
market weight they would not be paid for them at the end of the exercise so they could they had to
face some risks they were also on the hook for their own barn if it burned down or something punched
a hole in the roof it was their responsibility to fix it so they had new liabilities new costs
new overhead yet all in all this was a real economic and security gain for the McDonald's
and Mr. McDonald again began to think about leaving the farm to his children he previously thought
about such an act but he was a little concerned that it might actually turn out to be a subtle
form of child abuse and he'd given it up but now it was beginning to appeal to him again
there can be many versions of the McDonald's saga the one we just talked about lots of different
ways to do that and i gave you that one just by way of illustration the combining of farms
to make mega farms and the widespread use of contracts to direct farm products to processors
without the intervention of markets is the new trend in agriculture as with most big changes
there are potential winners and there are potential losers among the apparent winners
in this new system are first of all obviously a number of multinational companies that offer
contracts of this kind to farmers for the production of animals or plants this industry
and some of its participants have grown enormously in recent years okay it's a good business to be
in because you can make a fair deal with your producers you can do them a favor okay but you
can get a pretty reliable supply you avoid some of the liability of production you don't have to
shell out all the capital for building the buildings things of that sort and you don't bear the risk
of animals not making it to the to the final weight so it's not a bad deal for these corporations
they can affect economies of scale by dealing with lots of contractors that allows them to
pay for research they can develop animals exceptionally well suited for the sort of system
they're employing and they also have resources that can be used for advertising and for lobbying
remember up until this time we know that agriculture was an enormous industry but it
was dispersed and many of the players were relatively small that's changing as these producers
step in and use the mechanism of the contract to bring suppliers to them and then they can negotiate
and operate at a different level so they can have some legislative influence they can advertise
they can do things of that sort now many farmers have gained a great deal from these trends
priority availability of this sort of production contract many farmers faced economic ruin and
they could not keep their farms together keep them in the family or convince their children to take
on such an arduous and risky way of life retailers who may actually be the driving force in this
system enjoy things like the uniform size and quality and uniform quality of products supplied
on a predictable schedule at a predetermined price there's not all this stuff with local
markets and and things going up and things going down you can now predict a little bit into the
future and that lets retailers make some business decisions that allows them to run a little bit
better operation consumers are purported to want nothing more from their food supply system
other than it provide food that is predictable cheap and convenient if that is the case then the
consumer is also a big winner in this system okay if those are the winners among the possible
losers might be the environment since the operation of CAFOs creates on a daily basis
big hazards as dangerous quantities of animal waste have to be dealt with and disposed of
in ways that would not be so problematic if stocking rates were closer to the natural concentrations
of animals on a particular amount of land a certain number of animal units per acre what's
different about a CAFO is not actually the number of animals it's the number of animals on a given
amount of space i don't think anyone can argue that there's anything wrong with a farmer who's
good at what he does wanting to deal with lots of animals because there's potentially more profit
there and he's being rewarded for his hard work the problem comes if those animals are crowded into
a space that can't adequately handle their waste and maybe can't adequately handle them okay so
that's the issue with CAFOs or at least part of the issue another possible loser would be rural
communities of the of the kinds that the mcdonalds used to live in they're clearly losers as local
markets both for selling products and buying supplies are displaced to larger centers far away
from the farm these once lively places so well suited for raising a family are becoming virtual
ghost towns not only around america but around the world there are infrastructure costs to the
counties and states which see their bridges and roads battered by larger scale deliveries and
larger hauling trucks public health might suffer from the concentrated waste and the flies and
insects that attracts and the outrageous odors that are produced but most frightening of all
are the increasing numbers of antibiotic resistant bacteria that are beginning to accumulate in and
around such farms as a result of the practice of feeding antibiotics on a regular basis to
healthy animals i suppose the consumer who wants something more from the food system
might also begin to wonder if this is serving her well those concerned with national security
might be worried about such practices which concentrate production processing and distribution
of food to a degree never before seen it could be a system that looks rather inviting to a person
interested in poisoning bioterrorism or disruption of a major portion of the food system even the
fact that many of the corporations that play such vital roles in this system are multinational in
nature gives some concern about food independence these are things that could not happen in a
more dispersed system and what about the animals could they be losers here if they could might they
be asking did my ancient ancestors really make such a good deal partnering with these humans
after all remember that's been a recurring theme in this course that domestication
has been certainly can be and i think ought to be mutually beneficial we've established the idea
in this course of a mutualistic symbiosis between human beings and their domesticates
the issues surrounding plants are quite different from the issues we face with animal
domesticates and the debate over the issues frequently involves how we balance what we
perceive to be the legitimate needs and welfare of the animals and the legitimate needs and
welfare of the human population that's the rub this balancing of after all people do need food
people do need it if at a price they can afford people do like some variety in their food they
do want it to be safe they do want it to be plentiful they do want it to be predictable and appealing
don't they come first but then there are the animals and then there is that business and
so it's the struggle to try to find the right balance of course there are people that would be quick
to give you pat answers in this area but i think it is one that's worthy of your careful deliberation
as you develop your own opinion about this controversial and important subject i've tried
hard to show that there are benefits to doing things in this way that people are doing reasonable
things and that there are outcomes and people can view those outcomes and those activities in
different ways i think we could all agree however that in the partnership between humans and their
domesticates there are certain expectations that the human partners should meet when it comes to
dealing with their animal partners what are some of those well obviously we need to make sure they
have adequate food and water that's obvious we need to provide protection from predation we have
been doing all those things since the first domesticates came under our protection we should
provide veterinary and obstetrical care when possible and i think it's interesting to think
about this people in veterinary schools are concerned that the demand for large animal
veterinarians is actually reduced by the scale of some of these things because veterinarians used
to be called into small farms to deal with individual problems but now frequently there's
an on-call veterinarian for these huge kfos and it may be that the actual amount of veterinary
care per animal is down a little bit that's a saving economically i'm not sure it's necessarily
the best for the animal we certainly when possible need to minimize damage to animals done by parasites
i think we'd all agree that's a good thing we should allow animals to live as natural a life
as possible okay of course here we're on a slippery slope we're talking about a matter of
degree and we have problems with definitions in some respects this course may be of help to you
here as you consider this question for now i suspect you no longer consider a domesticated
animal to be the same as a wild animal they have different needs as well as different
capabilities from their wild progenitors this is an area where earnest honest well-intentioned
people can and do often disagree and when it is time for them to die when it's time for these
animals to die we should see to it that their death is not a degrading terrifying and painful or deal
there i would hope that it would go without saying that we would all agree with that
now industrial agris industrialized agriculture creates a few changes to the obligations
or a few challenges to the oblig obligations we have assumed toward our domesticated animals
many of the efficiencies and economies of scale require crowding in unnatural environments
this can result in restricted movement which can be in itself painful crowding in such facilities
also sometimes leads to aggression to protect animals from this they are often routinely
mutilated in the case of those little piglets we talked about if they were going to be confined
tightly they probably had their tails cut off because if they're tightly confined they chew on
each other's tails birds turkeys and some broilers that are allowed to live in close quarters have
to be de-beaked their beaks have to be cut off so they don't peck at each other these animals also
have little time to be animals i don't know how you will weigh this observation it may be important
to some people while others may think it is just sentimental nonsense but do you need to let an
animal have time to be an animal or should it be simply confined in a cave all its life
because contagions can spread rapidly in crowded conditions antibiotics are often used to prevent
outbreaks in addition it was learned some years ago that adding antibiotics to animal feed increased
weight gain so as we mentioned before it's common practice to dose healthy animals with antibiotics
many more tons of antibiotics are added to the feed of healthy animals in the united states each
year then are used therapeutically to treat diseases in ourselves and our domesticates
with clinical symptoms think about that that's an interesting observation everything that is born
must die it's perhaps then less of an issue that animals die in this system than how they will be
allowed to live and under what conditions they will die slaughter plants can be horrible places
where animals are subjected to terrifying and degrading circumstances before meeting an unnecessarily
painful death but let me hasten to say that is not always the case many of these problems can
simply be eliminated by better design informed by studies in animal behavior a little common
sense and a modicum of kindness and there are brilliant people working hard to develop systems
that are humane in handling animals in these situations as mentioned before recent studies
have begun to find antibiotic resistant bacteria on the increase it is truly upsetting to see the
incidence of MRSA higher in people living near CAFOs than in the general population MRSA is
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus it's a bad bad bacterium the debates over some of the
changes in farming just discussed are heated and passionate almost everyone is brought into the
controversy at some level it's my hope that some of the material we have been covering in this course
is providing you with context and the backstory to help you precisely develop your own opinions
about what this most important subject is about please keep in mind that actions taken
long ago set things in motion that have inexorably led us to this point the issue of the food
population nexus and the ensuing positive feedback is partly responsible the desire of all of us to
get more than just subsistence from our agricultural practices also factors in consumer choices that
we make inform retailers that respond by pressing producers and suppliers who in turn find ways to
gain the cooperation of the producers on the land the farmers to supply what the system
feels the consumer wants i would leave you with one thought related to that one of my
favorite cartoons shows two vultures sitting on a branch one says to the other actually
i prefer fresh meat but i find carrion to be cheaper and more convenient a kind of consumer choice
in our last lecture in this course we will reach back to the beginnings we will bring them forward
we will talk about what we have learned and we will do the best we can to try to put the
information together to help us understand how we have come to this point in human history and we
will ask the question have we reached another point that may be of equal import to that one
when our ancient ancestors first began to produce food i'll look forward to seeing you then
