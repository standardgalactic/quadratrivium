The real performance you missed was me backstage dancing in my most white way possible.
So I was recently feeling pretty down about myself, and like most people, it's cheaper
to go to BuzzFeed.com than it is to visit a therapist.
And I was at that point in my life where I needed meaning and purpose, so I figured
why not try to find out who my arch nemesis was?
That kind of direction in my life I really needed, and because it's BuzzFeed and they're
the future of journalism, and because it's a very scientific quiz, the answer was squirrels.
Clearly I'm a nut.
And so let's have a thought experiment for a moment, and let's pick a particularly shady
squirrel, mustache top hat normally says Robert Barron Squirrel, he's my arch nemesis, and
let's also say for a thought, just a thought experiment that I showed up a little early
today and I replaced one of the seats in this auditorium, don't worry it's the one that
looks like that, very distinct, with something I bought on eBay which was a Martin Baker
ejection seat, which you can buy for the low low price of $12,500 free local pick up,
just in case you're curious, and I've replaced the guts of that chair with my ejection seat
for my arch nemesis, a shifty squirrel.
And at this point I feel like I have to tell you this is going somewhere, they don't let
anyone up here, at least they won't in the future.
What I'm here to talk about today is complex systems, and I've been talking about complex
systems since 2008, and what I found in just generally in education, the best way to teach
someone anything is to threaten their lives, or to threaten the lives of a fictional protagonist
which is what I'm doing now, and I want to talk about complex systems in the phrase itself
is scary, complexity is something as a culture that we tend to shy away from, the word complex
normally people when I ask can I come and talk about complex systems, I don't hear the
rest of the conversation because they've hung up on me, but today I want to talk about complex
systems and a really simple way to think about complex systems, they're a network of things
that are connected, and because they're connected they get to do really interesting things like
anticipate the future and adapt, I'm going to give you some examples because probably
that meant nothing, but this is the example of if I showed up early today and my goal
was to eject my arch nemesis a shifty squirrel into the ceiling, how would I choose which
seat to tamper with, and all of you should be a little nervous right about now for the
seat that you're sitting in, one the first thing that I'd have to take for consideration
is this notion of disperse control, for some reason you've all agreed to let me stand up
your bathe gloriously in light while you sit there, let me speak at you, but I don't have
direct control over you, like a beehive, a beehive is a complex adaptive system, the
queen bee, that's really a misnomer, the queen bee is really responsible for reproduction,
but she's not telling every single bee in the hive what to do, what to think, and how
to go about their work, I don't have control over this audience, although I'd love to,
I would love that level of control, and there's a pretty good reason why I shouldn't have
it, but I can't tell you where to sit, and I can't assume my arch nemesis a shifty squirrel
for argument's sake would sit in one particular seat, so I have to take that under consideration,
the second is in a complex system, they're interacting agents, a stock market is a complex
system, because it is the behavior of lots and lots of individuals who bring with them
their own mental models about the world, their own motivations, their own problem solving
strategies, and so rich behavior in a system like this comes from competing and collaborating
agents, so just like when you walked into this auditorium you were deciding where to
sit, I will assume everyone on the aisle has to pee very often, I will assume that there
was one young gentleman who picked a seat next to a lovely young woman for a particular
reason, and that the decisions you made were not wholly driven by your own needs, but by
those around you, also complex systems are non-linear, so we've probably heard the phrase
butterfly effect, where a butterfly can flap its wings and a hurricane can appear on the
other side of the world, frankly I think that we're blaming butterflies a little too much
for that one, but complex systems are really built on small, small elements that tend to
interact to have much larger consequences, so when I think about this, I think about
where would I want to place my ejector seat in this audience, hypothetically speaking
only, none of you are about to be propelled into the ceiling just quite yet, and when
I think about that I have to think about all the myriad things that go into the decision
making process of why you sat, where you sat, and where my arch nemesis, again a shifty
squirrel for hypothetical sake, where he might sit, or she, complex systems also adapt, they
have the ability to anticipate the future, because it's lots and lots of different agents
trying to fulfill their own needs, but also making predictions about the future, about
how to fulfill those needs, so just like a flock of birds, which is a complex system,
you don't quite often see flocks of birds running into buildings, maybe wind mills and
wind generators perhaps, I'm from California, so that's something that we have to pay attention
to, but for the most part, a group of birds who cannot communicate in any direct way that
we see are able to adapt their behavior, so just like now that I've told you that potentially,
well hypothetically maybe, there's an ejection seat under one of the chairs in this audience,
someone may have just checked under their seat, and I like that person, I want to be your
friend, and so complex systems have the ability to adapt, so my arch nemesis, if he or she
may be sitting in the audience, might decide to get up and maybe head to the back of the
group. Complex systems also exhibit perpetual novelty, just like the human immune system,
which is a complex system, this is a healthy T cell or white blood cell, and your immune
system generates a huge amount of variety and a huge amount of novelty because it's constantly
trying to predict what your body is being attacked by, whether that's the flu or Ebola,
which I think both are equally as scary today for whatever reason, so that's something I have to
pay attention to as well, if I asked you all to get up, walk out, even in single file how you
set and walk back in, the same seating structure would likely not be in place and we could try
that hundreds of times over and it would not necessarily equal the exact same seating structure
as before because a complex system is constantly exhibiting novelty, and so this is a TED audience,
I figured you could rise above this, but I thought wrong, like the weather, which is a
complex adaptive system, the best that I can do is make a prediction, I can make a probability
assessment about what might take place based on what I currently know about the system, but just
as when the weather man gives you the 10 day forecast 10 days ago, he's far less likely to be
accurate 10 days later, so as more time marches on, my ability to predict gets less and less
successful, and so the one thing I'm here to tell you is that complex problems demand complex
problem solving, so think about all of the work I just did to launch a hypothetical arch
nemesis which was a squirrel into the ceiling with an ejection seat that I may or may not have bought
off on eBay, I put that much thought into place because that's how much context and information
and how the decision making process goes in because you have your own mental models, every
single person in this room went through whether it's implicit or explicit in your head, had
dozens of rules in place to determine where you would sit in an audience, and it's important to
respect that level of complexity, otherwise you may find yourself falling on your face.
And this is something we see in culture all the time, and I'll give you a really bad example and
then some real examples, so let's say that you have a teenage daughter, you're worried about her
texting while she's driving, that's a completely acceptable concern, it's something you hear on
the news every single day, but you don't see a lot of people arguing that maybe the solution to
that problem would just be to cut off her fingers. It would certainly fix the immediate
problem, although you might find that you have a daughter who can now text with her toes, which
is fascinating, and I've also heard that this works as a threat to the boyfriend of your
daughter too. There's actually a name for this sort of law of unintended consequences when we
apply an overly simplistic solution to a problem, it's called the cobra effect, and it
becomes from a story of British colonial rule and rural India, and the idea was that some
intrepid British bureaucrat decided I would like to limit the number of cobras in a rural area, I
would also want to do that if I live there, so the scheme that was devised was to create a bounty
system, so bring in a dead cobra, get five bucks, a completely elegant solution it seems to that
problem, except what ended up happening is a whole cottage industry popped up to farm cobras.
Cobra farm is now something that you'll have to think of as a place and a thing and a profession,
but then, so it gets worse, so then the British bureaucrat said well we can't exactly have people
farming cobras, we should get rid of this bounty system, so they totally got rid of it. The
unintended consequence is everyone released their cobras, because they no longer had value, so here's
clearly a very simple-minded, some people would say very straightforward solution to a problem that
actually exacerbated the problem and made it far, far worse, in this case cobra is everywhere, but this
is a problem-solving strategy we see all over, and it's one that we see today very often, and
you have a problem with drunken immigrants in your country, outlaw alcohol, we all know how that went,
we have the creation of organized crime, thanks to this very simple solution to a very complex
problem, have a problem with just regular old immigrants, you build a wall, and the wall becomes
this single-minded solution that we talk about, again it's not that this solution in a series of
solutions was a bad idea, but the fact that we put so much money, so much attention into a wall, that
clearly now you can drive over, which this is a real photo, which is frightening, and many estimates
show that for every illegal immigrant apprehended we've spent up to $40,000, so when we take a very
simple-minded approach to a problem, we are often solving the problem in a very, very costly way, and this
week, this is the big conversation that's happening right now, Ebola is a very scary, very real problem, but
the solution to close the borders is not one that will come with unintended consequences, people will run out
of those countries, it'll be harder to track those countries, it'll be harder to bring in the resources
necessary, so it sounds on paper like something we can all get behind, because I would like not to have
Ebola, but that does not necessarily mean that we can't respect the complexity of the problem itself, and this
is an amazing selfie, by the way. So again, when we're confronted with complex problems, we have to demand
complex problem solving from ourselves, but also for the people that we elect to solve problems on our
behalf, and we all have the capacity to think differently about this, and I am by no means a complexity
science researcher, which actually exists in the fields of science, most have been around for hundreds, if not
thousands of years, complexity science was created in the 80s, so with hair band also came this idea of how do
you approach problems that seem messier than other problems, which inhibit all those things that I talked about
before, and really my perception of the world changed on September 15, 2008, and it changed because of
the conversation I had with my father, photobombing me here in a national park, and the conversation that we
had was centered around Lehman Brothers collapse, so this was the fourth largest investment bank in the
world, and my father runs a small construction company in Houston, Texas, where I'm from, and we were on the
phone, and I asked my father, what do you think about this? He's had his own company for 35 years, he's
weathered all manners of ups and downs, economic booms and busts, and he said, it's fine what they're doing on
Wall Street, they can make fools of themselves, I've known my banker for decades, I trust that they wouldn't
have made these bets, and we're fine, and what we've come to learn is that's what most people thought, but at
the same time, those risky bets that were being made on Wall Street cascaded not just in our economy, but globally,
and so we can look at some complexity science researchers, this is some work that was done right after the
recession by Cornell University, and when it shows us from 2003 to 2008, the economy became network to
fail, we had banks who were making risky bets, but also lending money to almost every sector of the economy,
and so one small speculative bubble and one economy then escalated to the rest of the world, and the fallout on it
has been traumatic, it's been traumatic not just for institutions, but for people, so my father, for the last 35
years, has worked for himself, it's been a very small business, but for the first time in his adult life, he's now
working for someone else, and he can't sustain his business, and my wife's father, the exact same story in the
housing market, he had a business for 20 years, and he no longer has that business, because we fundamentally don't
understand how connected the world is now, and so the script, I think, in the world that we live in today, is one
connectedness, we live in a more connected world, and that connectedness creates complexity, and all complexity
is, it's a scary word, but all it means is a measure of relationships, and those relationships, because there are
no single causes anymore to these big global problems, or to these big messy problems, those connections create
uncertainty, it's so much harder now to predict the future, we no longer plan 18 months out, 6 years out, when we
work with organizations, we plan 6 months out, we plan in a very adaptive way, but that level of uncertainty,
unfortunately, can create chaos, the chaos that we're seeing with the Bola Scare, the chaos that we saw falling out
of the Arab Spring, for ISIS, sort of coming and coalescing and turning into a new Al-Qaeda cell that we've never
even heard of until two weeks ago when we started bombing it, this sort of chaos reaction to things that are
uncertain is where the real damage in our economy, but also in our lives occurs, and Yogi Berra always says it
best, which is it's deja vu all over again, because in 2011, a European complexity science conglomerate actually
started to map the economy again to say what lessons have we learned from 2008, and what they actually found is there's
a super cluster, which is my favorite new term, of 147 organizations in the world that now control 40% of the
world's wealth, and what that means necessarily is that we have not learned those lessons, we are still too
networked to fail, and we aren't thinking about the degrees of connectedness in the world, and so I very much, I spend
most of my time working with large organizations, helping them prepare for a world that's more connected, and for
problems that are more complex, but this to me is the asteroid that's headed towards the earth right now, that none of
us are paying attention to, but we all as individuals can pay attention to, and so it's not just on regulators, not
just on our governments, just not just on our institutions, individuals first have to make this change, we have to learn to
embrace complex systems, and we also have to learn to disregard overly simplistic solutions, and I'll give you five easy
steps to get started, but really this is a lifelong transformation for me, which has taken years and years, and occupies most of
my time. The first is to question the borders of problems and solutions, when we're told that problems are very simple, or we're
told that solutions can be single-minded, we should challenge that, I think we've seen over and over again that when we don't
respect the complexity of a problem, that we undermine the impact that has on the world, and not just borders in terms of
geography, but borders in terms of time, one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite authors Kurt Vonnegut said, there
should have been a secretary of the future, we need people who are thinking long term, who are thinking beyond the simple-minded
short-term solutions that we often hear about. Also learn to network, so the industries that recovered fastest in 2008 was
banking, and you can come up with lots and lots of different ways to explain that, but the number one reason why banking
recovered so quickly is because they are an industry built on networking, they lend money, their livelihood is so dependent on other
organizations, and so my father's company was a very small company that wasn't very networked, his network was very small and
geographically confined, so we work with most of our clients to say how do we build not just a networked supply chain,
network distribution, but how do we build a networked business model, we see companies like Uber, Airbnb, Etsy who have built
these businesses that really live and thrive off a very complex network, and at the end of the day they're far more resilient to
impacts in the economy. And then not just to become more connected, but to understand the connections themselves, so in complexity
science we don't just look at how things are connected, we look at the forces of those connections and what they impart on one another,
just like how you sat down today, it's not as important to realize that you made that decision and concert with a lot of other
people, but those people imparted influence on you. And last we have to learn to celebrate complexity, again we can't be afraid
of this word, it's not the C word for the 21st century, it's the word we all need to understand, and it's a word that really is the
literacy of the 21st century, and if my words have failed me, then I'll leave you with Im Scott Peck, abandon the urge to simplify
everything, and begin to think multi-dimensionally, to glory in the mystery and paradoxes of life, not to be dismayed by the multitude of causes
and consequences that are inherent in each experience, but to appreciate that life is complex. Thank you.
