Look, the eye color is often given by only a couple pixels, and we get a really crisp and believable output.
What's more, it can even deal with glasses too.
Now, of course, this is not the first paper on super resolution.
What's more, it is not even the hundredth paper performing super resolution.
So, comparing to previous works is vital here.
We will compare this to previous methods in two different ways.
One, of course, we are going to look.
Previous regression-based methods perform reasonably well.
However, if we take a closer look, we see that the images are a little blurry.
High frequency details are missing.
And now, let's see if the new method can do any better.
Well, this looks great, but we are fellow scalers here.
We know that we can only evaluate this result in the presence of the true image.
Now, let's see.
Nice!
We would have to zoom in real close to find out that the two images are not the same.
Fantastic!
Now, while we are looking at these very convincing high resolution outputs,
please note that we are only really scratching the surface here.
The heart and soul of a good super resolution paper is proper evaluation and user studies,
and the paper contains a ton more details on that.
For instance, this part of the study shows how likely people were to confuse the synthesized images with real ones.
Previous methods, especially polls, which is an amazing technique, reached about 33%,
which means that most of the time, people found out the trick, but...
WOW!
Look here!
The new method is almost at the 50% mark.
This is the very first time that I see a super resolution technique,
where people can barely tell that these images are synthetic.
We are getting one step closer to this technique getting deployed in real world products.
It could improve the quality of your zoom meetings, video games, online images, and much, much more.
Now, note that not even this one is perfect.
Look, as we increase the resolution of the output of the image,
the users are more likely to find out that these are synthetic images.
But still, for now, this is an amazingly forward in just one paper.
I can hardly believe that we can take this image and make it into this image using a learning-based method.
What a time to be alive!
