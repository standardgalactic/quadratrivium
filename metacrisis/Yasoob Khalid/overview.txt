Checking Yasoob Khalid/Top 14 MOST famous Python libraries & frameworks.txt
1. **Requests Library**: An essential HTTP library for making all kinds of HTTP requests in Python, with support for sessions, connections pools, and more. It's user-friendly and robust enough to handle various web request scenarios. Kenneth Wrights created it.

2. **TQDM**: A library that adds a progress bar to loops in Python, making it easy to track the progress of time-consuming tasks, such as training machine learning models or processing large datasets.

3. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data, providing tools for natural language processing and computational linguistics.

4. **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, developed by Google engineer Fran√ßois Chollet, that allows for rapid prototyping of deep learning models, supporting both convolutional and recurrent networks, and running on CPU/GPU. Keras can be used as a front-end to TensorFlow.

5. **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python that provides a high-level interface for database access, offering capabilities like schema migration, query building, and database mapping from Python objects.

6. **Django**: A high-level web development framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design, with an included ORM, user authentication/authorization, and admin interface. It's used by many well-known companies and websites.

7. **Twisted**: An asynchronous networking engine written in Python, which includes implementation for various protocols like HTTP, SMTP, SSH, and Telnet, making it suitable for scalable applications that require high performance on network I/O operations.

8. **Kiwi (Python for Android/iOS)**: A toolkit for rapid development of cross-platform GUI applications using Python, which allows developers to create apps for both Android and iOS platforms without deep knowledge of native app development.

9. **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python, widely used in scientific and data visualization communities.

10. **Python GUI Libraries (e.g., PyQt, PySide, WXPython, TKinter)**: Various libraries that provide graphical user interfaces for desktop applications. They allow developers to create standalone programs with windows, buttons, and other UI elements.

11. **TensorFlow/Keras**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team, with Keras being a high-level API for building and training deep learning models on top of it. TensorFlow provides extensive tools and libraries for production and deployment in various environments.

12. **Other Mentions**: The video mentions that there are many other amazing Python libraries not covered in this list, and the speaker plans to cover more in future content. They also invite viewers to subscribe for updates on Python-related topics.
