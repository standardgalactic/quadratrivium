Daniel, thank you so much for coming, Tom. As always, great to see you. Daniel,
you and I have been friends for a while. I've learned a lot from you. Thanks for spending
some time with us here. At a time when many of us in the world were learning how to ride a bike,
you were studying complex systems, you were studying engineering, self-awareness, cognitive
science, philosophy. You are an extraordinary autodidact. When I was introduced to you, the person
introduced us said you are one of the brightest people in the world. I kind of wondered in the
time I've spent with you, I've realized that's probably certainly true if not an understatement.
You've done meaningful work on catastrophic risk scenarios and avoidance. That's really
where we began to get to know each other when I was working on warnings. You continue to focus in
a world spun out of control and the systems solutions needed to heal it. You call it long-term
civilization design, I think. You advise big, bold name technical leaders and technologists
and scientists. You're a hero of people in the world trying to make sense of an increasingly
nonsensical and increasingly dangerous globe. You're launching an initiative called the
Consilience Project, which I'm honored to be a small part of. I hope we can talk about that a bit
today. You spoke at the Flashpoints Forum conference last year. You and I jammed a lot of your wisdom
into a very short lunch session. That's the worst time of the day to speak. I still thank you for
doing that. I noticed in that talk at the Flashpoints Forum conversation when you were
speaking at lunch in the front row was a prime minister with whom I've worked for years. He's
a very serious man. Some people think of him as a very difficult man. He's clearly a technical
genius and I've never seen him so entrenched. I've never seen him so fascinated. I've never seen him
so amazed and I've never seen his face slightly puzzled and I saw all those things on his face
when you were speaking at our conference last year. That's often how I feel when we get the
chance to talk. I hope to bring some of that wisdom to our listeners today, many of whom
will meet you for the first time through this show. I also hope that we can get into a conversation
about your complex thoughts on how to fix our big minds in our world and then I'd love to be able
to get you and Tom to spend some time comparing and contrasting his deep thinking, his big successes,
trying to heal our hearts. I think it's going to be a powerful conversation between the two of you
as well. I'm going to be up all night because I know this conversation is going to fire me up.
I also, having to be prepared at 6 p.m., had a cup of coffee or I'm drinking a cup of coffee right
now at 6 or else I would be tremendously outgunned. I'll only be slightly outgunned with a cup of
coffee, I hope. So here's to this. Daniel, thanks so much for being with us and it's an honor.
A question to be here over, ridiculously over generous introduction, but
there's a lot of things I'm very curious about that I've been trying to sense make and I'm looking
forward to the conversation today. Let me ask you about the Elf in the Room. It's more than the
Elf in the Room. It's the thing on everyone's mind. It's the front of every newspaper and every news
feed, which is the coming election for President of the United States. You spent a lot of time thinking
about existential and catastrophic risks. Something, what is it? 35% of the voters right now believe
this election, maybe a quarter, is existential. They're extraordinarily concerned about the outcome
here. There's a lot of other people who are very concerned. There's almost no one who isn't quite
concerned about where this election is going. Just broadly, I wondered if you had any introductory
thoughts about does this election matter that much? What does this election mean and what kind of
things are you looking for as election unfolds and the new president sits in relation to your
concerns about sort of long-term civilization survival? Yeah, I'll say I have more questions
about it than very solid predictions, but a few things in terms of how I'm looking at it.
What are you looking for? What's interesting to you? What do you think the outcome is?
What are the stakes? I think this election is unique in modern history of having two things
both through the case, that a huge amount of the population on both sides anticipates the election
being stolen or rigged or somehow unfairly judged to have questions around the election integrity
so that no matter who ends up being considered to win, it will be considered an illegitimate win
by a huge percentage of the population, and that combined with a huge percent of the population on
both sides thinking it's existential. So the Trump camp, having many people that think if
that Trump is the only thing that stands between some kind of globalist set of agendas and the
debasing of national integrity of the US completely, and the anti-Trump camp that holds that Trump
getting in will be the end of the republic because he'll create a dynasty and like formally the end
of the republic. So what do we do in a situation where the chance of the election being contested
because of mail-in ballots and all kinds of things is very high? The Supreme Court, the
Electoral College, the Senate, whoever might come in to try and adjudicate that is also not really
understood or trusted by citizens widely. All of the journalistic incentive is for inflammation
and we end up getting a situation where the government is considered illegitimate with an
illegitimate president in an existential consequential way to coming up on half of the
citizenry no matter which way it goes. I think this is a huge issue and I think
RPSU and Ergo were looking at being able to predict social violence as it arose with the
riots coming out of the protests from COVID. We didn't know what would spark it. We knew there
were like a handful of things but we knew that when unemployment goes up that much, the social
violence possibility goes up pretty heavily. Well, we still have very high unemployment. We have
high eviction. We have increasing embodied polarization around racial issues, around left
right issues, around mask, no mask, COVID reality issues. And so now we're looking at this on top
of all of that and the actual kind of like insurgency and militia on both far right and far
left preparation. So I think we're moving, I think the election is going to be really problematic
and I would say for, or it very easily can be. I would say if there's a period of time where
it is contested and the US doesn't have a clear executive branch, what the rest of the world
does probably not towards the US directly but as far as power grabs internationally for
geopolitical influences, also a very big question, not just what happens socially, domestically.
One of the pieces of history I would say is for people that don't have a good
thinking of history, democracies don't live very long historically. They typically die in less
than 300 years. We're at about 250 years on this one. No civilization or empire is
enduring forever. They all end up falling and there are certain characteristics that when we
look at the fall of previous empires and previous democracies that we can kind of find that generally
play out and we see those types of things playing out pretty well here. So for me, and we already
don't have something that's really like a republic. We don't have a government of foreign by the people
that are comprehensively educated or have an unbiased or the state where they know what's going
on and they're actively engaged in the functions of the state. We have a permanent political class
with a rotating door between the market that it's supposed to regulate and the regulators that
end up getting captured by it and basically narrative and info warfare having replaced news
and public education having been eroded. And so the question for me is, and then you also see that
like when you have term limits and we understand why we have term limits, it's very hard to do
long term planning for anyone who has an incentive to have things that will pay off within the time
of their term limit. When you have massive left-right polarization for the two-party system,
you end up having so much of the energy go into the coordination cost of just getting
elected and trying to keep what everything you did going that the ability to coordinate well as
a nation is very low. So then you see over the last 20 years, China's ability with something
more like an embership to build high speed rail all around the world and infrastructure all around
the world when we still can't fix roads. And between that and Turkey and Venezuela and Brazil
and movements in India, we can see a more autocratic direction globally as one of the trends.
And we can also see why is because the idea of a democratic or participatory governance where
lots of people who see the world differently all work together is actually a ridiculous proposition.
Like it's a really hard thing to make that work well. And I would say that there is a level of
civilization fabric, social fabric that underlies that even being possible,
which is, you know, George Washington saying the number one aim of government should be the
comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government. And I think it was Franklin
who said, if I could have perfect government and broken news or perfect news and broken government,
I'd take the perfect news because when people really know what's going on, they can remake
government. If they don't know what's going on, they can't possibly make good decisions.
And if we think of or a public or a democracy as a participatory choice making process for
consequential choices that are kind of shared across us, we have to have participatory sense
making and high quality communication to be able to coordinate and enough like political
understanding to know that politics is how you sublimate warfare. Like how you make compromises
with people that think really differently than you and value different things where
a compromise is better than warfare. So you actually can't just ignore and villainize them.
You actually have to listen to and work with them. So these are a few thoughts related to the
position the US is in. And so what I see is that we are at a place where the US has decayed to a
level where either it just has decreasing relevance in the world moving forward or it needs a reboot.
And the reboot of a real kind of republic has to be bottom up. It has to actually be citizenry
that are getting comprehensively educated about how to make sense of the world rather than just
get captured by some tribalistic narrative warfare kind of narrative that have to get
much more media literate and that have to get have to have to start to have a value around
good faith understanding, not just pejorative strawman of the people that hold the other view
to be able to say how can we work together because those other people don't stop existing just
because I stopped listening. So the Prime Minister's face is now getting puzzled. So I want to I want
to break this into a small building blocks for everybody today. First I'm reminded of a quote
well not a quote H.R. McMaster and I know you familiar with him and you've seen our interview
with him makes the point in our interview in his book that the deterrence effect of an educated
populace is extraordinary and necessary and we don't have that. I just wanted to touch on that
quick thing but previously back on the election a lot of people think it's existential. A lot of
people think it's rigged. It's very likely to be contested probably over you know over 30% likely
which is a humongous number that it's going to be dramatically contested. You put that on top of
massive distrust in our government to start with 65% of people believe the economy is rigged and
they're probably right based on where they're sitting and you talk a lot about narrative warfare
replacing news. So let's start with that for a second. We had Tristan Harris on here who's saying
his praises about you and all the work you did with the social dilemma which I wasn't surprised
after having watched the movie that you know you had a lot of your fingerprints on it.
Let's talk about narrative warfare. What's it mean that narrative warfare is replacing news?
I would say there's cycles of this throughout history. You can read Sun Tzu and hear about
narrative and info warfare thousands of years ago right but how to control what people believe
is true and what they think both as a political and military strategies as old as civilization.
As far as in the current environment a few things that I would say are particularly
key and you probably covered this with Tristan well. The movement from broadcast news to largely
decentralize social media based uptake of the media environment is one of the most significant
factors in the contemporary environment because our governmental institutions were built in the
era of and around broadcast capability from the printing press which was broadcast through the
telegraph through the radio through the TV it was basically one to many type broadcasts with very
few people having access to the mechanisms of broadcast and everyone else receiving relatively
unified messages so of course they could be distorted right of course you could have some moguls
having more political or economic influence affecting the news so we're not saying it was at
all perfect but at least as far as social coherence goes everyone was seeing something
relatively similar when there was three news stations when you have a and to the degree
that it's wrong there's at least some accountability and there's not as much just complete overwhelm
and the overwhelm drives a kind of epistemic nihilism where people don't really even think they can
really make sense of it and then they're more just oriented to pick sides and defect towards
strongman leaders let's not skip over that that's a fascinating idea i haven't heard you mention before
because there's so much news coming out of so fast people get overwhelmed and feel like they
can't keep up though in fact they're just looking at you know a huge different many different facets
of similar news or fake news and and that becomes overwhelming to them and they feel sort of left
behind yeah i mean flooding problem you'll see interviews or polls where russians are asked
if they think putin lies to them in the news publicly and it's you know extremely high 70 90
percent say yes but then they also he has that high of an approval rating and in a situation where
they felt um their country was kind of drained after the wall by the way capitalism came in
nato's attacks on them whatever it was like having a strong man leader including having
to lie just existentially safer and i think in situations like current environment
people's ability to really make sense of climate change how long do we have how serious is it going
to be is like are we all just is my 401k even matter we all about to be completely screwed
and it seems like there are scientists who disagree on this and is china really close to
some kind of world domination plan or not it seems like there's very kind of different views on that
and hydroxychloroquine masks covid whatever right like disagreement on base reality across so many
things and the ability to say well let me look at all the science that really try to make sense
people don't have the time or the skill and so there is then just a place where they start to
resonate with both leaders and subgroups that are more like them and so epistemology gets replaced
by tribalism so it's similar to when under stress we revert to type you're saying when under an
overwhelming amount of information we still revert to type overwhelming amount of information and
dissonance of information and this is where fud becomes a strategy right so fear uncertainty
and doubt on purpose because then since people can't make sense of it then rhetoric works better
and then have the strong rhetoric and and people don't want to be outgrouped and they do want to
be part of an in group whose rhetoric appeals to the aesthetics of that in group you'll notice that
the way that the demo left-leaning a left-leaning politician will kind of stir up the crowd
doesn't appeal to people on the right like as an aesthetic they're like i don't care if you call
me racist right now and i'm not like saw climate change doesn't move me and whatever and similarly
the way that someone on the right talking that about national security or protecting our borders
whatever doesn't appeal to the people on the left so there's and it's it's a belief system but it's
all the way down to almost like a cultural aesthetic that the rhetoric can move people who
share a cultural aesthetic beyond the actual epistemology beyond them saying well what are
the actual national security risks what is my basis for knowing and how clear am i on that or
what are the actual you know border issues or climate change issues so yes i would say
epistemology being replaced by tribalism is one of the really huge issues and so then
now we we're talking about the movement to decentralize media so let me let me stop you
and i'm going to do this a little bit so we can we can keep people from losing you
so flooding becomes a strategy i think that's a fantastic insight there's no longer a shared
reality there's no longer a modern name Walter Cronkite social media and others are limbically
hijacking us they know precisely how to do it our monkey brains throughout the entire process are
being driven back to tribalism is there a threshold beyond which it's impossible to reel the public
back into a shared reality is there a point where people are so disillusioned and warped by
misinformation disinformation that they can no longer be reached by even our best efforts and
if so are we getting to a point where too many people in this country are are thereby lost
if we keep the things that are conditioning people and increasingly polarized directions in
place yes we get to a place where interventions would be very hard but like no matter how riled
up somebody is on on the left or the right about whatever like ready to take to the
street with guns about it all they have to do is just scroll instagram for a while folk where
political stuff isn't occurring but just social pictures are and engage in entertainment a little
bit and they'll mostly forget about it because there's such a flood of other kinds of stimuli
the reason why they don't forget about is because that media stimuli is continuing to come through
the instagram and the facebook repeat and the whatever it is pretty often if we could change the
media environment because i think basically it's there's a it's not just that it was in culture
and now it's the case especially given how little time most people spend in embodied space with each
other and how much social interaction has become virtualized through a screen and how much of it
is then the artifact of this of the social media platforms
so do i think that if we were able to change the kind of media environment that people were in
that we could actually and change where people are taking into their minds that we could change it
relatively reasonably yes i do now how to do that's quite a hard problem
i don't remember the word you used rp but when you think about sort of this the social media
limbic thing is because they got good at figuring out how to draw your attention right
but there's another part of that where it's almost like the marketplace
of algorithms that's just going to do what it's going to do right and i know they can control
it to a certain point but basically they're they're going to distract they're going to
they're going to make that limbic stuff get all limbic-y right because that's what they're learning
how to do right in what it with whatever method they may use and so okay so that's just one side
of the equation all i'm trying to say there is like it's almost like a benign evil that's going on
over there to a certain extent and you know there's also all kinds of you know incentive-based reasons
why they may not want to fix any of those things but then i even wonder to what extent they even
could but let's let's put that aside for one second on the other side of the equation
and i think we're all gonna marvel at this one day some of us already do this guy trump
is outrageous like this guy's the biggest media star in the history of the planet bar none i mean
that guy's name has showed up in more places in more parts of this world more times than any human
ever right it's just outrageous what a big kind of media star this is so what what he has is a certain
kind of charisma whatever you want to call it you use a different word i don't really care i don't
want anyone to think it's a compliment or not all i'm trying to say is like this guy puts on a show
like nobody we've ever seen and if you think of the last two presidents we've had we went from a
big time rock star superstar which was barack obama and that's when we were kind of moving
out of the old days and we came into whatever you call this guy the biggest circus performer in
the history of the world i don't know and you just imagine like imagine if trump was like
a little more regan-esque now i know those two things may not go together all i'm trying to say
is if he if he sought a more broad appeal of a certain kind like god imagine what he might do
now you may not have the capability of doing that kind of a thing anyway i'm getting verbose here
but the thing i wonder is in the end might our best hope be
charisma tied to reason like i just don't know what other things what other person what other
group other than maybe that because let's let one other thing i want to say before i stop
if you think about what joe biden is i mean you're talking about an old white guy like really old
like will be the oldest president of all time who is anyone really voting for joe biden i mean
really when it comes right down to it i understand lots and lots and lots of people are voting
against donald trump i get it they're voting for a certain democratic platform but in the end like
wow are we at an interesting time and at a minimum like just put yourself in let's say
biden wins and now it's august of 2021 what's going on is he really the charismatic leader that's
changing this world is that really what's going to happen or is it just going to be noise city
just all kinds of new kinds of noises that are coming from all these other weird places
based on this new reality that maybe biden for the first time will teach us just how wild it is
because this sort of calm older guy sitting at the middle of it and it's still not orderly
that's what i fear anyway i just said a lot yeah so what i kind of hear you saying is um
that the charisma of a person speaking is its own limbic hijack in addition wherever it is that
the algorithms do and then you have an interplay between those right between you have the limbic
hijack of what goes out on the media and then you have the limbic hijack of which of that is
specially selected on my news feed based on my interaction with it and obviously the news feed
can't limbically hijack me if it doesn't have content to put in there that has that effect
right so the you end up getting this reinforcement dynamic and you mentioned a benign evil so i'm
going to just address the social media thing for a minute and come back to the uh the the president
chrism a thing yes the social media algorithms whether we're talking about youtube's recommended
video algorithm or facebook's news feed algorithm when they drive political polarization or ideologic
entrenchment it's not their intention like there there is nobody there saying we want to make
you know antipa whatever um but in so far as they have to pick metrics to optimize and the
thing is just as powerful as it is yeah and time on site is a good metric to optimize for and because
of lots of reasons the advertising model is going to be relevant to how much time on site and how
many people are coming but even beyond just the pay and the advertising model it's their way of
sensing how much are people liking this thing right uh people's life is not that good spending
that much time on facebook or youtube their life would be better to get off and to the degree that
they're clear right that they're in their kind of executive function prefrontal cortex they would
check in quickly say i want to spend 15 minutes and then go about doing other things but if once
they've been scrolling for two hours that happened because they weren't in their executive function
right it happened because either they're fear of missing out or their desire for social cues
because there's lonely and there's lots of faces on there and largely photoshop faces or because of
their political outrage whatever it is but it's it's appealing to the things it would actually have
someone spend a lot of time that is not really well used time for them and so that drives addiction
because that's a limbic hijack right but it also drives things that scare me things that anger me
and um because if i see things that really scare me i'm not going to leave i'm going to feel like
i need to know this but then if there's a billion pieces of news on a topic and there's no way i
could ever take them all in what the youtube algorithm recommends for me or what the facebook
feed curates for me is the ones that based on my previous interactions the ones that i shared and
clicked on whatever are most likely to have me share and click on them so that means that it appeals
to bias and it appeals to emotionality so when you have a population where everyone's bias and
emotionality is getting doubled down on then you get increasing in-group tribalism and increasing
out-group antipathy right and it's very strong and people don't know it's happening because
let's say that i'm going down the youtube recommended videos or i'm going down the news feed i can
scroll down the news feed forever and keep getting more of the same type of stuff so it seems like
that's the whole world and of course because what's gonna appeal to me there regarding talking about
the other side is going to be versions of the other side to get me fired up i'm going to keep
getting pejorative strawman versions of the other side and reinforcing versions of my side
which means that good faith endeavor to seek to understand is being broken right now because
that's what's being selected for on the facebook algorithm and that's where people are spending
time on site then the news agencies themselves have more incentive to make more salacious headlines
and shorter things that appeal to shorter attention spans and which means that they
can't possibly have complex or nuanced views because the complex nuanced views someone doesn't
have an attention span for yeah you can't run good sense making which also means you can't run
democracy with shorter attention spans you just can't right it it requires a larger bit size to
be able to understand something well enough to know what a good choice is and so the addiction of
new stimuli new stimuli i've been reading for five full seconds and i haven't got a new stimuli
that leads to the shortened attention span is itself fundamentally breaking down of the possibility
of participatory governance and so you get this feedback cycle right between what the algorithms
that are the digital environment which were consuming information about the world and the
producers of the content what their incentive is that will actually get paid attention to
and then the conditioning of the population and so we could intervene on any of those three
error error oh and then also the incentive of the politicians right so if a politician does
more salacious stuff that is automatically easier for the news to pick up that's also going to be
useful and so what we see is a set of reinforcement dynamics so then you're asking could we make a
politician who is charismatic enough but where the charisma is bound to good thinking we could ask
could we make news that tries to bind affected limbic hijacks to good thinking you can ask could
we change the social media algorithms in such a way that are still sticky but walking people in
the right direction and then at the end of it you could say could we educate the populace
to be more aware of how much the world is seeking to hijack their attention and that there is
feel good about any of those i feel good about a strategy that's working on all of them simultaneously
and i feel particularly good about the last one that i'm mentioning right now would it would it
would it not be perhaps easier if it was a malignant thing like might we be able to solve
the problem more directly if it were more malignant that's the thing that scares me
is that the technium actually is take playing a role here that that's just frightening to a
certain extent i mean i want to believe don't don't get me wrong like i i i have a predisposition
towards optimism but i don't know like even the first one though like we're talking because we're
talking about a certain kind of charisma which i'll give you an example so today
i watched chris haze and and uh what's her name uh rachel madow just laughing so hard about the
jeffrey tubin thing and like doing this kind of bow thing together with each other on the news
and i looked at it and i'm immature so i'm not judging them as humans but i am judging our news
like they were having more fun with jeffrey tubin and masturbation than just about anything
they could have had in a long time and i looked at them like this is like the world we live in
right now like there's no way cronkite was doing that and there's something to that that by the way
from a business perspective apparently doesn't work very well because if it did there'd be people
doing it but from a cultural perspective it scares the hell out of me when you say would it be easier
if it was more malignant um the thing the the deepest underlying things that are driving the
problems in the world are not a clear bad guy it's not nazis um people want to focus on uh
a clear bad guy and so they actually over norm things to that but why political left right
polarization moved in the direction it has or why a facebook why tiktok became more sticky than
facebook did because of an incentive war that even if you change one platform there's other
platforms emerging um the the underlying dynamics are the are are kind of like an invisible hand
themselves and they're a bunch of hyperobjects hyperobjects uh is an important concept which is
we evolved to perceive things with our senses and to be able to
look at hear touch taste and ground to understand something to know how to respond to it because in
our evolutionary environment we were mostly responding to things like that were either direct
threats or direct opportunities that our senses could work with it's impossible to directly sense
climate change it's not something that you can sense i i can see snow melting somewhere but i
could always see snow melting i have to try to take statistics on snow melt year over year and ice
taps and things about co2 that i can't see that are invisible in the atmosphere so i can conceptualize
it but i can't sense it to have it feel viscerally real to me i can't sense the social media algorithms
i can't sense the the principles of narrative warfare or class dynamics or um any of those types
of things i can't sense arms races i can see there's a groan but i can't see all of the
drones and the arms races towards ai weapon that conceptualize it but it's very hard for us to
conceptualize a hyperobject emotionally as well as it is a real object particularly an agent
because the bad guy historically mostly looked like an agent that wanted to come attack us right
and so oh it's nazis it's terrorists it's republicans it's democrats it's you know whoever it is the
bad guy is great we're we're pretty good at that when we have problems that are hyperobjects that
are the result of collective behavioral dispositions right climate change is not the result of
nazis or communists or or republicans or democrats right it's the result of collective
behavioral dispositions it's very hard to make that the bad guy in a clear enough way that will
motivate different tribes that are against each other unifying against them and so the kind of
enemy hypothesis where people will orient to be more tribal and they'll only unify if they have
a shared enemy it's very hard to make the hyperobjects that really are the shared enemy of
everyone the felt shared enemy because evolutionary we're not that wired that way so it's much easier
to keep making each other enemies but when you keep making each other enemies where you have
increasing narrative weapons right the ability to put fake or at least spawn or conspiratorial
or whatever it is info out and spread it to billions of people and make it highly viral and
split test what makes it most viral when you have when you have also then decentralized real weapons
that are more catastrophic cyber weapons drone weapons whatever what happens when you keep running
conflict energy from of humans towards other humans with increasingly decentralized increasingly
catastrophic capability it good it goes bad right so we do have to figure out how to deal with that
thing let's get to that one second let me daniel let me try to i was thinking this morning about
can we channel the nationalist zeal that america has against china it is something that's actually
great for the growth of america like could we look at how china does long-range planning
and look at how they put their best and brightest into some of those long-range plans obviously
they have all sorts of other advantages we don't have so far as former government and use that as
a way to redesign aspects of america i asked that because i'm i'm i'm asked that in reflection
to what you guys are just describing about hyperobjects if can we use things like that can
we use things that stir us up as a people to motivate us to incentivize us towards positive
directions overall can we find things so punchline being how do we incentivize
people to pay attention to things that can't be sensed directly yeah so you have a couple
different answers the the only enduring and effective answer that i know is much deeper
and wider education so that's more people understand the hyperobjects well enough and
can actually make choices from executive function that they're not just needing an enemy hypothesis
that they viscerally feel outside of that any solution i can give where i'm saying okay here's
how i manipulate the populist that don't understand stuff there will always be a that's a that drives
armed races whenever i'm doing war you always get armed races you never get to create a weapon and
not have a counter weapon from some group they want something else where they learn what was
effective about your weapon iterate on it so it's kind of like and i think this is something that
i've seen the political left recently in the us be particularly not cognizant of so if you
use shame as a social tool called people racist and islamic phobics and transphobics and whatever
to kind of like um shame them into a particular kind of uh political view or political correctness
that shame as a weapon as a narrative weapon creates a counter weapon and the counter weapon is
not giving a shit about those titles at all that's one of the counter weapons right so at a
certain point it's like oh that just stops working call me a racist fuck off and um another one of
the counter weapons is if okay let's let's have to the degree that academia and left establishment
started to have some alignment more than we can say was fully unbiasedly warranted and so there was a
people on the political right feeling like there were academic arguments they couldn't argue
that didn't feel true to them or that didn't feel like it took their concerns to mind well so this
would be things like social sciences critical race theory whatever it is or some of the
environmental sciences that didn't that addressed and even whether they're wrong or whether they're
just partial but all didn't also partially address the things that other people had lived experience
of anti-intellectualism becomes a counter weapon to weaponize academia where they're like i trust
my gut and i'm i'm sticking with the bible or i trust my gut and i'm sticking with trump or whatever
it is um so it's always important to think about if we're not talking about really educating people
where they can think well about what's true and we're talking about well okay they're they're too
dumb to do that so how do we effectively use some kind of narrative control mechanisms on them other
groups will also be doing that to the degree that that's effective and then you have to deal with
the escalation the arms race of narrative warfare with exponentiating narrative warfare technology
now start to see what happens when they're putting on the vr headsets and being in these environments
and on and on some of so we've done a pretty good job probably describing some of the challenge set
in which we find ourselves in this civilization in this brain inside this media environment
and when i jumped in before that last question you were beginning to talk about some of the
modern day risks or consequences so i'm i'm trying to show a chapter separation here for our listeners
of you know what what i think we were to sort or learned about before is part of how hard it is to
come to solutions being who we are and where we are but i'd love to hear a little more from you
about why it matters that we deal with solutions well now and one quote that i heard you say i thought
was was quite illuminating was we're running through a forest increasingly fast and increasingly
blind right so what are these trees we may run into what are the risks what are the higher
consequence challenges that are in front of us right now that we may not be aware of
i don't i don't know that it's terribly useful for most people to study existential and catastrophic
risk well if they don't feel like they have some agency connected being able to make things better
because it just can stress them out and sometimes even make them nihilistic where they don't engage
the agency they could have and i i'm going to interrupt you and i i did i tell you the story
about and there is he's walked in about my 11 year old then nine year old when i was writing
warnings and the chapter on on the the control function artificial intelligence and one of the
parents of one of his friends called me up and was like what are you teaching your kids at home
because you've terrified one of my children so i agree we uh evolution selected for all animals
including us for sensory mechanisms information processing to process that sense information
and then actuator output to act on it in a closed loop right um if i could sense something but i
couldn't make sense of it there'd be no evolutionary adaptive value to that and it wouldn't have been
selected for if i could make sense of it but i couldn't act on it or if i could act in a way
that wasn't informed by sensing the environment none of those would be adaptive so what's selected
for is the closed loop between those technologies kind of broken that loop open for humans where
i can sense things that i'm not directly sensing through the internet news i can hear what's happening
in dc or portland or bangladesh or whatever but i can't actually make sense of is that true is
it the whole truth what's going on because i'm getting very partial sensing and on things too
complex so my i can sense stuff but not make sense of it to the degree i feel like i can make sense
of something large-scale things like climate change or whatever i don't feel like i can act on
because i don't have the agency like what do i do about that and to the degree that i can that i am
acting on things i'm acting through largely decentralized distributed process i'm buying
something that had supply chains that took six continents and all kinds of activity to make
the thing happen so i'm having effects right my action is actually through supply chains having
a globalized effect but i can't sense it so i can't really make appropriate choices and as a
result as a result the the binding of sense making an agency is very broken and i want to
rebind those because if someone is hearing about problems that they feel like they can't do anything
about oftentimes there's just overwhelm and shut down let's go to entertainment or whatever it is
or sometimes even worse is something like nihilism sets it and so i can talk about what are some of
the catastrophic risks but the context i'm trying to set first is i think for most people
them being more aware of their local news what's really going on and how they can help out with the
animal shelter the pta the integrity of local governments the things where they feel like
they actually have some agency to do it they should invest more of their sense making in
places where they can do something about it because they'll actually then do positive things
and they will increase their sense of agency which will then allow them to start sensing
larger things and being able to take steps with it well i i sign up to that but at the same time you
and others and i to maybe some extent have to make sure we are really looking at these existential
risks as well and i think that's probably a pretty wise direction for this conversation where you're
going where we find ourselves with this challenge of incentivizing accurate information disincentivizing
false information i'm using your words can make a request i would like you guys just quickly just
name five i mean i'm sitting here like i wonder what the fuck these guys think is existential
because i got my list so i'm guessing your list is better than mine and there and others so just
give us five something to think about don't want to take too much right daniel you start with number
one so some people categorize it by like uh exponential technologies who's can't you're
doing two you have to do one i don't have a taxonomy that i would wait that way and so i was going to
do a meta comment on maybe you want to share your top five and then i will make some comments on that
i don't know my top five i would say i mean we kind of covered it pretty well but i would probably
start with the control function on superintelligence um i would then probably talk about and of course
this gets to your concept about about self-recursive technologies i would then get to um uh crisper
castinine and gene editing and then i would probably get to and obviously the use for that
in biological weapons um i think there's i mean i think there's a societal disruption
probably coming from sudden global uh sudden global sea level rise i don't think i put it
as high up at my list and i feel like i'm kind of missing something that we were talking about
earlier which is about just the dissolution of society it's not existential but so the
dissolution of society the end of pox americana the end of the ability for america to offer any
sort of goodness to global world order that the taking over that mantle by a country that
has shown great disregard for human rights which is china i i don't find that's obviously not
existential but i think that's a category risk so i don't know there's my quick shot so so what's
not on your list is war not for existential so yeah that's cool but by the way tom i think
that's a good one too by the way it's a good one too i think that i think the the risk of um global
nuclear winner from even a much smaller nuclear exchange than the one that we thought about in
the cold war like a north kray us exchange or an india pakistan exchange as described by dr allen
robach is a very serious risk as well and that's a gigadeth risk not an existential risk meaning
millions and billions of people would die but perhaps not the end of civilization
but cheery so yeah if we define existential as the end of all sapiens and there's even worse
forms of the end of all mammals or all hydrocarbon life on earth or something like that um there are
not that many scenarios that take us there uh and but if we talk about catastrophic risk of losing
the improvements of quality of life that have been happening and losing a huge amount of the
collective knowledge and wisdom and industrial capacity and like that as well as a tremendous
amount of life there's quite a lot more scenarios where that happens um and i know rp you've had
nick bostrom come speak in group before everybody should study boscow's work if they want to have
a good insight into existential risk um reading uval harari's second book yep global catastrophic risks
is a good slightly easier intro to the topic um so i'll talk about catastrophic
non existential risk that i'm particularly more concerned by is something that involves
cascades between a bunch of different categories where none of them on their own if you're just
modeling if i'm just modeling nuclear risk or just modeling climate change or just poverty by itself
i don't get this but if i start to look at climate change not as something that makes a
venusified uninhabitable planet but something that makes increasing droughts that destroy crops and
going along with decreasing groundwater start to create massive unlivable areas in india and
vangladesh and various places like that that lead to human migration and very large human
migration that then leads to resource pressures and resource wars that then lead to war escalation
on existing political fault lines that can then lead to increasing participation on multiple
sides of that and more scaled war that can lead to breakdowns of critical infrastructure and
supply chains now you nationalist government structures so you know i think that uh you know
like with with covid and covid was just a big enough catastrophe to start setting off a bunch of
the systemic fragilities um i'll just i'll share one way of thinking about this the idea of human
induced real catastrophic risk wasn't even a reasonable idea until world war two in the bomb
because we didn't have technology big enough to mess everything up we just weren't that powerful
and then and so the major empires always warred throughout all of history like we don't have
any real knowledge of how to be at peace with each other um historically for very long periods of
time only for relatively short periods and so now all of a sudden with the nuclear bomb and the
consequence of it the major empires aren't allowed to war with each other anymore and so we got this
Bretton Woods global globalization world that said okay let's be so economically interdependent
on each other that it is and focus on massive GDP growth for the whole world that everyone gets to
be part of a positive sum game and we don't need to kill each other over who gets the scarce resource
because it's not zero sum people growing total GDP through globalization extraction so fast and
we're so dependent on each other bombing each other's a bad idea and that gave us a relatively
long period of at least the major empires not actually doing kinetic war they did cold war
and they did proxy war and there was an insurgency wars and i would say that that world that Bretton
Woods set of agreements is largely broken down and is in final stages of breaking down and what
replaces it is a really big question here but since then we went from you know call it two superpowers
with nukes to a lot more countries with nukes but also a lot more total types of catastrophe weapons
as we're talking about cyber weapons can be catastrophe weapons now by taking out infrastructure
and drone weapons are easy and unlike nukes that take nation state level capacity because
uranium enrichment is hard drone weapons don't take nation state level so non-state actors can
have them which means you can't do mutually assured destruction so mutually assured destruction
only worked when you had two superpowers one catastrophe weapon now you've got dozens of
catastrophe weapons and many dozens of actors that haven't and you can't keep up the same gdp
globalization growth because we're hitting limits of growth in terms of fundamental resources and
you know biosphere issues okay so now what do we do here so the globalization that that Bretton
Woods world caused also caused a lot of fragility because what it meant was the world was so
interconnected that if things broke down in one area you could start getting cascading breakdowns
because of supply chains and so the world got to see oh wow we're very dependent on China for
production of lots of things so what happens if a breakdown occurs in China right so one of the
things that I saw covid did and covid is nowhere near as bad as the pandemics that could happen
following in terms of virality or lethality so it was kind of like just bad enough to show us
how much we're not prepared for catastrophic risk pandemics or anything um which hopefully we take
the lesson of right now we have not yet we have not started to increase effective global coordination
towards this which is why sense making this is critical but um okay so covid's an issue so
we're going to shut down travel to stop the movement of the virus well in doing that we
also shut down critical supply chains that included things like fertilizers and pesticides that were
necessary for the way that agriculture works in many areas of the world to increase food insecurity
and increase poverty type dynamics and this is what I mean by the way we solve problems causes
additional or worse problems we think too myopically if we're trying to solve this but not what will
the unintended consequence of this in a very very connected and increasingly fragile world be so
the food insecurity in Nigeria of 26 million people who were food insecure who are now way
more food insecure which means Boko Haram rises and things like that got way worse and in India
we've got a few hundred million people in relatively serious food insecurity on top of climate change
already making hotter drier summers and an erosion of groundwater so now in the next few summers where
you can have massive die off of crop as a result of the heat so then you know when it's 52 Celsius
in the heat waves and there's no food and water people don't die peacefully does that work over
resource cleave along muslim hindu lines if it does does it become an india pakistan war like
this is where you start getting to see the ability for just the normal stuff that is happening
to start to really cascade and it doesn't take a big thing to turn into a big thing it can take a
little thing and the set of cascades in a very fragile environment to turn into a very big thing
yeah the um the um two quick thoughts so one is not to disagree with anything you said because I
agree with that entirely and this might seem flippant but I do have this thought that if
cv19 was a little more lethal or killed younger people we would have taken it more seriously and
it would have ultimately killed less people but your point about how it's kind of laid bare the
fragility of our infrastructure the just in time world we live in is absolutely real and to put a
very harsh point on that the world food program says it was actually a few months ago they said it
I think things are getting worse that 265 million people may starve in the next uh 24 months or less
because of the disruption caused by this you know relatively mild disease you know put differently
what's fascinating about this disease is that it's individually not that lethal but in a community
in a national level it's quite destructive um so I just wanted to have this for a minute
that's a quarter of a billion people right that was half of the entire population of the world
at the beginning of the industrial revolution like just to just have a sense of scale there
and then typically people don't just die peacefully if they see that other people have resources
and so then the question is can insurgencies that don't have comparable weapons cause problems
and I think we're all very clear now yes they definitely can and and and they can without
really good drones and crisper bioweapons but they especially can with those emerging as technologies
and so this is also where we get into a place of there are no really good security solutions for
anyone that aren't good security solutions for everyone in a world where you have so much systemic
interconnectedness and so much fragility and decentralized catastrophe capability so anyone's
investment in their own security requires more investment in security writ large and boom
that's when you get this idea of you have to redesign civilization right if you don't then
you have a whole series of of processes where you're making the castle walls higher and then
the trade buchet gets bigger and higher and bigger and higher and bigger and off you go into a uh
you know a contentious framework and a competitive framework that drives us into the spiral which
we find ourselves the um by the way I value that those risk outlines those for me because that
actually got me to where you are right now in a way that's helpful so thank you but what's what's
important about that um is back to this idea about hyper hyper objects is a part of the way people
different audiences reflect on different things and respond to different things and Daniel was
making the point about democratic audiences moved by things different than jp audience
national security audience my audience is moved towards the concept of climate change when you
begin to talk about radicalization migration hyper nationalization and all these things that
happen and you can tell the story of the migration from levant into europe and how you this literally
happened the last two years you know so we see the very poor stories of the children drowning on the
on the banks of the med and then you see the governments of these countries taking in large
numbers of migrants and the structure and face of these countries changing becoming
nor nationalist in some instances because of that process and so we've actually gone through this
loop already this isn't a future looking crazy dystopian science fiction novel it's germany
you know two years ago it's sweden last summer it's like literally happened uh hunger you mean
so as examples where you have more of the hyper nationalist election um so it seems very theoretical
and there's a lot of crazy words flying around that a lot of people are going to have to watch
this twice to get um but we're living it i think that the destruction of the amazon is a very real
us national security threat and this is not in most people's awareness and so it ends up being
this kind of leftist environmental issue or whatever uh but when you understand the hydrological
pump of the amazon amazon is very big the water that is transpiring up through the trees that is
then raining down on the trees keeping it a rainforest it's keeping it so lush and growing so fast
that's the hydrological pump that water pump but it's pumping up excess water that then becomes
north american rainfall a very significant percentage of total north american rainfall
and so just like climate change has a point at which there's a positive feedback loop meaning
with albedo effect in particular right if the snow being white is reflecting sunlight less
no cover reflects less sunlight eats faster and you get this kind of runway effect the similar
thing with the amazon is that it's postulated at a certain point you get enough loss of tree cover
that you get decreased rainfall on the rainforest creating increased susceptibility to fires and
whatever and you you actually get a break of the hydrological pump and groups like noa and nasa
and other ones are modeling when that happens and there are forecasts anywhere from like a year
from now to 20 years from now but like none are very long based on current rates of destruction
of the amazon obviously you could just mess up the headwaters of the amazon and ecuador and mess
the whole thing up so it doesn't it's not just again based on total acreage of farming or mining
or whatever it's also based on criticality um but what would happen if that runaway break to the
hydrological pump occurred that dropped north american rainfall by 30 to 50 percent what that
does to agriculture into our aquifers it basically means that we have lost food security and domestic
kinds of uh independent capacity so i think that should be thought of as a national security
threat and the state department should pay attention to it so but here's a perfect example
of again i like your your inductionist idea to us of the hyper object here's an example of something
that is actually quite linear and gets the american farm and the voter boom um and a
unfortunately to some extent it's dependent on a belief in climate change and that whole science
which a whole group of american voters aren't going to buy although president a president
biden certainly does and interesting as you're saying this you might remember he mentioned the
amazon rainforest in his debate with trump which i thought was very odd um maybe this is why he
did i didn't think it was a really powerful thing for him to go for based on the voters he's trying
to mobilize right now probably wrong um but here's an example of something where like i get it i buy
it you you you you motivated me um i just kind of know with this system of government it ain't
gonna happen like that message is not going to get to the right people we're not going to
take behaviors that do that and you and i and some of our friends have talked about actually
relatively creative and not that expensive ways to get them to stop bringing another rainforest
right um so we live in a system daniel where that very clear negative causal loop uh is going
to continue because we don't know how to absorb it we live we have a complexity mismatch problem
obviously with our decision makers we have an acceleration of history with our technology you
you know etc and then we live in this media environment where we don't share facts so
so great work stating the problem set and it probably was worth getting into the actual
structural threat and my 11 year old left the room at that time so i'm not going to get a call
from some of his his friends parents although i'm sure i will for something else um so let's begin
to talk about if we can let's some solutions uh and and i have a whole series of questions i want
to get to but let's just let's open it up what do we do about it yeah anyway tiny part of the
problem statement on climate change just because it's going to be directly relevant to a solution
yeah of course i would say our sense making around climate change
is actually very problematic uh not just sense making the climate but sense making the related
issues and the political climate and the the memetic climate of how people are going to relate
to it so let's say that all of the scientists agreed on the climate change model which they
doubt right you actually have like call it the standard model which is ipcc but you have some
very serious scientists like lovelock who think it's much more severe than the ipcc's model and
hey jim hanson i mean he lays it out brilliantly and you've got very serious scientists who are
earnest who are not paid by oil companies like freeman dyson who think that it's less severe
because of how he calculates non-linear dynamics and so there's there is like some authentic
scientific inquiry around it but let's say that there was just total consensus of the thing that
we had to do there but the solution is bound up with the acceptance of the problem statement
and the way it's presented in the public sphere so the solution is going to be carbon taxes
that have to get agreed upon in some international order and then there's this idea that
that's going to slow gdp growth and uh so the us and whatever european countries agree to it
if there are other countries like say china or iran that don't agree to it then they have
marginal increase in gdp growth relative to us that they can continue to reinvest in silk road
military whatever it is that increases their geopolitical position with regard to the rest
of the world and so you'll see people rejecting climate change without ever really trying to
make sense of climate change because they think the consequence of the solution affects something
that they feel or care about more and this is where you can't try to think about climate change
without also thinking about the economy and geopolitics right so just to be explicit on
what you're talking about this is probably a rational response from climate change denier
actually that's not wrong that's wrong a rational response from someone on the right to we have to
instill these solutions on climate change is very much along the lines of what you're saying it's
just too expensive and i now i'm going to find all sorts of excuses to deny the science because
what you're suggesting is expensive and by the way a lot of what you're describing goes counter to
my view of how government to work it's starting to sound pretty socialist i don't really like where
you're going and so this is where the adequate sense making has to be not just a problem but
the way the problem space interconnects because otherwise we'll come up with a solution that
solves that problem externalizes harm somewhere else the people who are connected to where the
harm is externalized will be a mentally opposed it and the coordination cost is too high to do
anything so this is where there is a level of good faith discourse and the level of really good
problem understanding before presenting solutions because if we present a solution prematurely
it ends up being wrong because maybe even if it's right in that narrow domain it's wrong in other
domains and so this also requires the ability to process more complexity first because being
able to say well let's make sense of climate change with before we present a solution
well now it becomes easier if my acceptance of science around climate change doesn't automatically
mean that i'm also accepting a solution that i think harms something i care about i can just
get online with the sense making but then i'm like i also want you to get online with what we're
thinking about geopolitics with regard to china and economic growth and the problems of slowing
economic growth if we can make sense of those things together then we can start to say is there
a better solution set that addresses those things together okay so now we're okay good so we're
getting towards this idea of solution set i gotta tell you at this point fully aware of some of
these system dynamics fully aware of the challenge we have fully aware of who our decisions makers
are and who they're likely to be um i'm pessimistic so why don't we um let's start talking about how
to fix it is the conciliance project a good place to start or yeah i mean the conciliance
project is a project that we're working on right now and you know you and i have talked about in
this uh discussed ways that ergo can uh be in relationship and we're honored we're honored
to be a part of it i think it's a big bold ambitious idea and i and i want you and i want
tom and ida um you know we before we started this call we read a bunch of a little bit of the stuff
and we have some you know we have a bit of a view of what it is i want to hear more about it from you
and then i want us to engage you on on i want to see if you can turn my pessimism to optimism
and i doubt you can so i mean first i'll just say on that i
i don't want people to have an optimism bias when they're doing sense making
i want their sense making to be as full and clear as possible because otherwise they'll
come up with wrong solutions i want their optimism to only be kind of in the space of what it is
that engender someone to work on solutions that aren't obvious in the presence of very hard problems
right it's not optimistic about a false solution set it's optimistic about the innovation possibly
that would have them work towards it so i think we're gonna agree about the significance and
difficulty and entrenchment of the problem set and then what we want to look at is what would
a sufficient solution be and before we have a sufficient solution in the same way that problems
can cascade and we start to get solution cascades where something that is not sufficient can give
rise to more things that start to converge towards a sufficient like the idea the conciliance project
is itself not sufficient at all but i do believe that it increases the likelihood of many other
positive things that start to converge towards sufficiency um and i'll i'll just say like
so the conciliance project has to do with how to really support a new kind of cultural
enlightening that scale we'll get into that but there are other approaches that other friends
and colleagues have that i think are also very valuable like you know i have some colleagues
and their focus is hey two to five thousand families own all the world's wealth
and they're increasingly more powerful than nation states in a lot of ways they don't
have land they have to protect they don't have constitutions that they're bound to
when nobody will use weapons of mass destruction their access to private military contractors
is functionally as big as nation state military capacities are and algorithmic trading of money
on money dynamics means we're not going to escape that so why focus on the population who are too
dumb and too controlled just focus on getting those families to rule better in the new emergent
feudalism that's inescapable that's a compelling argument that the new emergent feudalism that's
inescapable that's a particular model i'm not saying did i agree with it but i think there's a
lot of good thought and and validity to saying where there's a power law distribution of power
give a disproportionate amount of attention to the top of the power stack if you can influence it
concerns projects the exact opposite of that right now it's actually a a more kind of i want to add
one little thought to that for people who are paying attention to this the the top one percent of
the united states controls 60 of the wealth or something like that but more critically
the bottom 20 of america has a negative amount of wealth because they're in debt the bottom
50 only controls like six percent of the wealth like the distribution is extraordinary
and it's getting worse and worse and worse just to add some emphasis the point you may
before my first statistic was wrong i can look it up but conceptually i'm not sure people quite
realize what the wealth distribution looks like in this country and how different it was from the
80s and sorry go ahead and you know just to understand that if i have more capital and capital
equals optionality towards all other kinds of resources maximum liquidity and optionality i
can control private militaries i can control media i can influence politicians through campaign
budgets and lobbying and revolving door type dynamics and so to the degree that i need to
influence social dynamics i have the capacity um and then even though you know when you talk
about that distribution one percent is kind of misleading we're mostly talking about point
zero zero one percent that have real top-level financial capacity that i would say disproportionately
controls something like 90 plus percent of the way that the financial sector itself moves and i
got the stat here it's the bottom 50 of the united states controls tom what what percentage of the
us wealth do you think the bottom 50 of america owns and by the way daniel's point is the control
functions even higher but actually owns tom what do you think the bottom 50 of america
what percentage of the of the us wealth do you think they own i'm gonna go with one yeah it's
2.5 percent 2.5 and that basically is homes and 401ks this is not influencing right it's got it's
got no scalar opportunity exactly um and poor people are not good at hiding their wealth wealthier
people are better at hiding their wealth because it's quite useful often times to do so so the
numbers okay but just footnote i'm sorry to drive you off i think part of the problem we have today
by the way is that rich people and and certain celebrities or others are not hiding their wealth
and that they're they're invoking massive memetic response and if you go back to the 80s it was um
the lifestyle's rich and famous that woke a lot of people up to rich people right like there's all
these great stories of folks who grew up you know poor didn't quite realize they were poor until
Thanksgiving when the next door neighbor's cousin showed up from Chicago and he drove in a
Cadillac that was wealthy now the wealth of the of you know the wealth of the wealthy is is thrown
in our fate it's called keeping up with the Kardashians for a reason right because you can't
keep up with them and you're going to see their face day after day of their wealth and their
extravagance day after day sorry Daniel go ahead yes okay so where were we supposed to go before
we got into well we were getting towards solutions and and you were and you were talking about there's
a variety of other solutions and you were talking about one about about you know sort of reinforcing
a feudal state okay so and how the resilience project is exact opposite i believe that the long
term solutions look pretty meaningfully different than the social solutions humans have tried so
far like i don't think the very long term solutions are nation-state based i don't think they look
like a single type of fungible currency and primarily private property ownership or whatever
rule of law enforced by monopoly of violence in the same way i'm talking about many generations
from now i'm not going to get into that because that's that's hard what i will say is
nation-states and global markets and and you know rule of law at the level of states is going to be
what continues to primarily be how civilization operates for the next couple generations at least
and so we have to make that system meaningfully better how do we vector in the right direction
and so i'm going to be assuming our existing types of institutions and looking at how to
um correct some of the institutional decay that has occurred i think institutional decay is an
important concept because some people naively still run this idea of a continuous dialectic
of progress where things just get better and better and better um as a result of say technology
and accumulated learning and i think it's very clear to see with the loss the burning of
alexandria and the dark ages and the loss of the uh you know classical greek enlightenment
and whatever that there's actually periods of emergence of things getting better and then
getting worse in meaningful ways and cyclicality and and major empires and civilizations do fall
well the important thing to understand is when the roman empire fell or when the bizantine or
maya or aztec or egyptian empire fell they were not fully globalized civilizations they were still
local civilizations because of globalization if the kind of civilization stat meaning how it does
its modes of production falls now like every other one always has its scope of consequence
is unprecedented but failure is not unprecedented in fact there's no other precedent okay so coming
back to the idea of a liberal democracy for a moment i'm going to make this kind of us
centric and immediate is roughly you've got these kind of three sectors you've got this
market thing you've got this state thing and you've got this civil society thing that is not
market or state but is religions and community groups and other places where basically the
cultural values act so the rough idea and i'm not saying that this is adequate or true but the rough
kind of idea is uh okay the we're going to let the market do most of the modes of production
and most of the incentive and most of the innovation because it's good at it and we
don't want a central government that is too strong trying to do too much of that because
we found that this country getting away from excessive powers of government and we want
something that is more individual self-determining but we're not doing a pure laissez faire market
either we still make a state because we like the idea of rule of law because a market will
have a market for nasty things like slaves and organs and uh whatever uh and so things that we
like to call crime and be able to have a force to stop them and specifically it's recognized that
even if if at t equals zero i gave everyone an exact equal amount of money in enough period of
time we would get a power law distribution no matter what because some people are better at
making money with it and then having more money gives them more ability to make more money and so
the the power ends up being auto poetic and falling on power law distribution so then how
how do the few people up here who have the incentive and capacity to maintain their asymmetric power
not be excessively kind of inhumane to the rest of everybody else well everybody else pulls their
power into this thing called a government of foreign by the people a state that has monopoly
of violence it's going to have even more power than the most powerful economic actors have and it
can bind them with rule of law and rule of law is where our culture our values because the basis
of jurisprudence is ethics right the basis of ethics is some kind of value system or metaphysics
so we have some kind of value system that is the basis of jurisprudence the basis of rule of law
we bequeath a monopoly of violence to enforce rule of law to a state that had to be able to check
largely the predatory aspects of markets the primary kind of role of the state to enforce
rule of law is largely to keep people from doing things that they would otherwise have an incentive
to do people or corporations and where we agree that that's not a good thing to do so the idea is
that the purpose of the state is largely checking predatory aspects of markets while keeping functional
aspects of markets but that's only possible as long as the people are checking the state
because otherwise the representatives in the state will end up the market will seek to capture
those representatives the watchdog issue the classic libertarian critique and saying hey instead
of regulating against my interest regulate in my interest and you'll have better houses in the
hamptons and Swiss bank accounts and a reelection budget and whatever else and given that lobbyists
are paid for by somebody an election budgets have to come from somewhere and whatever and then
you start to get involved in door dynamics so the founding fathers knew this so they said
you know comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government adequate
for the state of government of foreign by the people people actively involved and it'll probably
break down and it'll break down for these reasons is the people won't stay actively involved because
it's too expensive and it's very easy to complain about government while not actively investing
hardly any of our life and trying to be involved in governance yeah and then we're basically de facto
consenting to be ruled and just complain so the idea is that if you want to prevent the kind of
decay of a republic into crony capitalism and eventually a kleptocracy and an autocracy
the basis of it has to be a comprehensively educated public who knows how to make sense of
the types of things that occur like market incentives like narrative and info warfare like
problems with political science etc and who are both comprehensively educated in knowing how to
make sense of stuff who know how to communicate dialectically with people who see stuff differently
because they know that's how you sublimate war and who have some access to current information
right we're good for the state so that they but where they still have the capacity to
parse it and sense make it themselves if you don't have that as a basis you do not have the
possibility for participatory governance there is no republic there's just an illusion of it while
it's actually some kind of oligarchy or something so the goal of consent project is the acknowledgments
that the two of the pillars of or like not even pillars prerequisites for democracy or a republic
or subsidiarity or participatory governance of any kind are an adequate public education that is
teaching people how to make sense of the world well enough that they can participate in governance
and a fourth estate that's giving people information about the current world that actually gives them
it is an information complex right that gives them the access to the information that they need to be
without distortion to be able to meaningfully do sense making on it so they can do choice making
and that what I would say is that both public education and news and a bunch of other things
have gone through institutional decay where they are no longer serving that function and the
pre-requisites or the antecedents of democracy don't exist and we have to basically reboot them
and I'm not trying to reboot them through a top-down process of how do we get government
to fix public education and get adequate civics and then whatever or legislate news but a bottom-up
process of how do we actually just start to educate people about the fact that right now
the right is pretty sure that the left news is fake news and lying the left things the
right's news is fake news and lying what they don't get is that all the news is fake news
and lying to various degrees but if we can show across the whole news landscape either fake facts
or if not fake facts at least cherry pick that yes this fact is true but these 10 other facts are
omitted that give you a very different sense and then it was contextualized and spun like this
so even if it's not full-on lying it's still misleading in the nature of sure contextual
nonsense right and so there's a kind of media literacy that people would need and you know
why drain the swamp is so effective is people feel corruption as a real thing and people
don't want to be manipulated but to the degree that someone saying they're manipulating you
so trust me that's an effective manipulation and so what we actually need is for people to
start trusting their own capacity for better sense making and have that trust be warranted
because they're actually getting better at sense making and not just individually but
collectively meaning I'm also getting better at not just trying to sense make based reality but try
to understand what do other people think and why do they think that so that because I know
that if I just try to ignore or cancel a big part of the population they don't stop existing
and acting they do stuff and if I do effective stuff they'll do effective counter stuff and
strategy means factoring counter response so if I want to do that effectively I'm going to be better
if I can actually understand them and see if there is some way to be able to work towards
better shared solutions so the consensus project is looking at can we actually reboot
the republic here can we reboot participatory governance in some way and even deeper than
that globally we're not really succeeding with the SDGs very well we are not we didn't do nuclear
disarmament sustainable development goals yeah any of the large global issues we're not doing
preventing the AI arms race or whatever we we we are mostly not doing a good job at global
problem solving and that's a coordination issue either we don't understand how to solve it or
what some people think a solution is other people actively are opposing or you get multi-polar
traps where there's things like arms race race to the bottom type scenarios to solve the coordination
choose requires some kind of shared choice making and the basis of that a shared sense making
communication and that and the basis that is not in state or market but in culture right a value
system around better sense making and better good faith dialogue right now those are not even highly
valued things they're not trained but they're not even very highly valued okay so within so
just to redefine here to help people kind of follow along so you've got government markets
and culture inside the concept of culture to prevent the decay of the system of government
in which we live into a cultocracy we need to have people who are capable of overseeing and
participating in government and right now we effectively don't that's only going to become
more of a problem as the world accelerates around us and more technology matters more
complexity matters and we have a complexity mismatch problem but actual participation and
governance is critical and only can happen with people who are aware or educated enough
to be able to have that role and you get back to the Thomas Jefferson FDR H. R. McMaster quotes
about an educated populace being not only critical for democracy but also a great deterrent to war
and when I so when I think about actual launching points one thing we've talked about is
and before corona one thing that gave me a sense of optimism was there was an increasing amount of
training or education for children in self-awareness meditation you kind of get into like
anti-bias training understanding the flaws of the wet computer between our ears right so when
people begin to understand that you know everything that is us is us drives us and and we are is a
hundred twenty thousand year old wet computer that's driven by biases and heuristics and pushes
this bag of meat around you can begin to get people to you know sort of get that user manual for
how we work who we are and then they can enter you know an education environment is there an
amount of self-awareness and bias training and you were saying sort of mere media awareness
that's a necessary prerequisite of education for an educated populace thereby relevant to
to help lead this country in an upward trajectory yeah so if we're if we're going to discuss kind
of like the anatomy of the problem space of what broke sense making and kind of civic fabric down
which then gives the categories of work that need to happen there's absolutely a bunch in the way of
decay in public education yeah we can kind of look at why there's a bunch of reasons
but let me let me just sort of lean you over towards and what what what does conciliants
project what are other ideas what are some solutions to I know you're you're being very responsible
about illustrating the problem set but looking at the clock and hoping to keep it at two hours
what are some solutions so the consensus project I mean basically we're trying to support what we
see as an emergent but not yet recognized cultural movement towards better sense making and better
dialogue as the fabric of society in which problem solving of any kinds of problems that we care about
can happen and let's just talk about that for a second so this is a movement that you know if you
think about what is that I like Pina Coladas that that's that silly song about the guy who meets the
girl in the dunes help me out here and there's there's a joke in there about you know if you
don't like yoga right so like in the 70s it was cool to not like yoga to make fun of people meditate
and we're we are certainly moving more towards you know a person who meditates or thinks about
self-awareness is no longer a standout freak but maybe there is a cultural movement towards
oh maybe self-awareness is a worthwhile thing maybe expanding our circles of empathy is a good
thing is that is that part of what you're talking about do you believe that's right do you believe
there's more of a possibility in this country to touch talk about these soft things that are
historically non-masculine and non-tastastro and driven and thereby lots of people ran away from them
I mean I really appreciated your conversation general McMaster where he was talking about empathy
because it didn't seem so often feminine it actually seemed directly relevant both to
preventing war and being successful at war and I think it was it's a it's an important frame
that empathy is not the thing that people who are unaware of conflict theory do and that makes you
do and that makes you kind of bad at conflict theory or or winning sun susan do you understand
the opponent and if you're going into battle you don't understand the point that's empathy right
there's a there's a way that to even be effective at war I have to understand my opponent but also
to be able to prevent war to be able to sublimate it through some kind of political compromise
I have to actually really get what the other people think and feel and want need to say what
are the right solutions here so I think empathy I mean and this is this is actually partly why
sociopaths oftentimes have higher cognitive empathy than the average person but lower embodied
empathy is that they're good at modeling someone else's theory of mind to game theoretically
beat them but without actually caring and so you can weaponize empathy and that's something
we have to be very careful about that's you know cult leaders are good at that cluster
B disorders are good at kind of a weaponized empathy but okay do you want me to stay on
the empathy mindfulness or come back to the what do I see as the critical parts of solutions I
think with that it's not purely cognitive right the development that we need in people is not purely
cognitive training to be able to understand existential risks and climate change and
and even social science and politics it's also if they move into outrage too quickly
if they move into overwhelm too quickly they're going to be useless
or problematic or make things worse so there's also an emotional intelligence and you know
you go back to looking at like the Greeks exploring this the stoic school and the
Aristotelian school and the Socratic school kind of were all parts of something that was more complete
together that weren't complete on their own right the Aristotelian school is can we actually
understand the formal logic and the kind of scientific thinking and natural philosophy to
make sense of base reality together the Socratic schools can we understand each other can we take
all of the various perspectives in the debate the stoic schools can we understand ourselves
enough that we don't get hijacked by our own emotions if we can understand base reality we
can understand each other and we can understand ourselves we can start to get somewhere and so
in terms of what is the necessary cultural enlightenment of this time it definitely requires
at least all three of those facets fair enough and talk a little bit more about how you're going
to achieve some or all of that with or I know you said it's not an entirely it's not an entire
solution set but talk about how Consilience Project is going to be valuable in that end
to that end yeah so if you don't mind two major kind of parts of it there's a kind of movement
coalescing part and a kind of education and content part the education and content part
is us working on developing something like better news and which is the assessment of base
reality so what are the most consequential things happening in the world and what do we know
what is an overview of the topic that is we can't say unbiased but we can say bias corrected
I'll explain that in a minute what do we have high certainty on about this topic what do we
have low certainty on why do we think it's consequential and what are the questions we're
asking and the indicators we're watching to see how this thing unfolds and even framing it that
way helps educate people how to be better sense makers for them to even notice in themselves
where do I have high confidence where do I have low confidence and what is my basis of confidence
that I just come to high confidence emotionally or because a leader that I like said it I didn't
look at the data myself right so even just starting to calibrate those things and then
to emphasize questions more than propositions and think about why something is consequential
that factors second and third order effects this is all giving people information but also
training them how to process information by the way that we're processing built into the presentation
but then if someone's like well why did you come to that certainty why would I trust you
we like don't trust us actually trust your own ability to make sense of things if you so here's
this weekly intelligence report of critical things going on but and we're trying to present it as
simply as possible but if you want to click under the hood you can see how we derived it what things
did we read what data sets did we look at how did we make sense of it how what epistemic models
did we apply and how did we calibrate confidence now it's kind of a better than but parallel to
a peer reviewed scientific study on what's actually going on there's some parallel to that there is
some parallel to that and so now somebody can look at it and one if they think we missed the
data set or mis-weighted something they can let us know and we will be continuously updating our
models and correcting our positions transparently right which is really important including doing
retrospectives of where we got things wrong or missed stuff which is another important thing
is a kind of epistemic humility for people to not be focused on being right but focused on
earnest inquiry which involves being very clear where you're wrong and but also they get to see
like wow if this if I didn't have this order to make sense of it for me if I went and looked at
all of these different types of news sources from different countries and different political
perspectives and I applied these models and I parsed it this way I could make better sense of
stuff too so right it's teaching people sense making and then also hopefully well okay that's
one part so basically that's the news the meta news is where we're not making sense of base reality
but we're making sense of the media landscape and helping people have a better kind of media literacy
and understanding of the narrative and info warfare so that they kind of get inoculated
against it was it I think one of the newspapers the Washington Post or something and as soon as
I mentioned any newspaper everyone's going to have their built-in biases about the biases of
that paper but one of them used to publish documents like the government released this
statement and then would have sort of journalists commenting on the document the way down it was
a pretty neat tool to help us under oh when they say this they're trying to you know fool you with
ink you know blah blah blah you know yeah so that kind of commentary right so what we're
seeking to do here is that this project is a non-profit it commits to have no profit stream it
won't put anything behind a paywall won't sell anybody's data won't have ads and so there's no
vested interest in that way the articles that are written are all written by the house like the
economists no journalists names are on them to both make it safer for them to say what's true
even if it's controversial and for people to have to deal with the content as the content rather
than have a kind of ad hominem or identity politics approach to it and the organization will shut
down after five years a non-profit it has a five-year time to live so that it's not a progressive
jobs program or career opportunity for anybody and it's not positioned to have a part of the power
landscape it's trying to catalyze something trying to catalyze something culturally
that will happen outside of it so any group that's trying to do good sense-making couldn't see us as
being in competition we only succeed long term we get a lot of other groups to succeed
and so I'll mention that in a moment the movement building part yeah that's a big question I have
the meta-news part is where we take some topic that is trending and highly polarized like masks or
hydroxychloroquine or lab origins of covid or whatever it is and or police violence as a
function of institutional racism in the US and we start by saying what is the landscape of
primary narrative sometimes there's just two narratives there's kind of a left and a right
narrative whatever sometimes there's like five narratives there's also like a strong libertarian
critique of both there's a conspiracy narrative whatever and of course there's a thousand sub variants
but they kind of cluster to some primary narrative structures or tropes so we do this thing in the
meta-news saying here's the narrative landscape of the things that are trending that a lot of people
believe sure and then we steal man each narrative which is the opposite of straw man which means we
try to make the strongest case for it possible because most people who aren't in a narrative
either don't know that the narrative exists or can only think that the people who believe it are just
kind of dumb and bad they don't have a compelling understanding of why anyone could believe that
thing because the version that their social media algorithm is curating is the one that will appeal
to outrage for them or whatever so we want to actually be able to help people understand
actually what is come what the narratives are and what's compelling about them this part of the
socratic process of do we understand each other then we want to convert those narratives to a bunch
of propositions and say what evidence is given to support these and then beyond that what evidence
can we find to either formally falsify or verify and if we can't falsify or verify can we at least
find things that make it more or less likely and how do we calibrate that so we're teaching people
first to assess a narrative landscape then to empathize with other people in the form of can I
try to really steal man their arguments which is also good faith dialogue right then analytic
propositional logic can I actually go through and because what'll oftentimes happen is like
this is true this is true therefore these eight propositions you already got me on these two
these have no data but the people just kind of believe it right and that that type of thing we
want to go through and be able to say because then what we'll also be able to show is in everyone's
narrative there's some true stuff there is some signal which is actually also very important to
realize then we can also see that across most of them there's some falsifiable like clearly
nonsense but also a lot of just cherry pit and spun stuff and then a lot of stuff that's pure
conjecture that we can either falsify nor verify that is basically just spin or whatever
would you should have low confidence then we step back and say what can we say with high
confidence about this topic after having looked at all this so we're not saying unbiased we're
saying we are taking each bias on purpose so we can bias correct right so now one of the things
that will happen is we'll also be able to show exemplars of each of the narrative like the top
news sources and show okay here's where they put spin on this thing here's where the nature of the
title is misleading but it's what you walk away with from what the actual science said or whatever
and here's where they cherry picked so people start looking for cherry picking they start
looking for spin all over the place so they're getting inoculated against the tools of mimetic
and narrative warfare and as a result tribalism and strong leader dynamics and whatever and starting
to actually think so they're so news meta-news then there's some other deeper education stuff
long foreign pieces about things going on in the world if you really want to understand
well what's going on in the china india border or 5g or whatever it is deeper things in there but
again where what we're doing is trying to teach people how to make sense of the world in the
process of making sense of something they care about now that is largely to start being a
strange attractor of people who are seeking better information and showing people what the
fourth estate could be to increase demand for higher quality things to try to create a race to
the top in the media environment rather than the race to the bottom of more salacious shorter etc
that has been there so then in the movement coalescing side we're working on putting together
innovation challenge okay so then just to locate people so what you just described is an extraordinarily
gorgeous orchestra of information that i would love to see i'm excited to be part of you know
as as you've just painted it that would be an unbelievably immense and beautiful gorgeous
thing to read to look at to to see to learn from now you would you say movement building
and and i know we're going to run out of time quickly you're can you describe i guess faster
than than yeah how do you get it sounds like an elite focus thing how do you get the rest of
the country to pay attention as we started building this and started reaching out to
advisors and people working in the space we started finding hundreds of really brilliant
projects to increase sense making a public dialogue we just either didn't recognize themselves as
part of a movement or needed help getting a certain kind of traction so there were some groups who
had built uh tech that could be made as a web browser plugin and fact check any site that you're
on news sites highlight things that look like facts and then identify data sources where you
could go check those facts and that should be a web browser plugin everybody has and it should be
continuously getting assessed and being made better there was another group based on lakehoff's work
that made a kind of semantic processor that could identify across new sources narrative framing and
show the frames that were being used show news organizations using the same frames and where
you could look at the same topic across different framings of it that should be a web browser
plugin that fucking everybody has so they can understand the principles of statistical cherry
picking data manipulation and narrative manipulation but then they can web browser plug it and see it
in real time and the stuff that they're scrolling on facebook when it pops up they can see those
things and so then that starts to create an incentive to find the ones that are less manipulated
which starts to create a race to the top of an orientation of the media to offer different
supply because the demand is changing through education but those types of projects were
like man we really want to help those projects succeed because some of them just were like a few
computer scientists working on their own they got to it but then they don't have the resources to
take it further or an academic institute a media lab got it somewhere but then it's not part of
their mandates to take it further so we're like we want to host innovation prizes we also saw people
who are doing really good jobs of like making cartoons to teach american history and civics
to high school kids but it hasn't scaled it was like being done in one town but that same thing
should scale all over the place what's that like the oatmeal i don't know the oatmeal but oh you
don't my god okay there we go you check it out when we're done you're gonna love it there are people
who are working on how to make peer review better or remove bias in journalism or bias in academic
science or get better at identifying state sponsored narrative warfare in the u.s from other
states and what we're saying is those are all parts of one issue that people haven't recognized as one
issue which is the breakdown of sense making writ large and i think by even bringing them
into one environment they start to get more self-awareness that these are all parts of one
thing and there is a cultural movement towards valuing sense making and dot and high quality
dialogue is the basis of our capacity to solve problems and then our ability to curate the
resources that are actually good and direct people to the resources that are good the ability to
create forums for the right kinds of interaction where the architectures and sense good sense
making and good faith dialogue and prizes that help both new projects emerge and that change the
nature of demand for existing projects and where the products we're making are really like prototyping
and open sourcing what it could be and encouraging anyone to rip it off like you want to take this
to your country and implement it or locality or whatever awesome so the goal is movement
catalyzing in the finite period of time and education and kind of the attractor basin
i love that i thought you were going to describe how to build a movement to get people to look at
the conciliants project you're talking about using the conciliants project to create a movement
on a couple of levels a movement towards driving people to higher quality journalism and movement
towards sort of an incubator of great tools help that happen etc that's that's fascinating
we're running out of time quickly so go ahead the underlying this is that there's a common
just like there's a commons of air or water that can easily fall prey to tragedy of the
commons dynamics there's an information and epistemic commons of the data the data we need
and the processing on that data we need to make sense of the world to decide what good solutions
for anything are and that information epistemic commons is not stewarded right it's gruesomely
and it's there's maximum incentive to manipulate that common i think that's a really important
concept you'll understand the information commons do tom i um i imagine you have a lot of thoughts
but i i don't want to put you in the spot but well i'll give you my um
i mean i love sort of walking down the road the way we walk down the road um
you know i have to admit selfishly i got a very powerful description of why i do what i do every
day i mean literally i i wouldn't have defined the problem the way you define the problem but
i'm talking about the same problem i wouldn't have defined the solution the way you define the
solution but that's what i do every day i mean literally i mean i guess an important difference
for us is like we're very focused on story and it's really about meaning shared you know we do
these gatherings all over the place and you know relatively unscientifically i can tell you that
90 of the people when they have that opportunity to share meaning they love each other i'm and i
use that word specifically i believe in that word sounds corny and loose but it's real and and
ultimately you're talking about a very similar kind of thing if i have a fear if i were going to
define my fear and i say fear because i want you to win um you know one is the bummer and i say
it's a bummer because i think i used to not believe this was the case is that even with creative
projects the winner works the hardest like the winner just busts his or her ass and read does it
5 000 times until it's good and and and that element of this idea i think is huge which is to say
there's going to be a steven spielberg of even what you do even if it's the way the gizmo looks
even if it's the way the interface works with the way the stare the story sort of winds its way in
or when you start to think about a movement it's critically an emotional thing you know and that
storytelling thing being so critical if i'm if there's something i i would be afraid of one of
them is i love the idea of the five-year thing i just don't know if that holds what i would hope
it would hold and then the second part is i'm not sure not for profit attracts the kind of killers
you need and i that may be a pessimistic cynical view but i think there are people who more and more
can hold both things i mean think about like a rock like great musicians think of the grateful dead
ironically they were capitalists now they weren't capitalists first but they didn't do it not for
profit there's a freedom there there's a risk there that i think creates something that's just
different this is my own philosophy i'm not i know i'm not a hundred percent right on this
but i think there's this interesting prop for profit not for profit thing that's hitting a new
place and that part makes me anxious but anyway but okay so those were my i spent time talking
about my fears and criticisms but like i'm talking about like the little part at the end
as opposed to everything i heard before and i love it and i and listen i think it's um
i think to be passionate again in this country about education because unfortunately it's been
about money you know we keep talking about money and we keep saying it's about debt and we keep
saying it's about higher ed my view is it's different ed higher i don't i don't even like
how you're gonna draw that line um and what's it really about like what what is is is learning
about a job is that really what it's about i know that's an important piece of the puzzle i wouldn't
i don't want to diminish that but what you're talking about is nobler i mean it just is and so
how do we celebrate that as a culture again because we don't celebrate it that much like the notion of
what a liberal arts education is or what it should be i say should what i what i think it could be
man i'm not sure we even jump up and down about that anymore i i don't know i don't hear it very often
i really like to use the word noble because it's um
there was a thing before democracy you know called the nobility as one governance system of some
people who uh for whatever reason were were developed or believed to intrinsically have
but largely developed the capacity for good judgment and uh you know decision making that
that involved nobility not just you know cognitive capacities and nobility moving
from being a class of people to being a distributed characteristic right is one of the core essences
of the democratic republic ideal and the idea of democracy as we all have a say that's participatory
governments we all have a say in what happens so there was this idea that the internet would
democratize access to information everybody could have access to information but when there's a billion
search results on anything access to information is utterly useless information processing is the
key and there is not a democratization of information processing you have groups that have access to
massive big data analysis and private and public intelligence and most everyone else who only has
access to narrative warfare um aimed at them and so if you want to have anything like a democracy
you actually have to have democratization of information processing what we're trying to do
is to be able to provide information that is the quality and nature of information the top level
institutional decision makers currently get to everyone because the idea of a decision maker is
an anti-democratic idea this is why it's a nonprofit is we will not put it behind a paywall
is because it it will be fully available with no manipulation will require an email or anything
for everybody now if people want to make for-profit news institutions as part of the movement awesome
we want people to make for-profit private intelligence companies and news organizations and whatever
as well as nonprofit ones but the stewarding group that is stewarding the information commons
must have no other master here in this particular way of doing it which is just our goal is to both
steward the information commons and to get that to become a recognized thing where it becomes
decentralized stewarded by lots of different groups and kind of as a cultural value and then
to not have any other reason to exist okay i mean that's fair but there's some master to that money
as well when people donate they can try and have strings attached and this is where great founder
hypothesis is important um apple post jobs isn't the same and musk industries post musk is probably
not going to be the same and so institutional decay oftentimes starts to occur when the founder that
was the for the founding group that was motivated by the thing is gone and they didn't pass on that
process that generator function of the wisdom well enough so you get generational decay
this project is not going to last long enough for that to matter here the generational decay
issue is a real issue but um as a founding team focused here we've had times where people
wanted to give money with strings attached we just told them to fuck themselves and
because we know what we're actually committed for yeah and the same is true with people who would
work in the organization if they can you know have this is why like also no name is associated is
there isn't there is there's actually the nobility part i like that there's actually a noble
imperative that is deeper than the capital imperative and it can be tapped into earnestly
now it's been manipulated so much you have a group of cynical a whole kind of cynical population
where all there was no experience of real virtue only virtue signaling but real virtue is actually
a thing and the ennoblement here is the idea that everyone could be possibly a meaningful
decision maker and contributor to society and they all we want them all to have access to the
best information anyone has access to there's an ennoblement of what we think about the value
of the mind and that this is a key thing not only do i not want to manipulate what someone
does who they vote for what they believe on something i want to give them better ability to make
sense of it i want to inoculate them against anyone being able to manipulate them effectively
moving forward right we want to help them increase their sovereignty and increase their communication
with other people so that collective intelligence individual collective intelligence is actually
a thing that's the actual thing that we believe in as a basis for change across lots of different
vectors well i mean i love the spirit of it and and i you know i and i mean this sincerely i mean
this very sincerely i don't fully understand that but i want to and i i respect what you're
saying i really do i'm not i'm not trying to be cute at all and part of it is because of my own
experience in the four versus not-for-profit realm and then just sort of the battle of ideas because
it just you know in essence it just becomes you know i've seen the most some of the most competitive
people i've ever seen in my life are people running not-for-profits who make you know decisions
based on personal foibles and things in ways that are just so destructive you know and then
there's also this just this kind of um there can be this sort of elitist view that permeates the
place based on other things and we don't need to talk about that right now but i'm saying this
because i care and i and i think these are reasonable and good considerations and we've
went over hundreds of them you know internally like possible strategic considerations of a very
good advisory group and we'll continue to and we'll pivot strategically to what serves best
as we really learn what serves best the clarity of what the actual mission and vision is is clear
is how do we actually support an increasing integrity in the information and epistemic
commons and how do we increase a shared cultural value towards not just group virtue signaling
and outrage and whatever but high quality sense making and high good faiths dialogue
as the prerequisites of our ability to do any of the problem solving that we really care about
and uh you know these the kind of conversations about these things uh
we'll be happy to have them on or offline at some point yeah i think there's also probably some
very powerful synergies here between tom your extraordinary ability to tell stories and to
grab people's attention without limbically hijacking them and and and what you're trying
to build here daniel um i uh i certainly got a whole lot more than i expected out of this
conversation it's going to be fascinating to see how we edit this if at all but um
and there's there's a question tons of questions that even get to you so maybe we can do it again
deal i want i want to talk about well there's a lot i want to talk about either on camera off
and and i let me say too that i would love to tell this story this story it was a great that was a
great treatment right there really it was a great treatment for film and you could tell this story
in about i'm making this up 19 minutes literally in a really useful form and i think it would just
i would love to hear your thoughts and get your help on telling the story it's a great great story
and i love i love you know the i mean in the in the world of information overload prioritization
just becomes so much more critical and if we can find that place which in the end will include
nobility will include it's going to it's going it it it well it's dead on arrival if it doesn't
have the energy to carry through and if you leave those pieces out of this puzzle i'm sorry man it's
just it's the way the world works these days it's like constantly tearing things apart and if it
doesn't have that integrity that holds it together you know other than you know to be a new addiction
because if you're making a new addiction you could probably ride that train for quite a while
but if you're trying to do something different it requires it has to carry some elements that are
really powerful i want to say one thing about addiction it's the last thing i'll say so in the
present you know we evolutionarily evolved to have high dopamine response to salt sugar and
fat because in our evolutionary environment there were many of those things we developed the ability
to make lots of those things combine them very effectively fast food obesity we know that thing
it's actually very hard if kids are being exposed to that to not go down that path you know especially
when they're young they don't have good um discipline develop whatever it is not true that in the
presence of those a hundred percent of everyone is obese there is a way to develop uh discipline and
good habits even in the presence of those things and to get positive feedback on health and vitality
rather than the positive feedback in an addiction direction and we see people who it's not addiction
but have a strong positive feedback loop around fitness and health and things like that it's not
enough of the population but there is a thing there where discipline is actually trained and
required to move in a direction other than the near term hit hypernormal stimuli direction
the same is true cognitively emotionally socially and um we can train people to have
discipline around not just taking the hypernormal stimuli hits and being able to do better sense
making and the importance of that and the people who do will do better they will understand the
world better navigate it better and the groups of them that can burst better will have more
collective intelligence will problem solve better and become a strained tractor and one of the thing
I'll mention is that hypernormal stimuli whether it's dating apps or porn or social media or fast
food what they were to the actual evolutionary thing hypernormal stimuli is something we're
way more susceptible to because we live in a hyponormal environment meaning the kinds of stimuli
that we evolved to have we're actually missing we're not we're not in a tribe of you know 50 to
150 people that we're interacting with socially very well gov or mate's work and other people in
attachment theory have shown that loneliness is the main predictor of addiction and we are not
physical as much and so there there are kinds of stimuli that are healthy evolutionary stimuli
that our world has made less of and that hyponormal environment makes us susceptible to
hypernormal which is why so many people who are checking their phone all the time go to a festival
with a bunch of friends and notice they aren't checking their phone at all because they're
actually actively engaged in something that is meaningful and rich and whatever so one of the
dynamics here will be the development of the awareness and the discipline then the effectiveness
of that that catches on one of the other dynamics will be social reinforcement dynamics of people
actually having more meaningful engagement with each other and the positive feedback Luke like
exercise has of epiphany a better understanding and then more capacity to navigate and sovereignty as
what the race to the top as opposed to race to the bottom is so Daniel Schmocktenberger is the
greatest outlier of the thesis of TMP of anyone I've ever met I'm not kidding I'm not kidding
like the what you were just talking about there's you know Judd Brewer and I have you know Judd
Brewer but he does a really nice job of outlining those practices and its relationship to mindfulness
for example you know our our thing is a lot about the battle against the isolation emergency
that's the term we use and and it carries with it so many other attributes that you talk about
I mean it's very interesting because it truly is and you were referring to it earlier RP
like it's a competitive advantage in modern times in ways that it just it's never been
like not like not on this level because if you live in a state of like that constant you know
micro anxiety those people who actually have some kind of clarity man are they get you know
what a gift that they have anyway this has been great I've enjoyed it I would be happy to come on
and do another talk at some another dialogue at some point
