I can't believe it's raining in Tumbridge Wells in February.
I mean, for the last 30 years, every February, it's rained an average of 12 days, but how
was I to know the likelihood of it happening today?
Bayesian statistics.
Historians believe, from the evidence they can find during Thomas Bayes' life, that he
was living as a lodger in this house between 1731 and 1761, when he first laid down the
foundations of this incredibly important area of mathematics.
I'm inclined to believe the conclusions of those historians.
Oh, and this new evidence I've just discovered has only increased my confidence that this
is where Bayes lived.
The problem is, I don't know much about Bayesian statistics.
I would need someone who uses it in their mathematical research to help me to explain
it, which is why I'm joined by Dr Hannah Frye.
Hello.
Wow, there you go.
I have a chance of finding me here.
It's the first time I've found you here, so I don't know.
Although now I've found a mathematician, I can update my belief that this is Bayes'
house.
Tips you over the threshold now.
I'm going to keep doing that all video.
So anyway, Bayesian stats.
Yes.
Well, what I thought we'd do is we'd go inside and I would show you how to recreate an experiment
that Bayes himself used to really clarify how he saw the world.
Let's do it.
Cool.
So, actually, during his life, during Thomas Bayes' life while he was living here, these
ideas weren't really out there.
It was only after his death that a family friend, Richard Price, was asked to go through all
of his papers, see if there was anything in there that was interesting, that he came across
this paper, which contained, I mean, I don't think it's too much to call it a revolutionary
idea.
But he didn't really ignore it previously.
Pretty much, yeah.
No one really knew about it until after he was dead.
So in this paper, there were a number of different thought experiments as well as a big, massive
idea and one of the thought experiments I'm going to redo with you, for which I need
a table, some balls, a clipboard, and someone to do some throwing.
I am now mildly nervous, but this is genuinely something that Bayes came up with.
Yeah.
It's going to be the original paper.
So here we are.
Right.
That's such a menacing throw.
Don't.
How good are you at throwing and catching up?
What?
Adequate.
Like, I understand the theory.
Yeah.
We're mathematicians.
You can't.
We're good at other things.
It's so true.
So true.
No, I can throw a ball.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
We'll see about that.
Behind you, behind you, there's a square table.
Yeah.
Okay.
What I want you to do, I want you to throw this over your shoulder.
Say, facing that way.
Right.
I want you to throw the lands on that table.
No.
No promises.
Go for it.
Go for it.
I'm glad you didn't make a promise.
It's okay.
I didn't do it again.
Is it still flying?
Or I haven't heard it land yet.
I don't know.
Give me that.
There you go.
Yeah.
Let that out.
We won't.
We won't.
I'm not going to hurry.
Okay.
Here we go.
Nice.
Okay.
I heard that land.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
So tell you what.
If we call the table, draw a square on your table.
Oh, okay.
So this is the top of the square table.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we'll say, let's say, we'll keep it in the same orientation as that.
So where do you reckon the bull's land is on that table?
I mean, my instinct would be to say the middle.
Right.
But I don't know.
Like, I heard it land.
But it could.
So I know it's not probably on the very edge.
No.
Because you fall off.
Okay.
It's very difficult to know.
I'll tell you what.
I'll make it a bit easier for you.
I'll give you a second ball.
Oh, okay.
Check this one on the table.
Right.
I'm going to tell you where this one lands in relation to the first.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
If I got hit the table, give me the ball again.
Try.
I am trying.
Okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, okay.
You know what?
I'll put it where it landed.
Hit the table.
Yeah.
Hit the table.
Hit the table.
Okay.
All right.
So this time.
Yeah.
I still only care about where you threw the first ball, the white ball.
Right.
That's what I want you to guess.
But this time, I can tell you that your second throw has landed north.
Oh.
And slightly west of your first throw.
Huh.
Which means the first throw is probably over here somewhere.
I mean, over here.
Yeah.
Oh.
So, shall I mark a guess?
Yeah.
Why not?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's mark a single guess on.
What did you reckon?
I'm going to put it like, I don't know why, but roughly thirds.
Yeah.
Maybe there.
Yeah.
There.
I think it's there.
Same sensible.
Same sensible.
Okay.
Tell you what.
I'll give you some more information.
Let's do that again.
Let's repeat that process.
Okay.
It's not.
The hit rate's not right.
I'm going to nail it this time.
Okay.
So, this time the orange ball has landed north and west.
Again.
Mmm.
Oh.
I feel like I should move my guess more southeast.
Oh, that's guess.
Actually, I'll subscript one.
Yeah.
And over here, there's guess two.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's repeat this.
Let's repeat this.
It's sort of, the pitch is becoming a bit clearer, though, isn't it?
As to where the ball will be.
A little.
Yeah.
I'm slightly more confident.
Okay.
Again, you clipped.
So, I mean, you're actually remarkably consistent.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Not what I expected.
I think I'd be quite a good randomness generator.
Try more random.
Okay.
So, once again, we're going for, that is north and...
Mmm.
Oh.
I'm going to say, actually, it's about in line east-west wise.
That's not good information.
I can't add half to each.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
So, it was north again.
Yeah.
I'm just going to, you know, I'm going to vote that...
I'm just going to vote east to kind of...
Okay.
I'm kind of balancing it up.
It's not very east.
So, I'm going to pop my new guess over here somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry, I don't think that's all right.
Okay.
All right, we'll carry on.
We'll carry on.
It's something.
We'll carry on.
There you go.
Ooh.
Okay.
All right.
So, that is...
It's north again.
Yep.
And west.
Wow.
Okay.
So, every time...
Have you been allowed?
...you're throwing this ball...
Well, as many as you like, really.
There's no limit.
But, I mean, every time that you're throwing this ball,
you're getting more and more information about where...
Sorry.
It's not on purpose, I swear.
Every time you're throwing the ball...
Yep.
...you're getting...
You're not even giving it to me this time.
No, say what you got to say, then give it to me.
So, every time you're throwing the ball...
Yep.
...you're getting more and more information...
Yep.
...about where your original throw was.
You're being able to...
You're able to update your belief in what's going on.
Okay.
All right.
So, this one...
It's northwest.
Ah.
You know, when you say update, because...
If I was being honest, that first one,
I was just, like, anywhere here.
Yep.
Now, I'm really feeling like I'm always getting north,
so it's got to be close to here.
And I'm mainly getting west with a tiny bit of east.
So, now I'm pretty confident it's, like, here.
Yeah.
Done.
Okay, all right.
Final guess, final guess.
Final guess is there.
After five is there.
Okay.
Do you want to have a look?
I do want to have a look.
Go on.
So, ready?
Oh, yeah, okay.
Okay.
Pretty good.
Not bad.
It's pretty good.
Oh, yeah.
The odds of me clipping this are tiny.
So, eventually I would have.
If I was being random, I would have got that finally.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
So, if you can think, if you had an infinite number of throws,
and you were able to throw them perfectly randomly,
then after enough time, you would have.
Exactly what that is.
You could zone in perfectly to where it is.
But it's given that you've only got a finite number of throws.
This gives you, I mean, you only had, what, five throws?
Five throws?
Five throws there.
And you're already owning in very, very quickly.
And I could feel myself getting more confident.
Like, it was really surreal.
I was like, yeah, no, it's definitely bearish.
There are also a few things that can be improved here, right?
Because each time you've made one single guess,
as to where the most likely place that you think
that the bull has landed.
In theory, you could go through, for every possible point
on this table, you go through and you could say
how likely you thought it was that the bull had landed
at that point, right?
You could almost have a surface, essentially,
as to where you think your original throw had landed.
And that would gradually become a peak,
or piled up in one spot.
And then, if you had an infinite number of throws,
it would be a single point.
Yeah.
The other thing that we haven't taken into account
is that the chances of it sort of landing perfectly on the edge.
And then the balancing right there, yeah.
Yeah.
And also, there probably was some distribution to your throws.
Do I throw normally?
No.
No.
Oh, really?
Oh, that's awkward.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You got other skills.
You got other skills.
Thanks.
Thanks for that.
We could take that into account as well,
which we haven't here.
Because factor in my incompetence.
Factor.
I don't think that's a strong word, Matt.
Strong word.
But this really, this was Bayesian's original idea.
It was that how can you find yourself in a situation of uncertainty?
What progress can you make by thinking through each new piece of evidence
and using it to tell you more about what you know?
This is Bayesian statistics.
This is Bayesian statistics.
But here's the thing, right?
This is different to how you might imagine that science works.
You think that science is about exact answers.
It's about precision.
Calculate.
Exactly, right?
Totally, you know, are completely sure about things.
Never in this situation will you be completely sure.
If you've only got a finite number of throws,
you're only ever going to be confident to a point.
And that's what this whole idea about Bayesian statistics is.
It's about being able to quantify your belief in something
rather than being absolutely certain.
Embrace uncertainty, but quantify it.
Exactly.
I like it.
That was fun, but I recall there being Bayes theorem and an equation.
Yeah.
Yeah, so the actual equation itself didn't come along till a bit later.
So Bayes really just talked about these ideas
of updating your belief in something.
The equation actually was Laplace.
Oh!
Bayes gets the credit for it.
Yeah, because I've always seen Bayes with the conditional...
I know, but it was actually...
The actual equation wasn't Bayes himself, it was someone else.
Just the concepts were Bayes.
Concepts were Bayes, yeah.
This is sort of like the initial...
sort of crystal of the idea.
What I find very interesting is Bayes is not about the actual equations
and the theory, it's just this kind of way of looking at things.
Yeah.
Which is why, because I've got friends who are cosmologists
and into finance, and they talk about Bayesian statistics
with an almost religious view,
but I can see now it is a philosophy on working things out.
Yeah, it totally is.
It's incredibly powerful.
If you can throw away the need to be certain,
and accept that certainty is impossible,
and that you're just interested in confidence and beliefs instead,
that's a really powerful thing.
Because ultimately, if you're measuring stuff in the real world,
it's not like being in lessons or lectures.
And this was a bit contrived.
It was a bit contrived.
And very probability.
Right, exactly.
I mean, if you take something like a driverless car, for instance,
you think, well, of course you know where that driverless car is.
Inside, the GPS is telling you exactly where it is.
But in reality, you have this uncertainty in the real world.
If you think about when you open maps on your phone,
that sort of blinking blue dot that gives you a rating.
I mean, here somewhere, yeah.
Yeah, there's uncertainty in the real world.
You can never measure everything precisely.
And that's why you need to have this Bayesian way of viewing things,
underlying absolutely everything before you can move forwards
and make decisions knowing that you're in the right place.
Knowing that you're never going to be absolutely sure of anything.
I like it.
I would describe myself as a Bayesist.
Bayesian.
Bayesian.
I think so.
I'm now converting to Bayesianism.
What were you before?
I was a certainist.
I don't know.
We'll go with that.
We'll go, sir.
What were you before?
I don't know.
Previous evidence.
So as well as thanks to Hannah for joining me for this video.
Thanks to people who own the house.
It turns out one of them is a mathematician.
They very kindly let us in.
Thanks to all the Patreon supporters who make these videos possible.
And we both have books.
We do.
So your book Hello World.
Yeah, out in paperback.
And my book Humble Pie is out in hardback.
The superior book format.
So we haven't got time to separately plug our books.
No.
So we're going to do it simultaneously.
I think so.
I think so.
So if you want to read more interesting stories about Bayesian statistics gone wrong,
please read Humble Pie.
It's really good.
It's a really good book.
I highly recommend.
Definitely.
I mean, Hannah's is okay.
Start here.
And then, no, read mine.
It's fine.
It's good.
Start high.
Read.
Read.
And bye.
