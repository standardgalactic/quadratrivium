The sun is an explosion so large that the only thing that stops it from eradicating the entire solar system is it's the sheer gravity that's massive.
It's super hot. It's super angry. It probably hates you. Who really knows? But, and that's hot fusion, right?
That's just, hey, I have the entire mass of the sun to crush a bunch of shit.
Cold fusion is, I'd like to be on planet Earth and I don't want to eradicate everything in a 400 kilometer circle.
Basically, I fold space-time on itself so that I fold the two things on top of themselves.
I let them go nump together, but the relative perspective of each of them, they're still far apart until they're on top of each other.
Then they fuse and give out a buttload of energy. It's like a hack. It's a quantum cheat, right?
You can, essentially, lens space-time to form what could best be described as a quantum crucible, some angry little section of space-time.
