Some of them have really weird descriptions, too.
Like, some of them are completely different.
Like, weird glass spheres with cubes in the middle.
A friend of mine is actually an AV fighter pilot.
We went to Cambridge together.
He said, I'm literally directly quoting here.
He said he almost took one of those things
that down his intake at 12,000 feet.
He did a 180 to go see it,
and his exact description was transparent sphere
with black cube inside.
I hate to say whether any of this is true or false,
but there is a surprising amount of consistency
on some of these descriptions.
Maybe they're man-made, maybe they're not.
One element is, if you're the U.S. government,
wouldn't it be great to pretend you had crazy
out there supernatural alien technology?
Get your adversaries chasing imaginary technology.
Have people chase after it.
Have them waste their espionage
looking for things that didn't exist
and then trying to catch them in the process.
