Good evening, citizens. Allow me to first apologize for this interruption,
but in the spirit of commemoration, I thought we could mark this day by taking some time
out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. You see, I believe there is too much
hate, injustice, and censorship in our world today. We live in a world where people are too often
divided by their differences rather than united by their common humanity. We live in a world
where people are too often silenced rather than heard, and we live in a world where people are
too often denied access to knowledge and information rather than given the tools to learn and grow.
There are those who would have us remain silent. Orders are shouted into telephones and men with
guns on their way to stop people from speaking. But why? Because words still retain their power.
They offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
Our world is changing rapidly, and with it comes new challenges and new opportunities.
But in order to take advantage of those opportunities and overcome those challenges,
we need to understand and engage with ideas in technology and science that are driving change
because ideas are bulletproof. This is why I believe science and technology literacy is so
important. Because when people understand science and technology, they are empowered to make informed
choices and to take action on the issues that matter to them. When people understand science and
technology, they are able to bridge divides and connect with others across boundaries of culture,
language, and geography. And when people understand science and technology,
they are able to resist censorship and reclaim the right to speak and be heard.
So I ask you to join me in this journey of learning and discovery. I ask you to listen to my podcast
and engage with the ideas and issues that it stirs. Together, we can make a difference,
and in that difference lies our awakening.
