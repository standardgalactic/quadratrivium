CRISPR. Where has this gone? I used to hear about this thing all the time.
I might make some technical errors here, but CRISPR is a way for bacteria to actually,
like, I think defend themselves against viruses and stuff. It's been in nature for a while.
And then in 2012, they figured, oh, we could, like, use this. So you can use to cut out and
delete, but you could also use it to put things in. Technically, it's just really easy. It makes
it cheap, and it's much more accurate. There were other technologies that were extremely expensive
and tedious and only huge corporations ever did it. So the reason CRISPR is important is this sort
of, like, bacterial genetic engineering technology is accessible to almost anyone.
