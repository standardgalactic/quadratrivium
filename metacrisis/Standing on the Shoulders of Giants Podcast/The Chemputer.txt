You have something called the chemputer coming out.
So the chemputer was a concept actually that I came up with years ago.
It was just the idea of I wanted to build an origin of life machine
to go back to the beginning of Earth. There's chemistry everywhere.
And I was thinking the labor required to do the experiments wasn't going to work.
And I said, I need some automation for this, but I can't afford the robots.
I started to put together a very basic digitally controlled chemical reactor.
But really, in my head at that time, is I wanted to be at a right code.
And that code was to control a robot to put in chemicals according to a recipe.
So you have chemical codes of relationship between what their atoms and bombs representation
and mixed molecules together get a reaction, make a drug, make a new material.
So in a way, the challenge I took on was ridiculous, but I think it's working.
