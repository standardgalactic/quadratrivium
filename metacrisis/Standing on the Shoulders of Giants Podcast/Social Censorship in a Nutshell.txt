It seems like Elon stepped in a bit of a quagmire here,
and he didn't quite realize what owning a social product means.
It means content moderation.
Why is this so difficult?
You're looking at agreement between different groups of people
for a global product about what is the acceptable range of discourse.
You hear it discussed as the Overton window.
It's essentially the definition of what is the acceptable range of topics
to discuss for a given group of people.
The fundamental problem on this is not a technology problem.
It's a people problem.
If you get large enough group of humans together,
they don't agree on what topics people are allowed to talk about,
and then you get into these platforms that are pretty much trying to apply
the same rules globally.
And so what happens is you'll end up with people who disagree with the Overton window
that the people who are setting the content moderation policy have tried to define.
And that just leads to a place where there's just conflict over what you can say on that platform.
