What kind of technologies do they use
to contain these massive forest fires
and then ultimately eliminate it?
Dirt and strategy.
If you really control a fire,
you just can't put enough water on a forest fire
to put it out.
The seasons will put it out eventually,
but even wintertime won't always suppress a fire.
So fire will do strange and beautiful things.
Like it'll create a thunder cloud of its own
big enough to create a lightning strike
that creates another fire.
Fire is addictive
because once you really get a sense for it,
it has this absolute natural beauty.
Once you understand that,
and you understand topography and terrain,
and if you have a kinesthetic sense of the woods,
you get a sense for where the fire is gonna go.
And what you do is you creep around the edges
by digging ditches in the dirt
and separating the burnt stuff from the not burnt stuff.
And then you slowly contain it,
but you have to always stay behind it.
You're always training it.
And then sometimes it'll switch course suddenly.
You get in front of it, you die.
