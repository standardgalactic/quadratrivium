Lady Ada Lovelace is the daughter of Lord Byron. Lady Ada Lovelace produced a hand-written algorithm
on a piece of paper in 1842 prior to any machine existing that could even run algorithms. This was
programming based on a spec of a machine that purportedly would exist in the future. Now this
is something we do in computer science almost on a daily basis as we program on things that don't
necessarily exist. She speculated on branching conditionals, subroutines, also called functions,
and loops, all three of which are used in every computer programming language on the planet
with very few exceptions. So in other words, in 1842 she effectively predicted modern computer
science. Lady Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer ever and in my opinion she is
the absolute godmother of all of computer science. Check out the whole conversation on the standing
