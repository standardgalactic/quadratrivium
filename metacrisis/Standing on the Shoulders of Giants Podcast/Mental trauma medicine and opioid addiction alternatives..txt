They're doing psilocybin and whatnot for PTSD patients,
which I don't know why we ever stopped that.
One of the things they've been working on
is we had started a low dose ketamine protocol
for people with extreme depressive episodes
where it had been shown to have some benefits in.
So that's been an interesting area
that's been popping up more and more lately.
The treatment and some of the medication assistance therapies
that they've developed for patients
who are addicted to opioids have been developed
in a way that they don't have abuse potential
and isn't as dangerous as we were previously doing
when we were giving people methadone.
And while methadone is still widely used
for treating opioid addiction,
it's like you have to go in person
and get your dose every day.
