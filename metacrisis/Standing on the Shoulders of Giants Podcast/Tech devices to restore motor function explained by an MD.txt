Have you done some of these surgeries where you're either reconstructing hands or various parts?
Yeah, I think I've done about every plastic case there is out there.
This is the one that kicked me out of medicine, surprisingly.
There is a surgeon in Alberta that was pioneering the use of external nerve stimulus.
So you could implant an electrode on a nerve and then you would put a transmitter on the ear
and you could take somebody with a paralyzed hand and they would click their teeth
and it would open and close their hand and you would totally skip the brain and all the nerves
and you would just stimulate the peripheral nerve.
I had this vision that you could restore motor function in paraplegics.
With enough stimulus and a complex enough computer program,
you could put the electrodes on the peripheral nerves and literally restore walking
and somebody who was completely paralyzed.
I was obsessed with this idea and I thought that I would leave medicine for a year between
medical school and residency and I would gain enough computer knowledge to make this happen.
