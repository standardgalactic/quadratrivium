I have a sub-stack piece of Madagascar, that's the context, for the listener or the viewer.
So they went to Madagascar, I think in the 17th century, because there were Muslim traders and stuff on the coast.
And they were just, whoa, these people speak something very close to Malay.
So what's up with that? Because they're off the coast of Mozambique.
Exactly.
Okay? We knew that.
And if you look at the people, especially Highlanders, like the Marina people, a lot of them look Asian.
If you actually look at the president of Madagascar and his wife, they look Southeast Asian.
So what did genetics do? What did genetics add? There's a couple of things.
First, you can look at the segments of DNA and look at the segments that match all across the world.
You can look at segments that are Asian and segments that are African.
Pull out the African ones, leave the Asian ones, and then run the relatedness statistic.
And it turns out they are related to people from Southeast Borneo.
