Are there aliens? Are they here?
Life on Earth is a result of a four billion year curated chemistry experiment.
Four billion years of curation in chemistry gives you biology.
And the way that NASA looks for aliens is to look for evidence of biology on Mars.
You want to look for proteins, DNA, amino acids.
But what if the alien used a different chemistry?
What if the life was different?
Because I could basically ask, is this object complex enough?
I wouldn't need to go with any assumptions about its chemistry or technology.
Assembly theory is the ultimate alien detector.
It's agnostic molecule detector.
I don't care where you come from molecule.
I just want to know how many unique parts do you have?
The more you have and the more of you I can detect,
the more likely it is that you've been produced by some evolutionary selection
or technological process.
