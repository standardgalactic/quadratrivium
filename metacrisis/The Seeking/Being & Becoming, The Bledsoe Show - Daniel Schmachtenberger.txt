Welcome to the BLEZZO show.
This is your host, Mike BLEZZO, and today's guest is Daniel Schmackenberger.
He's an evolutionary philosopher, systems designer, and strategist.
This is a special show because I bring to him some things that are on my mind that I'm
working with and working through, and he helps me see things on a deeper level and unravel
some truths that are within myself.
He does this regularly for me.
When I say regularly, I mean every few months, I seem to have some type of question that
he is extremely skilled at helping me see a different perspective on, and I think he
will help you see a different perspective as well.
Additionally, he is the guy who created Kualia.
That's the no-tropic I go on and on about all the time, and a co-founder of the Neurohacker
Collective.
So, if you like what he has to say, you might want to try his product out too.
So if you do want to do that, go to Neurohacker.com and add that Kualia product to your cart.
Use the coupon code BLEZZO15 and you'll get 15% off.
I highly recommend just going over to the website and doing some reading whether you're
going to buy the product or not.
There's a lot of really cool stuff over there beyond just new tropics.
There's a lot of cool discussions that if you do dig what we talk about here, you're
going to dig what they've got going on over there.
Additionally, one other thing, make sure to go over to iTunes, give us five stars, positive
comment please, and helps this podcast reach more people.
Enjoy the show.
Daniel, good to have you.
Good to be here with you, my friend.
I'm looking for today's conversation every time we have a conversation.
I leave feeling like I, definitely having learned, definitely having learned.
And today we're going to dig into being versus doing.
I think a lot of people, one of the reasons I want to bring this up is this is something
I've been working on myself and being in a culture and society where so much value is
putting on what we do and even when I'm asked or we ask children what do you want to be
when you grow up, the answer ends up being a doing answer versus a being answer.
Even though the question is being and so we get this association, what do you want to
be when you grow up?
It's like, oh, I want to be and then they name the job, which is interesting.
That's something that's come to my attention recently.
I watched it's only going to be a firefighter or an astronaut.
That seems like a very doing thing.
Would you agree that that's just how our culture has been molding us up to this point?
Well, yeah, and it goes deeper than that.
Not only is it a doing thing, it's one very specific specialist role.
And it's a specialist role that is usually related to how they're going to make money.
And so it's, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Because it takes them out of the moment into the future.
It takes them into wanting to develop who they are right in the framing of their essence
as a job.
So you can look at how that is the effect of macroeconomics forming people to be effective
cogs in that system.
There's a whole bunch of things going on, but being and doing is definitely one of them.
As you're exploring that inquiry yourself, if we reframe it to something like who do
you want to be, rather than what do you want to be or what do you want to do, what comes
up for you as meaningful answers to that?
I want to be honest, trustworthy, I want to be an asset to the community and that, things
like that, things more along the lines of characters, or not characters, but yeah, what's
the value of my character and my, somebody who tells the truth, things like that.
And how does it relate for you to what that character is doing?
What is the relationship of those qualities of being and doing?
It's something I can do, it's something I can be right now.
It's not even something that aspire to as a choice, oh, I can just, if I want people
to trust me, then I know that I need to behave with integrity.
There's a number of embedded dialectics or dichotomies here.
There's now versus later.
You said this is something I can be now versus something that's aspirational in the future.
And there's something that is more around qualities of character versus specific types
of action.
Someone can show up with integrity as an artist or as an inventor or as an entrepreneur or
as a mother, lots of different roles, and those roles are meaningful, they're deep and
meaningful to who that unique being and their expression and their dharma and their purposes.
And then there's also the difference between the qualities of character of how other people
feel in relationship with them and their own quality of experience, how they've experienced
life.
And so when you look at the fact that we have choice over our own experience and we also
have choice over how we affect the experience of others.
All of that kind of shows up here.
There's something around optimizing the relationship between all these dialectics, our own acting
in ways that optimize our own experience and the experience of everyone and everything
that we touch in effect, showing up right now in the fullest way we can now and in a
way that optimizes our growth trajectory into the future.
And qualities of being and specific types of doing that are both aligned with each other
and the deepest aspect of who we are.
Yeah, I think it's challenging sometimes to think about what it is that I find that
sometimes there's a challenge between who we are or who we want to be and who we're
showing up, how we're showing up in the world for others.
And I've had conversations with others and then I've had this internal conversation with
myself around, am I showing up for the purpose of, am I doing this, I tell myself and I've
watched other people tell themselves they're doing this because they love other people.
Like all I'm doing is doing this out of love when in reality the motivation is born out
of need in that if I am not this way or I don't behave this way or I don't do these
things then this person won't love and accept me.
And so we end up in this, we end up in this place where I either have to behave the way
other people want me to behave in order to be liked or I do whatever I want to do and
no one's going to like me.
I can't do both.
That seems to be a reality that's being created for a lot of people and a reality I've had
to wrestle with myself.
So we have more things where you have two different things that are both meaningful
framed as being dichotomous.
So you have your individuality and your authenticity and your sovereignty on one side, which is
who do I really just want to be for myself?
And this is prima facie meaningful, obviously meaningful.
And then you have the relationship, connection, communion side, which is how do I show up
in a way that is enriching to other people so that they also want to show up with me
because there's so much of what's meaningful that only expresses itself interpersonally,
which is obviously also meaningful.
If we believe that there is an inexorable dichotomy between those where we have to sacrifice
who we actually are for relationship or sacrifice relationship to be who we are, then life will
suck.
And it's not actually true.
It is true that those are polls, but they're polls that are actually complementary and
when navigated properly are symbiotic with each other, that you being who you actually
are and you relating with other people in a way that creates most meaningful relationship
are symbiotic.
Now you might be in a relationship with someone where they want you to behave a certain way
because you kind of made that contract with them or from the beginning you acted a way
that you thought that they wanted that was never true to who you were to get something
from them where the whole thing is a bullshit commodities exchange, but that just might
be an unauthentic relationship to begin with.
Would you say that a lot of people have that relationship with their parents?
Sure.
De facto, most people have that relationship with their parents if their parents weren't
really focused on facilitating those people being who they actually authentically were,
which is not most parents.
And so then they are being who they think their parents need them to be.
And this is why they don't like going home for the holidays, right?
Now there's then one can rebel and say, I'm going to be whoever the fuck I want to be
and lose connection or they can sacrifice who they are and their authenticity in a co-dependent
way or connection that isn't real connection and pseudo connection.
Or they can see what is the authentic overlap between who my parents actually are and who
I actually am.
What is the overlap of that Venn diagram that's authentic and let's see how we can explore
that.
Let's see how we can expand it.
Yeah.
What would you say to somebody who, say, grew up and I was just talking to someone earlier
today who grew up in the Mormon religion and then they leave that religion and when we
look at that Venn diagram, there's really not a lot of overlap or maybe there is overlap,
but it's very difficult to find.
How do you go about, do we need to reconcile those relationships?
Is that something that we owe other people?
So we talk about being, I live in an environment I think you do too where the new, the relationships
that are new are easy to get into because we're showing up as our most authentic selves
more than we ever have before and so there is, you start the relationship without the
bullshit, but a relationship that where you grew up with it and now is it something worth
cutting away later on in life and cutting people out or is it something, do we owe
people something?
I think there's another way to ask it that's more insightful.
It's not do we owe our parents an obligatory false relationship which is not actually very
meaningful for anyone or on the other side do we just cut it out?
I think one meaningful question is as we are interacting with our parents can we feel comfortable
being who we are without needing their approval and without needing them to understand us and
agree with us and can we let them be who they are and even if they can't, even if they don't
have a worldview, maybe they think we're going to burn in hell or they think whatever it
is, can we accept them, get them where they're at and be who we are or do we go into some
trigger where we think we need to change who we are for them or we need to change who they
are and to the degree that that trigger arises is there an evolutionary opportunity for us
to heal that and are they a really good mirror for showing us where those triggers live inside
of us?
I've been in that conversation with people before too is like you think you're enlightened
or whatever you want to call it, just go hang out with your family and they'll show you.
It's a very classic statement that if people are focused on some kind of personal development
one good measure is you hang out with your parents, the degree to which you can be authentically
you and at peace around them without trying to convince them of anything and let them
be who they are without being triggered on who they are is a good measure for how you've
come.
That's powerful because they pretty much installed the triggers.
This is why it's such a deep mirror for the triggers, what they are for you, which is why
you disproportionately react to them in a way that nobody else does, other people won't
see them like whatever, it's irritating, it's cute, it's no big deal and you're freaking
out about it is because all of your trauma has history there and to the degree you've
healed your trauma it's not still getting pushed and to the degree you haven't seeing
it shows you where you're going to work.
Coming back to, I just want to dive in just a definition of this which is we talk about
states of being and I've personally been looking at doing versus being and I think
a lot of us in the western culture consider we go, oh if I do these things then I'll be
this person and then we do those things and then we kind of become a piece of this person
we thought we would become once we do these things and now we have to do more things in
order to feel good and I've been investigating the possibility of going straight to being
and then once you become the person that you want to be or the person you were, you remember
the person you were before you were imprinted you become this person that has, that is this
being and this being just does the things that they're supposed to do or it just unfolds
easily.
So a lot of my focus has been around how can I be different without focusing on the doing
first and then coming from a lifetime of being taught that you do to become and now I'm going
in reverse going okay I want to be different and I need to go and can the motivation and
if the motivation pure is like do I want to be so that I can do and in which case is that
even possible or do I need to have the pure motivation of look I want to be for the purpose
of being and being authentic and then I need to trust, trust in the uncertainty of what
that looks like when the doing happens.
There's a bunch of elements kind of wrapped up in there let's pull them apart and see
if we can address them.
I'd actually like to address the topic of dichotomy and paradox a little bit more essentially
because it's right at the heart here of is being really what we care about we actually
care about who we are character wise or we care about our state of experience right and
all the doing is really just so we can be happy or good or something and if we're there
already then how do we have any idea what we would do and who cares and doesn't matter
or is doing really relevant because we're actually evolving the world and we have a
role to play and what is the relationship between those and is their causal influence
both ways does doing affect being and being affect doing and can they be recursive and
so think about this very simple analogy but the analogy is illustrative think about a
cylinder cylinder is a three-dimensional object it's a very simple three-dimensional
object we're used to thinking in three dimensions three spatial dimensions so an easy thing
to think about but if you imagine a two-dimensional creature right a planar planar creature they
can't see a cylinder they can see a two-dimensional slice of it now there's an infinite number
of two-dimensional slices since they're infinitely thin that stack on top of each other to actually
make the thing up so they're actually reducing the total information of what that is infinitely
right one dimension reduction is infinite right reduction so they slice the cylinder
one way and they get a circle and it's very clear that the reality they're seeing it's
kind of passing through their space is a circle if it passed through perpendicular to that
they'd get a rectangle right the other and cross section from a two-dimensional perspective
like is the cylinder a rectangle a circle well it's obviously whichever one is happening
like it being a circle is true it's very clear that from a two-dimensional perspective like
that is what is being seen it's true it's there's the perfect fidelity to it right from the
other direction as a rectangle it's also perfectly true and those two descriptions of reality
in two dimensions cannot commensurate right they are disparate mutually exclusive descriptions
of circles is totally round thing rectangles these corners and so then what are the opportunities
well you can either just say I saw a circle so I know it's circle on the other side is
just wrong that's fundamentalism which is kind of like there's some truth and I'm sticking
to it right and I'll fight with the people on the other side or you see the circle and
then you for somehow you happen to be on the other plane and see the rectangle to and you
go shit there's seemingly truth to both of these now I have embraced paradox what do
I do with this and you have different options one way as you say well maybe there's a middle
path but you're still trying to reconcile it in two dimensions because you're two dimensional
creatures so you say well what's kind of in the middle of a circle and a rectangle and
you get a rounded rectangle right you kind of round the corners of the rectangle make
it a little more circular like now that isn't even partially true right like that isn't
even a little bit of any part of a cylinder or you just say well they're both true and
neither are true and we embrace paradox and that just means you gave up on understanding
is really what it means the truth is a cylinder is a very straightforward thing which is a
circle translated over the space of a rectangle or a rectangle rotated to the space of a circle
but you can't understand it in duty you can only understand it in 3D which means you need
an entirely higher dimensional framework of understanding to get the nature of reality
when you're trying to reduce reality to a dimensionally smaller perspective you're fucked
right because that dimension simply can't understand it so then you have false paradox
because the the perspective the view itself is reducing the total reality and you can
even see just looking at the east side of a building versus the west side you could argue
over what the building looks like and it's because perception is inherently reductive
you cannot see the whole of what something is because there's many many different views
of it right so you need a trans-perspectival understanding that can reconcile them so
the the reality of the cylinder is different than circle or rectangle but both of those
are partially true from that kind of perspective well when we come to many existential questions
it seemed paradoxical or dichotomous like being and doing is what really matters my
state of being in the moment or was is what matters my state of becoming and that I'm
becoming more and more right being side says outside of time and am I touching the infinite
am I touching the eternal am I in wholeness am I in fullness now becoming side says universe
itself is evolving my evolving with universe am I adding to universe and myself actualizing
and realizing right circle rectangle these are both true but we're not just saying well
it's both a circle and a rectangle we actually have to put those together and say how are
they both true how do being and becoming reconcile in that way the key thing to get and we can
see all the other dichotomies that come with this based on the being model it's well I'm
gonna love and accept myself exactly how I am I'm gonna love and accept others in reality
exactly how it is I'm gonna see the beauty in everything right now on the becoming side
you're like well I want to make myself better I want to help make others better I want to
make the world better right well which one is it do I want to love what is or do I want
to make it better this is exactly the struggle I think I've been having and that I go through
phases where I'm going through accepting and then I'm going I'm going you know what I need
to really step it up yeah and there's things that need to change and I want to I want to
see the progress and in see the evolution and then I it's almost as if I get caught up
and pushing the ball forward and then I feel as though my state of being there's static
on the line and then I have to go back to accepting things just as they are and that
state of being so this is this is fascinating to me is I've been living I've been living
a life where I'm switching between truths right because I can't reconcile the two so
we can we can be in a place where we flip-flop between truths that both are self-evidently
true and yet seem unreconcilable or we can reconcile and live them both more fully simultaneously
but we have to go higher dimensional to do that we have to go to a place where they can
really reconcile and that requires and higher dimensional here isn't spatial dimensions
it's how we understand the complexity of reality so we're going to get to I'd like to add another
element of a model because it'll really help with this and I think I think you might find
it interesting I want to compare for a minute roughly generalized very oversimplified an
Eastern model and a Western model of the nature of reality and meaning and spirituality obviously
it's oversimplified because there's a lot of Eastern models and a lot of Western models
and the delineation between them isn't clear at all but let's just take by Eastern I mean
a kind of Vedantic Buddhist the primary interpretations which are very being focused
and we're using these as a reference for this particular dichotomy here so you notice in most
interpretations the Buddhist tradition the focus is exclusively on being right not doing not
becoming in fact any chopwood carry water doing is just because if that needs done do it but it's
all about the quality of being while doing it it's the only thing that matters right the reason
why or one of the reasons why that becomes insightful is the Buddhist and the Hindu Vedantic
model of time is a circular model of time right they have this system of time called the Kalpas
or the Ugas where where the time in universe itself is believed to cycle cycle through birth
and death so you know if you if you think about it these people watch nature very deeply and they
saw seasons spring and fall and they saw empires rise and then fall they saw people born and then
die they saw relationships come together and come apart and they just saw everything cycling they
watch the procession of the equinoxes they saw cycles within cycles days within months within
years within galactic cycles right so they saw it was all cycles and so because of that if everything
is cycling and then then they extend that up to but this is just a intellectual extension
everything in universe is just cycles then nothing is actually going anywhere which is going in
circles there is no actual thing called progress it's just a wheel of time right so they have this
concept of the wheel of time so so if you're trying to push something forward you're just moving
through the cycle more quickly you've bought into the illusion that you're going anywhere right that
spring means anything other than its way towards fall and death right and so this is why then they
talk about it as Maya right illusion or even more samsara suffering so then if it's just this
fucking illusory wheel that isn't actually going anywhere going further is meaningless so then
there's actually a movie samsara on Netflix you can watch which is just yeah it's demonstrating that
if you want to go see it that concept right it's a concept right and so then the goal there
becomes getting off the wheel and so that means getting out of time in the concept of linear
time completely so then the goal is being able to access the eternal through the now and so the
idea of becoming or of progress or making the world better when the whole thing is illusory to
begin with meaningless fundamentally to begin with just means you bought into the illusion you
don't get the ultimate truth so the goal there is is to step out of time to be now full complete
in a way that doesn't have progress built in at all right and that's the kind of pure zenith of a
being model you notice that happiness in that model is a model of happiness that's like contentment
or serenity like fullness right now with what is right and in fact anything like passion or desire
or excitement is called the cause of all suffering right because that means that you believe something
good is in the future so you sacrifice being in the moment for wanting something in the future
and that just leads you to getting all feverish and fucked up and then when you get it you
aren't even that happy and you want something else and then you're anxious of losing it so just
don't desire anything don't have passion for anything just be full and content now right
you know this is also yeah this is great because this is also something I've been
I've been studying you know like how do I be and then how do I and then also
it's hard to not believe that my passion and my my drive in my just my desires are for nothing
well they in that model they are for nothing that isn't illusory and stupid
right they they are for plenty of sound and fury leading to suffering and nothing
and so that's that model but that is circle right that that it's kind of true but it's so
far from true that it's just actually infinitely off okay so far from the whole truth it's a
dimensional reduction so then let's look at the western model I'll say one thing it sounds boring
it can sound boring but of course in the idea of boring in that model would be a mental trap
and that when you come into the fullness of being right now you can access and this is true
a state of serenity that has a kind of blissfulness to it that doesn't need you to do anything
and that is unperturbable they'd be like no you actually don't get what the fullness of being
you drop into it is yeah right that is eternal and it's unfuck with a ball
so that's that now the western model of time kind of originating Judaism we can say and then
the Greeks and modern science and you know up till most of the world now because early Jews
were very focused on history and noticing their kind of progression as a as a people new technology
as it emerged and new law and new ideas and etc they and they were recording that they were
actually noticing net change over time and that new things were emerging that didn't exist before
and so rather than focusing on the cycles and in nature and seeing everything as cyclic they were
focused on the emergence of things humans were creating that were additive and actually going
somewhere and so they had a linear model of time so time was actually going somewhere
and so that led to a dialectic of progress and a focus on becoming more than being
and in that in that model there is there a what I've seen is there's a beginning and an end
maybe or maybe not sometimes there is a beginning and an end and maybe the beginning is the
beginning of universe and Genesis maybe the beginning is when you were born maybe the end
is heaven right there's different kind of theologic models but people they can disagree
about where the beginning and the end is they can even have a reincarnation model within it
but that there is net progress along the whole thing right because universe itself is actually
going somewhere and so you're going somewhere within it and you're adding to universe going
somewhere well if you're if you think universe is actually going somewhere then adding to universe
going somewhere is inherently meaningful and you being part of where it's going is inherently
meaningful so then just being in the moment is not that interesting becoming evermore in a universe
that is itself becoming evermore so developing oneself right in which case being just completely
content in a way that has no drive is is antithetical to what's purposeful so you notice their
definition of happiness has a lot more that sounds like passion and excitement right right
and which if you were to look at if you're looking at those cultures there's a lot of
singing dancing yeah even partying whereas you look at some of the more eastern
philosophies and it's things very quiet and and uh it's the traditions or that I that I'm that I'm
imagining right now like a tea ceremony yeah very just it's very calm not a lot of excitement
very bland or vanilla well you're giving a western bias here so you're calling it boring
and bland and vanilla sure they would say uh profoundly serene I'm am I insulting people
that come from that perspective you think well probably but what's more what's more interesting
is that you're not getting it yet right because you haven't you haven't dropped into that place
of getting it but you probably have if you think about it you might have had moments where you're
surfing and you stop and everything kind of stops and you just see sparkles on the water
and thinking about what's coming next stops and the moment's full and it's more full
in a certain quality than excitement about the future is yeah there's no doubt about that
I've definitely had moments right staying there so the whole eastern process would be staying there
right each moment being fully with that need the endless wave except it doesn't it's about it
independent of circumstance right it's something you're in the eye of the storm no matter what's
happening around you you keep your peace yeah a part of the enlightenment in that model being
able to be fully with what is no matter what is no matter what is happening because everything
that's happening is in illusion right it's all just changing and flexing but the consciousness
that's witnessing it is ever present and identifying is that and that that is actually the fullness
right that the light is actually the light of consciousness that's what waking up means there
now so if one wanted to buy us from that direction they could look at the other thing with all the
singing and dancing and say look how feverish it is look at how kind of immature and its excitement
when things go well and disappointment when things don't go well look at how little sovereignty
that people have where they're so affected by their environment and their circumstance look
at how they rush around trying to change their circumstance to make themselves happy look at
how attached they get to other people and how fucked up they get when things don't go the way
they want look at how unhappy they are when they lose something look at how when they get what they
want they're only happy for like 15 minutes and then they want something else and that there's
like almost nothing of seeming enduring depth there right now these are both true right so we're
we're talking about circles and rectangles so to just finish a little bit on the on the western model
so time is going somewhere dialectic of progress so the focus becomes purpose because purpose is a
time bound concept purpose unfolds in time right and evolution is a time bound concept and so evolving
ourselves evolving others evolving the world around us becoming more being able to express more
of infinite potential through the finite through time we're and and in there in that model it would
say well of course when you get what you wanted you aren't just enduringly happy because then you
would stop becoming the goal is to be becoming forever the goal is actually to be in the process
of blossoming they at the depth what universe is the evolutionary impulse that brings subatomic
particles together into particles and particles into you know higher order particles into biology
the whole thing from the big bang on that that that what keeps organizing universe towards more
orderly complexity is a becoming impulse an infinite blossoming into higher order potential
of universe and that you resulted from that and you also have the ability to choose in a way that
aligns yourself with that and so of course when you get something then you're not you're happy
for a moment because you're in the becoming but it's actually the being in the becoming that's
what's interesting right what teres are done called the lure of becoming but because it's about
becoming it it's also every moment right and so there it's more about excitement passion
you know associated with becoming now what's interesting when you put these together
you have a circular model of time in a linear model corresponding with the circular as being
with the linear is becoming with the circular is presence with the linear's purpose
with the circular is contentment serenity and the fullness of the now
and with the linear is passion and purpose and the promise of possibility
you notice that the circular model maps to serotonin like happiness and the serotonin
energy systems right and that the linear model maps to dopamine right and the dopamine kinds of
happiness like processing and that the practice is so glad you're tying this to
to the neurotransmitters this brings so much application and if anyone knows anything about
how those things are impact or if you've had experiences where you had an excess and dopamine
or serotonin right and it's like oh that's why those experiences were that way people
have interesting people who've explored it might resonate with the they took a serotonin
urgent thing right they took MDMA and they became very in the moment very sensory very
feeling very in the fullness of everything being overwhelmingly beautiful now yeah almost no
awareness of other than now right someone took dopamine urgent thing right they took
Adderall or cocaine or whatever and they become profoundly focused on what they want to create
and they all they wanted to do is be in the process of creating it right and we can see the beauty
and the crashes of both of those and what becomes more available and less available in both of those
we can see them the practices right a lot of the eastern practices are serotonin
and urgic practices being in the moment breathing slow being in nature having all of your awareness
your sensory awareness and what is right a lot of the western practices are create goals
achieve the goals feel good that you achieve them check them off reinforce having goals
create more goals check right and those are dopamine urgic practices now if we come back
to our 2d 3d analogy dopamine is addiction yeah right dopamine dopamine and its relationship
with opioids the dopamine opioid system is feels good do it again because it is time bound what
things were evolutionarily relevant to do again right nobody's in terms of addicted to serotonin
if you're having an experience that is more about being in the moment you're not jonesing for the
next moment right that would explain why people tend to get hooked on something like cocaine and
maybe MDMA is not as addictive right now someone might have a serotonin imbalance so they're
going to keep wanting to go back to some serotonin urgic thing there's obviously all SSRIs are focused
on that but it is that all addiction relates to the dopamine axis other things are involved but
it will always involve that okay now come back to our 3d 2d analogy with the cylinder but let's
look at their models of time here and the circle and the the circular model of time linear model of
time and if we embed those on each other in a higher dimension because those are both one
dimensional right one dimension curved back on itself like a circular one dimension you know
of time that just continues straight if you bring them together you get a spiral of time
right which is a circle that isn't closing on itself it's a circle that is actually moving
along a line so then you say are there cycles yes there are cycles and there is net change
from one cycle to the next now why this is meaningful is we see we we look at the ecosystem
and we see that you've got spring and fall and spring and fall and things are born and die but
over the course of deep time you look at the fossil record there's evolution of new organisms that
weren't there before so there is net change over time while there are cycles in how that occurs
it's important to understand that there are cycles because that means that in how you
proceed in becoming you need to have phases of activity and phases of rest phases of going
outward and phases of coming inward phases of learning new things and then phases of applying
that learning phases learning new things phases of digesting and you know taking taking that to
process with everything else you know if you don't understand that there are cycles every
time it's time to come inward or to digest or to learn something new or to step back you'll
feel like you're not making progress but the key is that those those or you'll never want to sleep
right those i've gone through phases where i'm pushing pushing pushing and then crash
and look you know in hearing this i could have been more sensitive to the fact that it has to
cycle in that way so you don't have to push and then crash where the cycle forces itself on you
you can go with it and you actually you optimize yourself over time now at the same time you realize
that within that cycle net growth is happening so you might come back to it's it's interesting how
i can see this in some aspects of my life but then i completely neglect them and others right right
well now the areas you've neglected them in you can start looking at and saying where am i pushing
where it is inexorable that there is a cycle that if i give space to it i'll actually get go
further faster and i'll enjoy the process more my being and my becoming will both evolve yeah
so now we put this together right and if we have a model of time in which cycles happen
but net growth also happens then and we start to synthesize to reconcile all the elements of
both of those do we want to be unconditionally able to access fullness and contentment now
yes do we want to be able to access creative desire and passion about the future yes
do we want to be excited about making something happen and not devastated if it doesn't happen
yes both at the same time right do we want to be
optimizing our dopamine urgic circuits or our serotonin urgic circuits yes both right the
fullness of the human experience and so we can see how different cultures were were pioneering
the insights that now we can synthesize right they were pioneering how to really bring those
insights and practices about where now as a global people that can harvest the wisdom
from all these cultures bring together we can really start to synthesize how do we be in the
moment fully and be becoming fully and so the fullness of the human experience is both and
if we look at it like this so here's someone and i want to love them unconditionally the way
they are right now i also want to help them grow which one do i do do i go back and forth between
when i really get it i realize that they're the exact same thing the cylinder is actually one
thing it isn't a bunch of circles stacked up is one thing right yeah if i love them the way they are
completely the way they are is not actually a static thing they are a verb right they are
different than they were yesterday they will be different tomorrow there's a sameness but there's
a becoming that is part of their being and because there is an impulse in them to express
who they are more and more fully to self actualize to self realize to add to universe to realize
the depths of what's possible for them loving them for who they are is wanting for them is wanting
for their fullest expression is also helping them become that so loving them unconditionally the way
they are and supporting them to be what they're becoming are the same fucking thing when you
actually get that those aren't dichotomous at all that built within the being is verb-ness
this is this is extremely helpful and then um i as you're talking about this i'm
visualizing a couple different relationships i have where in the past i had a hard
had a hard time accepting people where they were at and then wanting more for them but
the simple fact that i wasn't accepting them for where they were at in that moment and who they
were becoming like potentially stunted that or it harmed the relationship in the least yeah in
which case there was no way for me to be support think about this you were born in a particular
place to a particular family you don't really have much choice in that i'm not going to get into
if there was a spirit that did or whatever you as you understand yourself didn't have much choice in
that had you been born somewhere else right had you been even given up for adoption as a infant
and had you had you grown up with the machi ganga tribe in in the amazon or had you grown up with
the sue indians or had you grown up on the upper east side manhattan with a banking family or
almost every part of your identity would be different your aesthetics what you like what
you don't like the language that you think in and perceive the world in your your everything right
you know so much of what you think is you is other people it's other people that condition that in
you and so when you are and this is true of everyone else too so when you're interacting
with someone and there's something they're dealing with some jealousy or laziness or
pettiness or anger or whatever it is it's not them it is it's a part of the reality that they are
dealing with and and being right it's not essentially them that's what they were conditioned
into now what you'll notice is the person's dealing with that jealousy but they're like
i really want to shed this jealousy and just love unconditionally why do they even want that
if if who they really were was just jealous they'd just be stoked with it like yeah i'm just
jealous fuck i i'd like to be more jealous right like and it is essentially something i value
but no they're like no i want to love more and i don't want to be angry i actually want to be a
kinder person where the where does that want to come from even deeper than where it was conditioned
as a moral or a value even when you strip those away there are deep impulses that connect to the
deepest parts of the being of who they actually are and so what someone is wanting if they don't
know how to access it is deeper to the truth of who they are than what they're working through and
stuck with so when you really love someone you're not you're not looking at all the conditioning
bullshit that was put on them and in them you're looking at what is trying to express itself through
that and saying wow i actually see underneath all of the trauma and fear and conditioning and nonsense
i actually see the being you are and i love the shit out of it and that being is actually
totally beautiful and totally unique and in unconditionally loving that and accepting
that it's dealing with the shit that it has to deal with i want to help it deal with it
want to help it express who it really is more
this um this reminds me of i i i i like to think i create almost uh like workarounds
when i recognize something in a workaround i i came up with i i'm now recognizing as a workaround
potentially and then you can tell me what you think about it which is when i if i'm getting
upset with somebody or somebody's getting upset with me the way i've been framing it my mind is
their story is upset with my story like who they are is not really upset with who i am
they love you know if they were seeing me just for who i was or who i am and i'm seeing them for
who they are then i would just love them it's the stories that are that are in the way would that be
would that be accurate or do you think that's a workaround
yeah so let me say it another way
marshal Rosenberg the developer of the nomadic communication system had a good way of saying
this point said our fundamental needs and our fundamental values always work together
sometimes our strategies for how we go about acting on those values or meeting those needs
don't work together and sometimes we get very attached to those strategies and don't even
make a distinction right so there's a couple and one of them is having uh they're fighting about
like you never go places and go to parties with me and you never give me fucking space and you
know like they're in that dialogue and and one of them is really wanting the other person to go
interact with their friends and the other one is really wanting to be about themselves and
it seems like they are unreconcilable things that they want and there's a million versions of this
right but underneath it one person is usually wanting more their their actual need or values
around connection and the truth is both people value connection and one of the and the other
person might be valuing um sovereignty you know or individuality freedom both people actually value
freedom right and so when you get to what is actually the essential value that i have here
you'll realize we actually share this and you're like oh shit i want you to have freedom i want to
have freedom too oh i want you to have connection i want to have that too then you say if we were
stopped being focused on i can only have connection if you do this thing with me this way
which might be something you actually hate but there's plenty of other things you might like
to do that we could connect on that's the strategy that's the strategy or i can only have freedom
if i don't do this thing and i do this other thing and right maybe i can have the freedom to
choose to do that rather than feel forced into it knowing that i'm choosing it right yeah um
so if you let go of the strategies and you come to the needs you say are there ever a time where
those needs don't work together no they always work together or those values those values always
work together so then to the degree we can actually chill out on the strategies and say is there a
strategy that meets all the needs that fulfills all the values simultaneously there always will be
yeah okay and this is another place of like getting past a false dichotomy it seems like
these are unreconcilable but when you can step to a higher level right the level of values not
strategy they are reconcilable with this with this perspective
i imagine people are thinking you know what's there's nothing stopping us from loving each other
fully why do we prefer some people over others and and who we connect with
that's a very deep question
why do we or why should we continue to as we evolve are very different
we do historically for a bunch of mostly unconscious and not really great reasons
we prefer some people because they're the color that we're used to or because they're wealthy
or because they're hot or because they're mostly like that one that one is there right
that's that's a where your biology program to you i was gonna ask about that how much of that
is biology and how much of that is culture as well because there's definitely you know our
are you look at what a model look like 50 years ago to even now there's a difference
and what different cultures find beautiful there are differences there's also similarities the
similarities are evolutionary biology and that relate to fertility right signs of fertility
and the um the differences are culture but the point is those are both conditioned
and now you relate with those but how many people are there that i could find really hot
from an evolutionary biology point of view it would be absolutely terrible matches for me
most of them right like it's not hard to go to a gym or go to a beach and see a bunch of
guys or girls that are hot like and yet they you might have almost exactly opposite core
core worldviews values ideals beliefs you might be very symbiotic with supporting each other on
a path or not and so it's not that that is a completely meaningless metric but it it's a metric
that's important to um make sure does not override your assessment of all the other metrics
and especially as you if you are thinking about enduring relationship
it that metric will fade period
it will fade because aging will change aesthetics and it will fade because even
before aging changes aesthetics chemistry wears off as soon as it's no longer new and novel
and if you think of it from an evolutionary biology point of view there's a lot of evolutionary
advantage to staying together long enough to make sure that offspring happens and then there's
a lot of evolutionary advantage to have more offspring in more places so that some of them
will get through right yeah and so that looks like serial monogamy right that looks like
fall in love and then fall out of love fall in love somewhere else it's not falling in love it's
falling in um biochemical procreation patterns and then rationalizing a lot of love that is all
really nonsense um so so realizing that that is going to fade then you say all right how
controlled by that do i want to be versus how much do i want to create something enduring what is an
enduring basis of relationship and this is going to be now this comes to being and becoming again
our beings need to connect and our becomeings need to connect if we're going to have a
relationship that's enduring who they are becoming and who i am becoming actually need to connect so
that as time goes on we are on deeper and deeper past so you see a lot of people it's like their
vectors are crossing so for a while they're coming closer together and then they cross and then they
start going further apart and to stay together they actually have someone has to pull the other one
off their path or they go further apart there are other people where it's almost like two converging
vectors right like they're asymptotically converging towards each other and this is why part of a good
fit is is not just does our lifestyle fit do our way of being now fit to our chemistry's fit but
it's actually do our deepest aspirations and our basis for choice and our visions of the future fit
which is this is super meaningful right very and this is this is something that people
i imagine are exploring superficially and it might be superficially like do you want kids
i want kids are you gonna make enough money yeah okay cool we can do this but as it goes much deeper
it's one of the metrics of a healthy relationship is that you're becoming path right as you are
evolving you're becoming path that you are evolving
better because of being in that relationship than you would being out of it right or being in
some other one that was less good of a fit in that way and so who you you are actually being who
you essentially are more fully because of their influence in your life this doesn't mean that
you're codependently depending on them for it but it means they are an enhancement to the degree
they're influencing you of your own being and your own becoming and you are for them
oftentimes we'll have relationships that are more about addiction than love
where i'm actually being less of who i really want to be and i'm becoming less right i'm
i'm less available to my friends and family because i'm absorbed as fuck in the relationship
i'm doing my work and my dharma and my creativity and my art and my etc and my practice is less
but i really really fucking like them right and and what you notice is my relationship to them
is a lot more like a relationship to cocaine or heroin than a relationship to an evolutionary
path right it's more about i like the hit i'm getting from them and my life is getting worse
because of it rather than i am actually evolving in who i essentially am one of the key criteria is
with an addiction you become less able to enjoy anything else other than the addiction right
this if if you're addicted to coke when you're coming down off coke the sunset's not beautiful
right flowers don't smoke only getting some more coke is the only thing right and if you
don't get the coke fuck everything else and so you're focused on pleasure but it's becoming
more and more and more focused on one source um as one is moving in their actual enlightenment
right they're being direction right the eastern side of this is their ability to love everything
more to get to get connection pleasure with everything more and as they're evolving and
they're becoming they have ability to contribute to everything more and that their being is evolving
through their becoming right they're actually evolving which is a becoming thing in their being
and so if i have a relationship that's like cocaine what it means is if they aren't calling
me back they aren't texting me back i can't think about anything else i can't chill out i
can't enjoy i'm fucked up right life's meaningless but when they're when i get the hit everything's
great that's addiction not love if it's actually a meaningful evolutionary relationship my ability
to show up to everything else in my life increases because of them my ability to love and appreciate
everything else increased because i become a better friend because i'm learning how to communicate
better from them i start loving and appreciating other people more because my heart's opening more
how long um i i didn't think we'd get into dating
but i uh i find myself people asking me for advice about it and uh and i think i've given
good advice in the past for sure this is actually really helpful for me and and even being able to
to see what it is that i have in my own relationship and being able to direct others into finding
something similar um how long does it take to identify for somebody to go in this is a this is
an addiction or and because we're really good at tricking ourselves and you know this doesn't
just apply to relationships but you know we may take a job or we may we make a lot of choices
and uh well technically every everything in our life is a relationship you know we take a job where
we're we're doing a thing in relationship with other people because everyone in the company
is a relationship and business is just a series of relationships so at what point are we
how long does it take for someone to spot this is you know an addiction versus you know uh growth
well you can actually notice the vector shift in the moment you can actually notice the quality
of being in the moment so am i relating to this thing in a way where my presence to the rest of
life is decreasing or my presence of the rest of life is increasing i'm doing a bodybuilding
competition and all i can think about is the bodybuilding competition and if i lose everything
sucks in life and i i actually don't really love the people in front of me actively and i
that might be an effective mindset to take to be obsessed about doing the bodybuilding thing but
here's your question does doing create being will you actually be meaningfully happy with who you
are at the end if you win no because on the becoming side right okay so i became buff but then
that's just gonna it's becoming forever so then it's i'm i'm not happy because it was only mr
world 90 to win mr universe or whatever so then it'll lead to more becoming it'll never lead to
being in that way unless the things i'm working on becoming are related to my being right i'm
actually evolving in my presence my character and so one of the key things is am i even evolving the
right things am i even focused on the evolution of the right things or do i have a wrong causation
belief i have the belief that this strategy is how i will then be happy and so i'm trying
to pursue happiness through how much money or how buff i get or something it is actually a
wrong causal strategy no amount like yes i might get richer yes i might get buffer no i won't get
happier that actually isn't related to a mechanic of happiness right and the happiness actually
accessible now so then do i still have a reason to get buff or do i realize that was actually just
nonsense maybe i do still have a reason to be buff but it might be a different one yeah
so your question around how when do you notice so kind of all the time you can notice
do i feel like my i am being more of who i really want to be your question and am i becoming more
of who i want to be because of the way i'm showing up in this relationship in this job in this
activity and if not if i'm being less of or becoming less of what i really most value switch
something yeah that's it's it sounds like a checking in process and i think that's that's
something that um we might want to look into doing more is how often are we checking in reflecting
on what's going on well this is what mindfulness means is that can become
continuous there can be a continuous noticing so there can be real time correction
because especially as one gets more powerful there so they're moving faster than
when they get a little bit off if they don't check in as fast they can get much further off
of what really matters right quickly so there's a good argument for the practice you know mindfulness
practice and it's an argument for why it's more important the more powerful you get
yeah absolutely it's the faster you're going the more steering matters
i've noticed that um what
what are your favorite mindfulness practices or what is your what is your preferred method
of improving mindfulness it's a huge topic right mindfulness basically means noticing
what are you noticing so i can be mindful of my breath and so i'm noticing my breath and the
process noticing my body realizing oh i wasn't i wasn't actually breathing very much or there's
tightness or pain in my body i haven't been paying attention to or there's a lot of anxiety
i wasn't paying attention to what do i want to do about that right that might help you
feel a lot better in your body might help you change things you need change might help you
live longer right because you notice something you tend to it um so there's you know there's
body-based mindfulness uh there's noticing your thoughts and noticing how many of your thoughts
are fundamentally in a positive empowering direction and how many of them are
basically have no meaningful utility right like they are negative but not negative in a
constructive way and then as soon as you notice that when you don't notice it you really have no
choice because it's just an automated program running itself out you didn't choose the moment
you notice it choice enters the possibility for choice enters you can say well do those thoughts
affect how i feel yes do they affect how i perceive yes do they affect how i act yes so how do i want
to shift the thoughts so that i perceive and act and feel differently you can notice your emotions
similarly and say oh when i notice i'm feeling angry or agitated etc then i want to actually stop
and see what i can do to shift my state and recenter because if i'm acting from that state
that's going to be subtly affecting how i perceive and how i behave there's a lot of things you can
notice you can notice that we're talking about here being in relationship and your own sense of being
on path and being in relationship and how those relate to each other so there's a lot of good
mindfulness practices for various aspects of it and they cross apply right just increasing
awareness is valuable but i would say a very deep one is if someone takes some time to write
around being like you were saying want to be a person that invokes people's trust and is worthy
of it want to be a person who has character that leads to me being a support and a pillar for the
community not because i asked to be but because people just recognize that i show up in a way
that supports you but so you kind of look who do i really want to be and then what do i how do i most
want to become what i most want to do what are the things i really want to contribute to and
and you mind this and then you ask why on all these things and you say how much of that is still
because of some unconscious shit that my parents taught me how much of it is still because i'm
insecure and don't think i'm enough and this is my compensation strategy and then you see can i let
that go and then what do i actually want underneath that and you get deeper and deeper of what do i
really value and then your mindful of is what i'm doing right now is what i'm thinking right now
is the state i'm in right now aligned with what i most deeply value and if so great and if not shift
simplicity i think that's uh it's probably one of the not probably i think that's the best
explanation around mindfulness and the argument for why you might pick up a meditation practice
which is a practice of noticing
wit um
there's not yeah there's not intentional plug even but the supplement qualia which you created
i've been taking it for a year i've noticed that it has helped create an expanded awareness
um for myself and then i would say my wife even like what she's reported has been much more dramatic
even um so that there there's
it's taking a supplement like that adding if you're not having that mindfulness practice and
just taking it unconsciously you're gonna fire the rocket in the wrong direction
could yeah um
we've had many people describe uh being on qualia and uh finding that the effect it had
on neurochemistry getting more balanced for them actually helped them get clear where they weren't
before because it helped shift their state and so as they were shifting out of agitation or anger
depression or whatever uh into more centered empowered states that none of these are medical
claims make no medical claims but this is what people reported uh some of their experience
that it led to them being able to hold clarity more and you know etc many people because there's
there's things for the the body's endocrine system to balance it out so you're less likely to get
swayed by triggers uh so or maybe we shouldn't get can you make these
types of comments i guess let me finish where it was not come back to explaining the mechanism
because uh it's all relevant so other people have described that when they feel on right they feel
generally centered they take qualia they feel a lot better they feel like they have more power
nitrous run into the system when they are off they're angry they're agitated wherever they
take qualia then they feel more empowered but they're not directing it in in a way right like
they're they're not directing their thoughts very sovereignly and so now they actually feel
kind of more of that going on so for most people it has been supportive for them coming to center
if they are not but for some people uh the order of operations is sets that more centering would be
more software side would be you know relevant first or at least in conjunction with what you think
about it and related back to like what would a supplement have to do with anything we're talking
about if you think of the brain and the associated rest of the physiology as the hardware right the
bio hardware that the uh kind of software of thought and emotion is running on except that the
division between hardware and software and computers is a hard one right the software is not
affecting the hardware the hardware has to be adequate to the software to run on it and us
every time you change the physiology it automatically changes the predispositions for
thinking and feeling and every time you have a thought or a feeling it is actually an electrochemical
process that is then changing physiology so they it's all kind of firmware that's
center affecting each other yeah it's not fair to think about it as a typical computer it's not
that distinct but it is a fine starting place to say that most of what we call psychology is on the
software side of the gradient it's a gradient rather than a hard binary right and so it's a
the the psychology is looking at what do you focus on what meaning do you make from things
you know etc so mindfulness also would fit in there that most medicine and biohacking neurohacking
bio physical optimization is focused on the hardware side of things but these automatically
inter-effect each other because everyone has experienced having their body out of balance
having a headache or their hormones are out or hangover or whatever where your physiology affects
your psyche no doubt and you're angry or you're depressed or whatever because of a physiologic
process people have also noticed when their physiology feels great say they recover from
a sickness now they feel good in their body again how that automatically affects their psyche
right we also have noticed where you get really stressed out psychologically and you get sick
right or you feel great psychologically and you feel increased energy so you can see that there's
this psychoneuro interface where body and mind bi directionally inter-effect each other so the
optimal process is to pull the levers one can in both simultaneously leading to virtuous feedback
loops and upcycling so how do i work with my focus to focus on empowering things how do i work with
my meaning to create empowering meaning to that which i'm focusing on how do i work with my just
energetic state through uh visualization through breath through subtle kinds of movements etc how
do i work with my body through chemistry health diet fitness supplementation where each of these
lead to a system that is up regulating inter-affecting all the other aspects so qualia is something that
the first product that we designed in neurohacker collective to help up regulate certain aspects
of neurochemistry and neurophysiology so that the hardware that is mediating thought and emotion
is uh both more in tune right more balanced and moving towards more net capacity through things
like neurogenesis development of more neurons development more synapses more actual computational
capability and the reason why we developed that and all the other products that were in process
of developing on the hardware side is the goal of neurohacker collective is actually evolving
sovereignty i mean helping evolve the collective sovereignty of humanity and we define sovereignty
as as the relationship between three different vectors and you know so we imagine three vectors
x y z axis perpendicular to each other one is intelligence one is agency one is sentience
so intelligence is our ability to understand things our ability to understand dichotomous
things together and how to optimize for both of them and write our ability to uh think critically
to think systemically to uh have a total body of knowledge that's meaningful memory intelligence
right agency is our ability to in this position to make choices or follow through our responsibility
or drive our resilience are all you know all the things that move us in universe and our
sentience is actually our depth of feeling and our feelings of ourself our feeling of
whether we really are in tune or not our depth of being right presence connection with uh life
in the moment and others our empathy and our ability to feel the people so you actually see
how agency very much relates to becoming and uh being and and sentience are very related and the
intelligence can help reconcile the relationships between those so if you think about evolving
sentience right evolving sentience fully starts to look like bodhisattva right looks like the
embodiment of deep compassion embodied awareness etc evolving intelligence looks like polymath
right like full genius across multiple spectrum evolving agency looks like power the ability to
have more power to actually create reality fully empowered bodhisattva polymaths we believe
are will be the new normal in the future and have to be the new normal in the future because
the scope of issues that the world is facing actually require people who are fully caring for
the whole have profound capabilities complex thinking problem solving capabilities and a
profound amount of agency to do to actually take care of a lot of shit right and so we define all
of those together the volume of the sphere defined by the shortest of those vectors uh as kind of
proportional semi proportional roughly to one sovereignty and so
what we're talking about here is you can also think of then that being and becoming are both
parts of defining the sphere of what matters right and the relationship between them being
becoming in the and the relationship between how we navigate those um yep
I'm gonna have to go back and listen to this show it's been uh I'm not sure I have anything left
um to ask I definitely want to have you back on for another round is there anything that you
want to mention or something I didn't ask that I should have asked I run into this a lot of times
when I'm talking to somebody who knows a lot more about what they're talking about than I do and
there's always no what question did I not ask that maybe I should have
there's a very meaningful application of this dichotomy and looking at the
world situation in the moment which is
is everything really fucked up or is everything actually
perfect right and everything tending to itself
and it's both and neither but it's actually again the cylinder isn't just both and neither
circle rectangle there's a deeper way of understanding what that means
we can look at how all the exponential technology you know your your phone has the
computational capability of super computer is not that long ago we can look at all the
all of the places where technology is giving us the capability of building better technology
faster that is enriching certain aspects of the quality of people's lives and when
they're tremendous metrics around how everything's getting better
the same time there's all these metrics regarding biodiversity loss
and ocean acidification and overarching environmental metrics problems and war that's
empowered by more and more powerful technology and where everything's getting worse
and you can cherry pick the data on either side you want no if you look at big enough data sets
things are getting exponentially worse and exponentially better at the same time
you say well what does that mean if things are getting exponentially better and exponentially
worse what because obviously neither of those and or the trajectory to project where we're
going what it means is the current system is destabilizing right things are moving
further and further away from a centerline the system is destabilizing because we have a world
system over archingly it is coming to the end of its life cycle to the end of its phase where we've
you know we've had a world system that had exponentially increasing population
with exponentially increasing resource per capita all based on extracting more and more
stuff exponentially more stuff from the earth each year and turning it into trash
how long can you run a linear materials economy where you take stuff out of the earth unrenewably
faster than it regenerates and then turn it into trash put it back in the earth on a finite planet
you know with an exponential rate of you can't run it that long and we basically are at the end
yeah so and yet that system has given the technologies and tools that are necessary
to build the next system right and so we're at this very interesting place where what is necessary
for the emergence of a new world it is at a radically higher quality of life possible for
everyone than has been possible so far is emerging but it will be a fundamental redesign of everything
of economics of governance of infrastructure of worldview we're also at a place where the
current world it really is ending and having to change and so then we it it feels antiquated
and i'm not sure if it's a generational thing on if every generation feels this
well no this is not just generational there's generational stuff but there's
there's since the plow we started removing stuff from earth faster than we were regenerating it
since the industrial revolution you know exponentially faster and we're actually talking
about the end of a phase that started then so it's not that long well not that long in evolutionary
terms but the entirety of what we call recorded history um yeah but yeah considering so from
evolutionary not long from yeah from human awareness of our own uh history standpoint
the whole of what we've had so far is a phase coming to an end which has been a phase defined by
finite games zero some games finite amount of resources and the total number of us are growing
and we're competing for those finite resources and if you have them i don't if i have them you don't
and so our answer is pull the resources out of nature faster and compete with each other
harder and now our tools of competition our tools of warfare are big enough to destroy the
entire planet and we our ability to pull the resources out is enough that it can also destroy
the whole planet so we've outgrown the playing field and so that game is coming to an end so
either we end with that game or we create a new game and the new game will be an infinite game
not a finite game it'll be a positive sum not a zero sum it'll be one where fundamentally our ability
to uh thrive and other visibility to thrive are not in opposition to each other yeah and that is
an economic model shift right it is a worldview shift it is and we could do another show just
focused on these topics that's exactly what i was going to suggest is i think we're going from the
micro to the macro but here's where we'll tie them together yeah we live in a time when
there is more
at stake than there has ever been where because of the magnitude of our technology we can all
affect more than anyone has ever been able to affect gondi couldn't put things on youtube and
get virality right um and so we we have the potential to affect things in a way that
it could actually contribute to moving in the direction of humans not continuing or a higher
quality of life than anyone has ever been able to realize emerging so this is this is the context
for all of us contemplating our becoming so the being side is i can access the same state of
timeless fullness and beauty now that people could in the time of buddha right is it the
churnal it's timeless and that can be a place i can access as respite and as fuel to then come in
to this actual time which is very different than the time of buddha or any other time
and say my becoming is not to win at a game that is dying
but is to actually try and help change the game what is my role what is the role that i could have
in self-actualizing in a way that serves not just me but all life
so i'll just leave that as a thought to tie the micro in the micro
i like that that's a that's a purpose worth pursuing i like that you know excellent thank you
for uh joining us tonight i um i think everyone is going to get a lot out of it like i said i'm
going to go back listen again and uh make sure i harvest this uh fully and i encourage everyone
that's listening to this to do the very same so thank you for joining us daniel thanks for
having me always fun coming and conversing
