Greetings everyone, welcome to another edition of the official Ronnie Landis podcast show.
I am of course your host Ronnie Landis.
Before we dive into today's epic incredible mind altering, mind expanding interview with
our guest Daniel Schmockenberger.
I want to drive a little bit of your attention to one of my favorite cognitive enhancing
brain boosting neuro protective products that I've ever come across.
We sometimes call these products, Neutropics, which are defined by either helping increase
vasodilation, which is blood flow to the brain, or increasing nerve growth factors, which
have implications in increasing white matter or glial cell production in the brain, which
we're coming to find out is actually most of what makes a healthy brain, and what helps
create that neurological syndication of communication networks in the brain via what are called
glial cells and micro glial cells, and nerve growth factors, which have to do with the
myelination of our nerves, of our nervous system, and memory and short term, long term
memory, all that kind of cool stuff that you can nerd out on for hours on end like I do.
There was an incredible product that I started playing with about a month and a half ago,
and this product is called Qualia, and I have to say Qualia has been qualified in my opinion
as the best Neutropic product I have ever experimented with in my life.
Literally the first time I tried it, it immediately balanced my mental emotional coherence.
I felt throughout the day more emotional resilience.
I felt more mental clarity, more mental endurance, like I could go through my entire day with
a level of cognitive, what's the word, not just almost like clairvoyance is an interesting
word that's coming to mind, but just clarity and mental endurance where I didn't run out
of mental bandwidth.
I could process things quicker and make those synaptic connections much quicker.
Sometimes we call that synaptogenesis, that's another interesting term that you can geek
out on as well, and I'm not making any claims about it, but giving my experience and the
experience of so many people that I have talked to about this product, it is by far the best
thing I've ever come across.
It is my favorite supplement by far.
The product is called Qualia, and it's by a company called Neurohacker, and I will invite
you to go to Neurohacker.com.
Look at the research behind the product, look and investigate a little bit, and if it resonates
with you and you want to experiment with it, you can actually use the coupon code HUMANPOTENTIAL,
which is my coupon code, HUMANPOTENTIAL, and you will receive 10% off your first order,
and you, I believe, will be very shockingly surprised at the positive effects not only
in the short term, but the long-term enduring positive effects that take place from this
product.
That's my experience, that's been the experience of many, many other people, and I invite you
to have an experience as well.
So let's move on with the interview.
Speaking of Neurohacker, the founder of Neurohacker Collective, Daniel Schmackenberger, is our
guest today.
And I have to say, Daniel is one of the most impressive polymaths that I have come across.
Polymath is a term to describe somebody that has achieved multidisciplinary mastery, meaning
a level of mastery in a multitude of disciplines.
And Daniel's just a really fun guy to talk to.
He is a very humble, grounded, down-to-earth, and very brilliant human being, to say the
least, and you'll get that sense when you're listening to this conversation.
This conversation goes in a plethora of directions, and it would almost be a disservice to even
try to explain this interview, just in a quick little snippet.
What I will say is that don't try to absorb everything right away.
The way that Daniel's mind works is like in a holographic nature.
That's why I felt that we could really have an incredible conversation together, because
my brain tends to work holographically, meaning that I can see multiple subjects or multiple
things in a constellation almost holographically projected in front of me.
And I know a lot of you listening to this have relayed similar experiences, which is
probably why a lot of you feel called towards my speaking style, and feel called towards
the guests that I bring on, because I only bring on people that I am impressed by, that
I support their work, and that I actually genuinely want to have a conversation with.
Otherwise, I'm not going to bring them on.
I'm not going to waste their time, my time, or your time.
And man, was this just an incredible download and transmission.
Wow, I'm actually going to refrain from trying to describe this interview in any more detail.
I really just want to invite you to have your own experience and kind of get the downloads
and insights that come to you.
So without further ado, that's it from me.
Let's bring on Daniel Schmackenberger and enjoy this conversation immensely.
Daniel is the director of research and development in a co-founder at Neurohacker Collective,
where he is focused on developing processes and technologies for advancing medicine and
human optimization.
He is particularly focused on personalized medicine, adequate approaches to complex illness,
and deepening our knowledge of how the human regulatory systems function, how they break
down, and how they can be supported to function with greater resilience.
Welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me, Ron.
I'm going to be here.
Yeah, I feel like it's been a long time coming, even though you and me just started really
connecting more personally.
As of recently, you've been on my radar for quite some time within the collective community
that we come from in Northern San Diego.
However, the more I go down the rabbit hole as these things tend to happen, the more people
around the country, even around the planet now, know of you, know of your work, know
of your products, qualia, which has just kind of accumulated on my radar until I finally
started playing with it, which I have to say, and I know we'll dive more into that product
and the work that you're doing with Neurohacker Collective, but I have to just say, as we
start out here, that is my single favorite cognitive enhancement product that I've ever
tried.
And yeah, I'm looking forward to diving into that as well as all the other interesting territory
that we're going to cover today.
Sounds fun.
Cool.
So the first place that I'd love to start is the origin story, which I've dug into a
little bit of yours just from certain podcasts that you've given.
And I have to say that you have a very unique and novel upbringing comparatively to, you
know, most people's upbringing, I would imagine.
And so maybe you could just share some of your background and the upbringing you had.
Sure.
So the novel upbringing, I imagine you mean I was, I was homeschooled growing up and I
was homeschooled by really thoughtful parents who had ideas about educational philosophy
and how child rearing and human actualization could work and wanted to experiment on their
kids, which was cool.
And so our homeschool was set up with no curriculum at all, no fixed curriculum.
So I did no social studies, math, English, et cetera, that were curriculum based.
The idea instead, which has become more popular recently with things like unschooling.
The approach that we have is still a little different.
It was to expose us to as much as possible to see what we were interested in and then
facilitate those interests as fully as possible.
And so topics that I didn't express interest in, I never really learned.
And so I didn't learn much about American history as a child because it wasn't an area
where my interest just naturally peaked.
And I never learned state capitals, et cetera.
I didn't learn much in the way of spelling.
My handwriting never got legible.
But I did go deep in most of the sciences very early and in most of the philosophic
traditions and in many areas of activism, and that was kind of the braid that all my
interests fit into.
And the kind of educational philosophy idea was that kids are intrinsically interested,
curious, that there was evolutionary benefit to being curious, to being fascinated.
And that if we facilitate their fascination, not only do they become masterful at things
because they put a lot of cycles of earnest attention and energy because they're intrinsically
motivated, but their interest in life continues to develop, passion life continues to develop.
When you don't facilitate kids' interests and you try to force them to do shit that
they're not interested in, that's how you kind of break people's interest in life and
they just want to veg out and watch TV.
So that ended up being true in my case.
And one of the things that was real interesting was since I didn't have specific subjects,
there was no division between biology, chemistry, physics, philosophy.
So it was an inquiry into the nature of something and asking why that is enough times usually
led a trip around the universe, asking questions about why plants grew, that led to soil biology,
that led to microbiology, that led to understanding what the minerals were and how they were formed
in supernovas and that meant astrophysics and cosmology got into relativity and modern
physics and etc.
So that led to not only kind of a study across a lot of areas, but the relationship between
those areas.
So interdisciplinary science, but more than that system science and the deeper philosophy
of why does universe work the way that it does across all of those different domains,
which is where the underpinning was really in the philosophic system.
So that was a little bit about the background and my dad was largely interested in science
and philosophy, so I got a lot of support there.
My mom was interested in the arts and the humanities and activism and so as far as exposure
goes she took me to work with Greenpeace and PETA and Amnesty International and those
kinds of things early.
And so the impulse was from earliest on I can remember and I see this impulse in all
the kids that I interact with and it'll express in totally unique ways and my brother expressed
very differently, but the impulse was the same was to understand the nature of the reality
we live in, to understand what is ultimately meaningful and to see how we can uniquely
contribute to it in the way that is the most meaningful time for us.
So that's a little bit about the childhood part.
And who are some of your mentors that you paid attention to during your upbringing and as
your curiosity and fascination on all these different subject matter grew, who are some
of the people that kind of come to your mind immediately that played a big role in your
kind of fascination?
Well, there are people that I actually physically met who are mentors, but early on the kind
of deepest influences were just the philosopher, scientists, teachers that I was fascinated
by and that got to be the basis of my curriculum.
So the first name that comes to mind as being probably the most significant early intellectual
influence made was Buck Mr. Fuller and as one of my dad's great heroes, Bucky's work
was my probably most common early bedtime story as a kid even before I was verbal.
And one of the things is like as hard as it might seem for us as adults to learn a new
language and especially a very different language, say Mandarin, baby who grows up hearing it
learns it no problem.
Well, in the same way, if we grow up hearing the kinds of words that are in children's
books, we'll learn those if we grow up hearing different kinds of words, we'll learn those
just as easily.
And so, you know, my early words had a lot to do with synergetic geometry and integrity
and because that's what I was exposed to.
And so Buck Mr. Fuller and design science and specifically looking at how to design technology
that is both modeled after how nature works and that intentionally works in alignment
with complex adaptive systems, core part of my early childhood development.
And then a lot of the systems thinkers advance and popularize systems thinking.
So Fritschoff, Capra, Irvin Laszlo, the people who developed auto poesis theory, self-organization,
complex adaptive systems, Stuart Kaufman, all those kind of guys, you know, obviously
the bit of TV that came in was Cosmos and Carl Sagan.
And you know, in the Eastern tradition, for very deep for me.
So I got to live in Fairfield, Iowa, in the Princeton Medical Community for the first
six years of life.
And so Maharishi, Maheshogi, the kind of one of the people that brought Eastern philosophy
to the West, he was a meaningful early influence and that then led to lots of Eastern philosophy.
Western philosophy came a little bit after that.
And then, you know, the great activists, Gandhi was a very deep and profound early influence.
Many examples, but I was fortunate to have examples of great role models.
Yeah, I really, and I really appreciate what you're sharing about the natural curiosity
and fascination that children have with learning.
And one of the things that I really feel like I've been a voice for just in the subtle
realms of my work, maybe when I go off on tangents or something or I'm working with parents
in particular, I tend to really focus in on a child's innate, well, not even just children,
but people's innate tendencies, what are they naturally gravitating towards?
And if they are given, I guess, I don't know, the permission slip or they're given encouragement
to pursue those things, their intrinsic genius starts to kind of come about where, you know,
for example, our industrial education system doesn't foster that type of environment, right?
It's just kind of rinse, repeat, memorize, and, you know, focus on the end result being
a grade on your paper.
And so I feel as though this conversation is really important and just for just to maybe
plan a seed in people's mind that whatever we're naturally curious about is leading us
towards our intrinsic genius.
Does that sound about right to you?
Yeah, so to just kind of piggyback on that a little bit, so the extension beyond childhood
and home school for me was when I started college, and again, I was well-facilitated,
so I was fortunate to get to start college in the university young.
I had no intention of getting degrees, and I had no idea what I planned on doing with
any of the knowledge in a kind of vocation sense.
I knew I was interested in understanding reality and being empowered by that to help shape civilization,
but I didn't know what that looked like yet.
I didn't know enough, so I got into mathematics, and it was just, I was just passionate about
understanding how these maximally abstracted principles of order and relationship work,
and so I just dove into mathematics and had all math classes at the same time.
And my parents did ask you, so do you want to be a mathematician?
I just, I wasn't thinking that way at all, I was thinking that there was deep innate
fascination for me in understanding this, and at a certain point, I by no means understood
all that one could understand in mathematics, which isn't even possible, but I got to a
place where I understood math well enough that what the impulse that was driving me
there had found a certain kind of completion.
It wasn't actually just to work in math, it was to understand how to think through induction
and deduction and formal logic and abstraction, and you know, et cetera, to understand the
language that the science has operated in, and as soon as that happened, my attention
moved, my fascination was in physics, and then all of my attention was just kind of
deep diving, and then it moved to Vedantic philosophy, it moved to medicine, it moved
to ecology, and some people could think that that was lack of focus, and it was so clearly
not to me, it was following a kind of natural process that I wasn't crystal clear on, I
knew was trending towards accumulating the skills and capacities and insights necessary
to do what was going to be mine to do, even though I didn't know exactly what that was,
but pretty much as soon as an area would reach a completion of what I needed to do with it,
my attention moved to the next thing, until there was an adequate body of capacities that
I could actually put together what was really mine to do, which had to do with whole systems
designed at the level of civilization, how do we fundamentally redesign the core axioms
of civilization, what is the future of macroeconomics, post capitalism look like, that has incentives
that don't externalize on, what is the future of governance that has adequate decisions
making capacity to the scope of decisions that we have to make in the future look like,
it was a future of infrastructure look like, my focus was a whole system civilization design,
and even though I entuited that, I couldn't have said that, but it actually needed the skills of
all of those things that I worked in, there was a deeper than conscious process guiding that,
that was pretty much what my fascination was, and so being allowed to follow that was a gift
that I wish for everyone.
Yeah, yeah, very well explained, and that's exactly what I wish for everyone too, and it's
funny what you mentioned about kind of the hopscotch-ing model of self-interest-based education,
because when I look back on my life, it's very much the same thing, I was raised as a martial
artist, which caused me to be intimately exposed to Eastern philosophy, and many different
modalities in that world, and then eventually, you know, the last, I would say, eight or nine years
I've been more interested in science, and then learning the language of science, or different
formats of science, for example, where growing up that wasn't something that I was interested in,
so I naturally didn't have a proclivity towards it, so therefore I didn't apply myself, and teachers
probably assumed that, I don't think I was ever assumed like quote unquote dumb, I was just like,
maybe I was assumed just really bored, or like all I wanted to do was go on a track and field and run
or work out or something, however I do realize though, as I got older, the link between this
subject matter being different forms of science and things that I previously was not interested in,
the link between that and my purpose now had been created, therefore now there's more of a natural
proclivity to apply myself, because now I see how that matches up with what I believe that I'm here
to do on the earth, so I think that's really fascinating, and I want to use this as a segue,
I really love what you're sharing, I want to use this as a segue to go into some of the principles
that you share in some of your talks to further expand upon just kind of what your philosophy
or the philosophy that I think you're working from is about, so maybe we can give the audience a
basic foundational understanding on your perspectives around the principles of emergence and omni
consideration. Sure, great topics, so omni consideration is
as inclusive a word as I can think of, for if we have to kind of bring it to a single word,
core value or guiding principle on the consideration is the closest that I could get, which is how do
we think about everything that is affected and impacted by any decision, and how do we care,
so how do we care about it, and then think through the actual causation well and factor
the well-being of everything that is affected in every choice made, and so why would that even be
relevant? Well, it's relevant when we recognize the first step of relevance is when we recognize
that we live in an interconnected universe, that on our biosphere we live in a very interconnected
biosphere, that our technology is big enough that we're affecting things across the whole
biosphere in real time, we're making purchases that are affecting supply chains on most of the
continents, and that there really is no such thing as a way wherever our trash goes, there
really is no such thing as others where however their quality of life is being affected that's
leading to their patterns of behavior is leading to how they're affecting the oceans and ecosystems
that we're all fundamentally interconnected with, and so pre-industrial revolution when there was
less than a half a billion people and we didn't have much technology, there's a different set of
rules in that evolutionary environment for it was possible to have win-lose games, it wasn't a
good idea but it was possible and we did that, so resource issues, one tribe could kill another
tribe to have access to the resource, and that could work. When you get to the level of technology
where we're at now where it went from we have conflict and if we can't figure it out we'll
kill each other and we're using stones and then we're using spears then we're using bow and arrows
and we're using guns and we're using missiles, as soon as we're dealing with nuclear weapons,
weapons of mass destruction our weapons are actually bigger than the playing field can manage
and the wars are not winnable, when we're cutting down trees unrenewably but there's just not that
many of us were cutting down with an axe, it's one thing, when we're slashing, burning an acre
a second it's a different thing, and so we've got the resource per capita utilization we have now,
times seven billion people, the same way of when at the expense of the environment or when at the
expense of each other, well at the expense of the environment means now the life support system of
the planet can't continue to support us and we don't exist and at the expense of each other means
unwinnable wars, we've basically got a level of power that has obsolete when lose games being
possible anymore, they're not even possible, so now we can continue to try and have lose lose games
or we have to switch to fundamentally win-win games which are not zero sum, which are fundamentally
positive sum and there's just a totally different set of behavioral mechanics, set of thought processes,
set of dynamics, so omniconsiderate, part of the driver is we actually don't continue as a species
without moving into omniconsideration because if we don't contemplate the welfare of the ocean,
so we continue to do agriculture in a way that has nitrogen runoff, leads to growing dead
zones in the oceans and continue to do carbon emissions in a way that leads to ocean acidification
and warming kills the coral, we don't keep existing, if we continue to do fishing in a way
that over fishes the populations and so this is a key concept is we are used to in modern times
the West specifically thinking of ourselves as individuals, so I can think of me as if that's
a separatable concept and that I can think about my own success separate from the success of everything
else well it's important to get that's actually a nonsense concept it seems like it's a meaningful
concept but the only reason that I can think about me at all is because there's a biosphere that allows
me to exist and I just have to take that for granted and say well of course there's a biosphere
let's talk about me but if there's no biosphere there's no me right so without oxygen I don't mean
much without the plants that make the oxygen I don't mean much without the soil microbes that
make the plants possible make the oxygen without all of the people that have come before me that
have created the technology that I utilize that have created the language that creates the linguistic
structure of thought through which I think and perceive the world than me that I think of as
me wouldn't exist at all and so I get I'm actually not separatable from all of that I'm not an individual
I'm an emergent property of the whole and as soon as I get that I am I as an individual is actually
just a bad thought that is a misnomer right it's not understanding the dynamics well then the idea
of separate interest just becomes nonsense because if I don't exist without plants me damaging plans
to advantage my existence doesn't make that much sense right and especially as we get to the point
where we've damaged plants enough that we are close to tipping points of it not just being a bad
idea but it being an existential idea and so on the consideration is actually requisite
for our continued survival as a species this is this is a big deal it you know we think of
jesus or buddha like characters that we would say kind of had this on the consideration of
character the welfare of all sentient beings but they were extreme outliers as we move to the
place where exponential technology is increasing the impact that all humans can have and it's
increasing it exponentially how can we continue to have exponentially more impact without having
exponentially better choice making and continue to make it or we don't and so we are our choice
making being omnipositive which would be the result of it being on the consider right thinking
it may consider a process could lead to omnipositive results in a world that is this
interconnected and with this much scope of impact that is actually the only way to
continue making it so this this is a big deal because what we're saying is in the face of
exponent in the face of population and in the face of more specifically exponential technology
it's as if you know we can use the metaphor that we are merging into having the power of gods
well the power of gods you better have the wisdom and the love and the discernment of gods or you
self-destruct and so exponential technology necessitates that omniconciderate humans become
the new normal in the next very short period of time that's like that's like human beings three
point out that's like the the next logical and necessary upgrade to the humanoid template
which we currently are are experiencing however whatever your perspective is spiritually whether
we're just souls carting around in this this meat suit or this avatar like vessel or whatever the
particular perspective is the reality is that we need to go through some sort of quantum leap
evolutionary process within this generation which is and maybe it's just a consciousness
upgrade that that ripples throughout the whole system which is this omniconcideration model versus
this self-consideration this this self-centric model in which and which I think we've largely
been conditioned with right because when somebody you know as a biological symbiotic kind of organism
the the uh what's the word I'm trying to find it's the program or the tendency is cooperation
right it's not competition it's not survival the fittest it's adaptability and cooperation so
naturally we want to work together naturally we want we want the best welfare for all for for
everyone in all creatures however it just seems to me that we have been culturally conditioned
to focus on ourselves because of the illusion or maybe not so much the illusion in some cases of
scarcity so let's let's think about the narrative of how we got here and I'm going to radically
oversimplify it to just share one of the causal through lines so say we go to shortly after the
plow and agriculture and early civilizations and they they differentiated in different ways as we
would see people do and you know cultures do today we'd expect and for whatever reasons environmental
reasons and etc you have some cultures that were more focused on the arts and the humanities and
spiritual traditions and less focused on militaries and expanding their territory and yet other ones
that were focused on the other side of that and you can imagine it was a natural gradient of those
possibilities for a number of reasons and so we see a history of you know we see archaeology of
metrophocal matriarchal societies that had less violence that were more peace-loving as a result
they invested less in their militaries and more in their arts and then whenever a militarized culture
met a more peaceful culture they killed the peaceful culture and took their stuff and became
and then applied their stuff to their increased militarized capacity and continued on and then
when a couple violent militarized cultures met the more successful one on a battlefield one and again
assimilated the stuff of the other ones and continued and so there was a natural selection
that occurred but it was a natural selection of dominance capacity one and war and one in
economic competition and again economic competition ended up meaning how quickly we could extract
resources from the ecosystem regardless of how whether they were regenerating or not and so we'd
have more economic capacity if we could pull grains out even if it was diverse diverse
desertifying soil or if we could pull out coal or oil depending upon the time period we were at
and so what that means is because nature didn't have a balance sheet the better that we raked the
environment and externalized harm to it the more industrious we were and so the better that we
competed in the free market and the better we competed at war the better we did in that way
so there was this kind of natural selection of effective cooperation of an in-group in its
competition with all out-group which meant its effective dominance capacity and so we can see
how we got here that way but that wasn't a conscious selection of what is actually going to be
enduringly sustainable and viable or that was true good and beautiful into the future it was a
unconscious selection of what had dominance capacity now and as we continue where our ability
to extract resources from the environment has hit tipping points of moving past peak resource on a
bunch of key resources we can't continue with that success strategy we're almost out of the
ability to do that with many areas which means you've got an exponential curve up and then you hit
a cliff and then it drops off you know we went from half a billion people for all of hominid history
before the industrial revolution and the industrial revolution's ability to extract resources from
the earth much faster we've got that you know almost 7.2 billion people in the blink of an eye
and that population increase was not based on renewable resource utilization but extraction
of planetary savings accounts that were not renewing and so again you when you hit the the
tipping point then you get extreme drop-off and we're right there or you get some fundamental
civilization restructuring which we can talk about and so you know that has been the selection
criteria and what's interesting is we can't continue resource extraction or harm externalization
to the environment like we've done and we can't continue to win wars where our technological
capacity in military is too big for any war to be winnable and so what is how we've dealt with
these things for all of civilization since agriculture till now is not a way we can continue
to deal with it so we're looking at a phase shift for civilization that is deeper than anything we
have in in all of recorded history and this is a big deal this is a big deal for us to get
one of the things that's so interesting is it when we think about evolution as this kind of
algorithmic process of what ends up being adaptive now in an environment but that leads to increased
orderly complexity we get the orderly complexity of prefrontal courtesies in humans and now with
all the information we have where we actually have the capacity with abstraction to think about
things like evolution itself and where it's trending and have the capacity for omni consideration
where rather than just being parts of a big evolutionary dynamic we can actually choose
to participate with the evolution of the whole we can become stewards of the evolution of the whole
and not just focus on what's adaptive now but what is a true and good and beautiful feature
that we're interested in creating and I would say this is one way to think about the phase shift
is a phase shift from unconscious algorithmic evolution of what's adaptive now based on dominance
to a conscious evolution mediated by conscious agents that factors a forecasted future of the
true the good and the beautiful for everyone right this omni considerate and sustainable
regenerative etc and so evolution itself is evolving to being a more consciously agentically
mediated process where we become stewards of evolution I think this is a key way of thinking
about the phase transition we're at right now yeah yeah absolutely I um what comes to mind is the
the famous book The Holographic Universe did you ever read that book by Michael Talbot Talbot
yeah what do you what do you think about that idea because everything I hear I kind of maybe
it's because I have my own cognitive bias because I'm I'm redirecting certain concepts back into
an holographic perspective when I hear things like emergence when I hear macro and micro when I hear
omni consideration which to me translates into the fact that our thoughts words and deeds affect the
whole yeah I'm curious what what's your you know what's your perspective on that whole thing
there are hundreds of self-similarity at all scales uh holograms are one way of thinking about
self-similarity uh and fractals are another way um things like the construct a law or other ways
of looking at you know branching dynamics whether it's a cardiovascular system or a river network
or a tree group network um so we see patterns of kind of similar structures um across scale and
across areas because they have to do the deep structures in the nature of reality so as far
as this goes we look at a holographic on the scale of what is in the highest good of a person
and what's in the highest good of all people and what's in the highest good of all life when you
factor all the cause and effect feedback loops will always be the same thing yeah it might seem
like it's possible to benefit yourself at the expense of somebody else or the expense of your
future self that's only because you're not factoring some of the cause and effect feedback loops of
wherever you externalize harm actually as you continue to follow where that harm goes will come
back to affect you when you factor all of it it's kind of like you know cancer cells start
having their own agency their own kind of process of growth and development be decoupled
from their relationship with all the other cells around them and the net result is if
they're successful and they kill the body then they die too and so it actually doesn't end up
being a net good deal for them right but it it happened because they were damaged right some
radical oxidative damage occurred and so they lost some meaningful capacity for self-regulation
and right now we can think about humans uh you know at the level of nations at the level of
corporations at the level of individual humans lacking some of the capacities necessary to
regulate and make choices in a way that is good for them in the whole simultaneously and the
development of those capacities is key to what we need to do so this is a good opportunity for me
to switch into this lane which is um well i would just love actually just to dive into your personal
views on vegetarianism and veganism as lifestyle models as our collective population moves more
into a conscious awareness of sentience and moves away from a culture that seems to be so heavily
invested in its own demise how do you see things like vegetarianism and veganism as models fitting
into that super important deep complex difficult question yeah i i want to say this because i don't
want to handle the topic without the nuance that it deserves it's very easy to say vegetarianism
and veganism is a comprehensively better way uh because of the ethics of the you know how we
relate to other sentient beings because of the environmental load and impact of factory farming
or in general converting plant biomatter to animal biomatter there's a you know there's a those
arguments are easy to make and i'm compelled by all of them i i uh saw a factory farm slaughter
truck as a little kid saw animals that were in gruesome conditions was horrified by it
had always loved animals and loved meat without really realizing how those together that well
growing up like most people and did a deep dive right then read john robbins died for new america
got into pita and then you know vegetarianism and animal activism and you know became a deep
part of my life focus um that said the critiques that uh you know the book the vegetarian myth
and the critiques that um uh you know the people in the paleo world and uh etc will give
some of them are also meaningful and well founded and uh so i i want to address is it just about
plant-based versus animal-based uh no of course not the argument that if people are eating uh
sustainably grown organic mixed farm uh animal protein compared to conventional agriculture
that is you know plant-based food that is you know pouring glyphosate into the atmosphere and
destroying ecosystems for row crop then arguably the animal uh agriculture is both more you know
sustainable and actually maybe even kills less net animals and what it took to make that agricultural
space this is totally true is it uh true that for some people being healthy is easier with
certain animal products in their diet this is definitely true for many people uh being vegetarian
is actually easier to be healthy um but for some people for various reasons uh whether it has to do
with um amino acids fatty acids uh heme iron etc some people actually have a much harder time being
healthy on a vegetarian especially vegan diet especially if they don't know how well and so
then we deal with the ethics of their own kind of suffering so i just want to say that i think
the topic is really important and warrants uh nuance in its handling i think there are core
axioms of the whole conversation that are about to change because i think um manufactured meat
stem cell generated meat is going to be a game-changing technology uh where people who for
um health reasons that they feel that they need it or for taste reasons or for whatever want to eat
animal protein would have the ability to do that without the environmental implications of
traditional animal agriculture and without uh the ethical implications of something that
ever had nervous system um and where the uh energy input per kilo of meat generated is
actually profoundly low obviously there's a lot of work to do to dial in the the micronutrition of
it but the combination of that with better uh you know aeroponics and other um agriculture
methods for plant matter i think is necessary to be able to feed all of the world's people
renewably healthily um whether someone ultimately at this point ends up choosing to include some
animals in their diet whether they say okay i'm cool with fish but not above or i'm cool with
you know even peter singer was in the conversation about should we be cool with
oysters and clams and mussels divide by valve creatures because there's you know argument
around do they feel do they feel pain um does it happen and how do we know does it do insects
you know cricket flower cricket flower you can actually produce a whole lot of protein
and with a small amount of energy you know per acre which has a lot of environmental benefits
but do do they feel pain do we know is it is it based on nerves is it based on opiate receptors
is it based on movement dynamics so i would say there are ethically deep questions here
and they are being explored and they should be explored so whether people decide that they
don't eat any animal products at all or they will eat non-kill animal products so they'll eat
kill things below the certain level of nervous system development they feel good with and you
ask questions like well what about fungus fungus isn't a plant or an animal what about
you know or they decide that they are comfortable with mammals so long as they hunt them or
wherever they decide to be with it thinking through it and feeling through it deeply for their own
ethical alignment is key and um i don't think anyone can think and feel through it deeply
and decide that they feel good about the ethics of factory farms i don't that's possible um and
as far as the ethics goes while there's a lot of nuance to it i think the pie slice theorem is a
really good place to start right which is if we're if we're gonna be uh cutting something in half
and sharing it generally the rule of thumb goes i cut it in half and you pick or you cut it in
half and i pick but not i cut it in half and then i pick because then i'll cut it unevenly and pick
the big stuff right um so the question is would would i it would i trade places and a part of an
ethical relationship is that both sides are benefit begin to win win dynamic that we'd be happy to
trade places because we actually feel good about the experience of both sides of any interactions
we have to say when i think into the sentient experience of this animal and the way that i'm
relating with them would i trade places and do i feel okay about my effect on their sentient
experience and uh we could do a whole podcast to go deeper but i think asking that question
earnestly is a starting point i'd encourage for everybody yeah i i really i really appreciate
that perspective i was recently on a podcast where someone was asking me a very similar question
just my ethics around plant-based diets and vegan and vegetarianism and as he was talking
two quotes came to mind that really encapsulated my general perspective one of them was the
ahimsa quote from the the eight yams the eight limbs of yoga philosophy and which is basically
do no harm to others and do no harm to ourself and a lot of times that quote is actually taken
out of context it's just do no harm to others but it also has followed up with the do no harm to
ourselves which i think is part of what you're sharing is that there's a there's a consideration
for loving others loving other creatures and loving ourself enough to make sure that we
are covering our bases making sure that we cover our blind spots as a sustainable
biological organism so we're healthy and vibrant um and then the other quote that came up for me was
by the the great alchemist paracelsus who said that everything is poison everything is panacea
it depends on dosage so that quote came up for me because i said you know if someone chooses
to consume meat and flesh products and animal products that's their own that's part of their
own riddle you know nutrition is largely a riddle so you know i i feel like a lot of it really has
to do with dosage you know in terms of uh meat products my personal philosophy is if somebody
is going to do that let's make that a condiment instead of a main course let's do it therapeutically
instead of with with gluttony yeah i think
if if one factors particularly the first quote that you shared and they say okay
my goal is to reduce unnecessary suffering and harm to all life me and other life
and to optimize quality of life for me and all other life and then how do i make decisions
aligned with that if i can be uh vibrantly healthy on just plant matter and i have good
reasons to believe that um less suffering happens as a result of just eating plant matter than eating
plant and animal matter uh because more evolved complexity in animals than in plants nervous
system you know more capacity for response also means more capacity for sensing more capacity
for pain for suffering and the animal was eating how many plants they were uh you know in terms of
the agricultural feed to get there in the first place so you know if you bring up the argument
about what about the sentience of plants you've done more plant damage by moving the plants
through animals so you know it's a pretty easy argument to make if if uh if one can
not eat animal products and do well then it seems ethically necessary to do so if one
does not know how to eat only plant products and do well and so where if they only ate plant
products they would be suffering and they would meaning they'd have uh less vital health or
actual acute health issues and less capacity to do the things that would then enrich quality of life
for others then it would be an ethical issue not to but that doesn't automatically mean
carte blanche great eat as much fat requirement as you want right there is a lack of nuance that i
think uh is pretty common where hardcore vegan is an easy position and i eat meat is an easy position
the point of view that says there are times where i feel that it's therapeutically relevant to
increase mickey myron or my uh animal proteins or whatever and i'm going to do the least amount of it
in the least evolved forms of life um you know from the most humane sourcing i can
is very different than just a carte blanche eight animals right right so i'm going to take this
opportunity to pivot for the sake of time and um we've gone down a few low rabbit holes which have
been cool and i want to create the container for the rest of this interview to dive into
the qualia product in anything around kind of this idea around neuro hacking actually
before we dive into the particular product that you helped formulate which i think is
absolutely brilliant and very sophisticated which is why i wanted one of the reasons i
wanted to bring you on is to share the details of it um as we get into that can you share with us
your interest in quote unquote neuro hacking as it's popularly called
yeah so neuro hacking for us uh really means uh optimizing neurologic function and optimizing
mind brain interface capabilities so we think of bio hacking generally meaning uh any way of
increasing function of the biologic system and you know bio hacking could really just be synonymous
with um good health care uh and good well-being uh i think part of why the term hacking has caught
on in the hacker ethos is the hacker ethos was a little bit counter authoritarianism right so
there's much authoritarianism in the medical establishment process that uh because of its
inability to address complex illness and the people that have suffered from it while still having
you know uh authorities hold a lot of rain on what they think people shouldn't do as well as
its inability to you know really help people optimize there's this kind of um the the hacking
wasn't like nature is the main frame and we have to hack it it's we want to work with nature but
we're we are working um around establishment uh i think that's one of the reasons that the term
caught on another idea was that somebody could hack a computer system without understanding all
of the computer system they just had to understand ways of getting in which ended up meaning a lot
less information to still have a lot of capability so uh i think one of the other ideas in bio hacking
in consciousness hacking girl hacking all those terms was uh the the least amounted input necessary
to create meaningful output change so that's i just i don't mean to interrupt but that i'm just
glad you said it that way because my pet peeve is about the last the least amount of effort to get
the most amount of output so i'm glad you phrased it that way your pet peeve is thinking that way
no my pet peeve is other people using the term hacking like bio hacking or business hacking or
life hacking as a way to get as a way to put in the least amount in effort to get the most
amount of result and i think you know i think tim ferris kind of maybe did more than anybody at
first to popularize that idea productivity hack lifehackling with the four hour work week and the
idea of hey can i automate a lifestyle for myself with uh you know not as much time and then can i
apply that to body and other things and the idea of the Pareto principle of there is a
relatively small subset of all the things one could do in a space that can lead to much of the
results of the space and let's start there it's a good principle now if there's 20 percent of the
stuff you can do that will lead to 80 percent of the results if you really care about the area
you're not happy with 80 percent of the results um and so you know when you think about just increased
leverage right where less input can create more output that doesn't necessarily mean you
continue to do less input it might mean you just start getting exponentially more output because
you care more and you continue to invest a lot with just higher leverage strategies
right beautiful so neural hacking you know why it's interesting for us what is interesting for
me is when i looked at all of the uh dynamics in the world that we wanted to affect at a
macro level looked at um war and religious differences and violence and biodiversity
loss and you know etc it is pretty easy to see that one of the common denominators across all
those issues in different sectors was that they were all being mediated by human behavior
and that in order to change any of them we had to change human behavior at scale
and that all the solutions we needed were going to be brought about by human behavior
or they weren't right and so what are all the things that influence human behavior to directly
cause harm to indirectly externalize harm to uh work on solutions to work on solutions effectively
right like what are all the things that influence those capacities and those predispositions
well it's the social systems do economics and what you incentivize has a huge effect
the environment and the environmental psychology influences have a huge effect
our psychology our worldview our definition of success definition of self another has a huge
effect you know our trauma and all like that but our physiology has a huge effect and that was the
part that we wanted to address here uh we're used to thinking of kind of a nature nurture divide
where nature is assumed to mean something like genetics and is fairly unchangeable and
nurture equals other stuff but this is of course a very outdated way of thinking about it um
our genetics mostly selected for neuroplasticity we don't run fast like cheetahs we don't fly like
birds we don't swim very well like fish we don't really have many specialist capacities that are
physiologically built in but we can make tools that do any of those things better than specialists
right we can begin with our tools go faster than cheetahs slide faster than birds go deeper
underwater than whales um etc the strings of a gorilla is nothing compared to that of a hydraulic
press and so we selected for the capacity to do abstraction and develop tools and extend
ourselves to those tools for that tools those tools meant we were going to change our environment
rapidly which meant if we had fixed wiring when we were adapted to our evolutionary environment we
would be unadapted to the new worlds that we'd create so we had to have very little hard wiring
so that we could soft wire to the new environments we were creating which is why we're pretty much
useless for the first year of our life compared to a gorilla that can do stuff in the first
five minutes of course it's up and walking in the first few minutes is because we're born very
neoteness we have a very long developmental period because rather than have hard-wired behaviors we
have uh radical plasticity for firm wiring what is going to be adaptive to the environment that
we're born into and then we have continued neuro plasticity throughout life so basically evolution
said only being able to change our behavior through natural selection through breeding over a long
period of time is very slow so we're evolving a creature that can change its behavior radically
just by software updates mimetics right which are mediated by you know neural coding and and you
know neuro plasticity so genetics are genetics selected for mimetics so rather than having
genetic predispositions or really good or really shitty behavior we have genetic predispositions
to be mimetically susceptible to whatever our conditioning is and so mostly we're looking
at conditioning but I'm stating that to say the idea that we have evolutionary biology predispositions
that just inexorably suck I don't believe as well supported but we can say that physiology
does affect patterns of human experience and human behavior not even so much at the level of genetics
we could get into that but at the level of just whether or not the physiology is in tune right
so if hormones are out of balance life is very different than if they're in balance
brain chemistry is out of balance that's very different and so almost everyone has experienced
their physiology being out of balance in ways that affected their psyche affected their emotions
affected their cognition and you can kind of think of it as when an instrument is out of tune
you kind of can't play anything on it no matter if you know how to play well or not it sounds good
so before we look at upgrading our system right making our guitar a better guitar we just look
at getting it in tune first we see there's a tremendous amount of predisposition for shitty
behavior that is actually untuned physiologies that is neurochemical imbalances hormonal imbalances
microbiome imbalances etc that lead to
less system resilience less emotional resilience less impulse control because when you think about
things we care about psychologically empathy perspective taking complex thinking problem
solving impulse control etc those are all mediated over certain neural circuits involving
certain neurochemistry and those can be physiologically up or down regulated so neural
hacking was interesting for us to say how can we take a more complex approach to how we address
tuning the organism complex system science multifactorial etc so that we can both decrease
unnecessary suffering at the human level increase quality of life at the human level but also increase
the capacity for and predisposition for that human becoming an asset on nature's balance sheet rather
than liable and how does how does qualia fit into that
yeah so qualia is the first product that we have actually brought to market that's for sale we have
quite a few other products both additional versions of quality and completely different
products with different goals that are in various phases of development and will come out soon
the reason why we started with qualia is
one it was it's a familiar delivery mechanism taking pills is much more familiar to people
than strapping on EEG units or using transcranial stimulation so there's a low barrier to entry in
terms of familiarity there's also a low barrier to entry in terms of it takes it doesn't take very
much will there's not much behavioral involved in taking the pill and that it has the capacity to
not only have the effect that it has but it has the effect of increasing one's capacity to do the
other things that are harder to do because of its effect on motivational chemistry and so
those were all reasons why we saw it as a as a meaningful starting place and then
the desire to be productive is high for everyone the demand is high from a you know just your life
and dealing with shit and economics point of view and from the point of view of if you're
tuned into the world scenario and you realize how much needs to happen there's a major demand to be
you know creative and productive in shifting things while we have more challenges to
attention span from more distractions and so we see increased you know maybe not in your
audience but we see in in white audiences increased aural use increased smart ring five hour energy
etc your group is probably doing adaptogens but we wanted to see if we could make something that
had a much wider set of positive effects than those single molecule solutions had and that had
lastingly positive rather than lastingly negative effects because you know single molecule pharmacological
usually psychostimulants will have an effect but it's usually quite narrow right your
aural is gonna affect presynaptic dopamine increase it's going to increase focus and
concentration and drive but it's going to decrease task switching working memory and
oftentimes endophanies and then it's going to override your and imbalance your own endogenous
dopamine regulatory system which leads to down regulation and dependence we wanted to see could
we increase concentration and focus so you could be highly focused while increasing
task switching so you could move between tasks as needed better simultaneously while increasing
long-term memory short-term memory working memory speed of memory and increasing analytic
capability and synthetic capability simultaneously etc so how do we increase the capacity of all
of those meaningful subjective experiences and cognitive capacities that go into creative
productive flow states where where you know cognition is fully available accessible and
um that's started by just kind of modeling what are all the capacities and states that are desired
and then we model what what are the underlying physiologic mechanisms that mediate each of
those what are the chemistries that affect those mechanisms and then what are the chemistries that
are generally well tolerated whose effect on other systems is also positive and where we get
positive synergies between the chemistries and then that was the beginning of our formulation
process and then you know many many cycles of iteration to get to where it is and what what are
what are some of the the effects that you've seen across the board with people i mean i could easily
give my experience but i'm about a month into it right now and um i'm just curious from your your
perspective as the core formulator and also receiving testimonials from other people and
also doing it yourself i'm curious like what what across the board do you see as the most common
um enhancements or effects so first uh i will say for this podcast you know our necessary
medical disclaimer um of course that we are not uh able to prescribe treat diagnose anything
quality shouldn't be used for any medical conditions if you have medical conditions like
psychiatric conditions go to your healthcare professional and that neither Ronnie or his
company or neuro hacker etc should be taken for medical advice all of that's a given and we can't
make any claims because we haven't done uh the kind of uh FDA approval uh trials that are necessary
to be able to make claims so i can't say quality does anything um i can tell you what we intended
and i can tell you things that people have reported so as far as uh people have reported
increased total working memory how many things they can simultaneously hold and actually make
good sense of um increased rate of memory their verbal fluency going up so rather than their word
on the tip of their tongue and they feel like they can't um catch it that uh they actually have
you know meaningfully increased um verbal fluency inflow increased creativity epiphany
insight uh increased pattern recognition and also kind of error recognition um you know all
of those things we've heard uh a lot uh increased emotional resilience and drive both for the things
that they really love right things that people are motivated to do where they can actually
stay on task for a much longer period of time and even in the face of setbacks continue to feel good
and continue but also things that people would normally procrastinate actually feeling like
they can focus on and get done without being bothered by them so we didn't expect that we've
had so many people right saying that they actually did their taxes and cleaned their desk and finished
their papers because rather than it uh being an odious process they were able to just focus and
and not have any drama about it feel good about it uh decreased internal sense of drama was also
one of the things that has been important which doesn't mean emotional blunting people still
said they you know would cry at inspiring things and feel happy and grateful and feel sad when there
was something real to feel sad about but they were making up less stories because they were just
think clear so the bullshit thinking that led to a bunch of emotional reactions about what isn't real
decrease um and uh increased vividness of dreams lucid dreams now there's a lot of people that
have claimed things for their medical conditions people with you know many interesting medical
conditions have said that their conditions were uh meaningfully decreased or gone but again that's
way outside of the scope of anything we're allowed to talk about um and you know it's important to say
we didn't make qualia to uh cure conditions we did make it for well people who were seeking
optimization where this would have a wider scope of optimization than other solutions that were
available and with less long-term negatives and hopefully even long-term positives and for people
who have been using the product for a long time and then used it and stopped taking it for a while
and tracked their baseline the report of long-term positives has continued that is a really important
distinction isn't it because typically in a supplement um it is it is something that we
have to continue to take in order to derive the effects however in something like this the the
I guess the intention or maybe just the side effect that has been noticed is that even when
somebody stops taking it their baseline resilience or their baseline cognition
elevates to a new level where they don't have to keep taking it yet they're better off for taking it
yeah and again we don't have the kind of research where we can quantify that yet though we're in the
early stages of gathering it um and we we will have that you know in the not too distant future
we're really excited about it but um yeah in a dynamic system where you continue to have
lots of system inputs we don't expect any effect to be um you know permanent just like
exercise isn't meditation isn't something to meditate for a bunch of years and if they stop
they can start getting more stressed out but as much of an effect as if someone has exercised
they have really good fitness a few months later they're still in different shape than someone who
didn't exercise we were looking for a similar effect to that which is if you have an up-regulated
system uh that there should be continuance of that up-regulation until there is you know too much
that is uh uh down-regulating it and it doesn't have continued support right through a couple
mechanisms our intention was that if people were operating at increased efficiency continuously
over a long period of time that there would be actual new rewiring neuroplastic rewiring
along to that new state as baseline and that we have a lot of chemistry that's focused on
supporting endogenous processes of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis sort of neuro structuring
processes so you don't feel those right away the things that you feel right away are things that
are affecting neurotransmission but for longer term effects we looked at specifically
chemicals that support development of new synaptic structures new new you know
neurite formation and new progenitor stem cell neuron formation differentiation
so that those endogenous processes could happen in an up-regulated fashion
and that's where you could get not just chemical changes but structural changes for those structural
changes you know would have the capacity to be more enduring
yeah there's a my my brain just went in a whole bunch of different directions um
however we don't have time for that do we so okay so with all that said and I think that's an
I think we've already taken a shoot we've taken everybody on a few different rabbit holes into
some very um some very in-depth territory and especially this last part and I just want to
I just want to maybe add to this and and if if anybody if anything went over anyone's head
I really invite everybody to continue to research maybe continue to listen to this interview and
listen to some of Daniel's other interviews and content free content on YouTube because
this man is obviously what I would call a polymath which is um one of my colleagues John D
Martini who I had on the show recently he's obviously won and it's basically somebody who
has gained a certain level of mastery in multiple disciplines and which is one of the reasons not
only you fascinate me so much because that's something I'm trying to optimize within myself
because I have so many interests but it's just something that I have a great deal of respect
for because I know the type of work and devotion to your craft it takes to really to really weed
through all the distinctions and nuances to be able to critically think and extrapolate
information the way that you do so for everyone listening um you just continue to investigate
these things and I really encourage everybody to actually go to your website Daniel which I'll
let you tell everybody about which has a lot more broken down research and information on the concepts
that you're talking about and on the quality of product what is that website Neurohacker.com
cool so they can go to Neurohacker.com I believe that you guys also have a monthly subscription
for people that want to test it over a longer term you do cool and uh is there any any more
information or anything you'd love to leave the audience off with at this point just that it was
uh a delight and honor to be here with you and I appreciate the work you are doing and uh sharing
good resources with people educating people and happy about the friendship and to continue and evolve
it and um if there are future topics that are interesting that we can share about I'd be very
happy to absolutely well I'm glad you said that because I got a whole bunch of them for you and
I would love to have you back on the show whenever you'd like to be on sounds great okay awesome
thank you thank you so much for joining me and thank all of you as always for tuning in to
at this point the holistic health and human potential show I am your host Ronnie Landis and
this has been another phenomenal episode with a phenomenal guest I hope you guys appreciated it
and I hope you take at least one two or three key nuggets of insight that will help you really push
the boundaries of your own human potential thank you so much for joining us
