Welcome to the Heart-Based Medicine Inspirations podcast with Professor Dr.
Jan Bonifer and Daniel Schmacktenberger. Thank you Daniel, thank you for being with us
today. Thanks for putting this together. We had a chance today to talk about
heart-based medicine during the board meeting and during the opening ceremony
and I just wonder what does heart-based medicine look like for you if you were
to describe it in your own terms. The first sense that I have is that people
are called to a life path in the healing professions because of a care for the
quality of experience of other people and the actual sacredness of human life
and human experience and wanting to be in service to and devotion to that. So
heart-based medicine would be where the entire system of medicine and all of the
interactions were designed from and in service to that devotion and that
sacredness. So heart-based medicine is about a sacred space for you. Yeah I mean
we think about medicine being preventing and correcting illness and
promoting health. People's experience of life and what they can do with their life
to affect the experience of others is sacred. So then medicine is what is in
service to their capacity to experience life fully and contribute to life fully.
Beautiful. In many ways this is where medicine is coming from at least in our
part of the world and our cultures that medicine was very much in the domain of
the religious missions and that was the understanding of health care. That was
the understanding of care given and of elevating the potential of the ones we
serve. Yeah. Is this something very specific to our cultures or is this
something that you see as a principle beyond the kind of cultural and
religious backgrounds that we share in Western Europe? I think this might be as
unifying a thing across cultures as there is in terms of medicine, women and
medicine men and shamans and Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Early
humans figuring out how do we care for each other, how do we care for ourselves,
how do we prevent illness, how do we fix illness. Obviously the whole focus to do
that would be not just self-preservation but also care for each other so I
think that's probably as unifying a thing as there is. Yeah. So care is the
unifying principle. So if care is the unifying principle and we see that all
the talk in health care about the importance of care and we see how it
is delivered, what do you see as the current the strongest obstacles? Those
elements in our current health care system in the way that we go about
health care, what do you see as the current obstacles to deliver the kind of
care that we would perceive as a secret? A lot actually. I'm happy to unpack this
but there's a lot of systemic factors. There's obviously trillions of dollars
flowing through the thing we call global health care industrial complex where at
large and pharmaceuticals and hospitals and industries and insurance
industries. There's also all of the money in the world flowing through things
that affect health when we look at the burning of coal and oil and what that
does to the environment that then we're embedded in and breathing and drinking
the water from when we look at agriculture that depletes the topsoil or
sprays glyphosate on all the food. Like upstream from someone being sick and
coming to the hospital is do we actually have a civilization that's promoting
health and in how many places do we have a civilization that through structures
that create ubiquitous psychological stress and structures that actually
again exposes to ubiquitous pollution and poor forms of nutrition when you
just think about that like the goal of almost every business is to maximize
the lifetime revenue of a customer and nothing does that better than addiction.
Obviously the the supply side might be a multi-billion dollar company relative to
an individual consumer and so there's a kind of asymmetric warfare in terms of
their capacity to influence with commercial media you know so many things.
So if we wanted a society that was promoting maximum health we would want
to be minimizing addiction everywhere which would mean that any place where
addiction was profitable we would have a fundamental conflict we'd have a
perverse incentive in the nature of that type of market dynamic. So you know I
think there's a huge amount of perverse incentive that's one place where there
are structural issues. I think that there are places where out of caution because
of malpractice and whatever else hospitals create policies there are
insurance guidelines that actually don't allow doctors to do things that would
demonstrate certain kinds of care. I think that we have a medical school system
where the average amount of nutrition that is taught to a medical doctor is
extraordinarily low relative to the importance of nutrition and health but
similarly how much psychology should actually be taught so that the doctor
can actually really understand the experience of the patient well and be
able to relate and work through that should be a much bigger percentage of
the training that occurs. I think we also have a situation where you can't
actually measure the felt sense of love and care in the same way that you can
measure cholesterol and blood pressure and so you end up optimizing for the
things that you measure. I think MRI machines are expensive and they're
important so you make big hospitals that a lot of people go to as opposed to
small county clinics and because there's economies of scale but I think the
economies of scale mean you don't really know your doctor your doctor doesn't
know you you're one of maybe hundreds or thousands of people that they're gonna
see and so I think again the economies of scale end up really damaging personal
connection and personal rapport. I think the most important diagnostic tool
there is is really detailed medical intake and really having the time to
think through and pay attention and then a continuity of being able to think
about that for the patient and there's just that requires a certain amount of
time being allocated so I think there's a lot of structural factors that are
oriented to things like lowering liability and maximizing profit and
economies of scale all of which are not optimized for what supposedly the whole
thing is in service to. Thank you that makes a lot of sense and resonate very
much with the importance of the intake that is based on a deep listening
really being present with the patient understanding where they're coming from
and seeing that disease through their eyes. You're talking about you're
touching on many issues but you're also touching on one of the points you're
raising is that the person's subjective experience of their disease and how they
feel and what it means to their lives is something that is worth exploring and
yet it is hard to measure so the measures that we currently have available
are I think too crude or are they just is it just structurally impossible to
measure the subjective experience? Well by definition it is structurally
impossible to measure subjective experience. A measurement means some
needle move means it's in the domain of the object of a third person. I can
measure a neural correlate, I can measure a endocrine correlate, otherwise I have
to actually listen to the person report their own experience. Then of course we're
going to have all the biases that self-reporting has and someone having
reasons they don't want to say how miserable they are or they want to
exaggerate it for empathy or they have a limited vocabulary to express it. So I do
think that there is a need for a lot of question asking of things that cannot be
measured in blood tests. So how do we deal with this approach? So we we know
that when we talk to patients that we find out things and as you say there
are biases. So there's their preferences, there's recall, there's you know there's
all sorts of things that affect this and a lot of the approaches that we
take in everyday routine clinics is trying to bring some insert some
objectivity into this assessment seeing to what degree can we rely on this. But
in a way what we do is we take our tests that we apply our observations of that
person that we call objective observations. We take those as the reference
point and whatever the patient says is measured against that. When I hear you
correctly then what we really want to do is we want to improve on understanding
the subjective experience better. Okay so there's there's a number of parts we
can look at here. There's the way that someone's subjective experience affects
their objective physiology right to the whole domain of psychoneuroimmunology
and the way that stress affects health and the way that better psychological
disposition, placebo dynamics, etc affect health. So we want to actually be able to
work with people's subjective experience as part of medicine. That's one thing.
The other thing is that some people might have a disease that can't be cured
and actually still have a good subjective experience of life based on their
focus and their meaning making versus having a totally ruined experience of
life. So subjective experience is a terminal value in and of itself. So it
is both useful for supporting objective physiologic health and it is
intrinsically valuable independent of physiologic health. There's a bunch of
other reasons to talk to a patient and ask them questions though. You and I were
talking before that modern allopathic medicine does a really good job in places
where we actually understand the causation clearly and generally that tends to be
more in the direction of things that were acute like an acute injury. It's pretty
clear like oh there was a puncture wound we're gonna sew up the puncture wound
or there was an acute infection and we can see what type of infection it is
maybe an antibiotic can treat it or there was a acute poisoning and we're
gonna do an acute kind of detox but there was a acute incident and then
immediate symptomology and we can trace causation. But with autoimmune disease
and with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric
disease and cancer that's not the case and so for the most part we don't
actually know why those things are happening and it happens to be my
belief similar to much of the kind of functional medicine in naturopathic
world that most of those diseases are multifactorial. They don't have one cause
they have a lot of causes and it's not the same set of causes every time so
there actually isn't one thing called rheumatoid arthritis or one thing called
MS from a pathoideology point of view. There's a system that's being exposed to
things that don't create immediate symptomology but that are dysregulating
homeodynamics and those dysregulated homeodynamics make one more susceptible
to the additional stressors dysregulating homeodynamics more until
eventually we cross a threshold and now we get symptomology and biomarkers and
a cluster of symptomology and biomarkers gets a disease name and but if I
really start paying attention to those things and wanting to be able to trace a
complex causal situation that's multifactorial and maybe very delayed
causation in time then I want a totally different kind of intake right I might
want to be asking really detailed questions to see when they've ever been
exposed to mold or when they were ever exposed to industrial chemicals or they
spend a lot of time with epoxy at a certain point or whatever it is or when
they had third world travels where they got nasty infections and what symptoms
so I want a timeline of when different symptoms kicked on and a timeline of
different kinds of stresses and exposures when there was a microchromatic
brain injury that didn't show up in an MRI but it doesn't mean that there
actually wasn't a micro TBI that affected functional patterning in the
brain and if I'm able to look at the current symptomology the current labs
the progression of symptomology and the progression of exposures and have all of
that fit together and make sense then I might be informed as to how to start a
treatment that is actually addressing more than just symptomology and you know
disease manifestation and there's no I'm gonna get that without asking them a
lot of questions yeah so so is there do you do you feel that this is this is an
area of research that is developing I mean I I think that the environmental
medicine functional medicine naturopathic medicine communities have been
focused on with chronic complex illness in particular where the best modern
treatments are mostly symptomatic you know and not not just symptomatic a
biologic can actually decrease the total tissue damage from a connective
tissue disorder and obviously if we're cutting a cancer out or radiating it
out or poisoning it out that's still better than leaving it there oftentimes
but the why was there increased carcinogenesis in the first place and
why did the body's immune system not deal with the carcinogenesis are still
upline questions especially if we don't want this person to get cancer again
and especially if the things that might have led to it might be signs of
underlying dysregulation that affect other things so I think there is a
increasing awareness that chronic complex illness is not just stupid bodies it
is just kind of deeper complexity where it's not one disease one cause and we're
gonna have one pill it is radically complex regulatory systems many
different elements of causation that end up leading to things that present
like a cluster of symptoms and biomarkers that we call a disease that is
very fascinating I think in most of the research that we see published today
most of the clinical research that we see published today what I observe is
that the schematic the methodology is very much the same so we kind of have
two points of observation and between the two points of observation we
assume a linear correlation but what we don't look at are here if you look at
the classic table one in a publication where we're looking at the demographics
comparing the two groups you know three or four or five different variables so
we're looking at you know is you know gender ethnicity age so you really
crude variables and at the end everybody feels comfortable that both
groups are comparable well what we're not looking at at all is what happens
before the trial what are these life stories what is this what is this the
the complex of homeodynamic regulatory systems interacting with each other and
building up in a way that that we have great difficulties to understand that we
certainly don't have any measures or markers for this when we establish these
let's say if we get better at asking questions and really getting at least a
reported picture of what happened do you feel that the if we basically exploded
a number of variables from you know age and sex and ethnicity to to maybe let's
say 200 or 500 variables so if we were compiling this index of of measures or
indicators would we really learn more about what happened before an event
yeah so what are the right methods to gain the kinds of insights we want in a
domain as complex as human physiology is a very interesting question if we look
at a clinical trial say for drug research that's trying to see does this drug do
something beyond the placebo we're gonna get something like a Gaussian
distribution where all we you know it's gonna work pretty well for some people
and it's gonna work not well for other people and there'll be some range of
effect for a lot of people we just want to see that some range of effect and
maybe the front of the bell curve is better than what a placebo is but why
it works really well for these people and not really well for these people or
maybe even really badly for these people is a bunch of other variables that are
just hidden under the shape of a bell curve and so obviously we would like to
find that out so that doesn't mean that that is a worthless study that's an
interesting study but it if we go all the way to the other end we get how can
we get as much information about this one person as possible rather than this
one drug across all people right how can I get as much information about this
person and now we're starting to do n equals one kinds of studies and
optimization so I totally think there are places for clinical trials of course
if we have more metrics if they're appropriate metrics additional insight
comes because not just are you likely to be able to see more things but you
also start to get to see what are the relationships between these metrics and
are there combinatorial insights but as soon as I realized that the I'm not
just looking at a genome I'm looking at the combinatorics on all of the
polymorphisms possible on all of the the genes and then all the combinatorics
on the epigenome and then the proteome recursively changing it we're never
going to be able to compute all that it is actually not computable so there are
better ways we have to think about how do we actually understand what health is
and if we think about hope health as the integrity of the regulatory systems so
the homeo dynamics of how the body self-organizes and self-regulates and
the homeo dynamic not just the homeo dynamic state but the homeo dynamic
capacity right like typically most of the studies that most the tests we do in
medicine are testing state so we're testing cholesterol level or we're
testing blood sugar or whatever it is but what's really going to determine the
overall health is much more related to under some kind of stress how does the
body maintain being within a homeo dynamic range so you know we do this
sometimes with a glucose stress test or with a stress echocardiogram and those
are super insightful but there's a lot of things we don't do those with where it
might be in range but very fragile and could come out of range easily which
means that the person doesn't have a disease but they're very susceptible and
so yet if I see very high homeo dynamic capacity across lots of axes that's a
measure of the robustness of health so yeah different types of interesting
diagnostics in the future so when we are so what I hear from you is assuming
linear you need causal association is is a degree of simplification that silly
is really not very helpful I mean for some things in the knife wound case it's
fine yeah except we need to ask you know are they clumsy or are they getting in
knife fights for dumb reasons so there might be something upstream but so for
some things unicausal is fine but for most anything that emerged not
immediately following an obvious causation event this is why we don't
actually have real cures we have symptomatic treatments and you know
imeliorative treatments for most complex comic disease so the etiology of
disease we will more likely find answers for what is the real cause of disease if
we look at non-linear models and we look at the the period before the disease
started before the symptoms occur and see what what are the different factors
that have built up and reach that threshold when you speculate about what
might be the areas that affect the human body what are the areas that if they
stack up will lead to an imbalance of dysregulation that becomes symptomatic
yeah you know there's some actual pretty simple models we can start to look at
this comprehensively through so I mean Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine
actually had some kind of good holistic surestics to start with even though
they didn't have all the assessments we have like say you take a roughly Chinese
medicine point of view of where is there too much of something where is there not
enough of something so toxicity and deficiency this is pretty good starting
model for predispositions towards disease so you can think about that we
evolved to be able to like our genetics evolved to have a certain set of
behaviors interacting with a certain set of environmental parameters so where
our behaviors are very different than kind of what we evolved to handle or
where our environment is meaningfully different those are going to be
interesting things to look at so you know too much well too much can look like
things that we shouldn't have any amount of like glyphosate and pesticides and
you know and we're really kind of ubiquitously exposed to the volatile
organic compounds coming out of this carpet and out of the paint right this
we have built a world that we're actually not genetically fit for where
there are externalities to our health of the ways that we do lots of things and
so when you look at all the volatile organic compounds are all of the you
know petrochemicals that are in the environment most of them are either
endocrine disruptors or neurotoxins or carcinogens so then we look at how many
diseases fit into those being part of the underlying ideology right so too much
of things that shouldn't have really been there at all and but obviously too
much sugar or you know there there can be excesses of certain nutrients in
relationship to other nutrients like zinc copper balance or calcium magnesium
balance or things like that obviously we're not just limited to talking about
environmental toxins that aren't alive we can also talk about things that are
alive so infection would be kind of a subclass of too much of something and
that can either be things that should be there but they're overgrown like SIBO
and other kinds of microbiome disorders or actual infections but pathogens that
are not normally part of our healthy kind of microbiome and this is where the
concept of a subclinical infection or a subclinical toxicity is important which
is let's say that I have a level of mercury exposure or a level of lead
exposure where we're going to say oh yes I have lead poisoning well lead
poisoning is at this threshold but the ideal amount of lead that I would have
would be down here well there's a whole level in here which is I don't yet have
the level that we would diagnose with acute lead poisoning that is more than
none it has some effect and that also ends up being true with infections that
are not necessarily showing up as acute infection but are testable and that have
effect so we see helicobacter pylori in the stomach being able to cause ulcers
and cause stomach cancer over a very long time period or each PV and you know
cervical cancer or throat cancer or things like that for those few that we
found recently it's pretty safe to assume that there's a lot more like
that where the correlations are just not as clear yet and that's one of the
things that again some of the infectious study and environmental toxicology
studies that functional medicine is doing I think are really interesting so too
much of various things not enough of and obviously we can look at things like not
enough exercise not enough sleep not enough human contact and not a human
contact is actually profound because that ends up being one of the most
profound drivers of addiction which is then going to cause so many other health
issues but also not enough of specific nutrients and we see that we have a you
know modern American diet or modern industrial world diet is very high in
macronutrients and often low in really critical micronutrients and longevity is
usually best optimized by lower macronutrients and higher micronutrients
which is closer to what evolutionary environments would have so that's like a
starting framework thank you so here you have identified areas or risk factors
and if they are compiling they might add so these are the areas that we would
like to explore further and more deeply in an intake as he described that where
we asked lots of questions and try to understand what happened before the
patient has reached a state of disease yeah when we don't have a lot of time
talking to the patients and you mentioned the the systemic factors the
limiting factors of how we are setting up our health care system certainly I I
feel that limited time is a critical factor we need to make choices we need
to make choices about what questions to ask and one way is to go through a
protocol one way is to go through a long list of questions and kind of ask
all the possible questions and then I hope that either ourselves or some
computer will be able to make sense of it and then there's another way to make
choices and that depends it involves the observer it involves the health care
provider so it involves the way we show up as a health care provider we relate
to the patient and we ask these questions we briefly touched on the
subjective experience of the disease and you talked you touched on homeodynamics
as as the key principle to understand behind disease evolution now if we see
that you are a homodynamic system and I'm a homodynamic system is there a way
that those two systems can come into resonance is there a way that I can tune
my system into yours and by doing so I can actually ask the right questions I
wouldn't ask you as a clinician have you had this experience yeah that's what it
seems like I don't think we have to get hung up on wondering what the mechanism
of intuition is to acknowledge that there's a reality to it is it some
electromagnetic resonance that's happening maybe that's cool idea is it
simply that I have a lot of experience and when I take the time to quiet I
process the information in my own internal neurologic database better
that's a fine idea too I don't really I don't actually don't want to attach to
a mechanistic explanation of how intuition works that someone can say not
well enough verified and reject to say that increasing awareness and presence
and perceptivity is valuable and it will lead to better insights from wherever
that comes about what's going on with the patient and how to ask the right
questions that's interesting so you're leaving care as a sacred space and
you're leaving intuition as a sacred space so it feels like we need to talk
about love in a way connecting the two at least that's what it feels like to me
here's another sacred space and another question of can we measure or should we
measure what might be the value of measuring how we relate and and how we
describe the phenomenon of love or resonance
we talked about this earlier we can't measure love we can measure things going
on with the physiology when we say that we're feeling something that we call
love that may be statistically correlate to some degree and whether I'm
measuring oxytocin and other kind of neuro hormones and neurotransmitters or
I'm measuring heart rate variability or measuring some kind of EEG coherence
pattern those aren't useless things to do like that's interesting but I could
just say pick the right person to marry on paper whether you have any feelings
for them or not and just snort oxytocin regularly because love is just oxytocin
and most people don't resonate with that or or you know do a particular kind of
transcranial magnetic stimulation to the brain region that we identified as where
love is happening and there it is when a parent wakes up who is sick and who
hasn't slept in a long time who has an infant who's worn out as can be to take
care of their infant love is motivating them but they might feel like shit in the
moment and love doesn't really feel like a subjective emotion it's actually
something deeper than emotion it's transcendent to emotion it can move them
even through emotion and we might not see a you know the particular great heart
rate variability in that moment or whatever it is so I think it's
interesting to study correlation between physiology and subjective states but I
think if we're studying it through the method of science and we can do a lot
more with the objective within the method of science because that's what we
study things are measurable and repeatable and experience objective
experience is not a measurable nor repeatable then the temptation is going
to be to reduce subjectivity to being an epiphenomenon of objectivity and in
doing so then consciousness is illusory and choice is illusory or their
consciousness is real as an epiphenomenon but choice is illusory because
everything that happens in the brain is controlled by particle physics of the
voltage differentials of sodium ions that's the exact opposite of heart
based anything right like that is kind of maximum reductionism and it's not
even epistemically well-founded it's a category error of seeing that there is
some pretty low degree of information theoretic correlation between objective
and subjective pretending that it's perfect and then pretending that this is
the epiphenomenon of this one because this is the one that we know how to
actually make causal sense of do I think it's important to have some way of
noticing how the doctor and how the nurse and how the practitioners feel before
they're with patients and they're paying attention to how the patients are
feeling and they're paying attention to the quality of the relationship totally
I don't think you can measure that I think you can pay attention to it I
think that you might have some indices that are worth noticing but there will
be meaningful things that can't be brought into an index and the moment you
do you're actually collapsing something very information rich to something very
not information rich and you're losing so much information in the process that
if if you make your decisions as a hospital or an insurance company or
doctor based off the thing that lost all the information and then you
normalize this is the thing we want to do we'll mess it up it's beautiful so
so basically our our attempt to simplify questions so that we feel
comfortable to answer them so this reductionist approach limits our ability
to see just by the by the fact that we're setting targets to see yeah the
doubt that is nameable is not the eternal doubt so
ultimately good medicine is not purely algorithmic and our job is not just to
try and be robots that just get data that we just haven't got good enough
robots to do yet but will be replaced by them and then do if this than that
programs it's actually not that that's not the job that's a part of the job but
that's definitely not the whole totality of the job so there is something to what
medicine is it is trans algorithmic and so then you have to say well if we're
gonna be training doctors and if we're gonna be evaluating them based on a set
of metrics and a scorecard so then they are gonna try and perform to the score
card they're gonna mess up the actual thing this is what the note this is how
I interpret the no false idols thing is about right is that that that kind of
graven image of that set of metrics isn't actually the thing that it's
pointing at it's not worthless to pay attention to those things but you
actually have to have your choice making be bound to the actual reality not the
information reduced model it's very interesting particularly when we think
of artificial intelligence entering the space of medicine so when we look at
now there are computers being built that are exhibiting some features that we
would describe as compassionate for example non-just mental listening so
some of the robots are now able to listen to a human being and in a way
that they there is a feedback to the one that that is that that is talking but
it's non-judgmental this this is there's a conflation of ideas in here to say
non-judgmental assumes a binary with judgmental that where we're derived
we're correlating our experience of a human that is judgmental or non-judgmental
that computer is not being non-judgmental nor judgmental there's actually no one
home there is no quality it is doing an emphasis than that kind of program and
even if it's doing a deep learning program it is simply a fully causal
input output through some set of program dynamic so it's not really fair to call
that non-judgmental it is doing a function is doing what it's told and the
interesting observation is is that when people with certain disease conditions
for example autistic people are interacting with these computers there
seems to be a level of trust or acceptance that evolves and that those
patients exhibiting features that we would describe as autistic disease
spectrum will reduce and they will be able to open up and actually start a
conversation I think that that is a statement of how shitty the parenting
is and how shitty the doctors nurses and educators are that the person does
better with a robot like a fairly low-level robot rather than it is
something exciting about AI for me if someone's doing better with a robot
because it simply doesn't seem judgmental and it takes a little space
even though it doesn't love you or care about you like that's just a really low
bar I'd rather the person have a dog to spend time with the thing I'm excited
about with AI and the medicine space and it's it's confusing to even call the
machine learning do we want to have machine learning run big data sets to
find correlations that we can't currently find of course that's awesome do
we want to like scan all the medical you know medical records and using image
recognition and run massive big data so that we can see early disease
indicators we don't currently know that's awesome in so far as and and of
course we should be augmenting just like we augment human memory with books and
computers we should augment human computational process with computational
process so the ability to take a picture of something and have image
recognition be able to do better diagnosis of skin goodness like all of
that's great and that actually allows as that gets better it allows the doctors
to be less focused on just memory and computation and more focused on actual
connection to then know how to use that system and to relate to the person but
there's still going to be a pretty big gap between the doctor relating with the
person using the system and the system acting on the person directly so you're
now you're now juxtaposing the human experience and the development of machine
learning or the availability of machine learning capacity and we can run this on
databases as you say but we can also turn them into we can we can inform objects
that we call robots with machine learning abilities so they're able to
provide services so what we're seeing is that increasingly now there are kind of
robots evolving that are involved in what we typically would cause calls
services of care so for example they would help in household activities they
would help in you know basic getting dressed washing ourselves very basic
day-to-day activities and they are helpful for people who have in capacity
somehow they don't have the capacity to perform certain activities but they're
fundamentally different to a nurse coming to the home and actually being with
this person and providing that support yeah there's something about the
development of these technologies that is awesome and liberating and helpful and
there's something about the way we are relating to it that is gruesome and it's
important to understand both in so far as we're talking about a robotic exoskeleton
that can allow a paralyzed person to walk it's just a better wheelchair like I
mean it's just an extension of the tooling we've already been using you're
wearing eyeglasses that's a tool that helps you you're a cyborg to some degree
if we had ones that could autofocus and do cool stuff like okay that's fine but
something that does not actually have the capacity to care about you replacing a
dynamic where care used to occur is tragic now if it's simply helping you get
some stuff done you couldn't otherwise and hopefully that increases your
capacity for authentic human interaction awesome but the tendency of hyper
individualization that the modern world has had modern West in particular has
had every time you see a mass shooter who shoots up a bunch of people at school
or somewhere almost a whole of the time when the news goes and checks the
neighbors say yeah he was super quiet he kept to himself nobody ever saw him
because in a setting where you have a family or an extended family or a village
where humans evolve for most of human history if you're before you would go
kill a bunch of people you're obviously not happy and if you're interacting with
other people to get your needs met other people see that they'll actually be
responding and keeping that psychopathology from progressing that far
but if someone can be a shut-in and they can hardly ever interact with anyone
and maybe get an Amazon drone delivery to their house so they actually never
have to interact with anyone now they can have some robotic care agent they
can progress in psychopathology both in ways that make them dangerous to
society and in ways that just allow them to be suffering gruesomely for a long
time humans of our social primates we evolved in social environments we have
a world that totally is getting this wrong right now and we we have to turn
that thing around for there not just to like have an optimal world I actually
don't think we have any chance of having a world to continue at all from the
point of view of existential catastrophic risk if we don't solve this
particular thing because say someone is progressing in psychopathology and
they're really upset and the best technology for killing they have is a
knife they're just not gonna hurt that many people before somebody takes them
out but if it's an AR-15 they can kill a lot more people with decentralizing
exponential technology when that becomes a crisper gene-dried pandemic weapon
and weaponized drones and etc we just can't have really disaffected people and
that means if I can get all of my needs met without interacting with other
humans then either I have to have some top-down state surveillance system like
the China method which is already a dystopia or how do we have access to
the level of technological power people will be getting and have us be safe
vessels for having that much technological power well they have to be
no psychologically really damaged people and if there are any we have to know
the only way to have that kind of known that doesn't involve top-down state
surveillance is the kind of surveillance that a family does or a tribe does or
community does where my resource provisioning requires interacting in
healthy ways with people or unlike the kind of asymmetric surveillance of the
state that is just trying to make sure I'm not a bad guy it's a symmetric
paying attention of people that actually want to make sure I'm doing well
so part of the what you're proposing is a community surveillance in a way so are
you saying basically that doesn't even have to be developed because it's it's
an innate function of building primate communities that we're resonating with
each other and that we're realizing if somebody is behaving kind of outside of
the pack then then that is something to be addressed and is would you argue that
this is something that is a it's like an existential interest of the group of
course because of the potential so is this like a risk detection system of a
group does this mean that nobody can be a hermit no of course it doesn't mean
nobody can be a hermit but it doesn't mean that in the presence of
decentralizable catastrophe level technology we have to think about
some things differently than we did previously and the disposition and
well-being of people matters more to everyone because the one to many
capacity of a person is much much higher and so the coupling is higher which
means that the care needs to be higher
coming back to care again and again and again so now we're looking at cares a
group phenomenon so a group caring for the group and caring for individuals for
the sake of the group and for the sake of the individual and for the sake of the
individual so if I'm just translating this to the healthcare setting now where
we have a group of people working together and we have individuals walking
in and out of this setting and we look at the current I want to call it epidemic
of suicides in you know among our colleagues where are we failing is it
have we become numb has the system numbed ourselves have we lost a sensitivity
you're specifically talking about suicide amongst doctors I don't know I haven't
studied this I would want to really look at is suicide much higher amongst
doctors than other professionals of the same pay grade and other types of
similar stress level like I'm sure again there's gonna be complex causation
that's involved it's not one thing we can talk about why there are kind of
epidemic suicide issues society-wide but yeah I wouldn't want to speak to with
doctors without knowing more but I think it's pretty easy to see at least some
things I think it's pretty easy to see that the amount of stress doctors go
through even in med school right experiencing burnout or being on some
kind of well but you turn her out or all the riddle and there's some kind of
upper just to make it through school by the time they're just not even
graduating and then they're supposed to have a whole career of that and like you
mentioned 72 hour shifts and I also think that not having a place to process
the emotionality of it the desensitization of okay so I just you know as a
part of some kids dying today this experience and I'm gonna go do it
tomorrow and where's space for that and yeah I think I think there's obviously a
lot of stresses both that are unavoidably endemic to that profession that need
to be processed in ways that they aren't currently processed and ones that
are avoidable by changing the way the system works so we could as a group
become more proficient in detecting the dynamics of the group and taking care of
each other and we could become more proficient in the way that we show up as
an individual in the group and that showing up more proficient with our
peer group with our teams and with the patient will help us to see the patient
better see our colleagues better and that might create a community that is
kind of mutually supportive in a way that we are not so much cluttered by by
knowledge and red tape but we can actually allow ourselves to activate our
natural capacity to care and and our like to to allow ourselves to be authentic
in our natural state of being and connected that level yeah I mean it's
interesting you're talking about the group care between doctors colleagues when
when someone that we know commit suicide it's such a important inquiry especially
if we didn't know they were close it's important inquiry to recognize that you
actually don't know how close anyone you're talking to ever is to committing
suicide and you don't know how close to threshold they are and how your
interaction is going to affect their relationship to that threshold and
simply being aware of that changes the importance you put on how you show up in
all the interaction so much well we've come a long way in looking at taking a
big circle starting in what does it what does heart-based medicine mean to you and
we're ending on a note of how important it is to develop a sensitivity for each
other and to be present with each other and to know and how in so how many ways
this this finds reflections in our diagnostic capacity in the way with
device treatments in a way we want to create a health care system that
overcomes the many limitations that that we're facing at the moment towards a
system where people was feel seen and heard as human beings rather than being
seen as a disease with with some kind of background that really doesn't isn't so
important for us yeah thank you thank you for taking the time being here thanks
for having me thanks for following the call to help this movement birth we're
on it together thank you this has been a heart-based medicine production thanks
for listening
