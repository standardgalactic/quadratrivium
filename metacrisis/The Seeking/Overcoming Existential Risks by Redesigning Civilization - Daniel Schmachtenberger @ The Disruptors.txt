When it comes to a design of a new civilization system actually saying what a desirable civilization is is not a trivial thing
It's actually a super fucking non-trivial thing because we can see that everybody has very different ideas
But what a desirable civilization aren't and those ideas are often totally uncommentable
You talk to a shaman and they want to see a civilization
where we're much more connected to nature and much more connected to tribe much more connected to a sense of spirituality and
Don't don't separate us and you talk to a
utilitarian and they want to see us transcend biology and the physical universe completely upload our consciousness to the cloud and live in a purely digital
universe and
Those are obviously radically different to definitions of desirable and we don't have an ethical framework
That is commensurable with science that can actually give us a basis for that
Flag that topic and let's say that we actually have to address that
But the first thing that most of us can agree to in terms of what is desirable is that the civilization doesn't self-terminate
It's it's it's not a good design if it is intrinsically self-terminating by the structure of its own
architecture

Optimism oftentimes means a perceptual bias where we pretend that things that are problematic aren't actually
Problematic or we pretend that things that we want to do are going to be easier than they actually are
and it is actually a bias to seeing clearly and I have no interest in that kind of optimism
Which is why oftentimes it gets contrasted with what people call realism and what I'm interested in is
Seeing things clearly
Including both what is beautiful what's working well and what's problematic and really hard and then taking an empowered
Approach to making it better. So there is a certain kind of optimism of
Capacity to be able to respond on effectively, but it is optimism in
Possibility not optimism as a distortion on actuality understood. And what are you focused on today?
I am focused on a number of things in the biggest sense
We can say that I'm interested in the topic of
Civilization design how do we design a civilization which means how do we design macro economy?
How do we design our systems of governance and collective sense making and choice making?
How do we help design culture and our collective shared value systems and meaning-making frameworks and
Infrastructure and technology that creates a world that first is actually a sustainable viable world
So it is not a self-terminating world
And that means address the underlying causes of existential and catastrophic risk and then beyond that that makes possible
progressively higher qualities of life, you know for everybody and so that obviously is a lot of things
That's the future of education. It's the future of medicine. It's the future of trauma healing. It's a you know future of macro systems
It's how we go about technology design
But any of those on their own still within the context of the rest of the systems that contextualize them
In the current way is not adequate
So I the envelope is civilization design and basically civilization doesn't think broadly enough about the big picture
So we optimize incorrectly. Yeah, if there's a bunch of places we'll optimize for short-term in ways that are worse for the long term
We'll optimize for aid some agents in ways that is damaging to other agents into the commons
Which then of course leads to rival risk dynamics
We're there also seeking to do that and everybody has to increase their power to win rival risk games
Which is increasing the total amount of externality in the system and risk in the system
So, you know, we as a species we are powerful enough now that just acting with our evolutionary motives
But with radical technological levers on those evolutionary motives is not only no longer adequate
But is definitely an unstable equilibria that will self-terminate if we don't actually get a basis for choice-making
That is big enough to hold the size of choices technology empowers us to make so we're running into the situation where we've
Outevolved our ancestry so to speak technologically and we're coming to a point where a evolution's not following
Necessarily where it needs to be on a mental and emotional maturity sense in terms of one person
I mean Donald Trump can blow up the world if Donald Trump really wants to and gets enough people on board
We're getting to that type of situation. Is that purely due to exponential technologies?
Well, you know nukes are not an exponential technology formally meaning nukes
Don't give us a radically better ability to make more nukes
We can't argue that of course the ability to protect ourselves
Allows us to keep developing technology
But it's not the same kind of exponential technology is the way that computers give us the ability to make better computers
But it's still a a very big technology, right?
It's a technology that can if you think about all other animals tools are mostly built in and the tools that they evolve to use
Are the same tools?
they don't really change the tools that they use are not tool evolvers even if they're a tool employer and
We figured out because of prefrontal cortex and capacity for abstraction
We figured out tool design and tool evolution
So we could see a corporeal capacity that we have right there are the way that our fists could hit and we could make a
Hammer a stone hammer then we could make a metal hammer
Then we could make a bullet that could extend one type of what the fists could do and all the way to that ICBM
So if we still have the same type of dis choice-making basis, which is you know rival risk dynamics are intrinsic to evolution
But there's a really key thing is that the rival risk dynamics in nature are bound in a very specific
symmetrical way meaning that because the whole ecosystem co-evolves as
Lions are getting faster over a very long period of time as they're becoming more effective creditors because else are also getting better at
Getting away, and so you don't have even though there's a micro rival risk dynamic between them
There's actually a symbiotic dynamic between them at a macro level because of the power symmetry and if of course
Lions got a hundred X more lethal in one generation and the gazelles didn't the lines would eat all the gazelles and then starve to death and
That happens where an animal is so successful relative to its environment
It actually debases the environment that it depends on and goes extinct
So nature doesn't even select for individual species only over the short term over the long term nature selects for self-stabilizing
ecological niches where the whole niche is actually sustainable and what technology has done is
break the
Cemetery between humans and other humans and humans and the rest of nature in a way that is no that is not a stable
Equilibria anymore as you mentioned Donald Trump or Putin their individual people and you know if you think about the lion right
There's a cemetery between lion and gazelle and there's also a cemetery between lion and lion
The most powerful lion is only a little bit more powerful than the next most powerful lion
And not that much more powerful than an average lion
And if you say how many multiples of power compared to an average person does a Trump or a Putin have you're looking at like
It's hard to calculate. It's millions or billions of X and
When you look at our ability to cut down forests or pull fish out of the ocean with mile-long drift nets
The ocean hasn't gotten that you know
Commensurably faster at reproducing fish
So we are debasing the evolutionary substrate upon which we depend and so like a way of thinking about it is that we are still
Modeling ourselves as peak predators, but we're peak predators with exponential tech no longer in cemetery with the rest of the world
That is an unstable equilibrium that self terminates for sure
And so the basis and even thinking you know our social Darwinism basis of this is how nature works
Yeah, but nature doesn't have those kinds of asymmetries with those kinds of asymmetries
We have to work in a way that is different than evolution had worked
I agree with most of what you're saying, but let's play devil's advocate
Let's say humanity is on the path of expansion primarily due to the capitalist system that we have
So we need to build more to be more successful to be more economic so that more people have prosperity
Etc. Etc. So far that systems work because we've had unlimited so to speak resources
Well, we know that's not true and there are externalities that go into specifically the environment where a lot of this has happened
What about the possibilities of space where we have more space so to speak not both with
Resources pollution etc. Well, we can talk about why that is still not viable and also why it is gruesomely
Undesirable from kind of any ethical framework the idea that we act so
Parasitically that we ruin our home planet
So we start moving our parasitic action into space so we can unrenewably exploit as much of exploit include as much of the cosmos
Is possible it is just in it. I won't even try and argue in an absolute sense
I will say it's an aesthetically repugnant idea to me
And I think most people who think well about it, but we can also say it doesn't work
It doesn't work because we're pretty far from being a space-faring people in my assessment currently
The time that we have to get civilization right is less time than we have to get a meaningful percentage of population to be
sustainably space-faring in gamma rays and low gravity environments and things that are actually pretty significant like
We evolved on this biosphere in our our evolutionary binding with it is a big deal
I of course think that we will become a transplanetary species at some point, but it's not only that the externality hits the environment
Yes, we use we use resources unrenewably and then turn them into waste
And so the linear materials economy with exponential growth on a finite planet leads to depletion on one side and accumulation on the other
Which is toxic on both sides
There's also no sign that all the kinds of things that we need are in local universe like yes
You can get some platinum and gold and asteroids, but we could actually extend our
Exploitation exploitation in that way meaningfully, but as we are increasing our
Technological power we're increasing it across a number of fronts
So if you think about kind of the evolution of the thing we call civilization and the evolution of technology
You can think of it as the evolution and you mentioned capitalism as a driver
You can think of it as the evolution of rival risk games
And so you have tribes that at a certain point start competing for scarce resource
And so then some tribes will merge with other tribes to be bigger to be able to kill or protect themselves from the other tribe
They start working on having bigger tools
They start working on having a better narrative so their people don't leave and they work on being better at taking resources from the environment
So basically the competition happens at the level of we can compete economically in terms of resource extraction
we can compete in terms of information and narrative control the information about the environment disinform the other guys and
Have an orienting narrative that's harder to leave and more coherent and also in terms of force projection military now
All of those growing anyone who grows at them who has some new asymmetric tech that provides competitive advantage the moment
they deploy that tech everybody sees it reverse engineers it and you just up the level of power on the whole playing field and
So you get to a world where we have the military power that no one can actually deploy it and when everybody loses you get win
Lose becomes omni lose lose at a certain scale
And you also get with exponential tech or smaller and smaller players and more and more players and more radically multi-polar dynamics and more
disenfranchised players get catastrophic level technology
And so you can't even put something like a mutually assured destruction on it that is again a fundamentally unstable
Equilibria and when you realize that information is a source of strategic competitive advantage
If I know where the water is or where the gold is or whatever then in a win-lose game
I have advantage not only do I want to hoard that information and make sure the other guys don't get it
But I actually want to disinform them but with exponential information technology
Exponential disinformation that is split-test optimized to my specific audiences with all of behavioral cues
Etc built in and all sides being incented to do disinformation and disinformation
Happening the sides happen even within an organization
You have two intelligence agencies within one country competing for the same percentage of the budget
And so they will actually get into disinformation with each other and two people competing for the same job
Well, and so you get this fractal competition that leads to fractal disinformation that information ecology where we get worse and worse
Sensemaking with bigger and bigger actuator potential, right?
The technology is giving us the ability to make bigger choices that are progressively less well informed that again itself terminates
It does but how do we transition from something that is very obviously problematic yet baked into all of us in terms of how we've been brought up
That's a question. Well, the first thing I would say is you know, and now this comes back to your question
Am I an optimist or a pessimist?
I'm obviously not seeing the current structures through the rosy glasses of thinking that we can retrofit them in the work
But then what I'm also committed to is not coming to this question and saying it's hard
So let's not stop asking it
So the the process has been asking it really in earnest and exploring possible solutions
And then seeing where they're not adequate and then continuing to explore the way Edison did a light bulb, right?
But here it's civilization
So when you say they're very baked into us
there are some changes that will of course happen generationally where the
People more ready to make certain change within a culture the the fast adopters of
Certain kinds of new ideas will prototype a system that other people will not be ready for the effectiveness of that system will
Lead medium adopters to want to participate after they've seen it the kids who are born into that system will have it as the new normal
Their kids will will not even have that much memory of the previous dynamics
So some things will happen generationally some will happen via prototyping
Fundamentally ground up new civilization models at smaller scales that that show they have new economic systems new governance systems and new
infrastructure systems and culture systems that change the rival risk dynamics and
some of it will happen by
projects that do retrofit the current system to be
Both less destructive and more ready for bigger change even though it's not long-term sufficient
We can dig in more on any of those areas basically we're moving towards a world where we either
Solve these problems or bulletproof your Tesla's it's kind of is kind of what we're headed towards because we have the challenge
Increasingly as automation and AI come in and take away vast numbers of unskilled jobs
We're getting into a situation where it seems much more reasonable possibly necessary to get into some type of possibly universal basic income
Or alternatively designed system the problem
I see is that that system would challenge the existing system
So if you want to set up a new country in the US good luck kind of deal
Especially when the the nations are the ones that have the monopoly on force as you think about it the you know
the US had to to be created it had to you know leave Britain and
It went and found this new territory that was uninhabited
But of course it wasn't right like it was built on the slavery of one people in the genocide of another people to
Be able to have this chance to do its new prototype
And that's not a viable model moving forward anymore because even if it was a reasonable thing which it isn't it
The the militaries of the world are big enough
Everywhere and interconnected enough that we just can't do that kind of thing anymore and make it through so how do we do it?
It's tricky right because the actual constitutions of countries the foundational law as
Evolutionarily valuable as they were at their time some of them are also not adequate
So like when we look at the basis of rivalry the way we think about private property is actually one of the things that we have to
evolve and and not to
communism or socialism or
Capitalism like fundamentally new systems that have different properties in any of the systems that we've ever tried
We can get into some of the structures of what that could look like and but you can't actually do them within this structure of law
So there are prototypes that can happen within
existing countries like at a village level where people are trying to prototype different social dynamics and that's
Necessary and meaningful, but it's not a new civilization until it is a full-stack civilization from scratch
And it doesn't require import makes all of its own tech
This is where the people who are focused on being a seafaring nation
Which is kind of on the way to being a space-faring nation have really an important idea
Which is if we undertake the great project of building cities at sea several things happen one is they can have sovereign law and
They are also free from land that people have ideologic attachments to the land where their forefathers died for such and such
Also in the process of doing it. We're actually engineering scarcity out of the system
We're actually building new beach runt and building new desirable territory
And one of the key answers is you can't have abundance for everyone if things are worth more when they're scarce and worthless when they're abundant
You have a as soon as I value scarcity then I have an incentive to artificially protect a manufacturer scarcity
So you have to change economics at a deep enough level that we value what's actually valuable not the kind of fiat value of
That leads us to having gold just sit in bars in a safe not doing anything and valuing scarcity and then artificially driving it
And so one of the answers is how do we deal with scarcity as well?
We work to engineer them out of the system and this is an example an example of this happening in real everyday lives would be in San Francisco
People want to add more housing because there's just not enough housing and the locals don't want more housing built because that would drive down the prices
Is a simplified explanation for this so with with the seafaring nations
Obviously, I can see some illusions to blockchain. I imagine we'll go there in a second
But in your opinion does something like this work?
So the only the only way that a new nation could be formed would be if the if the big brother
Allows it to it's kind of like the little kid that's wants to play on the team
But he's five and you're ten and you can beat him up if you need to or want to well throughout history
We've definitely have this issue
The systems that proliferate are the proliferative ones not necessarily the ones that we would judge as good by any kind of
Deep assessment of what good is and so there have been there were plenty of cultures that
Invested more into the quality of life of their people than militaries and they got slaughtered by the warring cultures
And that's you know in a very simplified sense why we don't have the matriarchal cultures and a lot of the
Earth-based cultures and so we don't want to do that experiments again that experiment has already been done
So if you say okay within a rivalrous context you have to at minimum not lose
So then of course everyone's focused on how do we actually create strategic competitive advantage against the current things
And now it is still playing the same game. How do I win at force projection or resource extraction or disinformation?
And the moment it comes up with something that works and deploys it everybody else has it and etc
So we have to actually do something very different
Which is how do you make a system that doesn't lose but that isn't focused on winning that game?
And so it's focused on this not the ability to have power over others
But the ability to resist others having power over it
So it's focused on being able to maintain its own integrity rather than force projection
economic force narrative force force projection of any kind and
So does there's a few ways that that happens one is you know, there's a defensive only
Military capacity is that required during a transition? Of course that would be required during a transition
But to come upstream from there new systems will need to have export if
There if the new systems that we're talking about like there's plenty of people that want to get together and make
New systems based on all kinds of ideas
But those ideas are not based on a deep assessment of what is fundamentally not sustainable about our civilization
And is it addressing it? Is it just addressing the generator functions of x-risk?
Well enough that this new model is actually based on necessary and sufficient criteria for viable civilization
One of the things that we find as we're mentioning that this
Competitive drive leads to the competition over information leads to disinformation damages the information ecosystem and even just more mundane things like
that the best
Computer that science would know how to build can't actually be built today because the ip is partly owned by mac and partly owned by
You know many different companies and can't be synthesized and the same is true with anything
So even the richest person in the world can't buy what science knows how to do and if the ip could all synthesize
And if the information was being shared in real time
So the resources were not going into kind of gross duplication
How much better could we do and if we had no incentive to disinform or withhold information?
But all the incentive to share and synthesize information that information ecology would actually be radically more innovative
And so the source of competitive advantage is actually having created anti rivalry within itself
The anti rivalry leads to a higher degree of social synergy
Which leads to a higher degree of innovation
Where then the export can actually be solving problems for other countries that they can't currently solve for themselves
So you get a relationship of dependence rather than a threat. Have you seen the new adventures movie the black panther?
I haven't I would like to see it interesting
So it has um it has similar dynamics in play with a very advanced civilization
I won't spoil it for you or anyone listening
But are you saying then that the best system or the best way to transition would just be
It would be open sourcing everything of sorts
We have to go into a deeper idea set when we talk about open source
We still assume private property ownership and just open sourcing the ideas
And so you start to reach limits of where that makes sense
Let's say that open source is the first toe in the water of what I would suggest
Then what would be what you would be suggesting? You said you had thought about some potential structures and how this could be done
Yeah, so this is a topic that elicits an almost religious degree of emotional reaction for a lot of people
because people have a religious like attachment to capitalism and to
uh, say libertarianism and laissez-faire ideals
And automatically assume that anything other than that is Stalinism or something that will degrade into Stalinism and
so
I can say that what i'm going to propose is different in fundamental type and structure than anything
We have ever called an economic system to date because all of those systems are inadequate
capitalism obviously won the game of
Winning game dynamics between those systems
And so we wouldn't want to pick a shittier version of the shitty systems. We've had you fundamentally knew what i'm saying that so that
People's instant reaction. Oh, he's a communist. Maybe he can chill out for a minute
So we whenever we're designing something
We have to start by saying what are the design constraints of what a good design would actually be
What are we trying to design and how to how do we know what good design even means here?
And so when it comes to a design of a new civilization system
Actually saying what a desirable civilization is is not a trivial thing
It's actually a super fucking non trivial thing because we can see that everybody has very different ideas
But what a desirable civilization aren't and those ideas are often totally unconventional you talk to
A shaman and they want to see a civilization where we're much more connected to nature and much more connected to tribe
much more connected to a sense of spirituality and
Separate us and you talk to a
Dilitarian and they want to see us transcend biology and the physical universe completely upload our consciousness to the cloud and live in a
purely digital universe
And those are obviously radically different to definitions of desirable and we don't have an ethical framework that is commensurable with science
That can actually give us a basis for that flag that topic
And let's say that we actually have to address that
But the first thing that most of us can agree to in terms of what is desirable
Is that the civilization doesn't self-terminate? It's it's it's not a good design if it is intrinsically self-terminating by the structure of its own
Architecture and so if we say well, what is the what are the architectures that do self-terminate?
We can and i'm doing all this because before proposing an economic system
we have to know what an economic system is trying to do and
Otherwise, we're going to just take the ideas that we're used to the same foundational economic thinking and axioms and just keep
Rejiggering the combinatorics on them and there is no solution in that space that is adequate
I propose so we say so here's a way of thinking about it
and I want to present two kind of generator functions of self-termination of existential risk and
First kind of for historical context
We can say when we think about all of the previous great civilizations the egyptian empire the roman empire
Mesopotamia the mayans the ink as Aztecs any of them we notice that none of them still exist
They all
Collapsed and when you look at why they collapse you read books like the collapse of complex societies by tainter
You see that even if there was a siege that happened they had defended against bigger sieges for a long period of time
Or dealt with bigger famines or dealt with bigger internal conflicts
They lost coherence over time slowly had a process of losing coherence that ended up leading to
In losing the adaptive capacity to deal with the kinds of things they had dealt with so it is the precedent like the actual
ubiquitous precedent that all the things called civilizations that we've experienced so far self-terminate and
One of the major differences now is we don't really have an american civilization because america without
Trade couldn't actually build it's the stuff that it depends upon
We get our resources from other places in the world a lot of our
Manufacturing in tech and etc. And that's true for every country in the world
So we have this globalized supply chain
mediated civilization
And so the collapse of that is a collapse at a scale that has never faced the world before
And when we look at the collapse of those societies previously
We see that environmental collapse was often a part of it
They had they cut down all the trees had unremovable agriculture caused certification couldn't feed their people
Desertification is a thousands of year old human story. We just are doing it at way bigger scale now
And so where we created environmental fragility. We can actually create biosphere fragility now
That's a different you know scale, but of the same kinds of issues to the issues
We're talking about the create existential risk are the same kinds of issues that have always
Created problems for civilization that have led to war and have led to environmental destruction and collapse of societies just
multiplied by exponential tech now and
But the drivers are the drivers have always been it's just exponential tech is a forcing function for having to solve them
So i'm going to present two drivers of all those things and then say that a new economy has to solve both of those drivers
A new and it won't you can't think of an economy independent of a governance system and a culture and the technology that mediates it
Which is why we think about integrated civilization design
so one of them that we talked about source of
Self-termination is that rival risk dynamics have to be symmetrically bound to be stable the way we talked about in the beginning
Is it case in nature rival risk dynamics multiplied by exponential tech self-terminates because the in rival risk dynamics
We cause harm to each other and or cause harm to the commons in the process of advancing self
Whether self as a country or a company or a person or a family or a tribe or whatever
Exponential external externality and exponential rivalry self terminates on a finite playing field
Which is why trying to think about space, but we are still in a finite playing field
And so we actually have to get off of rival risk basis
So that's one if our new economic system governance system doesn't actually address
rival risk agency then it is not actually a viable system and
The second major cause of self-termination and and just to say when we look at you know
All of the different x- risks that we can look at today whether we're looking at
World War three or resource wars or so much economic inequality that it leads to
Collapse scenarios or the weaponization of exit of exponential tech biotech nanotech AI
Those are all exponential tech
Multiplied by rival risk dynamics leading to if not existential risk at least collapse
The other one is that the relation the difference between complicated and complex systems is critical
The things that arise by evolution are complex
So a tree an ecosystem our bodies complex meaning itself organizes
It's not designed by the outside and itself repairs and self evolves. We make complicated things
So they're not self-organizing we
Make a blueprint and then we build it and it doesn't self repair self-organize, etc
So that you know if I break my laptop, it's just broken unless I fix it
If I cut my leg it heals itself and if I burn the house that I'm in it doesn't repair if I burn a forest
It does repair so complex systems are antifragile complicated systems are fragile. We are
Converting the complexity of the natural world into a complicated human built world
which means we're converting antifragility to fragility and
Trying to run exponentially more energy through an increasingly fragile complicated system
And that also self terminates so we can call that complicated systems subsuming their complex basis
And so this means that we have to do
civilization design and technology in a different way where the
relationship between complicated and complex systems doesn't debase the antifragility of the complex ones and where the
complicated ones don't become unboundedly fragile
So we need an civilization system that addresses both of those things and an economic system is a part of it
And when we say economics, we're used to thinking about it in a very like just within the box
We've always thought about it economics is about trade
But when we think about it in a kind of expanded way we say well
One way of looking at it is that economics is actually a collective choice making system
Having more capital means that I can make bigger choices. I can employ other people
In carrying out choices that I want to I can be able to employ resources in doing it
And so capital equals concentrated choice making and so the idea
Right the kind of laissez-faire idea of why that would be a good collective choice making system
Is that to get capital I have to be a productive member of society that produces goods or services that the world wants and brings them to the world
With good value and if I do that I am actually evolving the collective
And so it's right that I have more choice making because I have kind of earned it, right? It's a meritocratic idea
This is of course gibberish because you know from the beginning of an inheritor of wealth
Might have no orientation or capacity to be productive and another example
I can make money not by being productive but by being extractive and
By externalizing costs and that's net bad for everybody, but I am incented to do it and on and on right
It's very expensive to innovate. It's very cheap to copy and then be able to scale
And so the idea that those who will have the capital got it by doing things that are net good for the world
Is it just obviously silly and so we say wow it really is a collective choice making system
That is just a really shitty collective choice making system. So what are better choice making?
Well to be able to make choices I have to make sense of the world first
So what is my collective sense making process to know what's going on?
What's needed what what good choices would even look like and then choice making so what we think of as governance is also
A collective choice making system. It's also a shitty one
Even though it was the best one we could do at the time
And so you can't think of economics and governance separately
You have to think about them together along with also things like media and education
That are going to be part of our sense making frame works and now technology and say how do we get
individual and collective sense making and choice making to be more
Omni adaptive so not just short-term adaptive while externalizing harm to the future or adaptive for this agent while externalizing harm to others
But choices that are omnipositive that engender others making similar omnipositive choices
So we didn't talk about the design yet. We're talking about design constraints that it has to do these things to actually
Be able to handle
Decentralized exponential tech without collapsing does that resonate make sense so far that makes sense so far
I think the bigger challenge is less so the design versus the transition
It's much harder to build something than it is to break it down
so I feel like the
The simplest way for something like this to be implemented wouldn't necessarily be to build it up
But would be in the in the ashes so to speak the ashes of collapse of the current system
You know, this is a common type of political thought
which is
that there are
Throughout history these kind of bottlenecks where a lot of population isn't going to make it through
Be the ones to get through the bottleneck and then build on the other side
And I think some of the people in the highest positions of power today are thinking that way and running those strategies
and I'll tell you a couple reasons why that doesn't work the
Bottle neck here is one that we in most scenarios. We don't actually make it through
Yep, that's a big deal
And so being the idea that we can let it all go to shit go into our deep underground military bases and then
Come out and repopulate is probably just actually not viable
Based on what what the dynamics that would lead to the collapse are and what they do to
Viable future potentials at all
Obviously if we talk about things like gray goo scenarios or green goo scenarios or mini bad kind of weaponized biotech scenarios or nuclear scenarios
Or certain environmental scenarios the ability to rebuild afterwards is pretty fucked somewhere between impossible and just really really lame
and
So that's one reason the other reason is we can already kind of see that the world is
Collapsed I mean
It is already past the
Inflection points of its adaptive capacity now deeply in the diminishing returns
Not able to actually innovate the solutions that it needs
And so so long as you're not directly trying to threaten it then
There is actually already space to build new things
Do you think that what we're going through now is just the immune system so to speak of the planet?
I think it's a metaphor that we can use to
Say if we do enough harm to the planet that the planet won't support us here anymore
But I the same thing would happen if we were in a really big spaceship
And it wouldn't be the immune system of the spaceship. It would be a self terminating system
Right, it's actually the way that the agents are interacting with each other in their environment would self terminate
In any group of agents in any environment
Because the incentive structure is all wrong. You said you had some thoughts on how this could be redesigned. You were discussing the
the
Yes, so I'm not going to try and
Talk about all of the parts because it's beyond the scope of what we can do today
But I'll give an example of a couple of them
So we need to switch not just from a rival risk dynamic where I can advance my own well being independent of or at your expense
Or at the expense of the commons
I have to move that not just to non rival risk, which just means we're uncoupled but to anti rival risk
Which means we're positively coupled which means that better quality of life for anyone
Happens in ways that are commensurate with better quality of life for everyone in the commons and
Before we just say well, that sounds fucking ridiculous
Just think about a body and think about the 70 trillion give or take cells in a body that are all actually
self-organizing autonomous living agents and all of them
Operate from their own bottom-up code independent of top-down neuroendocrine control their own bottom-up code
They operate in a way that is good for them and all the cells around them and good for the whole simultaneously
And there is both bottom-up
Organization of all the cells self-governing and top-down organization of neuroendocrine system taking messages from the whole system
And then being able to give messages to coordinate function of the whole system
But the bottom the top-down system isn't imposed it emerged from the self-organization of the bottom-up system
And so you I mean what's good for the lungs is also good for the heart
The lungs can't advantage themselves at the expense of the heart
But what's good for the lungs is also good for the cells within the lungs, right?
You have this kind of dynamic where you have an anti rivalry at all scales organ to organ organ to cell cell to cell
And so we can see examples of multi-agent systems that work that way and that produce really
Radical kinds of emergent properties in terms of the intelligence of the systems
so
If we let's take an example of that when we talk about rival risk dynamics
economically, we talk about rival risk goods rival risk good is a good where if you
consume it, I no longer have access to it and
so because the good is not
shareable then it creates a possible basis of rival risk relationship, right and
Consume it might mean consume it and make it no longer useful like food or in the way we currently do economics
Just you possessing something even if it's still useful even if I could theoretically use it
But you possessing it so I don't have access to it
It's still a rival risk dynamic and for the most part we only get access to things by possessing them
which is decreasing the access of others and
So and so that is obviously a rival risk basis
So let's just take things that are already happening and extend them and say, okay
When we look at something like ride sharing an uber or lift we see a movement from
Transportation mediated by a good owning a car to mediated by a service having access to transportation as a service
and
if we imagine
Something like uber becoming ubiquitous where I had quick easy access to transportation all the time and it's what everybody did
And now we use
Something like a blockchain to disintermediate the central company and take
What is the extracted profit and put it back into the whole ecosystem?
and then of course the cars are self-driving and they are so now we start to think about a
ubiquitous
transportation service that is actually
not centrally owned and yet has the
Resource processes to get repaired and get developed that it needs
You have just enough cars that there are enough cars for peak demand time plus those to be in service
which would be about
40th of the total amount of cars there are now in terms of the load
It's taken out of the earth factoring how much how many cars are sitting unused most of the time and yet you have
A higher quality of transportation service available to everybody
Dude, where's my car now you
Using the transportation service doesn't decrease my access at all. You having access doesn't fuck up my access at all
So we're non-rival risk, but if by going places
your generativity increases
And the things that you generate also go into these type of commons based
Access systems that I will end up having access to then the more generative you are the better quality life
I have so say you are going to a maker studio that you have
Just full access to and whatever you make you're not trying to sell to get money because
Say in a world where everything was structured like this
You already have access to everything that is interesting to have then you don't differentiate yourself by having stuff
You don't get status by it. You differentiate yourself by creating stuff
And so the incentive is to create stuff. Obviously you say well, who would do the shitty jobs?
We have to incent people right now to do the shitty jobs
Obviously, we're depending upon technological automation of the most rote kinds of things
So we de necessitate extrinsic motive throughout much of the system
But rather than just leave everybody jobless and have all the robot wealth get concentrated up to a small amount of agents
Which is a dystopia we can actually say
Oh that changes the whole theoretical basis of the thing that we had to call the labor economy
That was the basis of both capitalist and communist thought of why we had to create
You know like the the whole idea there was the communist
Thought if we just met everybody's needs if we split up the resources met everybody's needs
Then who would want to do the shitty jobs? Nobody would want to do them
So the state has to enforce them so communism is imperialist
So we're going to let the free market force them and they just go homeless if they don't do the shitty jobs
And we tell them the story that they can get educated and get better jobs even though statistically
It's very hard to get off the hamster wheel
now imagine a scenario where
Scarcity is not the default and getting stuff is not the programmed in default that I need to survive and then to
You know move up maslow's hierarchy and self actualize. It's just an uninteresting given and
So and and then you think about the radical creativity of children that are asking like
They want to build stuff and want to ask questions all the time until we break it out of them by putting them in school
Where we don't facilitate anything they're interested in at all and we try to force them to pay attention to shit
They aren't interested in and then break their interest in life where they just want to watch tv or do video games
If we when you think about all the great inventors and scientists and artists
They were intrinsically driven by fascination and passion that just somehow hadn't been broken in them
But that everybody has if you had a system that was focused on facilitating it
And so the movement from an extrinsic control and incentive system to an intrinsic
Drive cultivation system is one of the key things that happens
And so now you make music not to try and get money to have access to shit
You already have access to because you want to make money and you want the world
And you want to make music and you want the world to hear it or you want to make technology
You want the world to hear whatever it is
so now you having access to the art studio and the science studio and all those things and the
Retreat place where you can write some great novel increases the wealth of the commons that I have access to now
We are not non rivalrous or anti rivalrous your increased access
Leads to my increased access and because we have enough of everything for peak demand time
You even consuming something doesn't decrease my ability to consume those things and so we have removed
the
And and because me having access and you having access to the car cars doesn't have to require owning our own car
It requires radically less resource from the world, etc
So these are examples and these are very partial
But of how we can start to think about moving from agent misalignment where you getting something actually
means me having less access
to
Agent alignment
So with the primary with the primary difference between communism in the past and something
akin to what you're proposing today just be
technological limitations of being able to have higher value and
Abundance when it comes to both automation and production of goods. No, not at all. That's part of it
But if I say okay, there's scarce resources
So let's let everybody just compete for him and see who gets what that's capitalism and survival the fittest is how it's going to go
Or let's divvy him up and we'll all have kind of an equal share. That's communism divvy him up is just
And also a stupid allocation of resource because we still have something where
Okay, so now we just divvied up the scarce pie without engineering the scarcity out of the system without even making an efficient use
Of the resources commons based access is not everybody gets a shitty car
It's the access to everyone has access to better kinds of cars than even the wealthiest people in the world have access to today
Because we get to synthesize all the ip and because there we're not trying to make something that will go out of style or go up
Salete so we design it for modular upgrade ability and etc
so
One of the key things is the movement from a lowest common denominator
equality of having to a
highest possibility
Wealth of the commons that everyone has generative access to I think that's what they were trying to do in the past
They just have to do pretty bad
But that's um that's beside the point
Is it possible to do something like this without having just one world government or can this happen in the current country?
system
Elements can and they are but you know you're you're going to have things like in uber
That its primary goal is going to be its stock price going up and
Maximizing its extraction and so even if it puts us in
Non-rivalrous relationship to each other as far as car access goes it has a net rivalrous relationship with the rest of the
economic world and
You know with its own drivers and etc. So within that context those
Things are still going to bring over some destructive DNA
Now, you know when when you're asking how do we transition? I would say there are three different
Categories of work that are really important that we can think about there's protective work
transitional work and
post-transitional prototype work there the protective work is
How do we prevent fucked up stuff more fucked up stuff from happening?
So, you know buying the last pieces of virgin forest and protecting them so that there
We still have some biodiversity to repopulate with when we're ready is a super smart intelligent thing to do work to
Decrease risk associated with exponential tech
Is a super smart thing to do being able to
retrofit nuclear plants so that they're more stable like all of the protective type of work is really important and
Remediation work that is protective. How do we you know decrease the total amount of nitrogen effluent?
Causing dead zones that is also protecting against the expansion of those dead zones
That's not going to get us a new world, but it will keep us it will buy us more time
And more world left to work with and then transitional work is where we're not changing the foundational axioms
We're not changing capitalism. We're not changing democracy. We're not changing countries
but we are transitioning things that can be
Transitioned that both make the structures less harmful and more ready for larger changes
And so, you know blockchain and the whole movement to decentralize
Where the areas that are currently very extractive being able to de
Dissintermediate a bunch of financial services so that that wealth goes back into the market for everyone
That's an example of a kind of transitional play that is actually relevant and good now
That doesn't mean that decentralization is always good. There's plenty of problems associated with it
But there are a number of transitional technologies that can happen. There are some, you know, conscious capitalism as a whole
Is transitional how can we kind of retrofit capitalism to be able to use market driven solutions to do good things
And all of that's relevant. Then you've got how do we prototype new systems that
Meet the design criteria of necessary and sufficient design for long-term viability
And that actually happens at a design and prototyping level
All of those things need to be happening concurrently by people that are oriented to do those types of work
And they also need to be able to iterate and adapt the I imagine
Civilization design much like launching a startup is not what you expect it to be when you first start out
Totally, how can we deal with that if we it is people's lives on the line? Say more. What do you mean?
So it's easy enough if you launch a startup and realize, oh, we need to change this a little bit
We need to focus not on walking people's dogs, but we need to walk their cats and instead of doing it
We have other people do et cetera just kind of iterating on ideas
But when it comes down to designing a system
Both with blockchain and with more of what you're describing in terms of
An access or a resource-based type economy
How can we do that and not have a situation where
Setting something up is ultimately setting it up for failure because it wasn't fine tuned correctly enough
Yeah, I would say that it is a combination of much better
analysis of the actual nature of the problems and so that our thinking on
Necessary and sufficient design criteria is actually really good thinking and then also the right type of
experimentation and iteration process. What is a
Minimum prototype and then how do we learn from it and iterate quickly enough?
And so it has to be both much much better design thinking up front and good iterative design process
What's the minimum prototype in your opinion for civilization?
Yeah, for civilization for a city for a government. Well, so it depends on what we're prototyping. Obviously, you know, we could prototype
I'll give you a for instance
I have a friend named Nelson del Rio who has a really brilliant
Capitalism hack that's transitional that I think is
Should be implemented a lot and basically it's a very sophisticated way being able to do
development
Where you're designing
Whole markets and whole ecosystems and binding them together because we said it was the you know asymmetrical unbinding
There was a problem. So, you know, you go to a developing world and typically what happens is the government is broke
It means some money for something it has some asset like oil or metals or something like that that is a very high profit extractable
Item a multinational comes in says we'll give you the money that you need if we get the rights to this
And they the government signs over the rights
They multinational extracts the super high profitability thing
Externalizes all the cost to the area and the people and now they have no ability to solve that and they have to try and beg for
non-profit money if you
looked at being able to
Have the government not give the rights to that because it had another access to the immediate capital that it needed
And it was going to bundle together the things that had very high profit potential with things that needed subsidized
Where the entire bundle was still net profitable
But the high profits subsidizing the other things like say education and rural health care and some infrastructure development
Allows healthy development of the whole system. And then you also bundle
Dealing of externalities with ways of monetizing that. So there's a sewer that's dumping heat to sewage
Killing the whole ecosystem of a better sewage system doesn't have a market
Viable approach because people won't pay for it right now government doesn't have money to do it
But we identify that there used to be a fishing industry that generated 10 million dollars a year
That has died because of the sewage and that if we put a better sewer system on the fishing industry would come back
We'd be able to generate 10 million dollars a year sustainably from that
That pays for the cost of doing the sewage system and bundle those together
We can create a whole can be ecosystem bundle
Underwrite the thing and have the government
Agree to do that the underwriting agency raises the funds and gets them to the government
And now you don't have this extreme extractive kind of thing like that's an example of a transitional system prototype
That can happen at the scale of a local region in the developing world
And you know, it's basically a single operating agreement and you can create a radically better developing world
That's one example of say a minimum prototype of a transitional
Economic system where you're basically binding economics with law
If you want to say what's the minimum prototype of a ground up full stack civilization
The minimum prototype is where it doesn't need any import to be a high tech civilization
which means it creates its own biotech and its own consumer electronics and its own airplanes and
The minimum scale that can do that is a city state
So basically it's
Sovereign so state but at a city level a city is actually a self organizing system a country isn't it's arbitrary
But cities are actually natural emergent phenomena all over the world where all the things that are necessary for life end up co-emerging
And so a city state scale full stack civilization is the minimum prototype
But of course to even have the people who know how to do
This social dynamics in that world like lawyers as they're currently trained and judges and bankers and politicians would have no role
In that world because we'd be changing the economic and judicial and governance systems enough that it's totally new training and
In civics and all those things
So how do we develop those new systems and how do the people get trained in them?
That'll obviously happen at smaller scales that are not it's still dependent on import. We're still you know on
bought laptops and flying on other people's planes, but that are prototyping some of the civilization design and
and
Getting the things like the structures that are needed that don't exist yet develop to be able to boot the larger ones
So you've got um, you know minimum scale for a full prototype
But then you have minimum scale to get the parts together to be able to do that and so
Reverse engineer when I listen to how you describe this
I would say
Categorically China seems much closer than the US in terms of what you're aiming towards or who has the potential to reach this
China has
More coherence of a certain kind
Because it has stronger top-down control and so it's using top-down control choosing a singleton force
to keep multipolar dynamics in check and bottom-up dynamics can't address
Multi-polar dynamics as long as the bottom-up dynamics have arrival or spaces
You always get tragedy of the commons and arms races and things like that
But it is if you have a top-down system that
Is not it's not emergent
Then it is both fragile and
Disenfranchises the individual agents and so in some ways China could use that force to
That top-down force to build new systems that transcend itself. It doesn't seem that that is the direction it's on
Okay, fair enough. I don't think anyone's very close to what you're talking about
I think Scandinavian countries would have to be probably the furthest along just because they're the most socialized and also
The most economically successful so it makes it a little bit easier
Scandinavian countries and japan
Um, the countries that have the best education technology low violence, you know clean cities
they're very small populations and they're very homogeneous populations and
It's much easier to create coherence in small homogeneous populations
It's much harder
And they're also small land sizes to be able to create coherence across a lot of cultural distance
And geographic distance and population size actually requires different types of social technology than the ones that are employed there
But yes, they obviously have the highest quality of life metrics across a number of quality of life metrics currently
You take places like Iceland that over through their banking system that are quite small
They could actually do a really profound kind of prototype
Or when you say rebuilt from the ashes, you know, some very small countries island countries cuba
Whatever that are in a position to say hey, we're not actually invested in what we have that much
We could build something new that's also interesting if you were pulling the strings today for a large
Country or superpower. What would be your first couple of moves?
That's a very hard question because you're you're saying if I put you in the position of
trying to steer the
system that is itself the problem and
I don't know if you've ever
Read the the dictators handbook
There's a really great cartoon made about it called rules for rulers
But even with top-down control
I can't do things too radical that the rest of the base that supports me doesn't understand
Or I get taken out of power in a hurry, right?
So I have to appeal to my current base of power to be able to stay in a position of power
And so if I'm at the top of a current state, which is a power structure
I have to be playing the power game effectively. So I don't know what could actually be done
It's mostly not how I think but you know, obviously things like I mean, this is now just cliche things that would involve
Being able to well, I'll give you I'll actually give you an example
Here's something where you couldn't you would be fucking up your power base
I would make the military industrial complex not for profit. I would remove the perverse incentive of
The largest block of the global economy
needing war and
Try and do that now I would get kicked out if I tried to do that because I would totally fuck up
Way too many vested interests
But those are the types of moves where you're not just creating a policy that can be changed again easily
But trying to change deeper underlying system dynamics to create perverse incentive
And I think our elected officials are certainly not helping in most of those regards. If you were a student today, what would you study?
What would you focus on? Well on the elected officials thing capitalism plus
Representative government together will always be crony capitalism because you're putting an agent within the economic system
In the position to make decisions for the economic system as a whole
But they can't stop being an agent within it, right?
And so someone can always offer them a backdoor deal that says
legislate in this way and you know, we'll fill up your your offshore swiss bank account and
Even more we'll just I mean even more simply will give the campaign budgets to get you reelected
And try and do the other thing and we will put all of the lobbyists on
Our payroll to stop you and we'll fund the other guy winning
and so because lobbyists are paid for and they're the ones who are changing law and because
campaign budgets cost money and because the
Choice making agents are themselves also economic actors
The whole structure of that is that the economics ends up corrupting the governance
Do you think we'd have a better system where it was a lottery and we just picked people out of a hat?
probably there
I haven't thought about that. There would be pros and cons to it. Obviously the people would have no
Training but they would also not have been trained in the really dreadful things and conditioned in that way
So it would be an interesting experiment
I was talking to someone
Previously and they were discussing how that would also be a democracy. It wouldn't be a democracy where you voted
But it would be one where we agreed upon a common system. That is a democracy for electing people
Yeah, so yeah when we think about that
So just a couple things on democracy
So to get everyone to agree on something you have to have not that many people like we said small
Homogeneous populations have a much easier time doing that tribes had consensus type systems because you couldn't have the kind
Of polarity of right and left hating each other in a tribe where they would depend on each other
Right, like you couldn't have anyone feeling super disenfranchised by a choice where everybody had to pull and was working in it
So the reason for the Dunbar number the reason that tribes stayed capped at a small number was everybody had to be able to sit
In a circle and talk long enough that we heard what everybody knew and thought and felt and cared about and could come up
With a synergistic satisfied for everybody. That's why they're capped in size as soon as you get a lot of people
Not everybody can be involved in the decision-making because we can't get everybody to
We can't give everyone to agree because we can't get everyone to communicate because there's no communication dynamics at work at scale
so then
Some people end up ruling for everyone else and that's the history of
Civilization of top-down control systems and then we're like well
Hey rather than just have a small number of people ruling everyone
What if we at least had most of the people agree on something that seems like it's more fair and so democracy
But to even be able to do that to to have everyone vote you have to have them vote on something fairly simple
Right like yes or no on a proposition or this candidate or this candidate because they can't actually engage
The large population in a conversation that can generate new ideas
So there's this idea that we all get a vote
but we get a vote of propositions that we weren't involved in creating and
of officials that we weren't involved in picking and so
There's frame control and so you get kind of you kind of get a vote within frame control
And who is it that's creating the propositions as always vested interests?
And so it's not really a collective intelligence system, right? It is a
The other thing is to the process of making propositions that are binary
Yes, no that are going to be made by some
Group that is focused on something that they care about that will be less than everything impacted
Is why every proposition is good for something and bad for something else
Which is why some people like it and some people don't like it and the act of voting on things that
Benefit one thing and harm another is inherently polarizing and so the structure of democracy
Leads to polarization
Because of in groups and out groups getting created around a bad proposition that's based on a theory of trade-offs
And so what about a collective intelligence system that actually figures out what a good proposition would be first isn't made by vested interests
That actually does collective sense making around what is needed and what's good before doing collective choice making
Like those would be in the spirit of what we think of as democracy better
The thing that we have is you can't really it's not a very effective kind of democracy because you don't have sense making before choice making
And you don't have real choice making a very limited choice making within
Within constraints that are framed controlled by vested interests and that are always polarizing
So the the moral of the story is more better and more transparent and open conversation among people
Yes, and that solves the majority of the problems at least when people start talking about the problems without resorting to violence hate
aggression or hiding
Obviously if we are making choices that inter-effect each other then we need processes of communicating with each other to come to agreements
and of what good choices would be and at the scale of a tribe we know how to do it
It's our of all capacity
We haven't known how to do it at larger scale and all the communication technologies that have scale have been built by
Capitalisms in nation states built by rival risk dynamics to extend rival risk power, right?
That's why they're broadcast one direction communication channels where what goes on them is something that generates more resources so that I can keep broadcasting
But one of the things that will give us new governance capacities is new communication technologies
It's not a given that they'll be developed for that purpose
We have to develop them for that purpose
But the kind of communication technologies that can do collective sense making to inform collective choice making blockchain is obviously
Something that can do at least parts of that make the possibility of being able to have the kind of dynamics that happened at a tribe
actually happen at scale do you think we're moving towards a world of
thousands of micro governments
Um or one one mega government does your body have lots of different organs and tissues or is it one body?
I like it. You don't have 70 trillion cells in one blob. You have layers of self-organization
But the whole thing is also self-organizing
So you do have
Governance at the macro scale that you have governance at all of the scales all the way down to individuals actually self-governing well
I want to transition a little bit
I know we've been talking for a bit so part of what we like to do on fringe fm is get the world's most interesting folks
And talk about not just their expertise, but the the tangentially related topics that they're interested or excited in
So what outside of your traditional work? Are you most fascinated excited or scared of?
um
That's that's a lot of different possible ways to go with that
So I am I'm simultaneously fascinated by and scared of all areas of advanced technology
because
I'm fascinated because they offer
I'm fascinated and scared because they offer increased choice making capacity
Which is obviously exciting if we make good choices and sucks if we make shitty choices and within a the current choice making framework
I'm more scared actually of mini exponential techs than excited
But in the right context very excited about it a lot of work in biotech and kind of the future of
Functional medicine and regenerative medicine is an area I spend a lot of time and a lot of interest
foundational philosophy and our
Our ability to actually understand the nature of reality what reality is and
Of ourselves and the relationship between our self and reality and to navigate it well
I would say is just like the most foundational interest that everything else
Is always in relationship with which of course also looks like consciousness studies and things we call personal development
I'm a pretty interested person
My I if growing up I would suffer from
Overwhelmed with too many interests. What was the structure like and how did that create you?
I was homeschooled by really
Awesome parents who wanted to do an educational experiment and see what happens if you give a kid no curriculum at all
And just expose them to
Interesting things and then facilitate whatever they're interested in so I never learned how to spell really
I never developed good handwriting
There were certain areas of study that I I didn't go into that a lot of people do
But the areas of study that I was interested in which was all the sciences and all the philosophic traditions
I got to study very deeply and because
I wasn't focused on things
I wasn't being forced to focus on things I wasn't interested in and now and my interests were facilitated
My interest in life was growing in the process of of that and so yeah, that was a that was an early start
With that when did you become interested or we could also say obsessed with functional medicine and self enhancement?
I I actually got interested in those topics early because when I was a kid my younger brother had
A period where he started having pretty significant behavioral disorders. He was a little four five-year-old kid
violence and
he got diagnosed with
psychiatric
Diagnosis and Tourette's and the alpathic approach was to put him on a number of psych meds and they said he you know
He might be on a path towards institutionalization and my mom took him to dr.
Bossant Lauda Ayurveda keeler who gave him some herbs and told him to avoid a couple foods
He was allergic to and he corrected completely in a month and those issues never came back
and
That was the entry point and then a couple years later my
Mom had an incurable autoimmune disease and a drug reaction to it
Put her in the hospital and they said she died that night. I was again young kid and she didn't die and
They said she never walked and she walked
Well, she went to that same doctor and she healed completely
And so I got to see the inadequacies of modern medicine for things other than acute acute issues
And that there were other approaches that were quite meaningful
so then I actually went and got trained as a massage therapist when I was 13 and
Got into different systems of body work and then started studying nutrition and and had always been interested in
meditation and spiritual practice and so that just kind of deepened throughout my life and people near me would have
illnesses and that would lead me to study solutions. So, you know, I actually
got diagnosed with an incurable autoimmune condition and
that drove me much deeper in the study because I had to figure out how to resolve it and
but this was after already having a background in a lot of biosciences and
complexity thinking and
Was able to think about how the body as a self-organizing system actually self-organizes how it self regulates better and
How does self-regulation break down and how can we support the bodies rather than override the body's regulatory capacity, right?
Someone's blood pressure is high. So we give them a med to lower it or the cholesterol is high
We give them something to lower it rather than ask why is the body not regulating well?
And how do we actually support its own regulatory capacity and address why it's not regulating well?
Which obviously again, we have the perverse incentive of the fact that to get a drug through FDA approval
cost a billion dollars and so I'm only going to do that on a drug
I can patent to ever be able to make my money back to patent it. It has to be a synthetic molecule
Which means it wasn't part of how you were healthy before you got ill and so studying health and then how to support endogenous structures
There's actually no money for and so yeah
So then I figured out how to correct that for myself and that led me down a whole train of functional medicine work
I think you should plug your podcast here because it's very relevant and I don't think we could go down all of those rabbit holes
yeah, so we have a podcast called collective insights and
it's also on our website neuro hacker com and
Talk about a number of topics related to human health and thriving and development there and you're a pretty high performer
What's your daily routine look like? My daily routine is interesting. It's not it's not the routine that I would suggest for most people
I am nocturnal. I have always been nocturnal
my parents said I was nocturnal as a
When I was first born and I of course put myself on diurnal schedules many times in university and whatever
but my schedule always comes back my most creative time is when everyone's asleep at night and
I'm actually healthy
My circadian rhythm is altered
But I have a healthy circadian rhythm when I you know test my cortisol melatonin and all like that
Most people are diurnal
They do much better with a regular and early or sleep schedule
Which is why I said I wouldn't recommend it
but
Yeah, I I mean I do most of the things that are generally good practices for people to do like
Have a morning routine that involves
meditation and
exercise and then planning the day ahead and
Have a wind down routine at night and have practices to take care of various areas of health in my body and you know things like that
What time do you wake up every day? I thought you were kidding about the nocturnal thing earlier. Nope
I um
I usually go to bed around three and wake up at 11
I neglected sleep for too many years and that that's not a good thing to do
And so I don't do that anymore and I would be on a later schedule
Except my life currently needs to meet with people and if I wake up much later than that
I just don't have enough hours in the day that overlap with other people to meet with them
Interesting. I saw I saw a job description you put out for an executive assistant recently
And it was the most it was the most badass job description profile I've ever seen. How do you prioritize what you focus on?
Yeah, it's a great question
I would say that getting good at and continuously better at that is one of the critical things that everybody needs to
Invest in so I I kind of categorize my life
So I can think about you know
my two major projects is the work in biotech and in medicine and the work in civilization design and
Then my personal life
So I kind of think of those three buckets and then I have primary areas of focus in each of those and like within my personal life
there's obviously subdivisions of physical health and
evolution of my learning and my family relationships and my marriage and you know other relationships and and
so I think I look at the picture of my whole life and
Which is my mission and how
My values show up in all of the areas of my life and the health and integrity of the whole thing
And you know some things need to happen in each of those areas daily or weekly or monthly or as needed
And one of the things I find is that it's hard for us to hold the whole picture with our life
And so we just get pretty reactive most of the time and we'll be focused on some area
We're really focused on fitness
But we're kind of like letting our relationship slip or our finances slip or not tending to our mind as much
And notice we're getting more stressful thought patterns or not focused on our creativity or whatever it is
And so then we whatever area is screaming gets our attention
And then we're neglecting something else and we're kind of flip-flopping between the broken areas or
To get something done we just decide to have areas of our life chronically deficient
Which ends up making us the kind of unbalanced person that doesn't actually think as as clearly and holistically
So the ability to hold the whole picture of our life and maintain the whole thing
And then we might only advance one or two areas at a time
But then if we can maintain the area
Whatever we advance and prevent regress. This is one of the big things. It's like maintenance is not sexy
and
Yet typically we advance in an area and then we slip back and we advance and slip back
So we get not that much in that progress
So if we can hold all the areas of our life in at least
Maintenance and then as we make progress in areas hold that maintenance
And we can actually have a balanced life and make progress in a lot of areas over time
Yeah, it's like cooking with multiple burners. You turn the heat up and down depending on what you're focused on. Yeah
Very interesting. I know I've had you for a while and you've got a lot
You've got to get back to I have one last question
We ask every guest and that is what's something you'd like to leave in our audience with a quote an action item something to look into
so
There's so many things that come up
so the first one that came to mind was for people to study the things they're interested in more and
If they're interested in topics like this conversation and like how do we make the world better in civilization design actually?
spend time talking to people about it and
researching good thought that has happened on those topics and also
Knowing that if the solutions were figured out that would be implemented and so
There is actually work for you to do here
And if you feel called to it like the difference between the people who
Invented the shit that the rest of the world uses and the people who didn't was they actually cared about those things existing enough and believed in
Their own capacity to do something that had never been done that they worked at something
They didn't know how to do and didn't give up when they failed long enough that they actually figured out how to do it
And if you feel called to make a difference in the world in an area that is needed that isn't currently being tended to
It can be figured out and you can figure it out if you are earnest enough
Persistence is the most powerful and important trait in my opinion. One must be persisting about the right things
It's easy to persist at doing the
Thing that society or our parents told us to do without really thinking meaningfully about is this actually ours to do
And it's also easy to keep persisting rather than reflect on why it's going wrong
so we're we're not being very intelligent in approach
so it's the combination of clarity of what is yours to do what you actually really care about so the fuel is love and
persistence and
Intelligence paying attention so that you're persisting on the right things in the right ways
Very well said as always daniel. I want to thank you for coming on. This has been a lot of fun
It's been quite a interesting conversation. We'll have it have you on to discuss some of your other topics at another time
Matt, this was really good. Thank you. I appreciate you having me on and where's the best place for people to find you?
We'll learn a little bit more about what you do
So I have a blog we're right on some of these civilization topics
It's called civilization emerging calm
And then if people are interested in some of the thoughts on biotech the you know going to neural hacker.com and checking out the podcast
Is a good idea. We believe credibility is king
You may have noticed that french fm unlike most other podcasts isn't filled with three minutes of ads at the beginning and end of every
Episode per comfy mattresses better hiring or conferencing software or robotic doorbells
And that's not that advertisers haven't asked the thing is if we tried to sell you on buying our advertisers products
That would require deception and the level of misalignment and lack of open transparency and trust that we think podcasting in this medium
Necessitates would you trust someone who turned around and tried to sell you shit?
We wouldn't the online ads based ecosystem is killing our political and societal world
We're used to getting something for nothing and are thus stuck in a clickbaity society of trumpian tweets focused on
Extracting attention and avoiding the real meaningful issues and conversations to fix this we need to start paying for things that we value
Otherwise, it's all buzzfeed from here on out
