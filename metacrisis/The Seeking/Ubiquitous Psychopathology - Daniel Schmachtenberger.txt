The type of sanity that we're interested in is really well-being of the individual,
meaning that they are capable of making sense of the world and acting in ways that are healthy, adaptive, functional for them
and that are not unhealthy for the society as a whole unnecessarily.
Welcome to Project Sanity. My name is Scott Andrew.
Today's episode is the first of four episodes of Project Sanity this month,
which I'm calling the February Social Vaccine Series,
in an attempt to correct this life-blind value system disorder now faced by all peoples on Earth.
Now, I'm incredibly humbled by the incredible guests from around the planet
that have agreed to be interviewed about topics they themselves have chosen to speak about,
which, when viewed within a systems context, are all extremely important to addressing this mind-lock we all now collectively face.
All episodes of Project Sanity can be found at projectsanity.online and also on iTunes, Facebook and YouTube.
A big thank you to everyone that has supported this show thus far through listening and sharing episodes.
I really appreciate that. If anyone wants to be a guest on the show or wants to contact me for any reason at all,
please get in touch with me through the contact form on the website projectsanity.online.
Now, today I'm very, very honored to be joined by Daniel Schmuckdenberger,
one of the most important thinkers on the planet in the current life space.
Daniel is the director of research and development and a co-founder at the Neurohacker Collective,
where he is focused on developing processes and technologies for advancing medicine and human optimization.
He is particularly focused on personalized medicine, adequate approaches to complex illness,
and deepening our knowledge of how the human regulatory systems function,
how they break down and how they can be supported to function with greater resilience.
Welcome to Project Sanity, Daniel.
I'm happy to be here. Thanks for having me.
Thank you so much for joining us today. Look, I really appreciate you taking the time
to break some of these new emerging understandings down for us.
If anyone doesn't know Daniel, he's done some fantastic podcasts.
Please listen to them if you haven't already done so.
It's an amazing body of work that's emerging.
Now, Daniel, you've spoken for the need of a new system of economics redesigned at an axiomatic level
along with a new system of sense-making and governance.
So would you mind breaking this down for us so some of us can understand
what this idea of ubiquitous psychopathology of the current civilization model is really about?
Okay, so we've talked about the idea of this conversation we'd have here today
being titled ubiquitous psychopathology, which means kind of rampant mental illness
or mental unwellness, which is of course a startling and kind of cheeky term.
But I think it's actually a meaningful thing for us to explore.
And the idea is that we're not talking about clinical DSM diagnosis of psychopathology
that someone wouldn't have for treatment.
We're talking about are there low-grade but meaningful types of mental unwellness
that are really ubiquitous, that are affecting not only individual quality of life,
but how we operate as a whole species.
And if so, what is driving that and how would we go about working to correct that?
So that's kind of the goal for us to talk about today.
And to the degree that macroeconomics is part of that in terms of incentivizing things
that move us in the wrong direction or creating an incentive to disinform.
So people have misinformation or whatever for governance.
We might touch on those, but we're really going to kind of focus on,
my interest here is rampant insanity.
I will just say regarding the way you introduced me, which was kind but actually overly kind
and its relationship to this topic, I don't think of myself as one of the,
whatever the term you used was one of the most important thinkers of this time
and I wouldn't even know what that means.
But that's one of the things that leads to a world of ubiquitous insanity
is ubiquitous misinformation where for the purpose of attracting attention,
marketing, whatever, we say things in a way that is effective,
whether or not it's clear or true.
And so I just want to correct that right now because it's directly relevant to this topic
and say I want to try and speak to things as truthfully and clearly as possible
because a part of being able to help people be sane is to actually see reality
as it is with as little distortion as possible.
And so we want to be very acute to any source of or reason for subtle distortion,
cognitive bias, emotional bias that leads to cognitive bias, etc.
So as we're kicking off here, I was thinking when we first talked
and just because of the name of your podcast Project Sanity,
I don't know the etymology perfectly.
I believe the word sanity comes from Latin,
sanis, which roughly translates to health and wellness.
And so sanity means a healthy person and insanity means some unhealthy
and specifically mental unhealthy.
But I think it's also been used often in a normative way,
meaning insane means outside of social norms.
And so there are some dangerous ways people can use that,
if someone, you know, there's a totalitarian way,
which says even if someone is rational and clear and etc.,
but holds different enough values.
And we obviously saw during the Dark Ages and the Inquisitions and the Crusades
saying that people were insane or possessed because they held a different religious idea.
And so we want to be careful that the type of sanity that we're interested in
is really well-being of the individual,
meaning that they are capable of making sense of the world
and acting in ways that are healthy, adaptive, functional for them
and that are not unhealthy for the society as a whole unnecessarily.
So even the definition of this is a subtle thing.
But I remember a lot of respect for the teachings and writings of Krishnamurti
and he had this very famous saying that being well-adjusted to a profoundly insane society
is not a good measure of mental health.
And we think about our desire to be more popular or to make more money
or to do better in the corporation or to be more respected by more people.
And we're talking about, you know, how to be more well-adjusted to this society.
But then we see that it's a society that still thinks that war is a reasonable approach to conflict resolution.
And in plenty of cases where 20 years after the fact we see that the war had fiscal motives
that were not being represented at the time, where there were other alternatives,
where we really didn't think there were weapons of mass destruction, where etc.
And most of the people who were killed were civilians.
So we say, okay, is that sane at a social level?
We can see the massive species extinction, human-induced species extinction
and biodiversity loss and climate change, ocean acidification, etc.
that is literally leading towards our inability to keep doing the human experiment well here.
And so you can say, okay, there's some collective behavior that is actually collectively suicidal.
So that doesn't seem sane from a collective definition.
And then, you know, I think about the quote when Gandhi was asked, you know,
Mr. Gandhi, what do you think of Western civilization?
And he said, I think it would be a good idea.
And, you know, the joke is, can we call the thing that we're doing civil yet?
What does it mean to be civilized?
This is kind of related to what does it mean to be sane?
And, you know, when we think of the term humanity, are we actually being humane?
Well, if war is a reasonable solution to problems, it could have been solved through methods other than war.
That doesn't seem civilized, humane or sane.
And then if we have a society where we have homelessness, like rampant homelessness,
and we aren't even trying in earnest to fix it, right?
We have increasing wealth and equality.
And there are many countries that don't have that homelessness issue.
So we have models for how to solve it that are not even attempted in earnest.
Then again, we say, is it sane?
And now this is interesting, right?
Because we notice that psychopathy, right?
Being a psychopath or sociopathy are actually definitions of mental illness
in our current mental health care system.
Because we're not saying that, oh yeah, even if this person is rational
and can make, you know, cross the street well and make good choices regarding, you know, basic cause and effect for themselves,
and they just happen to like the pain of others, that that's just a particular predilection.
We're saying that's actually not mentally well, that humans are social primates
and that being mentally well means not just that they're capable of getting around and functioning,
but also functioning with other humans in a way that allows the other humans to function well.
That's meaningful, right?
So then we say, okay, well if psychopathy, sociopathy are mental illness,
then if we can continue to buy stuff that we know comes from sweatshops that are employing little kids
that's coming from factory farms that we know have unbelievable unnecessary torture happening,
just because it's more convenient, we don't want to think about it.
If we can walk over homeless people and not even try to do anything,
is that a kind of low grade psychopathy or low grade sociopathy?
Is it a down regulation of empathy to the point that our behavior is actually getting to continue directly
or indirectly through complicity being harmful to the world at large?
And as a result, harmful to us too.
And so I would argue that a sane society doesn't have homeless people
and it doesn't have people that can walk over homeless people,
that can see another human that is in very clear pain
and just keeping more focused on things in their own life that are radically less consequence
because they can just put the blinders on.
They say, well, okay, I care, but what the fuck do I do?
Because it's not one homeless person, it's a salesman, I can't help them all.
So we say, okay, there are conditions, there are societal conditions that are conditioning
that turning down of empathy actually being an adaptive response
because otherwise people would have no idea how to function at all
and so they have to turn down the empathy or they're just crushed.
So then we say, well, sometimes the mental illness is actually adaptive to a damaged world
and that's the only way to function the damaged world.
And it's like, is it a damaged world that is driving damaged people
or is it damaged people driving a damaged world?
Well, it's obviously a vicious cycle in the feedback process.
So we want to understand how that feedback works
and how to move it into a virtuous process
where we can have healthier people start emerging even in the world as it is
and then building a healthier world that conditions more people in healthy directions.
Okay, as we come back up to the top and just say ubiquitous psychopathology,
what do we mean?
We talked about kind of at the social level or at the civilization level,
environmental destruction and war and poverty and that kind of suicidal behavior.
When we think at a slightly smaller level where we're not looking at like driving existential risk
but driving really obviously unhealthy behavior at scale,
the Me Too movement that is having so much power right now
is starting to show people who didn't already intuit it how rampant abusive power is.
And we might have seen it first in D.C.
but then Silicon Valley Finance and New York Finance and then Hollywood
and then pretty much everywhere that power is concentrated, power is abused.
And so then we want to say, alright, is it just that men,
that's the nature of men and the Y chromosome to be violating in that way
and that's inexorable, it's a biological reality.
And I think we can argue very clearly no,
and there's a bunch of reasons in terms of other times in history
and other societies that really don't have evidence the same thing
and the fact that it is so much more concentrated where there are concentrations of power,
meaning that more than it being a Y chromosome phenomena,
it really has a lot to do with being a power phenomena
and that for someone to get to a high position in highly competitive cutthroat environments
like finance, like being a producer or director in Hollywood like government,
they had to win against other people at a lot of win-lose games,
which means they had to create a lot of losses,
which means they had to have the orientation towards power
and the desire towards it and the ability to turn off empathy
at where they created losses.
And so those environments are kind of incentivizing
and selecting for and conditioning abuse of power.
And so then this becomes a really core question for us about,
are the institutions, like macroeconomics writ large, governance writ large,
are the institutions themselves mental illness producing mechanisms?
Are they unwell themselves?
So we kind of see at the global civilization level,
the signs of mental unwellness, we see it at the social level
and Me Too is one example, but it's not just Me Too, right?
All the social justice movements we see everywhere
and then at the individual level and this is where I hope that it really hits home
for a lot of people, even closer to home is,
when we look at how many people in the developed modern world,
and I'm here in the United States in California,
so I'll speak to this experience in particular,
we look at how many people wrestle with non-trivial levels of anxiety
or depression, or existential angst,
or anhedonia, just kind of blankness, right?
Inability to feel much that's meaningful, pleasurable,
or addiction, how rampant addiction is, how rampant body image issues
and body dysmorphia are, issues with food, issues with loneliness.
That's pretty much everybody.
I mean, outside of people who live in some intentional eco villages
and some people who have done some really profound kinds of personal development,
everybody's on some gradient in there,
and I'm going to argue that that is actually not native to the human condition.
It's native to the human condition to be able to go into those states,
but not that it's a given that it's a baseline,
that that is actually the result of certain societal environmental dynamics
that are actually conditioning that in mass,
but that if we are to look at certain previous cultures,
even certain other cultures in the world today,
and certainly indigenous cultures,
that, okay, I'll do a fun for instance here
in terms of ubiquitous psychopathology and body image.
This is a, I mean, we could actually really take any of these.
Say we take loneliness.
If people get into Gabor Matej's work on that the primary cause
and his research of addiction is loneliness,
there's really good evidence supporting that as a,
at least a partial, very meaningful hypothesis,
and we look at how many people are lonely,
we look at how many old people are lonely enough that they are suicidal because of it,
and it's rampant, right?
Nobody who lived in a tribe was lonely.
I'm not trying to over romanticize tribe,
and I'm not trying to over be overly negative about things in modern civilization that are positive,
but these phenomena are the ones that we're wanting to address,
and we spent all of our evolutionary history
until not that long ago in tribal dynamics as that kind of primate,
and so now everybody living on their own
or with just a couple people, nuclear family style dwelling,
you have rampant loneliness,
and that's really, again, not native to the human condition,
which then drives rampant addiction as a way to try and fill the loneliness,
and you can see that with food, you can see it with social media,
you can see it with whatever, right?
So many things.
And so let's explore this one a little bit because it's quite interesting.
If we look at both the current, in addition to Me Too,
another one of the social phenomena of the moment that is really the world is paying attention to
is the problem of social media,
and Facebook, Google, other social media,
that they have all of their financial incentives to maximize the amount of time people spend on site.
So if people haven't seen Tristan Harris' TED Talk and other conversations on this,
he speaks to it very clearly.
He's a friend and educated me on the topic.
There are other people who are starting to really speak to this well,
and he was product philosopher at Google and left for these reasons,
but that if you, you know, if you're Facebook and you get paid by advertising,
the more time that people spend on site, the more impressions, the more you get paid.
So you've got, you know, multi-hundred billion dollar company
empowered by a lot of data scientists, psychologists, people doing analytics,
split testing, and AIs to maximize how much time you spend on site
getting the addictive mechanisms as addictive as possible
and getting the newsfeed algorithms as addictive as possible.
And yet we see the research coming out of Stanford in various places
that shows the more time people spend on Facebook, the more depressed they are.
And we see a recent study that just came out, I think a couple days ago,
on teen suicide going up in statistical correlation with their use of social media.
And so then we say, alright, so Facebook has two billion people on it, right?
Google of similar scale, these are, that's four times more people than were in the world
at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
So this is a civilization scale technology platform that is affecting people's consciousness,
their mind, their psyche, and, you know, AI empowered for a goal
that is seemingly antithetical to the wellness of those people.
So that is kind of asymmetric warfare, AI empowered asymmetric warfare
over the space of one's attention and mind.
So if what's best for people is to get the fuck off Facebook
and go spend time with real people, because, you know, they're actually lonely.
They go on Facebook to connect with people, but it's not actually a meaningful connection.
But you notice what they're doing, whether they watch TV or go to Facebook,
is they look at other human faces.
And yet it just like if they go to sugar when they're hungry,
they get a hit of something, but with no real nutrients,
which is why they're hungry again, and then they get fat.
You have this phenomena of hypernormal stimuli.
So hypernormal stimuli means some stimuli that hits way more neurotransmitter production
than most stimuli, right?
So in an, and I know I'm doing a lot here fast, so stop me if needed,
but I'm trying to tie a handful of ideas here together.
And then evolutionary environment, we didn't have much sugar.
We had a lot of vegetables.
Meat was pretty hard to come by.
We had to hunt. It was dangerous.
But the best that we had as far as sugar goes was not, you know,
was berries that there were not that many of, and they were nowhere near as sweet
as the modern hybridized berries, and they were only in season for a short bit,
you know, a few other fruits, but they were calorically dense enough
that there was this massive evolutionary benefit to take as many of them as you could,
store a little bit of fat and be able to make it through famines.
And so we would get this big dopamine hit when we would get sugar.
But that was no big deal because we couldn't get sugar often enough
that having that padding was actually useful and then you'd burn it off.
Now that we have a world where we can produce infinite amounts of sugar,
you know, functionally, then if now rather than starvation being a relevant thing,
we're piling on some fat as useful and then we'll burn it off.
We have a Western world that is dying largely of obesity.
But we still, we get such a big dopamine hit from the sugar that it's hard not to keep doing it, right?
It's a hypernormal stimuli.
We get more hit from that than we do from the salad or anything else.
But then we also start getting a progressively less and less healthy body
and then needing that hit more and more to feel good
because our baseline is feeling shittier and shittier.
So then we say, well, when someone's lonely,
they are more susceptible to go to the fridge and find something good to eat
than when they're engaged in, you know, with a bunch of other people
or doing some creative project and they aren't even, they forget to eat
because they're so engaged.
So now what we're saying is in an environment of hypo normal,
hypo meaning not enough stimuli,
meaning that the person doesn't feel a meaningful sense of engagement
and of purpose, of creativity, of connection,
then they're trying to find, then there's an emptiness
and they're trying to find something to be able to fill that emptiness.
And so people are susceptible, they're more susceptible to hypernormal stimuli
when they have a hypo normal environment.
And so most people's lives has an insufficient amount of human connection.
The human connection they have isn't intimate enough to actually feel like real human connection,
meaning that they're putting on a mask of what they think people will like.
So then even when people like them, they don't feel really liked
because if the other person really knew, then maybe they wouldn't like them, et cetera, et cetera.
So, and someone doesn't feel connected to their own creativity well,
their own purpose so, and they're not spending time in nature,
they're not moving their body enough.
So all the things that make up a normal in an evolutionary environment,
a healthy human life are absent or deficient,
hyponormal, leading to susceptibility for fuck,
what's anything that will make me feel better, hypernormal.
And this is where sugar comes in, this would be where drugs come in,
this would be where gambling, this would be where action, flicks and video games would come in,
and it would be where porn would come in, the hypernormal stimuli, right?
It's the 1% of sexiest people in the prime of their life
and then with plastic surgery and extra makeup and scenarios that normally never happen, right?
Which then, of course, desensitizes people to normal stimuli.
And that's the problem is you have hyponormal, creating susceptibility to hypernormal,
then making people desensitized to even normal stimuli.
So that's the addiction cycle.
And this is where the Facebook thing comes in.
So then we start seeing how rampant that phenomena is and starting to see,
all right, well, if Google also wants people to spend time on Google
and wants to give them the results that will have them keep using Google,
and the same would be true for all the social media.
And these are the largest companies in the world with the best data analytics and the best intelligence
and their incentive is fundamentally different than the well-being of the humans using it.
How do we deal with that, right?
And it's very much like the incentive of healthcare companies not being perfectly aligned
with the well-being of the patients, creating all kinds of problems.
Of course, if we just prevent illness, that obsolete a lot of drug sales.
And if we cure illness very quickly, that used to be something that we had just symptom managed forever.
We also obsolete a lifetime of sales.
Can we make enough money in that quick treatment to be able to pay off the R&D that it took to make the drug?
So if the incentive is to make symptom management things,
that financial system is fundamentally misaligned with human well-being.
The same is true with the for-profit military industrial complex that would go bankrupt if we didn't have war.
So this is where we start looking at the macroeconomic tie-in and the issue of perverse incentive.
But then, and you know, food industry, right?
If you think about it this way, addiction is profitable.
If I can sell you something and you like it, but you don't need it, you can try lots of things.
I don't maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer in the same way as if I sell you something you become addicted to.
And so the natural impetus of business is to vector in that direction.
And the businesses that do vector in that direction do better than the other ones and compete for market share.
The net result of that across the whole ecosystem of those types of dynamics,
and you start to see a world where the fact that depression is kind of ubiquitous
and loneliness and addiction are ubiquitous is not that confusing, right?
There's a lot more to say, but is this a spot for a question?
No, it's really, really great.
Daniel, thank you a lot.
We're just going to have a quick break.
Daniel, we'll be back in a moment with Daniel to carry on this train of thought.
Thank you so much.

The major difference between a resource-based economy and a monetary system
is that a resource-based economy is really concerned with people and their well-being.
Where a monetary system has become so distorted
that the concerns of the people are really stuck in there, if they're there at all.
The products that are turned out are for how much money you can get.
If there is a problem in society and you can't earn money from solving that problem,
then it won't be done.
A resource-based economy is really not close to anything that's been tried.
And with all our technology today, we can create abundance.
It could be used to improve everyone's lifestyle.
Abundance all over the world if we use our technology wisely and maintain the environment.
