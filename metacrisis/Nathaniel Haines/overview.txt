1. **Prior Selection**: The choice between informative and diffuse priors depends on the context and available knowledge. Informative priors are based on previous research or theory and can be more appropriate when there is substantial information about the parameters, while diffuse priors (or non-informative priors) are used when little is known.

2. **Prior Sensitivity Analysis**: It's important to conduct prior sensitivity analysis to ensure that conclusions are robust to different choices of priors. This can be done by comparing results using different priors or by providing software that allows users to input their own priors and see the resulting posteriors.

3. **Informed Priors in Practice**: In cognitive science, informed priors can be particularly useful when fitting models to data where there is prior knowledge about certain parameters, such as in evidence accumulation models or models of decision-making.

4. **Hierarchical Bayesian Models**: These models allow for the integration of group-level knowledge into the analysis of individual data. This can be particularly useful when the sample size for individuals is small, and there is a need to incorporate broader empirical findings into the analysis.

5. **Model Checking and Iteration**: The process of model fitting involves iteratively refining the model, checking its assumptions, and ensuring that it accurately represents the data. This includes simulating the model based on the priors to ensure that the model behaves as expected and recovering the parameters used in the simulation.

6. **Software for Model Evaluation**: Providing software that allows researchers to input their own models, priors, and data can be beneficial for transparency and reproducibility. It also enables users to explore how different assumptions affect their results, which is crucial for robust scientific inference.

In summary, the use of informative priors should be justified by the existing knowledge or theory, and researchers should always consider the implications of their priors on the model's outcomes. Conducting prior sensitivity analysis and providing tools for users to explore different priors can enhance the credibility and usefulness of Bayesian models in research.
