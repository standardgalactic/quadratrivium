 The Developmental Biology Film Series was preserved with the support of various entities, including distinguished individuals like Lynn Margolis, filmmakers Terrence Malick and the producers at Hummingbird Films, publishing companies such as Chelsea Green Publishing and GeoBook Studio, organizations like The International Symbiosis Society and The Hardy Lane Foundation, and contributors to the Lynn Margolis Archive at ScholarWorks. These contributions have ensured the availability of important educational content in the field of developmental biology.

Labyrinthula is a marine microorganism that exhibits a primitive form of colonial organization. It is commonly found associated with various seaweeds or marine grasses, such as eelgrass, zoster, or marina. The organism's individual cells are capable of gliding motility within a continuous filamentous network that they produce themselves. This network is laid down ahead of the cells as thin filaments that coalesce into larger strands.

The movement of Labyrinthula cells is a key characteristic of this species:

- The cells move only within the extracellular network, and their motion is not understood to involve specialized structures like cilia, flagella, or pseudopodia.
- Their speed can vary significantly across different isolates, ranging from a few to hundreds of microns per minute.
- The movement is often in pulses, with all cells in an area moving simultaneously in the same direction, although there is no inherent polarity to individual cells. They can turn over or reverse direction during motion.
- The network within which they move appears to be semi-elastic and does not seem to incorporate new material as the cells pass through it.
- Electron microscopy reveals that the cells are completely surrounded by the extracellular matrix in both longitudinal and transverse sections.
- Nuclear and cell divisions are frequent, with cells often seen dividing, and the central nucleus of each cell is surrounded by numerous cytoplasmic granules, mitochondria, and lipid droplets.
- In the older parts of the colony, cells tend to aggregate, forming poorly defined aggregates or cysts that can later reactivate when placed onto fresh nutrient medium.
- The movement of Labyrinthula cells within an expanding colony is along a preformed extracellular network, and this movement is influenced by the presence of a food source. When food such as yeast cells is detected, the labyrinthula cells will stream toward it.

The colonial behavior of Labyrinthula, which includes cell motility within an extracellular network, directional movement towards a food source, and rudimentary aggregation, represents a simple form of colonial organization in developmental biology. This organism provides insight into the fundamental mechanisms that underpin more complex colonial or multicellular systems.
