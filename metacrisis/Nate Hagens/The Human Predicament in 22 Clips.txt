Another year, another 50 podcasts. Those who follow the great simplification know
this is not a single-issue destination and my staff, Meredith especially, also
Lizzie and Leslie have put together an end-of-year clip reel that shows a
minute or so of many different podcasts, how endocrine disrupting chemicals and
climate change and oil depletion and left brain versus right brain and oxytocin
and debt and currencies and complexity and how all of it comprises what we now
face that I refer to as the human predicament. Much more content ahead in
2024. I hope this brief clip reel gives a sense at the enormity of the challenges
that we face and how everything ultimately is connected. Happy New Year everyone.
People don't realize that toxicity is, I believe, moving faster than climate change
and will be more deadly. What we have done is we have created a world which is
hostile to life in almost every form, including our own. The 60% drop in the
sperm count in the developed world and you can say and China and what that means
is it's real trouble. Now we were over-engineered, I like to say like a
Victorian bridge, so dropping to almost 50%, 40-50% didn't matter, but beyond that
it suddenly started to matter a lot and we have gone from a rounding era of young
couples having trouble getting pregnant to about 15% and the international
health guys come out the other day and say it's one in seven which is exactly
what we agree with. What they didn't have the nerve to say was that 30 years
earlier it was pretty well zero, that it had gone from nobody having trouble to
one in seven having trouble and it's accelerating at 2% a year which means
come back in 20 years and there will be hell to pay for ordinary people around
the world having children and this is all because of the stuff that was covered
in Shana Swan episode 2 I think that there's so many endocrine disruptors. I
believe the data suggests that pesticides on fruit and vegetables are the
main culprit. Pesticides on fruit and vegetables eaten by pregnant women are
probably half of all the damage done by chemicals to humans and it is an
enormous amount. The data is there, it's very high quality data, it's peer reviewed,
it's done over and over again. My conclusion is if we do not end up banning
most chemicals including plastics we will go out of business. The earth is where
you go back to. We all come from the earth and we all go back there and there's
a lot of understandings that still exist today about how we treat our
grandmother and when we talk about the Black Hills we had a lot of elders who
stood up and they protested when that court decision came down. They were
upset and they would put up signs. This is when I was a little girl they would
have their protest signs would say never sell your grandmother. Never sell your
grandmother. The land is sacred. The sacred is not for sale. A recent study
came out in 2020 where they assembled all the long term decades long insect
data sets in the world. So this is across all continents, across all types of
insects and guess what they found? Insects on land declining by 2% per year.
So what we've learned for butterflies have lined up exactly with what we're
now seeing for other insects. I mean you brought up a study that was in Germany
this set up off the alarms about the insect apocalypse and it was about a
different measure not the number of individuals but the biomass of insects
and they found an even more shocking decline. So they measured this is in
forest in Germany the biomass of all insects combined in the 1970s then
measured it again in the 2000s and they found a 75% decline in insect
biomass. I mean this is I mean it's just mind-boggling and frightening that
insects can be declining this quickly. The planet has become populated by
now 8 billion humans and all other species are reduced. That influences the
genetic endowment of the planet in profound ways. So and that has obviously
evolutionary implications and so I actually think that the economic super
organism the development of this system is a major evolutionary transition for
humans. It's another step in the evolution of our sociality. We then
measure our success based on GDP and GDP is the price times quantity of final
goods and services but when there was a small decrease in oil supply you know
in the 70s this happened and with the Ukraine war we saw prices skyrocket
small decrease in food prices leads prices to skyrocket meaning for
essential resources the less we produce the more they contribute to GDP which is
about as perverse a measure of welfare as you could possibly have. Oxytocin
promotes pro-sociality with people who you consider to be an us people like me
and your pet dog who you spend more on for food each year than your Sudanese
gets in a decade counts as an us what does oxytocin do when you're
encountering them's it makes you crappier to them it makes you more
preemptively aggressive it makes you less trustworthy oxytocin doesn't make
you nice it makes you nice to people who already count as a you and it makes
you awful to them's it just takes this us of them like fracture line we have in
our heads and it just pushes it apart further and amazing studies showing you
give people oxytocin and they become more cooperative to their team members
and they become awful to the people on the other team it is not this groovy
hormone it is this hormone that makes parochial you know provinciality more
dramatic and that's not often a good thing. The huge impact on fertility on
heart disease cancer all of these things are caused through some of the chemicals
that we use within plastic and a lot of those chemicals you know already are
called endocrine disrupting chemicals our endocrine system is vital to how our
entire body operates and when we disrupt it we disrupt many many health systems
and we are doing this now knowingly and this is the problem so one of the when
we look at a plastic planet and we look what are the levers of change what are
those tipping points where we can actually persuade industry that this is not a nice
two because of the bit of pollution or a turtle with a straw up its nose but this
is an imperative. If people don't understand how much better at chess the best AI systems are than
the human systems go study that for a minute and get a sense look at how the AI that beat
Casparov at chess IBM system then evolved into stock fish is the best system that had been
programmed with every human game that was so much better than humans it wasn't even calibratable
and then how a totally new approach to AI that google innovated the kind of alpha go system was
able to beat that system rough there were some ties but roughly 38 zero without having programmed
any human games just letting two of them play themselves a trillion times in three hours and
get so fucking good based on no human system just the rules themselves that they could beat the
previous god as if it was nothing and it took three hours of training and you're like whoa
we aren't even in the running of relevant we don't even have a reference for how not relevant
we are at being able to do anything with that narrow goal right now it happens that that narrow
system that was able to train that way and beat us on chess also was on go also did on starcraft
also like you just line them up and you're like oh whoa okay so this is a sense of the power of
artificial intelligence i think a lot of people are looking for some place to put their energy
and i'm afraid that too many people are are putting all of their hopes in some system change
some like of the government's going to change if i if i vote the right person in things will get better
or if i buy certain things things will get better but i'm like it is is even
even activist traditional activism in this culture revolves around fighting things that you don't
want and i i think i wanted to flip that on its head and what what can we put our energy our human
energy our our our life livelihoods towards to because we want to see more of it and i want to
see more food growing in a local and ecologically sustainable resilient way and i want to see more
community and i want to see more sovereignty and so that's what i'm doing because what else am i
going to do i'm like i i don't i can't sit and wait for somebody else to do that and to be honest
i was filled with existential angst for a long time because knowing all of these things that you
that you and i talk about a lot it's hard not to be filled with some kind of existential dread but
when you're actually doing something or doing as much as you can towards changing that even if
it's one little corner of the world i sleep soundly at night because i'm like i'm doing everything i
can what's different different this time is that we don't have any skills we are like we are so
helpless and we have the state especially maybe in sweden we have this totally total trust in the
state to deliver what we need and in in the transition movement we are talking about reskilling
and food production is a huge part of that but it's not the only part and you mentioned
nate that i came back actually yesterday from kenya and i had so many conversations with all
kinds of people like you know guards and taxi drivers and whatnot and they were all i mean
everybody i spoke to knew how to grow their own food because they did that when they were children
and that's kind of three four generations for many of us and i think this climate framing
has actually it sort of puts us also into helplessness because we are talking about it as a huge
global thing and then what can i do i'm very small it must be the state or the market that
that delivers on this huge crisis the british government france both have pretty strong no first
use policies india pakistan their doctrines are a little fuzzier but still basically no we're
we're not going to use these ultimate weapons unless somebody uses them against us first to us
is amazingly the strong exception to that we actually we say we'll use nuclear weapons for in
response to all kinds of things we'll we say we'll use them against non nuclear powers we say that
we will use them in response at one time during the trump administration we even had a written
policy we would use them against cyber attacks on infrastructure we would reserve the right to
use a nuke against whoever used it that biden's backed off on that a little bit but still the
list of reasons we would use a nuclear weapon first is long and actually pretty distressing
my most likely explanation is that we've over drilled it that we have drilled our wells too
close together and so what's happening is is that the wells are cannibalizing one another's
production that they have a there's a radius away from each individual well to which or through
which oil will naturally flow to the lower potential energy in the wellbore and if you drill
another well within that drainage radius of that of the first well both wells are going to go on
producing but they're going to be they're going to be cannibalizing each other's supply and so both
wells will end up producing less in their lifetime if the young people realize my god i'm in the
health care system by taking care of the soil you know it's not just restoration but it's regeneration
of society and the earth at the same time because we will not be able to achieve any of this separately
we're getting close to 19 percent of the gdp committed to health care it's about twice the
average of the rest of the ocd nations so we're definitely an outlier we spend about 12900
dollars per capita per year i think the second one is germany at about 7300 so we're there's a
huge gap there and you know the troubling aspect of this is not just the amount of money but
is our health outcomes you know we have the highest infant mortality rate among those nations and
we're about three years lower than the average life expectancy for the ocd nation so we're spending
a lot of money we're not getting the population health outcomes in return i think we all have this
belief that the age the ocean will save our collective bacon in some way um yes there are
changes coming but we have the sense that for sea level change everyone i think recognizes
this would be a bad thing but look we have these estimates where a meter in maybe 70 years well
that doesn't sound so bad that's just an idiot a little bit per year but what the ocean does
that i think people don't appreciate it undergoes enormous state changes in ways that are very
non-intuitive now perhaps the most common one that we might think about are la niña and el nino
these big current changes that affect global climate they happen relatively quickly within
a year or less we've changed the state from one to another and it doesn't happen over centuries
it's a very quick change this is the greatest danger facing us the ocean is going to go it's
going to undergo a state change from what we are now seeing as the the state change that we are used
to in a very cold climate we have ice sheets we have lots of ice in the water to a change where
they're gone and they go relatively rapidly to an entirely different type of ocean a stratified
ocean where we don't have oxygen everywhere where we only have oxygen in the very top surface area
look at the black sea there is not a great fishery there isn't a lot of food coming out of the bottom
of the black sea it is undergone a state change to a stratified system that cannot as my colleague
said it's hard to breathe underwater it's even harder to breathe underwater when your oxygen
is completely gone there are chemical addictions there are behavioral addictions you know there we
have both so anything that stimulates the nucleus accumbens anything that stimulates the reward center
in the extreme is addictive so we have chemical it's like heroin cocaine nicotine alcohol sugar
we also have behaviors we have shopping gambling internet gaming social media pornography
all of these stimulate the same reward center in the brain every one of those has an aholic
neck you know after it shopaholics chocoholic sexaholic alcoholic you pick it the point is
we have a reward system and it is under fire every day the geology of us shale as biggest
marginal oil producer over the last 10 years by far simply is not conducive to treasury bonds
maintaining their purchasing power in terms of the marginal oil barrel so i'm never going to
my treasuries you're never going to buy more oil on average than they do right now
they're not going to be able to rise in value relative to oil on average in the future so why
store them in treasuries you know what i'll do instead i'll take the dollars and instead of
buying treasuries i'm going to cut the middleman out i'm going to cut the americans out i'm going to
go straight to katar and i'm going to say sign me a 27 year deal on gas i will i will commit to
buying gas at this price for the next 27 years i will take these volumes take or pay here's the
dollars boom the second principle that i think is utterly essential to understand here is the
concept of self-organization that living systems self-organize and self-produce because they can
they're they're in an environment which is filled with gradients of energy and material
and that enables them to emerge in a self-organizing way to take advantage of the energy that is to say
the capacity to do things that is in those environments if you are embedded in a worldview
that sees growth as the goal really deeply ask yourself a question that and move to okay my
biggest piece of advice is to tap into what we deeply know in our own bodies right in our own
bodies we know that health doesn't lie in growth i mean when kids are small yeah that's a great
sign of health and then there comes a point where you don't want them to grow anymore it comes to
thriving and health lies in balance in our bodies we really get that i need enough food and not too
much i need enough temperature and warmth and not too much i need enough water oxygen stress on my body
to enough and not too much salt whatever you want to add that my bodily health lies in balance and
if something inside my body tries to grow unstoppably we call that cancer and we move in and
we stop it as soon as we can we deeply understand that and each one of our own bodies is a complex
adaptive system so each one of us is a miniature living ecosystem planetary experiment individualism
encourages us to think that the properties of an individual are just the properties of an
individual if you're a good egg layer it's because you're a good individual egg layer
or if you're a top performer in a company it's just because you're an amazing individual
as it turns out in the experiment the best egg layer within each group was the biggest bully
within each group it was social but it was and so by breeding the biggest bullies then in five
generations you had a nation of psychopaths and they were killing each other and plucking each other's
feathers there was a nightmare so there was still a good egg layer but the other chickens
didn't produce much at all because they were all packed and and subordinated now there probably
was variation in just your ability as an egg layer but it was completely overwhelmed by this social
social factor and the second experiment because selecting the groups that did along and
and that's also heritable and so in five generations you selected for you had 160
percent increase in egg productivity I just think that that business of the ever-evolving
deeper relationship a loving relationship with the world in all its manifestations
is is the secret of human well-being and happiness and you say that there is now a
different religion that of economic growth and so on and I you know I have quenched myself in the
last 24 hours a bit with with what you've you've said about this I found it very compelling
I'm sure you're you're broadly right and it reminds me of something that G.K. Chesterton said
that when people stop believing in God they don't believe in nothing they believe in anything
and that anything for them is their own power to become more and more rich powerful wealthy
and that leaves out of the count just about everything that sustains human happiness and
in the seeking for it they will never find happiness as a psychiatrist I can tell you
that the most successful people the richest people the most powerful people are not the world's
happiest people use your intellect and your ethical compass today to trump your future
emotional mind what things in your region your community your own life your own principles
your own rules of living might become for sale in coming decades similarly which things for you
as a personal live during these amazing and perilous times are a red line and you decide
are not for sale and never will be for sale
I think about that and I hope that myself in the future the future Nate is someone that I would
be proud to know and the decisions that I make in five years or 10 years from now
as things economically become more widely coyote and the leisure disappears will our virtue
disappear with it I hope not and that's a reason I'm doing this work
