Greetings, I'm off to the airport but wanted to reflect on something that's been in my
mind for a bit and was accentuated with a news announcement in the last week.
Last summer I was biking and hiking in northern Wisconsin and I saw these signs that had a
beautiful blue silhouette of Lake Superior and then some words that said not for sale
and I thought they were like some real estate agent that was doing the don't think of an
elephant like these this house is not for sale meaning that it is but I saw hundreds of them
in biking around so I got back to my Airbnb and I looked it up and what this is about
is local people around the shores of Lake Superior are becoming active to avert and avoid
people in the southwest building pipelines to transport the water from Lake Superior to areas
that need water not for sale and they're drawing a line in the sand.
For many of you that live in Minnesota especially you might have seen last week the
Biden administration announced a 20-year moratorium on the metals and mining in the boundary
waters canoe area there is copper and nickel there and there's been this long fight between
environmentalists and people in industry to avoid the environmental pollution from drilling in the
Quartico and boundary waters area you know this all brings up this issue of what is for sale
in our culture last week I talked about two scenarios where if we continue to grow if we are
able to generate productivity from a combination of technology and available resources that will
gradually head towards a mordor economy under that scenario if it happens we will be resource
and sink and beauty constrained under the other scenario which is a lower EROI
great simplification where we can no longer increase productivity in order to maintain our
existing financial claims we're going to be affordability constrained and in either of these
scenarios there becomes the issue of what will be for sale during those times in the natural world
in our own lives what will we take for granted today that will become for sale tomorrow
so humans are an odd species in that we think that everything belongs to us perhaps all species
think that we can't know but it never becomes a problem because what happens in the world of moths
stays in the world of moths the problem with humans is that in partnering with fire
the last 200 years we now neither own things abstractly nor temporarily and we can actually
find reasons to permanently use things up and rationales on ways to do it so what are we selling
now and don't even realize it i think just in our normal everyday lives and economic systems
we are selling the oceans we've traded or sold coral reefs and most large species in the seas
for a co2 buffer 90 plus of the extra heat added from fossil fuels has gone into the ocean so it's
greatly slowed the warming and the events we experience on land you know if we could buy
another generation for living the high life and global commerce who cares if the seas get
more carbonated but in very real ways we're influencing dolphins whales seals swordfish tuna
and the roughly 25 of sea species that spend time in coral reefs and the ones that cannot exist
without calcium carbonate skeletons so we're selling that without even reasoning or being aware
of it what else are we selling we're selling our time given the benefits from fossil hydrocarbon
to our society the global north should really be working 10 to 15 hour work weeks if that
but it isn't about work the fossil armies are doing that will work for us so these jobs have
become this unequal distribution of the monetization of earth and jobs provide that rationale while
keeping us too busy and tired to consider what we've done so there's lots of aspects of our society
where we're already selling things that that we don't realize so my friend west jackson
I think that the quote he used was that leisure is a great enabler of morality or virtue and we are
so rich as a global culture especially the global north that we take for granted the beauty the
ecosystems and even our ethic we say that we do these things but we don't really see the
externalities of our actions so in thinking about lake superior in thinking about the metals
and mining that will be required as humanity tries to double our footprint again in the next
30 years when we monetize everything we wind up selling everything
so the core messages from my perspective is we've monetized a world that doesn't belong to us
we belong to it so in the financialization of the human experience we have arrived at this
uh precipice of uh biophysical accounting and like some real personal conversations
so this is just a short reflection and if we can envision that things are going to get tougher
and tighter and more economically constrained in the future maybe listening to this and being
aware of the issues on on the podcast and in the poly crisis space use your intellect and your
ethical compass today to trump your future emotional mind what things in your region
your community your own life your own principles your own rules of living might become for sale
in coming decades similarly which things for you as a personal live during these amazing and
perilous times are a red line and you decide are not for sale and never will be for sale
um I think about that and I hope that myself in the future the future Nate is someone that I would
be proud to know and the decisions that I make in five years or 10 years from now
as things economically become more uh wily coyote and the leisure disappears will our virtue
disappear with it um I hope not and that's a reason I'm doing this work uh more in two weeks
I'm I'm traveling starting uh two hours from now thank you all talk soon
