This week I am joined by Environmental Peacemaker and Mediation Practitioner
Olivia Lazard to discuss how geopolitics, mineral and energy scarcity and climate change are interacting to have a big
battle economically, socially,
justice-wise between the Global North and the Global South on
potential future pathways.
Olivia has worked in the peacemaking sector at both field and policy levels at Carnegie Europe.
She's also worked for various NGOs, the UN, the EU and donor states in the Middle East, Latin America,
Sub-Saharan and North Africa.
This conversation
covers a wide variety of topics and much like Olivia's research is jam-packed with information.
Personally, I think we're going to need a lot more people like Olivia
who are mediators and peacemakers to navigate the speed bump filled roads ahead.
Please welcome Olivia Lazard.
Olivia Lazard
Lots to discuss, Olivia.
We will eventually get to climate and COP and geopolitics and energy transition, which is how I found out about your work.
But your training is in peacemaking and
mediation. So how did you get into your current work?
And how do these two fields, peacemaking, mediation and geopolitics, climate energy, interrelate?
I had a hunch that
globalization was molding conflict systems in certain ways regardless of context, regardless of geographies and history.
Because we were seeing an acceleration essentially of commodity trading, of goods and services and
extraction quite simply.
And
I was lucky that very quickly in my career, even though I started off working on peace process support in
Israel and Palestine,
for linguistic reasons mostly I was brought to work in the Middle East and then in Africa, in
Anglophone and Francophone Africa, and I worked for a long time in
the Congo Basin,
in the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Zadrafic in Republic, in Gabon,
and in certain parts of the Sahel and stuff like this. And whilst at the beginning of my career
I was specialized in the political economy of conflicts over time,
because I was seeing essentially that nature was becoming more and more parts of conflict economies, of illicit financial flows,
I started working on the political ecology of conflict.
How do people organize themselves, their societies, their livelihoods, their sustenance around certain types of environment,
certain types of natural resources,
how certain types of elites as well, which are a lot more connected to globalization through public or private institutions,
managed to tap into high commodity trading
based on natural extraction, whether it be for timber, for animal and vegetable biodiversity, minerals, fossils, etc, etc.
And the trend accelerated quite drastically
in the last 15 years or so. And I particularly remember one moment when I was in
North Kivu, which is a volcanic area of the world, beautiful, incredibly fertile.
And I was talking with conflict-affected people and
the communities I was talking to were telling me about all the ways in which they were affected by armed group activities,
but they were also telling me, oh, and by the way, climate change is hitting us really hard.
It was like, what do you mean? Well, you know,
the rains are not falling quite the same way and, you know, our crops are sort of late or early and then
they're reducing in sort of quantity and in quality, etc, etc.
And then I looked around and I was like, but where are the trees?
And we were talking, like we're talking about an area which is normally covered with a lot of biomass, particularly close to the Runga Park,
which is a very bite-of-ass area.
And entire slopes and hills had disappeared in terms of the biomass and, you know, I looked at them and I was like,
what happened to the trees? And they were like, well,
the FDLR, these other armed groups, you know, like timber is an important part of the country's economy.
And then they were experiencing essentially
ecological destruction, which was magnified by the global rise in temperature.
And, you know, one thing led to another. I started working on regenerative practices, regenerative agriculture, trying to convince essentially the U.N.
machine or, well, you know, peacekeeping missions or missions,
U.N. agencies within the field to try and move towards regenerative peacebuilding,
trying to really sort of look at how to strengthen ecosystems
and look at the way in which country stakeholders were
interacting with each other and with nature
to try and see how we could support different types of peace processes and different types of political economies.
And I remember, you know, as another anecdote,
because this is what led me to work on all of this,
regeneration was a starting point and then I would eventually led me to work on industrialization, which is the biggest irony of all times.
I remember in 2018, when I was in the Central African Republic,
we saw the Wagner troops arrive,
Wagner being a mercenary company, which is
the right arm of the Kremlin, and we've heard a lot about it recently in the Ukraine war.
And we saw them arrive in Bongi and then they just disappeared and scattered across the country. And then a few months later, we realized, oh, you know, they're
they're located in all the places where you find gold and diamond, but not just that,
not just that, also where earths and copper and cobalt and lithium,
all of the different materials that we need in order to decarbonize
as part of this massive energy transition that we're facing. And back in 2018, I thought that this was quite significant, but I didn't
I didn't understand the full extent of it.
And I don't think that I
really understood it until two years later. So when I really started looking into
this overlap
that I mentioned in my TED talk between a number of critical mineral deposits
and their overlap with conflicts affected in fragile contexts.
And then, you know, the other overlap, which is about
the fact that the country is concerned for the most part also hosts critical ecosystems necessary to regulate the global climate regime.
And that these very countries are also the ones that are most climate vulnerable. So it's quite a
an explosive set of issues that
since I live in Brussels,
or I'm based in Brussels, let's put it this way.
When we were talking in the Brussels bubble about the energy transition, I had never heard
of the ecological blind spots related to the energy transition. And I certainly had never really heard of
the links with conflict and fragile zones. And yet it is fully present. So I started to sort of
unearth that narrative and that sort of evidence and
and work on all of this. And now I work on decarbonization, regeneration and industrial policy, as I said, which is just interesting and
sometimes any unique mix.
Wow. So I have several follow-up questions to that.
First of all, you said for linguistic reasons you worked in central Africa. What did you mean by that?
Just that at the time, at least there were a few people who could speak fluently French and English.
So
it was easy for me to sort of travel around different parts of central Africa and then to work with englophone counterparts.
And you speak more languages than that too, right?
Yes, they're a bit rusty now, but I've studied in total about
four additional languages, Spanish, Italian,
Arabic, and Hebrew, and a little bit of Kiswahidi, but that's very far and very deep and buried deep.
Jambo. Jambo.
Ah, Habari. Buona. Yeah, I've been to Africa many times, but for vacations, not for the important work that you're doing.
So what is regenerative peace building, Olivia?
I've never heard those words combined.
So
there is a simple
mantra in
mediation when you look at conflict.
Simple on paper, not in practice.
It goes wherever you can,
expand the pie rather than divide it.
It makes sense, right? When you have conflict stakeholders that fight over
resources,
whatever they are, either political or natural or economic,
the more you create sort of common stakes between the conflict stakeholders
to try and cooperate so as to create and expand the pie, the more interest they have into channeling their differences into cooperative or
sort of collective mechanisms.
And
when I discovered what regenerative practices could do, meaning at the very least that they could actually bring back certain key natural resources, including water,
originally I thought that it would be, you know, super useful for food security,
but beyond that I realized that it had a very powerful message for the future of conflict resolution in a climate disrupted and ecologically disrupted world,
which was that specifically in arid and semi arid zones, more so than, you know, the Congo basin, which has a different
sort of geography and therefore sort of
ecological makeup that we need to take into account, and I can come to this in a minute, but for
semi arid and arid zones, we could essentially sort of use techniques that helped over time
to create
to reinforce, to strengthen natural systems through human cooperation, and through essentially sort of, you know, putting together different purses design, different dialogue sequencing,
and by bringing together a number of different either communities that are affected by conflict, but also, you know, governments and armed groups,
or non-state violent armed actors, you know, like to cooperate
over trying to stabilize essentially at the very least the ecological integrity of the ecosystems that they all depend upon.
Obviously, you know, like there is
the theory, but then there is the practice, trying to get one people to understand what regenerative
practices are in in their technique, in their practice is
one key challenge, because technically in
in mediation, you're not, especially if you're, you know, the mediator as a neutral party, you're not supposed to impose any type of agenda,
but you can suggest certain types of techniques that may help over time to stabilize conflict dynamics and therefore go
towards addressing what we call conflict drivers, which are the fundamental drivers of violence.
Um,
yep, I can hear that you have a question
I have six, uh, but the first one that comes to mind
is, you know, we're going to get to talking about decarbonization and rematerialization and climate and cop and other things, but
quite simply, doesn't the world
writ large need a lot more mediators at every level? I mean, we are so lacking in that skill, aren't we?
We are, um
But here is the catch and that's an interesting one
Technically, if you look at the type of conflict resolution that
sort of framework that I was active into, it is the product of a certain era. It's the product of
one, you know, the aftermath of the Second World War and even more so the aftermath of the Cold War
with also this notion that the more you did economic interdependency linkage
the more you could, you know, sort of create peace. It's this notion of liberal peace, actually
um
and mediators
as part of the un system or
the osc or even the european union the african union have inherited that sort of
ideological
dna to a certain extent
with exceptions, but it's been a bit of the sort of running framework
that must be
questioned. Um
It must be investigated as to whether or not the framework still stands. Um
mediators essentially that were trying to negotiate different types of peace which were essentially trying to negotiate political and economic
equilibriums
that had a tendency actually to
inscribe further natural extraction within peace processes or peace agreements
um that had a tendency to essentially rely on certain types of development pathways that would serve as backups
essentially for the political processes behind mediation
All of this needs to be reviewed. I think that there is a lot of room for reinvention
not on the principles of mediation right because mediation is a is a practice that is established within
non-violence and you know if you read for example the works of um galtung or
other scholars who have tried to sort of you know direct humanity towards what we call positive peace rather than negative peace
Negative peace is essentially the absence of war or conflict
Positive peace is what you create over time by essentially sort of like creating societies that
benefit from exchanging with one another from co-creating
um and co-imagining the future
And that is something that involves education, culture, arts, literature, etc etc
But we have a lot of things to reinvent also in our relationship to
One another in terms of societies communities etc etc, but also as humanity towards nature and nature was never actually really included
within that notion of peace right so
We do need a lot more mediators. We also need a reinvention of what mediation is supposed to do
Well more what I was getting at is on top of our
big biophysical environmental challenges. We have polarization and AI and
GPT chats and things that are just splintering
What normally people would agree on and I almost think like teaching
Mediation and conflict resolution or
Co-creation of positive peace as teenagers as a thing
Would be like a really helpful thing for humanity. That's where I was going with that question
yeah
Were you always like an expert in this like as a child
Or did you like go to university and say oh, I care about this. I want to learn how to be a mediator
um
Well, I suppose that we are all
somewhat influenced by our personal sort of backgrounds and and family frameworks, right and um
I my family was very impacted by different wars
starting with the second world war and then going on to the Algerian
war
of independence
So my father grew up in Algeria
And I've seen the way in which conflict can impact people in very diverse ways and in very
Deep ways that inform their political view that sort of you know frame their psychology
their understanding of the world
Their emotional resilience as well and I was I suppose lucky
to have on the one hand
maternal grandmother who had enrolled in the resistance and who was the epitome of
life and bravery and
Purpose for me
And my paternal paternal grandfather who went to a concentration camp during the second world war and who came out of it profoundly
traumatized and
Who had a difficult relationship with humanity?
um in all sense of the world and so
Observing these two adults when I was a child
Gave me a sense of the way in which you know like each
individual history can be marked by
history written with capital letters
And how we're all a part of it whether or not we want to be a part of it
We're all the actors and observers of it
And I was lucky that in spite of the difficulties that sort of both the sides of my family experienced
I was raised in an environment where
I was told that the future was Europe
And Europe was based essentially on this peace project
It was based on this notion of reconciliation, which is still ongoing
Which we still have to reinvent on an everyday basis
And that became my first school and then I decided to turn it
I mean it's sort of I was led something was
gnawing at me within myself
and
I
I let it lead me towards this path
Which I'm still on which is essentially guided by this question of what is peace
It's it's a very very complex and philosophical question
And it's a very personal one at the same time as being a very political one
So it remains my sort of everyday bread
So um
I
Met you and found out about you because of your ted talk
talking about the
If we decarbonize we're going to rematerialize
But since we first interacted
There is another war on top of the second world war and the algerian war and the cold war
There's a real war going on in ukraine between russia and nato
And you have been quite active there on writing about it and maybe working there. I'm not sure could you
What are your thoughts on what's going on there? What are the aspects?
That for positive peace or any peace. What do you think?
Well, I don't know about the prospects about positive peace or negative peace
because for the
well
The first thing that I'd like to offer as an insight is essentially that we have if we miss the war in europe, you know
particularly if until the 22nd of february
We just didn't fully understand the war was going to happen the first question that I had in my mind was what else are we missing?
and
There's been there. There are a number of different sort of narratives that have
Should have been developed over the last eight months now more so than than ten months
um
One that this war is about the past
I argue that it's about the past and the future together
To that this is a war about imperialism
I argue that this is a war about imperialism reinvented
in light of climate change and ecological disruption
And that it is fundamentally about systems rivalry
and so
One of the sort of arguments that have been developing particularly here in my work in europe has been to say that ukraine for me represents
ground zero for transition warfare
What's transition warfare?
The thing that I found very telling about russian behavior in ukraine
Beyond you know, like the type of discourses that we we have all listened to by president putin
Starting on the 21st of february of this year or even going back my number of years in the past and since then
um
is that
President putin puts a narrative forward and then when you study a number of documents belonging to the russian state or apparatus
You realize that there are there's a lot more sort of elaborate
Strategy and planning going into what is going on in ukraine and one of the things that really struck me
Is part of the initial set of research that I did
I think I it was you know on the 26th of february this year that I started to just trying to educate myself about what's going on in ukraine
The very first thing that popped up popped up on my radar
Is that ukraine is obviously the most resource rich country in the whole of the european continent
It has a lot of hydrocarbons. It has a lot of uranium and it has a lot of critical minerals
So much so that actually ukraine
Was and remains for that matter one of two
strategic partners for the european union to develop and deploy and diversify
supply chains for critical raw materials
the first one is canada
and the strategic partnership between the european union and ukraine
Was struck in july 2021
A few months after afterwards ukraine started an auctioning process for a number of deposits which are located
interestingly
um or at least concentrated in the eastern part of ukraine where russia is
actively trying to annex and control a number of territories and has been doing for a long time
um
and
If it was only about ukraine i'd be
Already concerned, but when you sort of compare and you know
I get ties back to the story with the central african republic if you compare
The way in which russia is behaving towards ukraine and how it's behaving for example towards african contexts
deploying mercenaries
Deploying military partnerships with countries like cameroon or zimbabwe or malibar kina fasso
Madagascar even you realize that russia is essentially targeting a number of different
um
partnerships or approaches or wars of aggression for that matter to try and gain access to
certain key raw materials that
They want that russia wants
To try and sort of you know re hone
Their power as a geoeconomic power broker
But most importantly that other energy intensive countries such as china the u.s. And european countries want
And russia is very very conscious of the fact that the world
The markets of energy
are changing
And that it needs to cater to changes in demand
For three different types of energy sources one being hydrocarbons
The other one being nuclear power and the other one being
Mineral energy that we're actively moving towards particularly in the sense of you know like trying to
Increase the extraction of critical raw materials. So so you in your shorthand you now use the word mineral energy instead of renewable energy
Well, I suppose that for
Renewable energy is one aspect of the whole set of energy that we're you know going to be going towards right
Mineral energy is also something which is incredibly used for digitalization purposes
Which is also part of the energy mix that we're trying to put together
So I I mean like it came to me naturally this way to talk about mineral energy
Um because I find that it's a lot more
It's uh honest
Yeah, very picturesque people can understand that you know energy can come from certain types of materials, right?
Renewables it just becomes this sort of like composite. You know, it's it's it's
This typical thing of like it's a final product, which is almost detached in our imagination from its origin
So I know a lot more about your work than you know about my work
but in my books uh re-refer to it as rebuildable energy because
The sun and the wind and the hydrological flows are renewable
But the machinery that we need to build these structures are no more renewable than a pickup truck
And they are as we're going to talk about very material intensive
um
So yeah another thing about my work Olivia and that you were just um
kind of uh merging your work with mine is
I think what's happened since february 22
Is we are moving towards a biophysical uh phase shift in world
recognition of our situation instead of money and technology
Being kind of the narratives we're moving towards resources
energy and materials and and maybe the environment and it just changes
It changes the whole power structure
And of course the leading country in the world economically
From where i'm sitting having this conversation with you
Is not going to uh quietly
Welcome a multipolar world and that's part of the problem we have here in russia
A much bigger country than the us
lower population lower gdp
But i don't know how many people realize this the u.s. Saudi arabia and russia are the three world's largest oil producers
But a lot of the oil producing countries use a lot of the oil and gas themselves
So on the global market of the amount of oil that's available for export
Russia has 21 of global export
Exportable oil and 25 of exportable natural gas
So this is a real kind of uh
Um sea change that's coming is seeing the world from a financial lend
Versus an energy and resource lens, and I think that's underpinning a lot of what's going on there
Absolutely, and I think I mean to go back to that point you know like one of the
There is definitely a sort of landslide that is happening at the moment as a result of the ukraine war
Which is related to the sort of reorganization of supply chains around l and g around gas
and uh
Where sort of new markets or sort of expanding markets are going to be created as a result of
um of russia's war of aggression
and as I said, you know like I think that
What we missed at least in europe, I don't know so much about the u.s. But in europe we really did miss I think the fact that
president putin was a lot more elaborate and and much more of a strategist
than we suspected
When you read for example, I got my hands. Um, I hired a brilliant
ukrainian researcher in the wake of the war in ukraine to help me sort of you know go through a number of russian documents
in russian
And we read through a number of strategic documents including the the national sort of
Defense policy and security strategy and stuff like this and I was really struck one of the key overarching documents that you know like
humanity has entered
the most unstable phase of its history
And the instability is essentially related to a fragmentation of power
Multiplarity, but also very much so as a result of climate change, which is significant considering that you know like in in my sector
in the security sector
um, a lot of actors have focused on
discussions happening in the un security council
over, you know the passing of
A un scr like a un sc resolution over climate security and for years russia has been saying no no no no
and you know like sort of
Wavering between different types of narratives at the beginning saying climate change doesn't exist
And then sort of saying well climate change may exist
But probably not you know as a result of anthropogenic activity
Or climate change may exist, but actually russia will benefit. So, you know, why not just let it run its course
It's going to increase our GDP
um
and
When I went back into those documents, which were you know dating back to 2014 or 2015
It was very clear that russia has a very strong understanding of the fact that
The biophysics of our planet are being disrupted that it is going to affect its agricultural base. It's water base
It's economic base that it is going to you know lead to a number of tensions around the world
If not wars and that this is something that russia needs to defend itself against and it has
been
very good at
Very good and very very disruptive. It's it's become a bit of a bit
It's become definitely a rogue power in the international community using different types of tactics to gain access to different resources
I'm hoping by the time this podcast goes live that we're not in a hot war
Between the us and russia. I will just say that
in in
recent weeks i've seen that
Russian population
um, which is a higher percentage
uh, christian or you know orthodox some religious view
Have started to label the west as
Satan satanization, you know, we don't want the
To live like that
And there's a real antagonism against the overconsumptive
Satanic practices
And uh, it's really scary when you start
Labeling people and cultures like that and I had some friends that are russian files and they're telling me
That that sentiment is quite uh, uh potent and growing in russia. Have you have you seen that or witnessed that?
Well, yes, but it's also i mean like it's being it's it's cultivated and
technically the
you know, the first thing that comes to mind when you tell me this is the narrative that was um
that was crafted also
as a result of the
Iranian revolution back in 1979 the us was also indeed sort of portrayed as the ultimate satan
And it has been the a narrative that has stuck right that is being
nourished cultivated
And emphasized and has been for nearly 40 years now
It doesn't mean you know, like once again, like it's it's part of these um
If you look at sort of so-called, uh, cultural clashes, which are not really cultural clashes for that matter at international relations level
It is a matter of sort of, you know, seeing the us as um
this double-hatted
actor on the one hand supposedly, you know, like those sort of
guarantor of international security
But also a guarantor that has been growing in strength and military power
And has you know, and this was the one piece of truth that put in on the 21st of february
uttered in his uh
In his address, which was that the u.s. Has also broken international law and different uh at different times including during the invasion of iraq
which has been used by the enemy enemies of the u.s. As you know,
Like, you know the the ultimate
Substantiation essentially of what they were trying to show the world right that the u.s. Was this hidden ultimate, um, you know power
Working, you know for the worst of humanity
But like any type of hegemon
This has always been the fundamental paradox that big powers have had to work with and as you are saying
the u.s. Is
You know dealing with a very very complex
political makeup at home very very strong fractures
uh
very strong economic forces working at odds with democratization at times and
with social sort of safety nets and
And there is an element where you know from an international perspective. It is a country that has
Shown to have its shortcomings in terms of international diplomacy and
And peace building and sort of mediation as well
And global redistribution of wealth obviously
as a mediator
Knowing something about the situation
What is our best hope to avoid some sort of world war three at this point?
I don't know
I'll be very honest. I don't know. I don't either. Um
I just like
food
A short of an answer as I can give as long as we don't know the extent of puttons ambitions
and motives behind the war
It will be very very difficult
for any type of
Option towards
peace
It doesn't like there again. There is a difference between peace and sort of stabilization
Ukraine knows this very well because
The post-2014 situation was some kind of stabilization which didn't work in Ukraine's favor in any case
and which obviously sort of led to putton
being able to regain strength
And to work on a sequence of events and efforts that led to the 24th of february 2022
And we have to learn from history including the second world war and the run-up towards the second world war and understanding indeed, you know
As long as we don't fully understand the motives of an enemy
Um, there can be some backdoor
information sharing
and diplomacy
to try and ensure that the escalation
is not
Going to get out of hand. This is something that europe the u.s. russia china
turkey a number of different sort of countries are working very hard upon
But can we work towards peace right now? I don't think so
Wait, but you said something earlier about a core tenet of regenerative
peace building is expanding the pie
But my work shows that we're about to globally no longer be able to expand the biophysical pie
and the way we're doing it now is changing rules and
Including cocaine and prostitution and gdp measures in in europe in order to allow us to keep issuing debt
To kick the can further, but at some point that we won't be able to expand the pie
And that's why
That's why mediation and peacemaking is about the well and probably a better governance
system globally and nationally
Are the are the best possible paths for humanity and i'm
I'm worried about it. Um
Any quick thoughts there?
I think that if we
Yes, so two levels
One is
It would be great if we or if we were all educated the way that you are for example mate and
in
the biophysical and geochemical realities of our planet
and understanding essentially that we're
We're going on over overshoot in so many different directions
That we have to work collectively in order to find an economic system
That allows for
Solidarity in the form of various types of independent exchanges
But at the same time allows for diversity
and
For much more diversified economic exchanges. That like political and economic and ecological diversity. Let's put it this way
The problem is that one
Is the understanding that we're quickly overshooting on planetary boundaries or
um geophysical realities is not
a narrative that is widely shared
And when it is widely shared it leads to two different sort of responses grossly
one is technosolutionism
how to
Corp and capture our way out for example of the climate crisis or how to
GMO our way out of the ecological crisis you talked about this. I think recently with Vandana Shiva
um
And the other one is also to sort of say well like let's sort of transition
Away as rapidly as possible de-grow and and you know like uh and and go towards
Some economic equilibriums which are a lot more responsible towards the planet
In between those two sort of polar opposites. There is a a vast array of nuances and options available
And we need to find our way forward because it's going to be a question of mix. Um
But one would be indeed to sort of
You know get world leaders on the table and to say well
Indeed war is definitely not going to go in the direction of trying to respect biophysical
boundaries
And our priority if we are to indeed sort of be able to respect some kind of equilibrium of nations equilibrium of powers
Um and different you know like diversity of systems
Then we have to come to an understanding of what not to go over in terms of threshold
And what to go towards in terms of objectives at the at the international level
I do think that all of the work that i've done on
energy depletion risk
mineral
scarcity
Given the um the energy transition
um the financial overshoot that we keep papering over our problems with debt
The six continent supply chain and the complexity of our just-in-time system all of those problems and the ecological overshoot
Are all made worse if we go to a big war
So I think every path has to avoid a hot war between the leading nations
And i'll just leave it at that. I don't know how to get there either, but I think it's a central question. So
I
Yeah, I think maybe just building on that because I was leading towards my second point. There is a problem, you know, um
You know, we've mentioned the ecological and biophysical literacy problem
The second part is that and this relates back to the point on transition warfare
China and I talk about it my TED talk
Is managing to turn the tables on the international economic system
Has used its foundations in order to harness and hone into its own power and then to sort of like then
from a position of power try to
Empty it or you know, give a different
Sort of direction of travel to the way in which we organize ourselves from a value system from an ideological system from
a governance system economic one, etc, etc
The part that I think is really complicated
Recording this particular war
Is the fact that it is, you know, a moment of it's a moment of break
It's a moment when essentially this notion of systems rivalry is being enacted
With a war of aggression
Very rapidly where both actors into it and observers of how it unfolds and everybody is right Russia included the ukrainians included
China included obviously
And it's about sort of seeing, you know, like how
Strongly do the international does the international system sort of manage to withstand the pressure of this war of aggression
Without crumbling in its own foundations
But also how does it manage to really evolve and the evolution part is going to be the part where it either breaks or
You know, like manages to sort of hop over into
A different moment of its history
But I think that this is the part that worries me most
It's, you know, like to me the war in ukraine is a sign that some
countries
believe that wars of aggression and
sort of taking
Supply chains hostage including food related supply chains
Is a completely sort of effective and
An acceptable way forward into climate disruptive futures
And that's the part that we really worries me
So so this gets into another area of your expertise and I will get back to your ted talk
But you talked about supply chains. So europe is really struggling
right now with
the electricity prices
Because of the the Nord Stream pipeline and natural gas, but europe is on balance a wealthy
Area, but what about the global south that they have to buy
natural gas and the open market and food and other things
And they have no say in this in this war and no stake, but they're at the end of the supply chains. So
The the pie even if it's the same size right now the global resource pie. It's being
Uh
Shrunk to the global south because we're rationing by price in the in the global market
So can you talk about that both from a resource and also maybe a climate standpoint?
On how the global south is set up to really take the brunt of of of these dynamics
Well
You said something there at the end of the supply chains technically there at the end in the beginning
We're already sort of seeing it. It's one of the second or third hand effect from the war in ukraine
There is a number of different fossil infrastructure be which are being locked in on the shores of africa, for example
as a way essentially to sort of, you know, try and
Reassure markets and investors
And as a way also to sort of, you know, try and appease certain african elites
Sometimes as we saw at cup 27 at the expense of how african civil society actually truly feels which is no fossil fuels
um
But that's the part which is, you know, like very very
African civil society says no fossil fuels
Well, what I saw at cup 27 was really quite impressive in terms of how african civil society groups were mobilizing very
Visibly in the cup 27
venue
To say no to the development of fossil fuels in africa and you've got I think, you know, it's a per a berman
who works on the
fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty
Has been also sort of shedding light on some of the work of
of
These african civil society groups which have issued a number of reports in cup 27. One is called don gas africa
um, and the other one is um
I forget the name I will sort of dig it out for you after the recording something like the gas illusion or something which
demonstrated very
Vividly how gas infrastructure locking in and in on the african continent would have tremendous costs in terms of its economic future
In terms of its water resources in terms of the impacts on ecosystems and ecological integrity
Um, and how it's it's just not it's not something that a lot of african civil society groups approve of
So what are they advocating instead?
So I'm gonna use the word leave frog even though technically it's not the best
The best of use but essentially to sort of skip the fossil
Uh, the fossil the fossil box and go towards different types of renewable
mixes from hydrological or you know hydropower
sort of energy sources to renewable to nuclear
Although i'm i'm not entirely sure that the the people who were
mobilizing against gas infrastructure would be in favor of nuclear. I didn't ask them but um
Uh, but I think that there is definitely, you know a very strong conscience at least in the activists that I talked to
that
The the fossil
Investments that are pouring into african countries right now
Will work at the detriment of long-term development and stable development
Well, I mean
If that happens then they're even
More in the belly of this the global superorganism
Because they get dependent on that whole structure. So you were about to say something
Important, uh, and I interrupted you again
That the global supply chain the inputs to the processes and manufacturing
Actually start in the global south
I meant that the outputs the food and the things in the in the grocery stores
They're at the tail end of that but but but keep expanding on your idea there
And again, it's both right
But I think from what I've observed
Working in african countries and a little bit and that's in america and asian countries
Is that indeed there is a huge amount of extraction as I was mentioning in the beginning of the podcast
Which serves, you know, uh, processing refining
Um consumption and export economies in the so-called global north for the most part
So there is indeed like it's the typical story that
We've studied for a really long time in development economics
Where, you know, a lot of countries in the global south are kind of
Stuck and some would argue
Made to be stuck at the extraction
Sort of economic level and then all of the economic value goes up to the global north in terms of refining and exporting as I was saying
Which essentially means also that, um
Because, you know, a number of
countries in the global south remain
quite
Nondiversified and their economic make up
They're highly dependent on imports
Including for agricultural goods even in spite of the fact that they have a lot of arable land
Um and very diverse and complex, you know, agricultural
sort of
you know
Productions which are a lot more
Which are a lot fitter for that matter to a climate disrupted world
but they bear the brunt of
Well, the sort of legacies of the structural adjustments in the 1970s and 1980s
of debt of
Well, that's servicing including, you know, like which that's servicing which is increasing
Because of climate disruptions. They're actually sort of servicing debt five times more than they are able to actually sort of
Repair or sort of recover and adapt to climate disruptions coming their way
um
And that means that when a war like the war of aggression in ukraine
breaks out
any type of
product and commodity dependent on
energy fossil diesel
is usually going to increase in price and therefore lead to
a fragmentation of
socio-economic
Sort of workings towards equality, which is already very very difficult in fragile countries for a number of different reasons
including the political and economic makeup
And the fact that, you know, the poor sections of society which are quite extensive are going to suffer tremendously from
a lack of mobility a lack of access to food
Which is going to lead to the type of
You know revolts that we've seen during the arab spring not in every context, right? Because the
And higher wet bulb temperatures, etc. Yeah
absolutely
And all of this combines means that indeed in link if we look
Not so long into the future. I would argue, you know, like even two to five years
We're we're seeing we're going to see even more of an acceleration towards this notion of poly crises or sort of interlinked crises as
as
depending depending on, you know, what kind of language you want to use but
financial inflation
economic inflation
debt crises ecological disruptions climate shocks
And then sort of more
Sort of political crises in nature which have to do with growing levels of marginalization and inequality
So this itself was a core part of your ted talk
certainly a
a takeaway sentence that I
Have used of yours is in an attempt to decarbonize. We're going to demit. We're going to
Rematerialize our economy and that has huge
Uh implications for the global south as you were just saying
So can you say a little bit more about that? I mean we're it's like out of the frying pan into the fire from a biophysical sense
What what are your summary thoughts on that?
Well, I mean like you can you can also direct your your listeners to your podcast with simon michaud and with a number of other people
Who have been here on the podcast before yeah, but he's talking about the availability and the cost
You're actually talking about the geography the geography and the people
And the ecology right that's the two part which are really interlinked. So I mean, you know
We're essentially we've the world has always been dependent on minerals that we know right like if you if you use
A spoon to eat your yogurt
Which is made of steel or aluminum. You're like we like this is like this is a product essentially from the mineral economy
But what we're facing at the moment with the decarbonization process and even more so with the
Twin transition between digitalization and decarbonization is that the demand for critical raw materials is is is about to explode
I
Take a few examples in in the TED talk extracted from different sources from the world bank the international energy agency, but
You know an electric car uses on average six times more material inputs than a conventional car
The level of you know, sort of electrification that we need for our grids requires nine times more materials than we currently rely upon for our fossil
infrastructure
For certain types of materials we're facing, you know, like a 500 percent increase in terms of demand by 2050
We're talking about graphite and lithium and that kind of thing especially for the world of batteries
And anything related to individual and collective mobility
So that has two combined effects one is obviously that we'll have to dig deeper
And in more places in the world in order to meet that demand
The ecological effects of digging deeper
Or digging in different parts of the world
differ in terms of the type of material and the type of technologies that we use but
We have to be very clear that any type of mining is environmentally invasive
Very water intensive and tends to have very strong effects
Some of which are fully known some of which are less known in terms of air pollution ecological pollution and sort of you know
disturbance to biodiversity of different kinds
And that will have
This is something that is not yet fully computed in terms of what are going to be the
first second third hand effects, especially as climate disruptions come
with full force at us, right, especially regarding
this this the use of water
were
sort of at least as far as i'm aware and i've asked a number of different sort of experts and and and
you know mining actors
The notion of how you know climate impacts will
Come and hit any type of given context where mining is taking place
Is not understood in terms of how it will affect the availability quantity and quality of water
Today five years ten 40 years from now and especially what their repercussion is going to be on local communities
So that's the ecological part
The geographical part is um, and I invite you know all your listeners to actually sort of watch the TED talk where I show
Sort of an overlap of different maps
if you look at um the
Concentration of ore and deposits in the world for different types of minerals that we need and we need a lot of them
And a lot of different types of materials
We can see that they're actually located in asin america in africa and central asia in inter-pacific
And in you know some places in in europe and obviously you've got also like the three four big polls between
China australia canada in the u.s. And then you've got greenland and the sort of arctic, right?
But I focus a bit less on that because that's less of the issue when it relates essentially to
a high densely populated
sort of countries
but the part that I the reason that got me to
Really delve into this topic is that when you look at the overlay of data
You find that the deposits are located in in in context which score very high in terms of corruption indices
In terms of fragility indices in terms of water stress in terms of climate vulnerability
Which are all foundations essentially for anything going back and those things are happening now
Not in the future. They're happening now absolutely
And they are you know like it's one thing
So maybe one additional thing one additional layer of complexity
It's it would already be bad
If it were happening in a world where geopolitical tensions were not running that high because we would still have a number of different sort of
you know
Extractive companies sort of you know going into different places where
Governance systems and the application of certain standards around environmental social and governance standards are not very strong
But the dangers are
That much higher as a result of the sort of power systems fragmentation at a geopolitical
geoeconomic and geostrategic level
Because when you look at the fact that a number of supply chain
Sort of both from extraction to processing refining and exportation are educated in china or in russia
um
And that this is the backbone essentially of the system's rivalry and the way in which power
Sort of redistribution or competition of power
Overpower is taking shape
Then you realize essentially that you've got different models actively sort of competing in those countries with disastrous environmental social and governance effects
So many questions on that part
Specifically if growing the pie the economic pie of the global human
economic system means
That we have to rematerialize
And if we don't do that, then we have a smaller global
Biophysical pie. How do you see the
The central powers being reshaped is china is obviously a big one
The russia is the u.s. Still part of that is it still possible?
That we can shape a shift to a multipolar world to be one of a more cooperative
Nature right from the beginning or is it doomed to be a resource grab power struggle?
uh after
growth stops
It's going to be both
Because when we look at the way in which history unfolds it always unfolds in multiple sort of in in multiple
competing
simultaneous ways
So I do believe
That
Reaching some kind of equilibrium somewhere down the road
Around how to reorganize power within the confines of planetary boundaries or geophysical
Biophysical boundaries is possible
We're not currently working within this confine
We're not currently having this framework in mind in order to rationalize and reason with power
And this is the crux of my work or at least it has become the crux of my work
Because when you look for example at the way in which we've that's you know, like even bifurcate for a second
into the sort of climate
Negotiation regime
around the Paris agreement or the sort of you know, Kyoto protocol and that kind of thing. We're still working with this notion of
Let's
Accept business as usual and organize essentially different types of technologies and different types of economic modeling or territorial
governance or mobility around business as usual
Because business as usual is essentially what maintains the sense of international equilibrium
And I'm looking at it in a very dispassionate way, right? Like I'm I've come to
Understand that it's not just
purely about greed. There are some fundamental sort of needs
Powering economic growth which have to do with social welfare system
Which needs to be reinvented. But in order to be reinvented, we have to reinvent the financial system the macroeconomics sort of, you know, like system
We have to go into debt conversations. We have to go into really really difficult
and complex topics
But at the moment
we are facing a level of geopolitical tension
and
geo economic race
And fragment coupled with fragmentation over supply chains, which is sending markets into all kinds of panics
That we're essentially seeing that new scramble for resources
It used to be the scramble for Africa now
It's the scramble for resources writ large and indeed the global south is at the center of it
And this is what needs to be stopped because if we go down that road
One, we know what the scramble for Africa gave in terms of legacies regarding global inequities and inequalities
poverty
political sort of, you know
Conflicts etc etc that needs to be avoided at all costs
because
because it's just otherwise, you know, like trying to
The result would undo any type of effort that has been put into place over the last 17 years trying to work towards more peace and more development
The second problem and this is where I think that, you know, to a certain extent we we need to create the right sort of
narrative and political and economic framework in order to
Try and reason with power is the fact that if we are to, you know, if we were to sort of
delve into the scramble for resources
We would actually plunder the planet on our way to decarbonization
We will actually lose
The future of humanity trying to save it on behalf of the climate and this is the ultimate irony, right?
I totally agree with that
Well, here's a here's a deep question
Would global access to all these materials and energy even solve the problems humanity is facing anyways?
No, absolutely not and this is you know, like one of the fundamental I would say sort of
Logical errors as part of how we deal with the climate
Crisis or climate change climate transformation however, whatever name you want to sort of tag onto the climate
The current international
Negotiation framework is looking at it as the ultimate sort of problem rather than seeing it necessarily as a symptom of a deeper crisis
right if you look at Johann Reuchström's or the Stockholm environments Institute sort of
Framework over planetary boundaries. You see a number of different overshoots
Which are all interlinked with one another in one of the key and this is you know, like one of the key messages in the Ted talk as well
Or something that really struck me for years in my in my sector, you know around security people
Then I didn't understand the link between between the climate regime and terrestrial and marine ecosystems
Something as basic as that right because we're just not like we don't deal with nature. We don't deal with physics or you know
chemistry within within our sector and I remember having to run
through
You know some sessions which for some were completely sort of
obvious
And others for whom it was completely oblivious
It was just like saying well, you know
terrestrial and marine ecosystems or the critical regulators of the global climate regime and it's a two-way street
If we lose ecosystems, we lose the climate if we lose the climate we lose the ecosystems or at least they get rearranged in a different way
We're going to see a sort of fundamental redistribution and reshifting of global natural resources, which will mean essentially something which is
Differences or at least a questioning over this notion of boundary this notion of sovereignty this notion of human settlements
Like we're we're going back into you know a notion of how to organize peace and security
In in a world that is so far away from the one that we know that we
Obviously know that the current foundations are not going to hold but we don't know what what's next
My friend randy haze who founded rainforest action network
Starts many of his speeches by saying there is no social justice on a dead planet
And so there's all these layers
of of priority here
So given how everything fits together olivia
personally
I see degrowth as what we should do
But post-growth is what we're going to have to do
So what do you think about this statement, especially as it pertains to the global south?
What do you mean by post-growth and what do you mean by degrowth degrowth is a voluntary
more equitable contraction that the world cooperates and contraction and convergence where
The the wealthy north gives up some of the resources and gdp in order to give a basic existence for the global south
at some level
And that the environment
And the planetary boundaries are somewhat respected that would be the the planned degrowth. I just think that's
behaviorally and energetically
Implausible by post-growth
I mean that we are part of a metabolic system where we've outsourced our decision making to the market
And we are compelled to grow to payback prior claims
And that everyone is pursuing this gdp and we're not even trying to do it
It's just the system has been built around that and we're running out of cans to kick
and with oil depletion
Which is a whole nother story
That once oil starts to decline in earnest globally
We won't be able to continue to grow the 19 terawatt global society
And then we have a date with a financial recalibration because we've built all these monetary claims
So then we're going to go down to a 15 terawatt or a 12 terawatt society
Once we start to go down there's no there's no way to predict what's going to happen as you said there's evolving
Responses
That's what I call the great simplification is we're going to have to prepare for that smaller
Biophysical global economy, but then there's the distribution. There's the geopolitics
There's all the things that you're working on
So i'm just wondering how you see the or maybe you believe that growth will continue
What what do you think about everything I just said?
well, I mean I
So I have a few thoughts
the first thing is
We're now in december 2022. I remember one year ago precisely
hearing still people in the brussel's bubble and across europe saying market market market technology technology technology
When talking about climate adaptation and climate mitigation
One year later. We're saying state state state
Market will have to take second place
right
This is are you hearing that globally or only in europe?
No, only in europe and this is my second point
We are facing a world where obviously there are different economic needs and different economic realities depending on where you sit
so if you look at it less from the sort of greenhouse gas emission
sort of uh regime especially if it's counted on a national basis rather than a per capita basis
um and more towards you know this sort of
slightly tentative
data computation where how many planets
Do ever does every region sort of consume then we know for example that in europe we need to
drastically reduce our consumption because I think that we I can't remember exactly but I think that we may consume like
You know in a country like france or germany like between two and three planets per year
But if you look for example at the u.s
You know the consumption is that much higher and would need to
Really that much more drastically
You mean that if the whole world consumed like france or germany it would require two or three earths
It's not just friend. Yeah, right
Exactly um and it's shifting essentially the conversation from purity greenhouse gases towards material use which essentially looks at
water
soil at
You know different types of material consumptions that then also lead towards the greenhouse gas consumption
Which is a major advance in the conversation in my opinion
Exactly um because it looks at things holistically and it looks at the way in which we use nature and organize our societies and
economies and exchanges on the basis of
Non regenerative or regenerative rights because at the end of the day regeneration is about allowing nature to regenerate naturally and sort of
You know organically in order to sustain life on earth
It's as simple as that but then obviously if you break it down it gets very complex, but that's the simple logic
so the
Here is the part that gives me hope about the sort of
growth post growth degrowth sort of modeling or alternative economic modeling
That um, you know, we need to be headed towards one has been the result of the war in ukraine
Um, the fact that we're now sort of focusing for now on there's something very specific
Which is results efficiency
We're not pushing the button far enough because technically we would need to be a lot more consequential
In how we reduce our use of energy including with regards to the solidarity with ukraine
And including with regards to the future sustainability of europe knowing that for now this coming winter
We're fine. The next one is going to be a question mark and everybody's talking about it already
So this is something where we should be inviting european citizens
Depending on different, you know, like where they sit in terms of meteor
You know meteorology and stuff like this to try and be a lot more consequential with their with their use of energy that it also includes
Shops like if you walk in paris at the moment, you'll still see, you know shops which are lit at night
Um, and never sort of, you know fundamentally reduce their um their energy consumption
The second part that gives me hope is that if I look for example at the type of research grants that have been
Given in the last few months including by the european commission
We find one of the largest piece of research has just been allocated by people near two people like jason hickle
And a number of other researchers
Precisely on degrowth
Precisely on trying to understand what the future of europe is going to be
When we start taking into account global wealth redistribution
Climate disruptions and the future of adaptation
So like it is a very very clear message
That at the highest instances of the european commission, there are some really hard questions that are being asked
They may not be discussed publicly yet
Because and this is the part also that leads me to that to my final point
We should be very clear eyed
at the moment
About the fact that we cannot afford to have
A conversation about the future of economic
Equilibrium and and and the future of economic resilience and adaptability
Which is tainted by ideology what I want
For me as a personally as a researcher is data
Data coupled with foresight's scenario building and an understanding of complexity
If somebody tells me we should be headed towards degrowth
Sure
If you look at a certain type of equilibrium
If it's only sort of you know from a national perspective
For a country like mine for example in france
Then let's look at the way in which we can reorganize sectors in a way that still maintains a certain sense of you know social welfare
That tries to generate indeed more social and economic fabrics that tries to generate more solidarity
And that tries to generate resilience and adaptability
I'm obviously in favor of that, but let's always remember
That especially as a result of globalization
There is no country that can pretend to be an island except potentially for north korea and not even then
And if we're not islands then that means that
If a country goes into a degrowth mode, it's obviously going to have some impacts
in you know on the countries on which it depends
and
If I take
A similar process in terms of comparison to try and sort of convey my point across
The european green deal
When president von der leyen came to the presidency of the commission
Was hailed essentially as europe's man on the moon moment
It was a project
Sort of you know made of 13 different policy packages from energy mobility construction agriculture
Demonstrating or trying to demonstrate european leadership, especially on the climate question
The european green deal was designed for europeans
By europeans and it didn't have a foreign policy component
It had certain elements of it with mechanisms such as what we're now calling the carbon border adjustment mechanism
Which is raising a lot of tensions with countries in the global south upon which would depend
To be carbon intensive in order to feed and sustain european markets
So there is a logic of trying to say
Yeah, you know like we're taking the leads because our consumers are asking for change
And therefore we're going to try and sort of you know, take other countries with us
But if it is not accompanied in the design phase in terms of policy packaging by an understanding
Of the global economic metabolism
Of the interdependencies that work for the best and for the worst of you know, like for different countries
Then we will not have a healthy conversation about the future of alternative economic modeling including degrowth
Degrowth currently has a bias towards national types of economic fabrics. What we need to have is
national fabric reorganization
At national levels and in terms of how they impact
sort of global economic exchange
And that is the part that is currently missing which I think is particularly
prescient for now
Because let's be honest if we were to say
If we were to sort of like focus or dial dial on you know, like the the the climate crisis and say let's go towards degrowth
and you turn to
president Macron or you know chancellor Schultz for that
You will not get their attention for the simple reason that there is a war going on
And that any type of economic sort of you know, destabilization
Which may be used or poached by foreign influencers, which is already the case. We're talking about china and russia
There is a lot of disinformation and misinformation going on and a lot of support for far right and left right left
you know, like far left, sorry, cut parties in countries like France and
You know others Italy for example
If you try and convince leaders to say let's go towards you know
Like climate targets without taking into account the fact that we are in a system's rivalry
We are in a very dangerous moment of history that requires a fully multidimensional thinking over what security is
security in terms of
Climate adaptability in terms of ecological integrity in terms of socioeconomic welfare
In terms of educational literacy as we were talking about before in terms of defense systems
Because they're not just
Inappropriate they serve a purpose otherwise they wouldn't be in existence
They were not going to have a healthy conversation and we're going to have an ideological conversation
and I'll end on that the
ideological
fragmentation and polarization is one weapon of war and of choice
for the enemies of the european project and and ultimately the enemies of climate delivery in terms of
um more solidarity and in terms of uh, you know being able essentially to sort of couple
the future of democracy or open societies with
climate adaptability
We could also spend an episode talking about this because I'd like to nuance also my own thinking about this, but there is definitely
You know something which is which is very strong being used at the moment ideologically the use of
of ideology as a weapon
I totally agree with that. Um, I I just
sent a tweet out yesterday showing that the chat gbt
Won't let you talk positively about fossil fuels. So there's ideology built into the ai, you know pro or negative
It's not the point. It's
We have to look at facts and data and describe what is and then have
mediators and educators
craft a path forward
um
I have so many questions for you. I'm so glad that we did this because now I am going to have you back and have a deeper dive
On on this I've got some personal questions that I close my interviews with that. I'd like to ask you
But before that I something that um, I just thought of last week. I was reading a book
Called braiding sweet grass by a woman named robin wall kimmer. Have you read that book?
I um
Not in depth. Unfortunately. I've never sort of yes, but I know of it and
I admire her thinking
Yeah, um, I don't know her I'd love to be introduced or so I could uh interview her but
She in the book, uh, and because you're a linguist is why I'm bringing this up. She brings up that
English is 70% nouns
In contrast to some other cultures like, uh, I think the potawatomi indian
Uh tribe is 70% verbs
So one of our students asked a question. Wait a second. Doesn't this mean that speaking english thinking in english
Somehow gives us permission to disrespect nature
And that's kind of the heart of your
Your philosophy as well. Do you have any thoughts on that?
It's it's fascinating. I um
I mean it would require me having, you know, a good a good thing about so but the very first thing that it brings to mind
is indeed objectification and we know that we have a rapport towards nature, which is
Seeing nature is something, you know, it's a resource. It's not life
even the way in which we, uh
If you're certain world leaders at cup 15 or cup 27 or the g7 or g20
They say we are part of nature
This is wrong
we are nature
And every person who has indeed ever been in contact with indigenous populations
I've had I was incredibly lucky a number of years ago to go to ecuador
and to
Well learn from indigenous communities
Something that profoundly
Impacted me and changed my understanding. I mean, it sounds very cliche to say it, but it was incredibly true
um
It did change the way in which I understand myself
my own nature my own biology and the way in which I
Look touch sense nature around me and it just helped me
I think at you know to a certain extent I would even argue that it was the very beginning of this journey that I've been on
the sense of relationship and its dependency and and
Interbeing I think it was tishnatan as well who sort of you know talks about this this notion of interbeing that I profoundly relate to
So yeah, yeah, you were like the ninth of my guess that's mentioned that um, it all makes me very sad because
We take it for granted like we're energy blind. We're also ecology blind and and sacred
We we will miss the creatures that we share this planet with after they are gone
And um, again, you don't know much about my work, but ultimately that's what I care about the most
But that's why I think we have to bend not break human systems to
Make sure we propel
as many species ecosystems
Values knowledge things that are important through the the coming
You know difficult times. So um a few closing questions for you. Thank you so much for your time, uh, olivia
So you're a peacemaker. What are some pieces of advice that you have
For listeners watchers of this show to be a a diplomat or a peacemaker in their own community in these kind of
highly uncertain to multuous economic cultural times
Take the time to cultivate your critical mind
Take the time to especially
be
In a world where we're flooded with information and where
Propaganda is rife
It's it really is like about
For me peace has always been associated with a necessary understanding of complexity
From an emotional perspective from an intellectual perspective
And then from there
From a technical technological energy resource perspective and and that kind of thing would take the time
To hone in on
Understanding the complexity and looking at it in a fairly dispassionate way. I would say it doesn't mean and again
I will end on this. I'm a very
I'm known particularly in brussels apparently for having a very passionate character which in brussels can be understood as something which is
um
A bit unwelcome. Let's put it this way. Um
but
I channel my passion towards
rigor and
Trying to make sense of the world and trying to understand what tradeoffs we have to face
What costs we have to face
In order to really craft the vision
that we need to go
towards and it takes time and it takes
humility which um, I'm sure I could use, you know
a lot more of me myself at times, but um
But it takes a lot of um of emotional maturity and intellectual sort of curiosity in order to
To sit back when
You know, we're sort of ruffled in our feathers ideological ones and emotional ones and and yet we should because there are some things that just need to be
pondered we're in living in very complex lines the way forward is not going to be easily drawn
A subset of that question then uh, do you have any specific recommendations for young humans?
listening to this program who are becoming aware of the economic environmental
equity challenges that the world faces
It's somewhat related. I hear a lot of um, so whenever I give lectures to
Younger people entering the you know, the the sort of job market. I often
get this question, which is do you still have hope?
and
I've started to
For me the word hope has lost a bit of its meaning
um, not because I don't believe in hope that's
not at all the case um, but I
believe best in hope when we can look at reality
with equanimity
um
When we can look at
the
Really catastrophic situations that we've created for ourselves
That we don't stop at them
And that's where interestingly it sort of connects back to the very beginning of this conversation where I was talking about my family history
I was raised on stories
At a time where darkness was only present
And it was it felt very powerful
And I was so lucky
so incredibly lucky
To be raised by people who were the descendant of people who had fought back against that notion of darkness
Which was you know first and foremost something where if you gave in to it
From an emotional perspective first
There was nothing left that you could do
And
I think that this is a teaching that I certainly take for myself in which I you know
I'd say to young people just don't fall into
emotional binarity just
We're so complex. We're so resilient. We're so strong as humans
And it is about cultivating the right type of emotions even in spite of
You know, what looks like a very bleak future
It's not about discarding it either. It is going to be tough
but it's life
I like that. I like that instead of hope the little framework that you just offered
um
last question
If you were benevolent dictator and there was no personal recourse to your decision
What is one thing one decision that you would do to improve human and planetary futures?
policy or
whatever
Something about figuring out, you know, our way our framework or indicators towards regenerative economics
And channeling
A huge proportion of world resources towards um
Doing regeneration through food system transformation
Through peace building and mediation in complex affected zones
um
And through business practices
Without endangering into gene slabs
And critical ecosystems that are still standing
That would be the overarching framework. I think that if we were to
Use or compass
Around what is regeneration which for me is interestingly now the same question as what is peace
um
Without wanting to sound too too simplistic, right?
But uh, we would have we would start asking the right questions
I think right asking the right questions is already a good start. Maybe we should start there
We're gonna we're gonna talk more olivia. Thank you so much for being on this show
And uh to be continued my friend
Thank you so much, Nate. It was a pleasure looking forward to the next time
