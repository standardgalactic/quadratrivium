Most people don't want explanations, they want easy messages.
I would say the biggest challenge is that what's actually impactful and what actually makes a difference
takes a lot of time, is complex to understand and is almost impossible to sell to donors.
Impact is always long-term. There's a huge discussion in the whole non-profit sector
about impact measurement and I can see why. We also try to measure it, we try to follow up
but the most important things you cannot measure.
My guest today is Patrick Nodl of the Nodl Foundation in Germany, an impact investing
firm who focuses on projects that increase sustainability and autonomy for the global south.
Patrick and I discuss the unseen details that go into creating projects that have genuine impact
for the long-term future for communities and for the planet. This conversation in many places was
also a reflective one on what the value and goals of impact investing should be and how Patrick's
life experiences have shaped his philosophy on these issues and the subsequent work that he does.
Thoughtful and aware humans who have access to resources and capital are a critical resource
for steering the direction of planetary futures and Patrick and his work are playing a critical
role on this path. Please enjoy this conversation with my friend Patrick Nodl.
So my friend, we met last year in Europe at a conference of like-minded individuals
and instantly became friends and hit it off not only factually and what we're working on but at a
deeper kind of spiritual level of what it means to be alive and engaged in these issues.
So can you unpack for our audience what has been your path to becoming aware of and educating
yourself on the many converging crises that humanity and the planet face?
At first I would like to point out that becoming aware is a process. So whenever you're at one
point and you think you figure stuff out then you meet some other guy read some other book
see some other documentary and you're like oh I didn't know that so I think the main
the main profit I gained for myself was getting to that point where you actually understand that
it's not over and that you have to be open to question everything you think you know all the
time which I think is the path to progress and in my case I changed quite drastically the way
I think about the world over the past 10 years I guess. So I studied business in Germany and in
England and two different programs and MBA and all of that and when I was in my early 20s I wanted
to become CEO of Porsche the German sports car manufacturer and I thought about how much money
to make is 80,000 good or 100,000 or 150 so I was I had defined my career plan I mean I'm German
based on cars so I had car models figured out that I wanted to drive at a certain age
and from that I said okay that's that's my measure of success so that that was my starting point
and also my my father is an entrepreneur so I I had that spirit and I saw the challenges but also
the yeah the greatness of of of doing something yourself and well after my after my studies I
started traveling the world with a backpack starting to see other people and other cultures and
and it somehow struck me struck me by lightning that so many things that I had learned in school
in university and also in western media had nothing to do with the reality of most parts of the world
and well maybe struck by lightning is a bit too harsh I think it's a process over several journeys
but for example at one point I I questioned myself okay I I went to four different business
universities where I had also economics I have never heard one lecture in my whole life
that involved the world the world sustainability or impact or nature or biodiversity or psychology
or any of that or energy would keep going or and energy surely not yeah energy surely not
and that was like okay why how can that be and so I started questioning things more and more and I
I found out that in in several aspects I wasn't listening to other opinions I wasn't reading
articles or books that were from a different standpoint I was quite skeptical about people who
don't come from the business background like sociological psychological environment whatever
I was always like okay these guys they might have a point but they don't understand the big picture
so I was quite arrogant in the way I saw the world and yeah the the the traveling broke that up
and and so I started getting into these things more and more and I think I always tell that story
on any on every podcast so if you've listened to another one sorry about that the most the most
example was when when I traveled to to to Malaysia in 2013 and we were four weeks there
so we flew to Singapore drove by car to Kuala Lumpur and like you have 400 kilometers and all
you see is palm oil and then you travel four four weeks the country and all you see is palm oil
and then you do research and like okay you see okay two percent is left of of of rainforest
in 1900 it was a hundred percent so then in the morning you look at the at the things you eat you
look at your nescafe that you got from the 7-eleven next door convenience stuff and you see okay there's
there's palm oil in there so basically everything I'm using had palm oil in there then I flew back
to London went to the Battersea power station huge real estate project huge shopping center
luxury apartments and I googled who's the investor behind that and it was that palm oil
company from Malaysia and so that was the first time when I was like okay four universities
and that circle of my consuming killing the rainforest being invested into luxury apartments
and shopping centers why have I not heard one word about that in my whole education that is
supposed to be so great my background is very very similar to yours but but on your point
every time I shop for peanut butter the first thing I do is I look at to see if there's palm
sugar or palm fruit oil in there and I immediately have an emotional image of an orangutan and I
put it back every time I may not be as conscious and looking at all the things but yeah it's it's
profoundly sad what's happened to Indonesia and it's happened little by little so we don't it's
like shifting baselines but on a century level it's a tragedy I mean from from there on I got to
the point where I always dreamed about working in sports I mean yeah again to the German cliche
of course I love football and I mean the football with the round ball that has been kicked not the
American one the egg that's being thrown and and so I wanted to work in that and and it didn't work
out and so I ended up at one point funny enough I ended out as a the co-founder of a franchise
restaurant franchise and it was a steakhouse so I was already critical of of meat at that time
so but I was like okay you're not a student anymore you can afford the good meat so eat the
good meat so then I I look deeper into that and and said okay there is no point so I I said okay
I have to quit this job and I have to do something useful I don't want to earn my money hurting people
hurting nature and and that led basically to many many discussions with people around me and and
and so that led to to the start of a charitable foundation and to the start of an impact investment
company which is basically the two things at least with regards to my LinkedIn profile that I'm doing
today and and apart from that which is very much related to my business I mean my my first real
interest in questioning things wasn't necessarily environmental or health which is it of course
today but it was a lot about war about geopolitics about selling the same stuff over and over again
always knowing why this war is good and this war is bad and never just saying that all of them are
just for power and we have to stop all of them and questioning these things was like was my gateway
into questioning society and and and economics in in total I have strong feelings about the
ongoing wars in the world today and I don't really focus on that on the podcast because I'm
talking about energy and nature and the great simplification and plus to go counter narrative
I mean the media and the intelligence communities within former intelligence community people in
the media it's a pretty strong narrative that in in every country there's a there's a war narrative
but it's if you fly up high enough and look down it's it's a very scary and very profoundly
disturbing situation US and Europe versus Russia is one what's going on in the Middle East is another
China you know is a longer term one but it seems like the people in power
war is good for for business and I don't know how to I don't know how to get out of that loop
but I feel that we have for the last 50 years or the last 80 years kind of
a frog and boiling water sort of thing we've gotten used to the fact that oh these wars will
never end up in something catastrophic but actually I think they might and I'm I'm really
hopeful that we can have some antidote to the building storm clouds on the geopolitical war
horizon my my own thing and I I know you at least temperamentally would agree with me I think the
antidote and this is going to sound woo is kindness and love and almost a Gandhi-esque
you know what Gandhi did against colonialism and and British rule if we could apply that in kind
of a Gaia sense globally against war and power I just don't know how to how to do that but I hear
you do you want to speak more about your thoughts there I agree with everything you said I would
maybe add conscious consciousness to that I mean
basically war is always about greedy old people telling the masses who to hate and telling young
mainly guys who to kill and so people end up killing people they've never met and they don't
know why so for me it's always like on a on a personal level if if you look at the media and
you have all those those those framed images about pure evil always look behind try to I mean
there is no no such thing as as neutral media but at least go to both sides if you say okay
if they say Putin Putin is like Hitler and he wants to overrun Europe because that's what
then CNN or the Guardian would write that's a that's a framed opinion a western framed opinion
so if you if you want to read that then also go to Russia today or Al Jazeera they're also framed
but at least you have the framing from both sides and then you can find your middle
and that's what I would recommend just always no matter which conflict listen to both sides and
don't let anyone make yourself hate anyone else that's very good advice I do that I learned in
the last two years how little I really know about what's going on so I'm super skeptical of of things
I read you know just as an aside Patrick one of the deepest intense emotions that I've felt
from a human perspective is when I go internationally to a conference or something I was in Saudi
Arabia a few years ago and there were people in the audience from like 50 countries from Brazil
and Pakistan and China and African nations and they didn't care I mean they weren't caring about
power or the war or status they were worried about the environment and climate and it was like
when humans from multiple countries get together and everyone's the same in most countries
the common people they like music and good food and a boyfriend or a girlfriend and security
and so when I watch these movies science fiction movies where there's an international space station
and there's collaboration between Russian cosmonauts and and the United States astronauts and it gives me
this maybe a naive feel and pull of what might be possible it is I agree these huge differences
if you bring people out of context out of the influence of their peer groups out of the influence
of their media of their where they work you you will always find much more things in common that
then things that separate you and I love the image of that there's a guy from Switzerland
he calls it in in in German he calls it Menschheitsfamilie so it means human family so I mean all the
borders we have today they were created artificially there's always fighting about which border is where
so how long it only depends how long you want to go back I mean do you go want to go back before
world war two and then Germany is bigger and France is smaller is that is that useful it's not or do
you go back 300 years or 800 years or if you go to 800 there is not even France same France has the
same origins as as as Germany so just making people realize that these nationalists ideologies
are really really small minded and that there is no no that there is no point in hating others
between because you have much more in common than you think I wouldn't say it's necessarily
everywhere I mean with my with my job I see a lot of things on this earth and I also traveled a lot
in in in personal terms and there are huge differences between cultures no doubt about it so
that's also the big topic of migration so how much is good in what in what in what kind of
tempo what can actually work and what are the expectations from both sides so that's a huge
other discussion which is getting more relevant for for politics these days but I feel that at
least with I don't know 90% of the people of other countries you can you can become very close very
soon if there is the right setting and no framing around so that that's what that's what gives me
hope to that we can somehow overcome these things and that is why also for example why I'm not such
a friend of the of the talking about okay people don't fly anymore because it's bad for the climate
yeah it's true but there are other things that are in in in total much worse for the climate but
all the people I know that travel a lot and by traveling I don't mean going to a five star hotel
and getting served at the pool I mean traveling most people have huge respect for other countries
for for social stuff for environmental stuff and this exchange is very very healthy whereas
when I talk to people who basically always have been living in the same village and never met
any other cultures outside they are very very close with regards to these topics so
there are two sides of the metal of flying that's what I want to say maybe oh there there's a huge
story there I'm going to do an upcoming frankly to fly or not to fly because I have strong opinions
on that because there's all there's what you said but then there's also the framing of the super
organism which is this metabolism that's not going to change until it does and my opinion is
we have to use the time and the tools in order to prepare for the future that most people are not
preparing for and change the initial conditions and had I not flown to Europe once last year
I wouldn't have met you we wouldn't have had this conversation and about 20 other people
as well but that's a that's a topic for another day so you come from a entrepreneurial family
you are an entrepreneur we're almost a professional athlete you invested as a young person in
restaurants etc what are you doing now what what is your job and what are your goals and values and
visions my my my mission is to be one one one bit of peace that is hopefully part of a bigger
solution and in terms of a job that that adds up that currently adds up to two things so one is
one is an impact investing company where I basically borrow money from my father's real estate
company in equity and I take that and I invest that in purpose-driven so-called impact startups
we can talk more about that and what what's working and what's not working and the other part is
charitable foundation that currently I was hoping it was would be over by by by the recording of
this podcast but it's not it currently is holding our family name because when we founded it like
seven years ago we didn't know what to do so we just took the family name but we want to
rename it which is not so easy in German bureaucracy but we're on it so I that and that foundation
basically wants to wants to fund systemic change so basically what I'm trying to do is I say okay
there is philanthropy will never be the answer to everything because philanthropy is only there
because first of all some people have too much money and second of all there are problems that
the system capitalism and politics cannot cannot cannot solve so there is currently a need for
philanthropy if it's done in the right way and the other part is the the for-profit world
you have to change that as well so showcasing that another business mindset is possible
and trying to accelerate that and make it normal so I'm trying to tackling to tackle those things
from from both sides and and with regards to the to the foundation in very briefly we have
we have five areas of funding where we are where we are supporting other organizations
so it was it was a learning journey when I when I started when I started the foundation and the
investment company I didn't know I didn't have any clue about investments or about philanthropy to
be honest so I was running around for the first year just asking people questions and found out
that many things in in so-called development aid as it is it was called in earlier days
didn't really solve the problem but were more likely to be part of the problem and so it evolves
over time so we changed what we do several times but the big picture is funding systems change which
for me means we have to empower people in the so-called global south I don't like the word but I
don't have a better one in English at least you could say less let less polluting countries that
would be the same so empower people to actually solve their own problems and find change makers who
actually live there who are in the problem and who want to solve it and usually have never any
access to any power structures to any capital and so we have four funding areas that target
that area the global south so one is reimagining education which is all about
the general problem of education that from my point of view as outlined by my own story
is is a huge part of the problem maybe the main part of the problem and not part of the solution
we can go to deeper into that if you want the second one is sustainable it's called sustainable
habitats which is about okay development for people and also for poor people has to go hand in hand
with environmental solutions which I see in general in in discussions also here
and in Europe it's always separated like the one one people talk about climate change and the others
talk about about the social stuff and then nobody talks about how how how bringing those of both
of them together and then they all wonder why there are right wing parties getting stronger and
why there are farmers protesting on the streets yeah it's because we don't bring these things
together so we're trying we're trying to think that when when we do that the other part is called
well-being economies which is basically about social business and all of these things so actually
people who are again solving their own problems with a business driven mindset so they can earn
some the organization can earn some money but the purpose of the organization is not to to to
become rich purpose if to solve the problem fourth one is called swift determined lives which is a
lot about about human rights about international trade about slavery which is still a huge problem
many people will allow say why why is he talking about slavery because in an in an official sense
slavery has been abolished in I think all countries but it's a it's a bigger problem that it actually
ever was so in this day and age right now there are different numbers between 40 and 60 million
people globally live actually live in slavery which is more than in the whole history of mankind
combined even taking into account the slave trading to the US so that's more slaves today than in the
mid 19th century yes there is more today than in all the human history combined added up until
like 100 years ago how do you define slavery yeah well I'm I'm not an expert on the definition but
there is there is there are there are many different forms I mean if you talk about that
then people always like okay so supply chain supply chains are not okay so that's not slavery
people still earn some money so the definition as I would point it out would be someone else is
actually controlling your life in all aspects there is no way to get out of that so I'll give you
I'll give you a very easy example of how it can work so in India I just you have the caste system
which is becoming stronger again as as the conservative Modi is pushing it because that's
where he's getting his his voters from and you have it's a huge nation but it's not it's a nation
built by built by the Brits but there are actually so many different tribes and languages and
everything so if you go to another state there's another language so what it what usually happens
for example is okay there is a there is a poor family they need let's say 50 it's actually those
numbers they need 50 dollars for an investment for school for their kids or whatever they borrow
that from a guy the guy tells them okay guys you cannot pay back but you can work it off
so he comes home takes the guy and his family puts them onto a truck or a train puts them into
the next state where they don't know anyone and where they don't understand the language and puts
them into a rice mill or a brick kiln or something like that and makes them work 16 hours a day
gives them only crabby food they sleep on the ground if it gets horrible there is sexual
violence as well against the women you can have all sorts of things unfortunately so they do that
for four weeks and they go back and say hey you said four weeks we can work it off so now we're
good to go right and he says no no no I paid for the transfer and you have been sleeping in my
brick kiln every day and I gave you food so you're rich that cost a lot of money so your original
loan adept was was 50 dollars now you're at 52 and with that easy system you have
actually families that have been living as slaves for four generations that have born and died
in these types of structures because their grand-grand-grand dad got a 50
dollar loan and it's not a it's not a unique thing it's not only India it's happening across
the world in in very very different areas it's um it's it's prostitution is a huge thing there are
many many different areas but don't those people have any recourse to figure out what you just said
and and get out of it or is there just nowhere to go usually there's nowhere to go they're from
the lowest caste so they have no classic education they don't speak the local language they don't
speak English so even if they go out they cannot even even if they if one manages to get away for
a half an hour he cannot even tell someone what's happening and then they're usually in these countries
there is not a there is not a police station and a working system like next door where you just can
go and say look my family is imprisoned and I don't you don't know my language but you get
someone from me who will translate when I heard about it at first I was also like is this really
possible but it's it's actually crazy it it goes even beyond that I'll give you another example
uh when you go for prostitution and and and sex trading there are actually
gangs who sent young girls around for example Europe they sent them to Ibiza to London to Paris
where always where the big events are they sent them in an airplane they go there they have to
sleep with 18 20 men per day and they go they go they go through customs they go through the airport
they're alone there's not no one standing behind them and and and pointing a gun to their head
but they have their family at home so they say if you don't do what we want your family will never
get back so how how do you define slavery I mean that person is for me how is that different than
when you work on a on a cotton farm and you have someone pointing a gun to your head in that case
the gun is just pointing to my family's head so there's no way out and and so we're working on
that as well as an example you you've made your point um so how so you just describe these four
categories is that the charitable foundation or the for profit one okay the charitable foundation
is is four categories in the global south and one focusing on Germany because systems change
means also as we as you know better than I do that we have to change a lot of things in the
global north so the fifth part is focusing on as we're German and we we're not a huge foundation
so we're focusing on Germany alternative education alternative economic education
alternative media so that's the fifth one and how is it going and what have been some of your
bright success moments and what are some of the challenges in attempting what I would describe
as a as a very coherent but difficult path the question is always where to start and where to
end I mean in the end if you're if you're funding others who do you fund so that's always that's
always the thing and when you when you start off you don't know anybody you're happy for any recommendation
and you just try and see what's what happens and then you get more experience then you kind of
get some feedback on what works and doesn't work and all of a sudden you get like
you get like emails every day from people who want money from you and you can give give it to
them so basically nine out of ten you have to say no all the time which is which is horrible and
which is the worst part of the job to be honest and and and and secondly and you have to come up
with I mean you call it theory of change but you can call it whatever you want so what is actually
what is actually driving change what can you address if you address topics in certain areas
while the right people to address it do you want to work with big NGOs who have a lot of people
and a lot of power and and and money and can influence things or do you want to work with
with the local guy from some village who wants to solve a problem that is just there do you want
to do you want to go the like I would call it the American way and and and and and look for
scaling all the time does everything have to have to scale is it good that everything has to scale
or do we need do you need local solutions so we we went back and forth on these things a lot
also in in how to work together with people because there is no way around there is a
huge difference a huge power imbalance imbalance if if there is some guy white white dude from
Germany giving money to people in Africa I mean that's the old cliche so that's not not something
you want to have so I'm also working on on that I want to I want to change that but as long as
this is the case you have to you have to try to actually create relationships because we don't want
to we don't want to give organizations money in return for nice pictures that we can post on
social media which is the classical development aid so you you you give money and those guys build
a school and then you have a huge a huge sign that says thank you xyz foundation and then you
have a picture of the school and you show that around in Germany is yeah you kids go to school
and then actually you see okay if you if you dive deep you say first of all who's running the school
there there's nobody is nobody's having teachers if there are teachers are they qualified if they
are qualified what are they teaching and is that of any use in that in that local community so are
the are those kids in that rural village in let's say Mali are they benefiting from what they learn
in school and are they able to get out of poverty with the skills they have there and if you honest
all of those questions you would have to say no so then you say okay what is what is different
what what what can we fund what can work and this is very on the other hand that's the challenge
because if you then need funders in in the west that that finance that and you have to explain all
of that you have to explain to them why why are we not funding schools because we all went to school
so education for us is always the same as school and in everybody's mind so if you say schools are
not a solution you have a you have a long shot of explaining and most people don't want explanations
they want easy messages so that's because you asked me about success and challenges I think I
would say the biggest challenge is that what's actually impactful and what actually makes a
difference takes a lot of time is complex to understand and is almost impossible to sell
to donors so and and can't necessarily be visualized or proven with pictures or whatever it's
something difficult and and and frankly the impact may be 10 or 20 years from now you're just not
going to see it right now it's the point the impact is always long term um there's a huge
discussion in in the whole non-profit sector about impact measurement and I can see why we also try
to measure it we try to follow up but the most important things you cannot measure I mean if you
want to give you a very easy example if you want to strengthen girl's self-esteem in a patriarchy
society how do you measure that you can of course ask them questions and and they give answers and
you can do the anonymous you can try but still what's the starting point what's the baseline what's
the target and and how do you define strengthening that self-esteem and that personality is it the
western standard like okay that girl has got a job maybe in the local culture the community
and the family is better so maybe the job isn't necessarily the right measurement so how do you
how do you do that and that's that's very that's very difficult and so from my point of view the
main thing is actually get build relationships with the people you're working with so that they
tell you about their about their failures if you have that as a funder then from my point of view
you're on track and from when I talk to many organizations that we deal with most of them
tell me that what they tell me they don't tell any other funder and then then it's back to the
power imbalance and that's a huge problem so when we met last summer I learned a little bit
not from you but from some of the people you're funding about one of your projects in in Africa
on food systems but could you either use that or any other example of specifically what you're doing
on the ground in some of these less polluting countries as you said well I'll give you two
examples I mean one for example would be we we support a social business in in West Bengal in
India and they work with local cooperatives of farmers decision makers are usually the women
and they bring it's a perfect example of bringing together eradication of poverty
while maintaining nature so for example take rice everybody in the world eats rice you have
basically three varieties of rice that are being eaten all over the world you have in India alone
hundreds of varieties original varieties of rice so that's biodiversity and of course it's it's
not nature but still and what they are trying to do is they say okay we we reintroduce all those
varieties of rice of lentils of spices of whatsoever we we teach we teach those farmers
how to grow them we keep the seeds there so you can have the next seed next year for free because
to grow them yourselves you don't need Monsanto or anyone else and then they say okay we we we buy
your products at a huge margin that you would never get at the local market but just the addition
like not everything because people should be self-sustained but the addition they they they
they they buy and then they go to Kolkata and you they distribute it in restaurants they have an
online shop they they do cooking courses to give people in the city the experience of what it's
actually like to cook local ingredients that are on the edge of of dying out so it's like bringing
the two worlds together so that's one very easy example and how does that protect nature you said
eradicate poverty and and biodiversity of food and protect nature well the question is how do you
how do you protect nature i mean you have smallholder farmers all over the world so in in
empowering them to to live a decent life without without without eliminating nature around them so
for example one popular thing is agroforestry so you plant trees in between your your crops
that you harvest most people don't know about it because they think okay i need i need a field
full of whatever full of coffee or full of mango and for whatever and and trees are just disturbing
in reality it's the opposite if you intercrop you get higher margins from that ground and you and you
have and you have trees in between that if you're clever enough you can also sell some carbon
credits for it and you have a different solution than how the carbon credit mark usually work it
usually works is like huge huge fields of monocultures so that's not nature i mean nature in
its original sense is always do nothing just that nature do but i mean that ship has sailed we
cannot just go back to that because smallholder farmers they will they will have they live and
we have to live so we have to find ways to combine both both in the in the best way and so
diverse crops combined with nature and no pesticides all all organic so from and and and
then taking that to educate people in the city because also in india people are much more related
still to from my point of view to to nature than we are in germany or in the us but also in cities
it's it's it's in cities it's the same thing they're losing it so yeah the the people and the
the hill tribes and the rural people they all have kind of different animus religions
of a real reverence for for nature i was surprised so have have you been to india do you
directly fund these people or do you fund someone who then in turn funds these these
organizations in that case it's the guy who founded it is is from india and he has a german wife so
okay they run a they run a company in a german non-profit and we give it to the german non-profit
and then they use it for their company in india and they do they do different things so we do
more things with them also plastic and so on so that's usually how it works but there are also
examples where we give it directly but usually i mean that's just but that's just tax law i mean
as as a german foundation if i give it if i give to a german non-profit from my german foundation
that has the the stamp for being tax-free i'm always good if i give it to someone in mali who
after maybe mali legislation is is non-profit i have to prove every little thing to the german
government so that's that's how you make sure that money the big money doesn't really go to
the people who need it but goes to big organizations well i wasn't so interested in the legalities
though that was interesting i was just wondering if you'd been to india and what your experience was
um yes i actually i've i've been two times to india and also to sch rilanka as they say locally
as far as i learned um i mean it's first of all india is not a country i mean it's it's a continent
it's very different depending on where you are southern part is very different than the northern
part um i found it amazing how much also in schrillanka how many how much people know about
food and about health it's like people here they go to the supermarket and then they get sick they go
to a doctor and take a pill i mean it's changing in our generation but that's how i grew up basically
and they're like they they they know every single variety of of any vegetable or whatever
they know what it's good for and how to prepare it that it does this and that in your body and i'm
like wow i mean this is this is how the world used to be so you um you were going to give a
couple other examples you gave the one on the west bangal farmers and and other examples of
what's your work what you're doing maybe i maybe i give one about education uh because that's main
main thing i mean um let let me let me just again clarify where i see the problem with
classical school education and then go to what can be a solution so the problem with classical
school education is first of all in in the global south it is that the ruling elites during colonial
times introduced school systems not to empower people but to control people and that's still
deeply rooted in systems apart from that very generally the same in the us or in germany um
when you when you are a child i don't know if you have a sister or a brother we never got into that
but if you have an older brother and he does things and your mother does things you see them
and you do them as well and then you make an experience and from that experience you learn
that's basically very easy how every human and every monkey and every elephant in the world
learns and that's precisely what a school never does a school there's someone standing in front
and telling you what to do he's telling you what to learn when to learn how to learn and he's judging
you on the way you have learned there is no room for exploration there is no room for failure there
is no room for experience there is no room for everything that makes humanity that has the
possibility to make humanity actually great and to use your empathy in your brain um so
classical education from my point of view is and there are many studies conforming this is designed
to build conformity and not unique explorative people so if you want to do it different
i mean it's there are tons of things you can do also within school but for example one example we
fund in in in in in the the company is based in mali or the the social social business is
his company is based in mali um they are using tutors from around the world to educate local
youth on on technological solutions so they take what's let's let's very easy spoken they take
what's good in the west to take on technological progress and they combine that with local indigenous
wisdom so for example um people in the sahara where it is quite warm uh they wouldn't they
would use local materials because they don't heat up so much then western civil civilization popped
in and uh they said okay we built from concrete so that gets very very hot so you need a lot more
energy for uh for the cooling and so they say okay let's combine those two let's go back to the
original indigenous knowledge that we have here and let's combine that with with it skills and
with 3d modeling and whatever and just make it more efficient in the local context and let's
let's empower people in that way to actually solve their own problem so and and the the
interesting thing i mean why do we fund that specific company they are called kabaku academies
if you want to look them up um the two founders one of them is is yannick and he came as a he
was born in kameroon um he came as a refugee to germany so it was the classical thing that we
always talk about um the the old son educated yes but classical education no chance for a job so
they sent him to to germany to europe so refugee made it all the way through god bless um learned
the language went to school here went to university made his degree made his dissertation
went to france became a professor at saubonne like one of the most prestigious universities in the
world and from his own experience he said okay guys i've done all of this almost no african has
the chance to go that way and the education they can get within their countries will will not lead
them anywhere and so i have to design something out of my own experience that helps people like
me that empowers people to actually solve their own stuff how might you term this like a inverse
colonialism or something like that where we're taking the energy surplus of western society and
uh after opening our eyes and our hearts realizing what's going on in the world and trying to help
in other places but there's an interesting thing there's like you just said oh uh let's build a
structure made out of concrete so that's what the surplus goes towards when in actuality the the
local methods that had been stable for a long time were fit for the environmental circumstances
in that place so is there um how do you how do you merge all those threads because um i'm i'm i
would guess that in a lot of less polluting countries in the global south they are aspiring
to the same what you and i would say is kind of a dead end path of um materialism culture of the
west is that changing are those cultures starting to recognize that they don't they don't need to
match the west they can have their own version of it and and be prosperous i don't know enough
about it to say but what are your thoughts i i also don't know enough about it but from what i see
i think it very much again depends on the context it depends on your on your peer group so um i
visited a rather classical development project last year i was in Ghana visited several different
things and one of them they were making like the classical stuff like okay we we um we give them the
possibility in a village to become either a hairdresser or or or a fashion close close making so um
um i was walking around and i when they didn't listen i i i asked all of those girls i mean
it sounds great because um they all they all have they have kids the guy is gone so they don't know
how to feed their family so they say okay we give them an opportunity to to have a to have
vocational training and to to have your own little business and the question is now because
that's what most people will tell you what what the great thing is go away from education go to
vocational training and then they will stay where they are and have a decent income so the question
is how many hairdressers and fashion people do you need in that village the market will be saturated
pretty soon and i i asked all of the girls and they all said yes at the moment my situation is
is better than before so that's good that's an impact the but but they all said i asked them what
is your what is your purpose what what what do you want to do do you want to stay here do you
want to go to the next town what do you want to do i asked seven of them six of them told me they
want to go to euro what are us and the seventh told me she wants to go to the next big city because
there she can she has more customers for her hairdressing so um if you uh it depends on the
context i believe that people can we can create environments where people can live in cities
and in the countryside um but the incentives have to change as long as we give incentives that only
work for the big cities and only for the richer cities and the rest is just nonsense and as long
as we take every projection for granted i mean people always talk when on these on these panels
i'm sure you have heard before several times you always have these projections how many people
there will be in 1000 in 2100 so it reaches between 8.5 and 11 billion i think in three scenarios
but all the scenarios say the same they all say that amount will will be living in cities
and that's why we have to make cities green and cities efficient and whatever nobody's even suggesting
to just create a world where people don't have to move to cities how can we empower people live
in the countryside they don't even ask the question and so from from that standpoint i would say if
you are talking to people in akra who are living in is who are who funded their own startup or
whatever you can have um very very self-confident uh people who say i don't want to go anywhere else
i'm i'm african i identify with this continent and with my country and i want to stay here and
build something but you have many many others who will who will follow um who will follow the other
path and also with the ones inside the city i mean you have television you have the internet
like everyone has a smartphone these days so um you can you can see the way we live and that is
just that is attaching i i i always think about you know you know the show king of queens uh
part of it yeah i mean basically what it's about it's a very overweight driver of a parcel service
with his rather good-looking wife and they are horrible with each other and it's funny but what
what's the main thing i i love the show because it was funny but when i grew older i was like okay
that guy is like complaining all the time how bad his life is he's not doing anything he's just
eating junk food and sitting in a truck for seven hours a day he drives a huge suv and he has his
own house and he considers himself kind of poor in in in the us i mean if you send that image
to someone who is living in the countryside in an african nation where you can there are
places where you have to walk for water for two hours it's still there i mean of course that that
creates a reality where people think wow how crazy is this i want that as well the concept of downward
comparison is uh is an important one uh we the problem is is that we upward compare to the people
that live on golf courses and whatever but we lack the ability to have visions of people
elsewhere in the world and in the future and in the past uh and non-humans for that matter let me
ask you a personal question so i know you a decent amount we're friends i know you your personality
and your work on social media you are quite outspoken on sensitive issues and confident and
you say what you think but how do you merge that with the necessity of of listening i'm sure when
you go to the global south um i expect that you are a very good listener and and absorbing and
taking time to hear other people's perspectives how do you navigate those two areas of your
personality and your work well mate that's why you're the host you ask great questions i'm not
always sure if i have great answers i don't know i mean learning to listen is is also a constant
process i think i was really bad at this for a long time i'm i'm trying to to do that more
not only i mean let's go away from the global south just within what i'm doing i have access
and i do that on purpose to very very different bubbles um like my father's company with real
estate very classical business mindset i have the the non-profit world i have with the impact
investing like the dudes who at least try or believe that they are part of the solution and and
a lot of a lot of these it's a separate topic woke woke stuff that i criticize a lot
and because i think it's it's the devil in disguise and and i cannot have that why is it
why is it the devil in disguise i'll i'll i'll give you a few examples on that last question
last sentence on the last one i think i'm i'm actually i'm i'm forcing myself to go to places
where i know that people will disagree with with my view and this is something i if i'm a good listener
i don't know i'm trying to be maybe maybe some other people will say i'm not i i don't know
you have to you have to ask the people who tell me stuff you you're consciously
waking up in the morning and on your to-do list is going places where you expect people will
disagree with you that that is something that you put in your routine that's quite something
not in my routine but i mean you can go to different events you can go to different
sorts of things you can go to the to the family office event where the billionaire is all about
my money and you try to convince him to invest it with impact then you can go to the to the retreat
where people all talk about old white men and racism and whatever and then you go to the
startup conference with you in in stock hall and and i mean what what you did in stock hall
in the conference like telling people who are in the impact we see world that they're actually
also not solving the problem i mean those people who went there i didn't i'm not i'm not sure if
they actually were aware of the fact that their reality would get shredded but it got so the
question is for them now will they do it again or will they next time just go to some place
where everybody's preaching to the believers and from my point of view that's the main problem in
the world inequality and people living in their bubbles not willing to talk to people who break
their worldview and that's that's the woke thing we can also discuss that yeah do that in a second
i just wanted to follow up and say i've gotten a ton of invites um and follow up from people in
the audience there who were in that situation that you're describing that want me to come and speak
at their event or whatever um i'm saying no to all of them but um still it the story the world
is converging on this reality patrick so you you wanted to give a few points on on why you're
critical of the of the woke um narrative well i i i guess i shouldn't do that because that will
cost me a lot a lot of sympathy but um i mean in in in economical terms the dominant force right
now is the whole left liberalism thing which from my point of view is nothing else than
neoliberalism with a with a green touch i mean that's your topic that's energy blindness that's
just painting painting something up that has been there forever and it's it's like funding a school
in less polluting country to take a picture of it it's exactly so you have you have that so left
liberalism means extreme inequality centralization of power and democracies um evaporating so uh
that's the platform economy that's um amazon you just you start with the cheap books and then in the
end you control the whole thing um and then you can do some carbon credits and then you're green
and then you do philanthropy and then it's okay so the the woke paradigm is like the social part
of it that's the cultural part of it um what i find very sad and i see that a lot in my LinkedIn
feed is that many people who follow that paradigm are actually good people they actually um have
seen problems such as climate change biodiversity loss usually it's ecological stuff and they say
we cannot keep going this way we have to change something and a lot of them are taking stuff in
their personal life decisions in their business uh founding ventures working on those problems and
i you can see that they are good people but they don't question paradigms and um i'll i'll give you
an i'll give you some examples maybe on that so this this whole divide and conquer thing is is
has been a popular method of um keeping people under control for a long long time now we have
technology that makes it much more easy you can easily create those bubbles and keep people in
in those bubbles and for example um what they address are in theory points that need to be
addressed so i've been talking a lot about um these these strange pictures of how we portray
people like you you in in in brussels you you still have a statue of king leopold who killed 20
million people in congo so people say how can we have that it's a war criminal you wouldn't put
hitler into berlin of course uh why not because hitler killed mostly white people they killed
africans so uh that the discussion about that is absolutely right and we need that and we need to
question our privileges and we need to understand our roles that we have i would never deny that
but the problem is how it is being done will lead to further division between people
and not uniting people so if you create the concept of the old white man i understand what
they are talking about because i am i am having a problem with what i say with old white men all
the time but is it helpful to create an image and where actually basically all all white men no
matter how old get the feeling that they cannot talk about certain things anymore just because
they have the skin color that's the opposite of tolerance and what's even worse that denies empathy
the woke paradigm is you can only play the role of a disabled person if you are disabled
you can only wear a rastafari if you're from Jamaica you can only whatever play the victim
of the holocaust if your mom is jewish whatever and that is horribly wrong because from my point of
one part of the success story of civilization is that we have empathy and we can we can feel
we can try to feel how other people feel in a certain situation that we have not lived ourselves
before we can never be a hundred percent there of course but where do you draw the line i mean
if you have a car accident and you broke your leg and your ribs are broken and the doctor tells you
oh one centimeter up and you're dead and i come to your hospital i know how you feel
and i can be i can be sad for you and empower you i don't have to have a car accident my own
so where do you draw the line at what point can you do you do you allow people to have empathy
and to be in somebody else's chair and where is the draw where you cannot do it and and that's what
they do very very extreme another i'll give you two examples i mean another one is the the equality
thing so when you listen to my as your colleague had to listen to my to my podcast to to get her
preparation for this podcast i mean i talk about i talk about equality all the time because the
inequality on a global scale between the people who who accumulate money capital and by that accumulate
power over others that's for me the main problem in the world that's the source of everything that's
going wrong so address that i would never say no but how is it addressed in the woke paradigm
they say okay there is there is a there is a difference between women and men and we have to
have equality so they would say for example in terms of maths we need as many women to do maths
as men nonsense equality is something totally different equality is okay you have different
strengths and by nature men and women are not the same it's not only culture they are different
and men are much more interested in things women are much more interested in people and in
relationships you can see that in every tv program who watches what and so when you want when you
talk about equality equality would be if for example in that example a a woman wants to become a
mathematician we provide circumstances that she can do it not that as many women are mathematicians
then guys and you can do the other way around with other jobs i'll i'll i'll give another example
that that that usually that's very extreme from my point of view and that shows
that parts of the discussion from my point of view don't address the right problem
so let's stick with the boys versus girls thing and go to the payment gap we all we all agree that
if you and i or no we're both guys if nadeen and i do the do the same job
we should get paid the same if we do it in the in the in the same good way
when you see look look about the discussion that ended up with with football this there's
megan rapino the the the us football player she's always like okay we have to earn the same
as the guys the national football team um so there are two things very very strange with that the
first thing is why is anyone being paid to play football that's that's the actual question i play
football nobody pays me to play football so in the current system there are people who are being
paid to play football why is that so because football creates a platform where people pay
money to watch the game and corporations pay money to advertise their stories and then
media companies pay for the for the viewing rights so that's if you so that's platform
that's our business model that we're living that's the platform economy so that value is the platform
so if i don't know if sky um pays two billion to show the man's football the the the man who
play that football can can get more from what's in there that's why they that's why they um get
paid more than women so if they get go to the same size they will earn the same size but the
the the the main question behind is how do we define value currently we define value with that
platform the real question is the pay gap many many women do jobs that are much more necessary
and healthy for society and the planet and they don't pay tate at all yeah the social the social
care uh and all of these things why do they earn less than the investment banker that's the real
question how do we define value as a society not why does a female football player in a platform
model this earn less you can explain that with two sentences but and that for me this is a perfect
example because there are discussions that sound good and that are totally wrong and that don't
even address the question because they are asking the right questions is why we're friends um because
you are really authentic and honest and don't say things just because they sound good you
you speak from the heart uh and I and I really value that um how do you man how are you managing
with all this how are you coping because you are taking it upon yourself to as you've been doing
on this conversation to tell uncomfortable truths and to invest in your time and uh the foundations
assets into projects that aren't mainstream uh and yet like me you're following along uh the
progress or the the negative progress of the world um in geopolitical climate um all sorts of
arenas how do you personally cope with with this burden um of all this well that's the big challenge
for all of us um when I when I look into um the founders I invest in with my company when I look
into the founders of the NGOs that we donate with the with the with the foundation the main problem
is that they all burn out um they are running for money all the time um they're working day and
night they have families they struggle so apart from the apart from the financing gap we have a
huge gap in terms of mental health which will be the main problem in this transitional times
that we live in and that will accelerate and also for me personally um I'll I'll be very honest here
I've been struggling a lot with that I mean um during the during the whole COVID uh thing
I got nuts now with with the media with regards to Palestine I've been to Palestine last year
I mean what mainstream media is showcasing and framing couldn't be further away from truth
Russia US conflict um what I personally do is I've actually stopped completely to follow
mainstream media that helps a lot and it's um I sometimes scroll through it so that I know
what other people talk about today but it's funny it actually happens so then there was a huge
earthquake somewhere so it's three days later I don't know it and people are really afraid that
they cannot keep up with the daily conversation but the daily conversation usually is very superficial
it's okay for me not to be part in that and if I miss an earthquake it doesn't change my life
and it doesn't change the life of the people who were living in the earthquake so just chill dude
that's that's one thing and I'm I'm trying to trying to work a lot on my on my mental health
on consciousness on with with different with different things breathing techniques and all
of that and trying to keep distance trying to um have friends that you just talk normal stuff with
not only the big stuff try to have fun still watch football although you know football is
an ugly business but it's your sport so watch it enjoy it and just ignore the rest go play do sports
so finding that balance um is is essential and I've not always been good with that I'm
I'm getting better over the last two years good um it seems like those of us working deeply in this
space kind of um want to reside in the um as uh Mark Gaffney would say and Zach Stein the post
tragic but reality keeps sucking us back to the tragic and we have to have self-care and some
routines to go back into the post tragic which is okay this is our reality let's roll up our sleeves
and and and do some some good so um by many definitions Patrick your life um might be considered a
privileged one from social and economic terms um growing up as you you did in Germany how do you
think that shaped your worldview and life path but more importantly what would you say to others
out there who um might have grown up and are in similar positions to yours now I think the
the worldview is heavily um heavily heavily shaped by the way you grow up and the older
you get the much you will the more you really if you're if you're a reflective person the more you
realize how much it actually was and um I can only go back to what I said before and go to people
who disagree with you and listen to them and talk to them and also learn and I'm also not good at
this but I'm actually trying to learn learn to have a discussion that you don't necessarily
need to win just for the sake of the discussion and for the argument I would say
accept that you cannot change everything in the world which was very hard for me
um
don't give up keep keep trying and and if you if you haven't started then start
many many people are in their comfort zones and I'm not saying to judge those if you have a family
if you have a job I mean cost of living especially in major western cities is getting crazy so you're
struggling all the time and you want to be you want to be a super mom and a super dad who's
taking care of your kids and work the 45 hour job and whatever and do sports and eat healthy
and organic so I know it's it's just it's overwhelming um and I get a lot of feedback
from people it's a strong feeling that many many people are not satisfied with what they're doing
and that they would like to be more purpose driven but they just don't know how to start
they don't know where um where the starting point is apart from maybe in personal life
not using a plastic straw or whatever and I think this is also why I think it's important I'm the
podcast like yours is inspiring people because it shows people who just started doing it different
I'm actually planning to do the same in Germany I'm planning to to set up a podcast in in German
because I think there's lots of content in English but not everybody is is good to go in English
with these topics and I'll be happy to come on but they'd have to be subtitles I'll I of course
you're on the list in a in a later stage when when I have 50,000 50 million followers then we'll
do it in English with Nate Hagan you'll never have 50 million followers I know there's a cap to
people that want to learn at this level about about this so so you know one of my upcoming
franklies is going to be a framework for philanthropy what philanthropy is doing right and what it's
doing not only wrong but unbelievably wrong with respect to the metacrisis sin and what we really
face you swim in that world do you have any pointers now that you have the microphone here on this
show like how might you transform the entire field of foundations and philanthropy to be more
aligned with the real crisis that we that we face that's not on the mainstream media
first of all I think philanthropy works kind of different when you talk about foundations like
US and Germany are very very different when it comes to the structure Germany is very very
conservative and people do what they know and and if you want to propose something new then
oh no that's too risky we don't do that I always ask myself okay you give away capital you already
have it you don't need it back you have the money if you don't take the risk who's supposed to be
taking the risk right so that's what I don't understand in Germany at all and the US is much
more and or also Britain they are much more risk-taking because the whole system is much more
built in in that mentality with venture with universities investing in venture venture capital
funds and all of this so it's it's it's more in the system they they from my point of view do the
mistake that they always think from a technological point of view they are educated in a way that
technology will solve everything it's a typical silicon valley thing so we can we can mess up
the world so let's just fly to mars and you had a you had a guest on your show recently which I
liked him a lot but I had to smile in the last part where he said that technology will and and
space and exploring that will will save the planet for me this is this a typical mindset and this
also goes into into philanthropy okay we have technology we will save that there is malaria in
in Africa okay what's the most effective thing to do get malaria nets out there there are many
many things why I would not do that because it's not working but it sounds as an easy scalable
solution so if you want to if you want to if you want to do philanthropy then it's hard work
in a in a sense that you have to actually again talk and listen to people that are
so-called below your power and you have to try to get on the same level to get honest feedback
and I don't think that the huge scalable program that can be rolled out all over whatever Africa
or South America or whatever is is the solution you have to question your own worldview because if
you come from the western worldview that essentially is killing the world as we know with the energy
and climate and everything so if you come with that mindset of the successful person
who shows others how it's done then you will fail and then you will be even even worse you will be
part of the problem you won't be even neutral you will be part of the problem that makes things
worse and that is what's happened a lot over the past 40 years were also state development aid
went went to other states which funneled corruption in those states in order to then
empower the your own country to build a factory there to get the resources very cheaply out of
the country so there are statistics to that how many billion dollars go into Africa each year
and how many go in development aid and how much resources go out so it's a huge profit
for the west it's not at all eight it's the complete opposite so if you want to if you
want to do it different then I would always suggest work with locals go deep and if you
want to you don't have to go to Africa or to South America you can also do it in in in your
home country then do the analysis of what is wrong before you build a school ask the question what is
wrong with education and what would good education look like and who who should benefit from that
and I think this step is not taken by many people who have been doing this for a long time your home
country or your hometown thank you for that this has been great Patrick I want to have you back
on and take a deeper dive on on some things but if you watch my podcast so you know I have
some closing questions for you for the average person who listens to this podcast probably
shares a lot of your same values and thoughts what kind of personal recommendations would you have
for someone who's aware of all these things and and trying to live a good life and and make a
difference at at this time of wonder and peril I would have to a little bit repeat what I said
two questions before because that's like just get started and if you don't if you haven't started yet
get started and if you have started take care of yourself love yourself that's I mean honestly
five years ago I would have never said something like that I think that that's an experience thing
maybe that there's there is something into it I understood why people say it and now that I've
experienced it I've understood I'm understanding it even better and this taking care of yourself
when you when you deal with complex issues all day and you always get the feeling that things
are getting worse every day no matter what you do the big picture as of today is getting worse every
day the Hans Rosling Gapminder Foundation he's pointing out that everything is getting better
it's just because he's taking single things and you can find a lot of single things that gets better
but the interconnected 10 foot pointer stick and he has a 10 foot pointer stick that I would love
that to be honest so so the big picture is getting worse every day and and if you if you see that
every day don't spend all your time on it and and take care about yourself because if you burn
out yourself then you cannot change anything for the better you you and I haven't spoken in a while
you you sound like you're one of my coaches that's what they're telling me exactly and I've I've
come some way in the direction of what you're just saying how would you change that advice to a young
human early 20s late teens who's becoming aware of all this stuff in Germany or in the United States
or in India or Australia or whoever's listening to this show first advice would be learn how to
cooperate I didn't learn that it's not being taught at school and it's not something in the
classical world where that is always telling you that competition is the answer so I think
cooperation is the answer and I think cooperation was a much better tool and was much more valuable
to mankind's evolution all over the world than we acknowledge so learn that and and build things
in a cooperative way from the beginning I didn't do that I also my my my things I'm doing now I'm
trying to improve that second thing is again going back to traveling I think it's absolutely
important to travel to other countries and cultures and learn different perspectives you will never
understand you will never understand that you have no idea whether what you're doing is actually
good or bad if you haven't experienced it from different angles and and and and and from that
comes except the fact that a solution that sounds really good and that maybe also is really good
in Stuttgart where I live in Germany might be horribly wrong in I don't know Udaipur
the world is not unipolar although people tend to believe that and media tells us that every day
that there's only one one worldview there are different ones and you have to understand that
and you have to understand that with your way of doing things forcing it upon others you will not
change anything I learned that the hard way to be honest what do you care most about in the world
Patrick I think this might sound a bit like the answer of one of those beauty contests where they
give the microphone to the girl and she has to say world peace because it sounds good but but to
be honest it's actually that peace and love it's it's stupid but that's the basis for everything
we will not solve any any crisis in the world if we don't get peace inside and from the inside
gets to the outside if we if we keep if we keep going to war no matter on what headline we will
go down as species we have to learn to love people that we don't know and that on first page are
very different than us and we don't understand where they're coming from and and the third thing I
would say we have to go back to the understanding that we are as mankind we are part of nature we
always talk about we are mankind and and then there is nature and then there are animals and we
also have to take care about them we are part of that we are not here without all of that we're part
of the system and I think everybody would say yes you are right if he listens to me but if you
look deep down into yourself who is actually feeling as part of nature and how disconnected
are we so peace love and be a part of nature it's not stupid at all my friend thank you for that
if you had a magic wand and could do one thing to change the trajectory of the future for people
and and the the planet earth is a one thing that you could do if your status and everything else
was not at risk so you mean I could snip and it's it's happening like really magic well I used to
ask if you were benevolent dictator and some people didn't like that the the the thrust of the question
is like what's one thing that would be leverageable even if it were physically impossible or politically
impossible at the moment that actually would result in a better future if we could do it hypothetically
might be boring for the listeners but I go I go back to peace again if you have if you have
peace all over the world then you have people who is who have it much more easy to have peace
inside themselves in the reality it has to be the other way around we have to peace find peace
inside yourself then it will happen on the outside but if I can dictate it or with a magic stick I
would say okay from today no more weapons no more violence nothing not none all of that and I think
that would change drastically the way we we deal with each other and it will it would empower solutions
that cannot be done right now I fully agree with that with the exception of violence and outgroup
war is part of human history yes so I don't think we can exercise that from our phenotype
but what we can do is change the software that our human culture is using now to minimize that
aspect of our nature and I don't know how to do that but I agree with you it's important
yes totally totally fine it just has so many it has so many implications on other fields
I once give you an example when you go to a Friday's for future whatever climate protest
you always hear the same things you hear the bashing for the SUV drivers and the meat eaters
and that's all fine and the the planes have you ever heard anyone protesting against against
military we are raising military budgets all over the world like crazy and I've once read
a statistic where they asked what is the biggest single organization in the world
uh to emit carbon it's the pentagon it's for sure it's war and nobody's talking about it
and so that's what I mean it's not only not only don't kill people anymore it has so many
implications on so many other areas so the United States and the allies in NATO versus Russia
account for 80 percent of the military spending in the entire world out of all the 180 countries
or whatever that's a whole other podcast so this has been great if you were to come back my friend
is there one topic that you feel extra passionate about that you would be willing to take a deep
dive that is relevant to the human predicament and the coming decade well I feel what we haven't
covered so much today is the other part that I do is the impact investing part and that goes back
into how do we finance change in a for-profit world with the incentives that we have I mean
that's where you are a much bigger expert than I am with your with your background but um talking
about those structures talking about um those like okay the green the green companies financing
with venture capital and exits that are then being being bought by billionaires or corporations in
order to change them that whole dynamic I think is also a Trojan horse I'm I'm part of that and
I'm trying to figure out alternatives such as steward ownership so all of these things um
because they are really really relevant we talked about Stockholm about the event there are so many
people god bless there are more and more people who want to finance transition
and most people only look at the what and not on the how and and the how might be the one that's
actually deciding if that transition is going to happen and to quote you if we bend or break
so that's maybe something we have to go deeper into maybe well let's do a round table on that
thank you so much for your time and for your work
Patrick do you have any closing words of wisdom or reflection or advice or anything for the viewers
I would say um don't be scared um if you see a problem raise your voice
um people will hate you but many of them two years later will see that there was a point just go
through it um zoom out if you want to if you want to look at things don't get irritated by the whole
expert discussion that we're having only experts can talk on any topic no um the real brains of
our lifetime like Da Vinci and Einstein and all of this they were interested in all sorts of things
and they were brilliant in one specific area if you want to understand things you have to
zoom out and not more and more zoom in and block everything that's not progress and the third thing
would be unite I mean don't don't get separated from other people most people are better than you
think and they are just victims of the propaganda and the and the and the and the education we live
so don't don't look for the differences um look forward unites you and what you can do together
that brings you forward and if there are two other topics that you don't agree with because
he's pro vaccination and you're against or whatever don't let that separate you there's still a lot in
common thanks Patrick I really appreciate this conversation to be continued my friend thank you
