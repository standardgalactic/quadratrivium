people have a hard time understanding time but also scale you know and you know the scale of the
universe or and so on it's it's very difficult so I don't I often use phrases that people don't
relate to because I'm thinking of a completely different different time frame but I really
do think we need to think longer term so a lot of the politics of today are talking about 2030
or 2050 but are humans planning to be around in a thousand years at 10,000 years you know
we need to have a look and see what we when we're thinking about those time frames rather than
overreacting to things that are happening today and and we need to understand probably a lot more
about the way that the earth functions which it does over a longer period of time and things happen
on the earth what natural things happen that are a threat to humans a lot of which we've not seen
yet but will happen if we're around long enough so we and we have a basic problem communicating
not just as geologists but scientists I mean for example in in we would often if we're just talking
socially we'd say glacial meaning something that happens very slowly but in geological terms glacial
is one of the fastest processes that we have you know so it just it just can it can be confusing but
I think we do need to start having a longer term viewpoint of the world as well as just a short
term one and that's really what what we wanted to talk about today was you know what is the role
of all of these components and and particularly with my background I know a lot about fossil fuels
and I particularly wanted to make the point that all right you know we we can't just stop using
fossil fuels they've been an enormous benefit to humanity to this point and and I know Nate that
you have spent a lot of time trying to educate people on how fossil fuels have gotten us to this
point you know and and it is shocking really how little people who've been around for 30 years know
about energy and where it comes from
