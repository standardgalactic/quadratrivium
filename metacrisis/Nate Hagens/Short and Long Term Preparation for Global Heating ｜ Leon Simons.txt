I think the climate won't stop warming in the year 2100, and I think one of the implications
of Hansen paper where you were a co-author is the earth system sensitivity to a doubling
in CO2 is now based on your research much higher than is conventionally accepted.
That if we double CO2, there's a transient equilibrium and an earth system effect after
all the feedbacks are measured.
If we only care about the transient one because that's when we and our children are alive,
we're neglecting what happens to all the other species and ecosystems and the human
species thousands of years from now.
I agree on that, but I think most people don't care about that much, and if you want to take
that into account, if you want the long term effect to be less strong or less bad, it's
also important for people to understand that the near term effect is likely much worse
than most think, right, because most don't know about these aerosol effects.
It's like in a cop in Dubai, very few people were talking about it.
People are blind, very blind to this effect because they don't know well if this could
impact the overturning circulation.
They don't know that this could cause really rapid warming where they live themselves in
a very near future.
If people would know, they might, I don't know, but they might get their shit together
faster.
