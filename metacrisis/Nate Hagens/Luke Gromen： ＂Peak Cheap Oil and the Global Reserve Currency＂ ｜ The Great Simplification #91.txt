The political power has resided with the debt merchants, the exporters of debt. You know,
who has won in the last 40 to 50 years in the system? It's been the exporters of debt,
which is Washington and Wall Street. And they still have a lot of power. They're not going to
want to hear this. I'm pleased to welcome Luke Gromen to the great simplification. Luke works
in the financial industry. He founded Forest for the Trees LLC, where he advises clients on the
macroeconomic energy integrated scenarios that affect the global economy.
I worked on Wall Street 20 years ago, and I have found very few Wall Street-minded people
that integrate the centrality of energy to our profits, our expectations, and the implication
of peak-cheap oil has for growth at our institutions and the way that our currencies work.
Domburg, Kiril Sokolov, upcoming is Lynn Alden and Jeremy Grantham. Luke is one of those people
that is integrating peak-cheap oil and energy with 10 to 25,000 hours of human labor per barrel of
oil. I think without understanding this, we can't see the big picture. He and I talk about
currency reform due to energy decline, and what is going to happen to our financial system in
the coming decade is at least as urgent to be discussed and planned for as the ecological
crises we face. Please welcome Luke Gromen. Luke, welcome to the program.
Thanks for having me on, Nate. It's great to be here. I'm excited to talk to you.
You might be asking, and my viewers might be asking why you are on a systems ecology podcast,
and I'll tell you because at the core of how the human ecosystems function is energy and finance,
and you are one of the few financial professionals that I've come across that
from my systemic lens gets what's going on, and I think for the environment and for governance and
for energy transition and where the society is headed, we need to understand the interlinkages
between the energy and money, and I know you and your organization force for the trees have been
articulating this quite clearly. Can you just start off with maybe giving us a longish elevator
pitch of you and your organization's worldview with respect to the current global financial
situation? Yeah, absolutely. I think the easiest way to simplify it is in the absence of an energy
productivity miracle, which is a phrase we use a lot. It's something we can touch on and what
exactly that means. Said energy productivity miracle could take multiple forms of varying
degrees of either pleasantness or unpleasantness, which again we can expound on. The bottom line
is the debt backed fiat currency system as it has been structured and existed since 1971 when
Nixon took the US off the gold standard. In our view has reached exhaustion for energy, for
peak cheap energy, peak cheap oil in particular reasons. I'm going to read a quote to you that I
think perfectly summarizes it. This quote was written in 1980 by the chairman of the Bank of
International Settlements, Yelzilstra, and it said that second oil crisis could be worked through
slowly, but the international financial system could not survive a third oil crisis. The inflation
would make it impossible to recycle the petrodollars to the oil importing countries with any hope of
repayment in real terms, in oil terms. Trade would crumble and the system would be brought to its
knees and so at its core peak cheap oil in our view means we are now in that third oil crisis that
the system as structured cannot survive in its present form. I would break the world and we
look at the world in to break the world into into three basic categories of nations. You have
energy importing, US creditor, nations, or regions so within that Japan, China, Europe, some others.
You have energy exporting US creditors under the post-71 system so OPEC, Russia historically.
And then you have the US who runs twin deficits and whose job is to essentially supply the dollars by
running ever bigger deficits to this system. The problem that peak cheap oil introduces to this
system is that as we are seeing the marginal cost of global oil supply so over the last 10 years
90% of global oil production growth has come from US shale so US has become the marginal
producer of oil. It is high cost and critically the geology of shale is such that the Dallas Feds
surveys have been showing pretty consistently from the producers they survey down in the Permian
and elsewhere that they need 8 to 10% on average growth in the price of oil in terms of their
break even so their break even price rises by on average 8 to 10% in recent years.
Because that's because they have to dig deeper and more complicated technology just to keep
technology up with depletion they have to increase prices 8 to 10% a year.
It's depletion it's the red queen problem as I'm sure you and many others in your pot so
basically the red queen is running at 8 to 10% per year in terms of what they have to increase
the price of oil to outrun the red queen the the depletion the decline rates in shale the cost
of oil service equipment etc etc. The problem within that is the US government cannot afford
anywhere near 8 to 10% interest rates on its $33 trillion in debt that that would imply so basically
we are now at a situation in the global monetary system as a result of what has been by far the
biggest marginal producer of oil in the world over the last decade which is US shale energy
exporters globally that first group I talked about would have to be stupid to be blunt to store
surpluses that they earn in dollars in US treasuries at rates that are not compensating them at the
rising cost of the marginal barrel of oil right if if the marginal barrel of oil is rising 8 to
10% per year and treasuries are paying them 4.3% right now at the tenure they're better off leaving
the oil in the ground with with one exception maybe is that treasuries are more liquid than than oil
and things in the ground uh yeah all all else equal um yes all else equal uh but even then
if they if they dig out or if they they produce oil sell it store those surpluses in treasuries
at some point they are going to reach their own decline or depletion problem and they are going
to have a pile of treasuries for them to go out and rebuy the oil that they just sold to the world
and it's going to buy them a lot less oil than than than what they shipped so basically yes in
the short run in financial market terms yes in the long run that as you're managing a country
as you're managing the sustainability of your FX reserves uh if you're a politician in these places
and you don't want to have a very bad personal outcome for you and your family you have to start
thinking about this problem so it's it's a problem for the energy exporters for the energy importing
creditors who have historically stored treasury bonds treasury bonds were kept relatively fungible
relative to the price of oil in other words if i was china if i was europe if i was japan i did
trade with the united states i ended up with dollars i bought treasury bonds those treasury bonds i
could rely on within a range to keep to maintain their purchasing power in oil terms over time
because when you look at europe when you look at japan when you look at china they are creditors
but what are they short their short energy and more broadly some other commodities so this this
problem affects them too they they can no longer store their wealth earned from surpluses in trade
with the united states in treasuries because they will find themselves short oil over time
for the people that understand what you just said this is pretty frickin horrifying the implications
it's a mexican standoff because the united states can't let rates go to eight to ten percent either
because we let debt get too high because we did a bunch of really you know we spent a lot of money
over the last 20 years um and didn't get a whole lot out of it so yes we are in this the third oil
crisis that zilstra wrote about in 1980 it's here it's here now uh it's a mexican standoff and it
has to result in major systemic change in some way shape or form and as i said that can be pleasant
or unpleasant depending on how things go from here so you and i just recently met um and to tell
you just a little bit of my history i worked on wall street i was at salomon brothers and
liman brothers and looking at credit markets and fixed income and commodities and then i
kind of had an environmental epiphany and i the last 20 years i've been working on systems ecology
and environment and human behavior and anthropology and and systems but my brain still remembers
you know wall street times so it's really refreshing to me to hear someone who understands
finance but also is using words like peak cheap energy and the red queen and um you know i i'm
likening i'm i'm terming what's coming as a biophysical phase shift which is where society
used to measure our wealth and our our future prospects pretty much solely in a money and
technology sense and now its energy and ecology and commodities are going to be primary and that
has a massive implications for a world that measures our wealth in papers and digits um
so yeah keep keep going so when you that's exactly how we're looking at it as well right so
historically you had you had you had energy and you had uh trade and you had the dollar in the
middle right so you had these surpluses dollar energy and and everything flowed through the dollar
and and the treasury market as a storage of dollars for future energy purchases and so what
you're watching happen what you've been watching what been watching happen since shortly after
the great financial crisis has been the arbitraging of uh basically the cutting out of the middleman
the arbitraging of this situation right where started with china and russia so china is looking
at this situation and you can see it by their actions they're going why am i going to store my
wealth and treasuries for future energy as i get these dollars coming in from trading with the united
states that makes no sense for a number of different reasons number one as we just talked about the
geology of us shale as biggest marginal oil producer over the last 10 years by far simply is not
conducive to treasury bonds maintaining their purchasing power in terms of the marginal oil
barrel so basically i'm going to not my oil my my the i'm never going to uh my treasuries are never
going to buy more oil on average than they do right now they're not going to be able to rise in value
relative to oil on average in the future so why store them in treasuries you know what i'll do
instead i'll take the dollars and instead of buying treasuries i'm going to cut the middle man out i'm
going to cut the americans out i'm going to go straight to katar and i'm going to say sign me a
27 year deal on gas i will i will commit to buying gas at this price for the next 27 years i will take
these volumes take or pay here's the dollars boom uh we saw it as as soon as i mean 10 years ago you
can find a story from late 2013 how china came to control an opec country's oil by 2013 the
chinese had signed so many of these forward deals dollars now for oil in the future from ecuador
they controlled like 70 or 80 percent of oil of ecuador's future oil production until the mid 20s
so basically you saw china go wow there's a problem peak cheap oil's a problem how do i fix this
problem there's a number of different ways to do that but one way you do that is you stop storing
your surpluses and treasuries and instead you cut out the middle man and you you do the deals directly
with the commodity producers for future supplies of oil that introduces other issues you have to
manage hedge etc but that gets rid of your primary issue which is your china you have a
bunch of treasuries you wake up one day and suddenly your treasuries that you thought were going to
buy you 100 barrels of oil now buy you 50 barrels of oil or 40 or 30 and you have a serious political
problem on your hands and in fact china has been selling off their us treasuries recently yes uh
they haven't bought an incremental treasury since 2011 i mean i'm sure they've bought and sold but
on a net basis their treasury portfolio has not risen um since roughly 2011 or 2013 something
depending on how you measure it so things are maturing and rolling off and they're not adding
and they're not adding and instead they're deploying those funds into things that will
much better store value in energy terms whether that be oil supplies refineries ports
gold etc well the other shooting ourselves in the foot is when we froze all the russian assets
good or bad that sent a signal to the world market that whoa maybe holding our savings in
us treasuries isn't as safe as we thought i think that's exactly what the message was and i i think
um there are elements within the united states that saw that as a good thing uh ultimately
there are interests in the united state govern the united states government that also see this
problem that china's been addressing by basically cutting out treasuries which is to say uh
the us the way the system works ends up driving a form of dollar dutch disease for the united states
and you know dutch i don't understand what that is so dutch disease is an economic term that is
used to describe what happens when a country suddenly finds itself in position of vast
natural resource wealth after the netherlands with i think it was probably the the groeningen
field back in the fifties but basically oh my gosh we found this giant source of natural wealth
and as a result so much of the attention wealth development etc goes to
commercializing and developing that source of wealth that all of the other industries
in the country atrophy and die off and go elsewhere and so it was termed dutch disease but
you see it very regularly across a number of different opec nations nations with natural
resource wealth where you rarely see it described is in relation to the dollar in the treasury market
but to the extent the united states as the ft said it four years ago the united states is the
saudi arabia of money we're the saudi arabia of dollars we can print well what has happened as we
became the saudi arabia of money we got dutch disease we don't manufacturing anything anymore
our defense industrial base withers on the vine and so there are interests in the united states
typically around the defense and intelligence communities that realize the dollar and treasury
markets system as it has evolved over the last 40 50 years is no longer a one-way street positive
for us national security because ultimately in a war you can't throw dollars at people you can you
know you can wad them up and throw them as hard as you can but you're probably not going to kill
them with that and that's what they're seeing in in ukraine right now well in a war or just in a
a smaller world where we need local and regional supply chains and need to produce our own things
you can't throw dollars at that you need factories and machinery and skills and for that you need
energy yeah yeah and for that you need energy so i want to get to the the currency thing in a minute
but let me ask you a couple more questions sure clearly clearly when you go to conferences and
you're very financially connected people understand that oil and gas and energy are important but i
don't think too many people yet understand that energy is the currency of life and underpins
the entire edifice and you often write that a barrel of oil has 25 000 man hours of labor in it
i would handicap that i say 10 000 because we're more efficient at at getting the muscle power but
still it's like years of our work is in a barrel of oil so how many people in your industry understand
that like that energy is fundamental to society in our past and in our future it's a good question
it's a minority i mean it's still a severe minority but it's getting it's getting less
because of ukraine maybe i think that's a big part of it i think as a part of it where you're
seeing this this recognition our GDP was i don't know how many times bigger than russia as we measured
however the russian's gdp was energy and producing weapons and like not a lot else and ours was a lot
of like selling houses back and forth to each other at ever higher prices and selling stocks and
bonds back and forth to each other ever higher prices and when you get into a crisis a war it
boils everything right down to the essentials and what we're seeing is the russians are able to out
produce us they're able to out manufacture the mighty united states in part because of this
dutch disease this deindustrialization that's taken place around the dollar over the last 50 years
we are uh really complacent as a nation are we not oh yes absolutely so from an energy perspective
that we can print money but we cannot print energy only extract it faster
wouldn't a wise longer term outlook uh visionary government try to keep our own oil in the ground
and print dollars and buy other people's oil yeah you would think that they would
um there have been those that argued some of what we did over the last 50 years was a version
of exactly that and i think there's something to be said about that i would say that generally
speaking the leadership that was in power during that during the cold war i would say is far wiser
than the leadership we have had over the last 25 to 30 years i also think if we use that lens
it gets really interesting when you say okay what changed that all of a sudden we started producing
our own oil again instead of you know if everybody still loved the dollar the same way and nothing
had changed around the dollar why would we ever produce our own oil well shale when we could still
print as many dollars as we wanted and bought everybody else's oil unless that had started
to change globally and i think some level it started to i mean to be clear i think it was
largely a market free market reaction in terms of the the the technology with long laterals
steerable laterals in the shales the high price of energy the low cost of capital with the fed
cutting rates with that said if you go back to the 70s you can read different documents where
there was a recognition uh by kissinger and some others around kissinger that once us oil peaked
in 1970 for the first time in terms of production that they were dangerously exposed to opec and
the soviet union in terms of us oil imports going forward and geopolitically it made sense
to diversify and hedge that well how do you do that there is a recognition you can read in various
history books and declassified documents etc from state department that there was an understanding
that if you remove the gold backing of the dollar you weaken the dollar enough you send the price of
oil up in dollars enough you will make economic basins that were with a gold back dollar
uneconomic basins such as pruto bay uh alaska such as uk north sea such as deep water gulf of
mexico canarelle etc so there was a recognition amongst certain us policymakers that weakening the
dollar to increase the dollar price of oil as a geopolitical hedge and diversification to
reduce us dependence on opec and russia uh in the 70s there was a recognition of that so there's
it's a lever people don't often think about uh but i i think when we had wiser policymakers i
think they did think about it well i i like to refer to our culture and our policymakers as energy
blind and let's let's move on to to brix and russia and china it was just announced that that i ran
and um other countries that um uh ua e that our oil not only oil producers but oil exporters have
joined brix plus uh or whatever you term it i'm not sure i sent you this chart i made earlier uh
in the week but if you add up all the countries now in the expanded brix it accounts for over 50
percent of the exportable oil in the world not the production but what's left after internal
consumption is is accounted for and so the barrels of oil that are purchasable in the world 50
percent or 51 percent is from russia saudi arabia uh etc so does this longer term um spell uh some
biophysical phase shift in the reserve currency situation or what what do you think this means
if anything so i think we are watching real politic happen ultimately and what i mean by
that is china is the biggest oil importer in the world uh china is the biggest trading partner with
the gc the gulf nations the gcc nations and with russia um and with basically everybody for that
matter uh china has an energy uh shortage problem if you look at the system as it is currently
structured and what i mean by that if we can go back four years uh kyle bass gave an interview on
i think it was either hedgerow or cnbc but the point was this china's got a finite fx reserves in
dollars china needs to import oil and other commodities to a lesser extent in dollars
china's economy is growing the price of oil is rising and so as the price of oil rises
that consumes dollars fast finite dollars faster as china's oil demand goes up to support
their growing economy and their growing debt the the supply of dollars goes down faster
ultimately oil imports if they're only in dollars will cause china to run out of dollars once they do
they have to shrink their economy shrink their oil imports that is a catastrophic economic outcome
catastrophic political outcome that would look very much like the southeast asian crisis in the
late 1990s massive devaluation of the yuan uh great shrinkage in chinese living standards
political problems etc that is a non-starter for the chinese communist party so how do they get out
of this there's a couple ways they have been managing and getting around this for at least 10
years now closer to 15 years or more number one as we talked about before instead of storing
dollars in dollars in treasury markets you begin going straight to the source and you sign long-term
supply agreements with the actual producers of energy step two you start building a military
and defense capabilities that prevent the united states navy from cutting off your oil supplies
they have done that with nuclear hypersonic missiles um uh to basically keep the straits of
malacca open and then the third thing you do is you begin working toward buying oil in your own
currency you and and arranging trade uh arrangements now who's going to trust the yuan not a lot of
people 10 15 years ago what are they going to do with the yuan if they get it and when i say they
oil surplus nations what will oil surplus nations do with yuan 10 15 years ago not a lot there's
only so many plastic trinkets they can buy now high quality 5g plus suave equipment infrastructure
uh nuclear power plants weapons there's a lot that china has moved so far up the value added curve
what i think we are watching evolve with the bricks is a system where oil china will have
the ability to buy oil and yuan and other commodities when they want to the resulting yuan
surpluses at oil importing nations which like you just said having joined the bricks uh with over 50
percent of oil global oil exportable oil some of them will end up with yuan surpluses when they do
they can use those yuan to buy chinese goods why way 5g equipment that's nuclear power plants
that they can then use to build desalination blah blah blah things to improve the living standards
for their own people gasp wow um to the extent that these energy uh exporters buy what they need
from china in terms of goods to improve the living standards and infrastructure of their
countries and still have yuan left over as sometimes happens depending on the price of
oil etc china has facilitated the settlement of surpluses yuan surpluses in physical gold
in shanghai in hong kong in london uh and while nobody trusts yuan everybody trusts gold
halin greenspan said the only currency that's better than the dollar in 2014 he said was gold so
i think we are watching this system evolve before our eyes and as such i think
bricks is a center or a proxy for that and as such i think these nations joining the bricks
i think is a very important signal in terms of the willingness to engage in this multi-currency
energy pricing net gold settlement system two-part depressing question uh part one how
do we navigate the next decade without currency reform and part two how do we navigate the next
decade without a global war uh when all the things are going on that you just said currency reform i
don't see how it doesn't happen there's going to be one way or another currency reform not only is
it going to come it's already happening when you we have a chart we've showed clients before i've
put it on twitter before 2014 um in 20 in late 2013 the people's bank of china came out and said
it's no longer in our interest to grow holdings of fx reserves it was basically china saying we're
done by growing our holdings of treasuries this was 2013 since that moment we have seen us holdings
of treasuries by global central banks declined by almost 600 billion dollars which is unprecedented
going back holdings central bank holdings of treasuries never fell for the 50 to 60 years before
2014 since then they are down about five percent uh it's about 600 billion dollars gold has gone up
300 billion so i we are moving towards that i think currency reform will happen it is happening uh a war
i'm optimistic that it won't happen simply because of mutually assured destruction and right we're all
i mean if there's anywhere we're all screwed so let's avoid it at all costs yeah absolutely and
i the sense i get when i talk to people in um the military and intelligence communities in the
united states i think there's absolutely an understanding of that you hear the bravado and
the rah-rah and the from certain people in public areas about well we've got the best military and
they can't stop us blah blah blah when you sort of have quiet moments with uh serious sober minded
military intelligence professionals they admit that there is absolutely a level of mutually
assured destruction not just from a military standpoint but from a financial market and
you know standards a living standpoint right i mean they it it would be horrifying
i fully agree with you i hope you're right i think the military uh intelligence people do get it
it's the state department type of people that i worry about um so um on on the one lens everything
you just described makes me incredibly bearish on the u.s dollar um and our standards of living
but on the other hand we're 90 energy independent we import some oil but we we are abundant in coal
and natural gas we're growing renewable energy europe and japan and other countries are do not have that
bio physical underpinning so the u.s dollar is bad but i can't imagine another currency that
would replace it unless unless it's something bio physical like gold or land or energy s drs or
something like that what are your thoughts on that i think you described it very very well which is
is peak cheap oil is going to force this bio physical issue you're already we've been seeing
russia and china in particular others central banks acknowledging this de facto by how they
have rearranged the deployment of their surpluses they've stopped moving them out of sovereign
debt and they've moved them into gold and hard assets and that could even include equities etc
the paradox of the way the dollar system is set up which is that there's a lot of dollar
denominated debt outstanding as you move to multi currency energy out of necessity as china does
this out of necessity you're going to be created so there's a huge over overhang of dollar
denominated debt that needs a constant supply of dollars to service right because every year you
got interest so you need more dollars to service that all else equal there is a monstrous bid for
dollars which is an oversimplification but just for illustrative point prefer illustrative purposes
as you start shifting small amounts of the global energy trade away from almost all dollars to
some yuan some euro some yen etc you're going to effectively as that oil comes out of the ground
and is paid for in these other fiat currencies you're basically creating new supplies of these
fiat currencies so you're increasing supply of yuan we'll just we'll just use that one but there's
not a monstrous bid for yuan there's not a lot of yuan debt outstanding in the global markets so
yuan supply up not a lot of demand what happens to yuan it goes down flip side to the extent you
divert a small amount of of energy production away from dollars into yuan you're going to shrink the
supply of dollars just a little bit doesn't have to be a lot hasn't been a lot however there is a
monstrous bid monstrous demand for dollars from the install base of dollar debt as the system
has evolved over the last 50 years so as paradoxically as you move global energy pricing away
from the dollar it actually mechanically drives the dollar up against these other currencies right
smaller slightly smaller supply of dollars huge demand demand up supply down a little price up
and vice versa for yuan yen etc and so we've been seeing some elements of that in the way
things have traded now ultimately the it is very bearish for the dollar and for our living standards
barring this energy miracle because of what we started describing right which is or started the
podcast by discussing which is these foreigners are no longer financing our deficits when we
talk about foreign central banks not having bought treasuries for almost a decade now
uh the u.s. debt in that decade is up 11 or 12 trillion dollars so ultimately the fed has
to print the money to pay for these deficits and that causes a weaker dollar in the long run
this is why my dad when i was 13 told me where babies came from but did not tell me where money
comes from because it's so labyrinthine to understand all this money comes from commercial
banks giving loans and now governments deficit spending so let me put this together there the
foreigners china and other places are more reluctant to hold and invest in treasuries
given the logic that you described at the same time the united states has to deficit spend more
for entitlements and covid relief and all kinds of holes and mouths to feed in in our economy etc
so we're borrowing more money how does it work when we have done all this the last 15 years with
relatively low interest rates you said that we've grown our debt 11 trillion dollars in the last
decade so not only we doubled our are almost well a 50 percent increase in our debt but now
what if rates go up what if rates go to four five six seven percent what does that mean look i think
that factors into the decision tree that our creditors on both the that we described before
the energy importing creditors and the energy exporting creditors i think that's factored into
their logic of ceasing to buy treasuries they don't have the well rather than say they don't have
they have the luxury of not having to run a portfolio that's marked a market on a monthly
basis or quarterly basis so they can look out and say and ask that very question how is the
u.s. going to afford this and the answer is either the united states when you look at what we spend
all this money on the reality is there's only there's only three things big enough to cut it's
entitlements so we're spending call it 60 almost 65 percent of treasury receipts record treasury
receipts by the way on entitlements defense about another 25 percent of record receipts
and then incredibly in the aftermath of the fed hikes we're at about
30 percent on a pro forma basis of treasury receipts is going to go to interest
as a result of the fed rate hikes and that hasn't fully reset yet so by the time all
said and done it's going to be closer to 40 percent so after that everything else we spend money on
drops off dramatically so the point is is that if the u.s. has two choices if as rates have risen
it can slash spending on entitlements it can slash spending on defense or it can print money
buy down interest rates via qe and yield curve control in which case the dollar and inflation
and in particular energy inflation given the bottleneck constraints that we've been discussing
there that'll be the release valve and so i think part of the message in the long run of us creditors
both energy importing and exporting moving away from storing wealth and treasury is
they don't know when it's going to happen but they know ultimately the end game is the feds
going to print the money to basically smooth over the deficit holes and that it the dollar will be
the release valve and that will be extremely inflationary in a particularly very energy
inflationary not only the fed but the bank of england the ecb the bank of japan right basically
anyone that because because to your point the treasury bond is the risk-free rate for everything
else so if treasury yields go up a bunch uh corporate borrowing rates the bank of japan's
borrowing or excuse me the the japanese borrowing rates etc well let me let me double click on that
because if rates in the u.s. go up significantly what is the impact on the emerging markets and
all the countries in the world that have had to peg their borrowing it to the u.s. dollar
and doesn't that create a an emerging markets crisis like in 1999 with long-term capital
i mean doesn't this really hurt the u.s. but it crushes some of these developing nations the short
answer is yes the longer version of it is that it de it accelerates the de-dollarization of global
energy markets and we're seeing that happen right so uh when we talked before about the need of
china and others to gain the ability to buy oil in their own currency as a matter of national
security because otherwise they'll run out of dollars uh yes what i just described will accelerate
the pace of dollar shortages as the dollar rises as rates rise so uh if you're the average emerging
market you've got big dollar outflows for two things dollar denominated debt service
and energy and so you you can't service dollar denominated debt with anything other than dollars
and so what they will do what we are watching happen is as this dynamic uh plays out like you
said where it starts drawing down dollar reserves as a result of the stronger dollar as rates rise
as interest rates rise on the dollar denominated debt for these countries
they have two choices they can shrink their real economy they can default i guess there's
really three choices default shrink the real economy that's sort of the same decision or
they can accelerate the pace at which they shift to buying energy in their own currency
and you've been seeing that uh the guinean government has done that recently using uh again
gold as a as a measure uh argentina to a lesser extent right and taking yuan swaps to repay the
imf it accelerates the de dollarization flows it doesn't necessarily stop the currency depreciation
but it keeps the energy flowing let me ask you two questions about gold um one everything you just
said makes complete sense we are not going to shrink entitlements we're not going to shrink
the military therefore we have to print and try to inflate our way out of this um i just
don't see how that's not going to happen so the markets and financial participants
even if they're energy blind have to see this why isn't gold already not at four five thousand dollars
an ounce i think ultimately you know it's interesting when we talk about energy as the
real currency as the real as real money um the price of gold in oil has risen almost four x since
2008 right so the gold the oil ratio has gone from eight to nine barrels an ounce to but you know
it's almost 30 but if energy is the real money why isn't oil the thing that's going on because oil
is very difficult to store it has a very low stock to flow ratio so it's it is it is commodity
properties that's the difference you can buy gold and store it but you can't do the same with
oil unless you know you have some tankers sitting around because that was my second question
about gold is gold is more biophysical than digits and linen that are the dollars in our
wallets but it's still not you can't eat it i mean it doesn't have a productivity attached to it
so do you um do you foresee in not this decade because i think it's we're too close to it but
do you think future human societies in the decades ahead could have a currency tethered to something
physical like land land productivity energy or is that just too remote of a possibility
i think the reserve asset will be tied to it i think you know and and you're seeing that happen
as i say we're already a decade into this when central banks stop buying treasuries and buy
gold instead they are storing their wealth in a reserve asset with a direct energy tie which i
think is critical to maintain that energy purchasing power when you when you ask why
hasn't gold risen more uh the answer is pretty straightforward which is
we know demand for gold has risen we know gold is finite and so if the price hasn't risen
it's really formulaic they have created synthetic supply of gold somewhere else and so how did they
do that uh the expansion really the unlimited expansion of paper gold derivatives over the past
30 to 40 years has allowed policymakers to manage the price of gold right so if if to the extent
that unallocated paper gold demand unallocated gold demand centered in london primarily increases
right so basically you if you have a demand for ounces you can either increase the price right
or you can increase the number of claims on the existing pool and that ladder is what has happened
over the years now that then gets into a very interesting situation and again why peak cheap
oil will force is forcing monetary system change is that when you hear me say central banks have
stopped buying treasuries and instead are storing wealth and gold restoring reserves and gold uh
when we hear me also say nobody trusts the yuan but by offering credible physical gold settlement
of any oil surpluses uh in yuan at the gulf nations in russia in gold what you're doing is
effectively tying oil to physical gold physical oil to physical gold not paper gold physical
which is important from a price discovery standpoint for gold because as we as you were just pointing
out the difference between oil and most other commodities in gold is the stock to flow ratio
so oil you buy it you use it it's gone and so the stock to flow ratio which is just all the
inventories out there relative to the to the daily usage when oil when when oil inventories
get high it's maybe 1.3 stock to flow ratio and when the oil gets really tight it's maybe 1.1
it's just not that efficient to store a lot of oil the flip side the stock to flow ratio of gold
is like 65 so basically all the gold ever produced is still out there in some way shape or form by
and large it's some marginal consumption for industrial uses etc however hey except for the
stuff i buried in 2008 in my back land here and i still haven't freaking figured out where i buried
but go on well precisely so when you have a 65 stock to so the stock to flow ratio
can be simplified down to the number of shells in a shell game right so if you have a commodity with
a stock to flow ratio of 1.1 to 1.3 like oil you can't separate physical fundamentals from price
for very long because there's just the stock there's it's the stock and flow ratios are so small
it's going to show up right so you have 1.1 to 1.3 shells per P if the stock to flow ratio of gold
is 65 there's 65 shells per P and so they can play games by creating paper unallocated
supply to manage the gold price and they've absolutely done that and i go chapter and verse
for a long time but i won't on on examples of that happening in history however peak cheap
oil is a forcing function on the breaking of that unallocated gold market because again
as peak cheap oil breaks in dites makes unworkable the debt backed fiat currency system where you
store your reserves and sovereign debt as we discussed is happening and you store it instead in
gold there's no they're not going to take paper gold they're going to want physical and so as
you connect oil and gold gold stock to flow ratio will drop towards oils and the price will start to
react so you've mentioned a couple times um russia and china so gold is increasingly the reserve um
you know go to choice of of what some call the evil axis of russia and china how likely do you
think it is that the us and the west um are going to try to vilify gold and possibly try to restrict
it's used similar uh to the us did you know in the 1930s um and they're kind of doing it now with
crypto um do you think that's possible because because if they don't do that things could get
out of hand or what are your thoughts i think it's very possible they could uh
how much of the world's gold reserves that the united states have oh eight thousand tons on call it
32 or 33 000 so about a quarter yeah so very well represented is there and so number one that's part
of the reason why i'm not convinced that they will because it actually will be in the interest of the
united states for the price of gold to rise it recolateralizes the system it weakens the dollar
it will free up more oil supplies and the way we talked about with the 70s um so it's it's possible
they will and there are definitely interests that want that in washington but again quietly
much smaller number of interests there are people in washington again tied with the defense and
intelligence community that understand um the need for a neutral reserve asset you know basically
we are seeing the biden administration run this um reshoring right the reshoring the the
increasing electoral investment in electrical grid all this sort of domestic infrastructure
this basically industrial policy um we've seen the biden administration do that is in direct
contradiction to the global monetary system as it has been structured since 1971 in other words
since 1971 the us's job is we run deficits and if we need to shut down our manufacturing and
import it from elsewhere to run more deficits to supply the dollars that's what we do so if we're
actually bringing stuff back relocalizing that means the global system is changing that means the
global monetary system is changing and if that is going to continue to happen you have to have a
neutral reserve asset you can know what you can't have both treasuries be the primary global reserve
asset which means treasuries remain the biggest export of the united states and reshor if you
want to reshor you have to move to a neutral reserve asset this is understood at certain levels
in washington and that's why i say to the extent it is in the interest of the us defense industrial
base um that has been hollowed out and to relocalize and supply chains there are interests that
understand that a higher price of gold is not necessarily against us interest the way it was
for a long time what a profound observation historically that one of the richest most successful
nations in the history of homo sapiens largest export is their debt certificates um at a time
when we're realizing that energy underpins all economic activity and we're passing peak
cheap oil as you've mentioned many times seriously that is like that's like in the early
warner brothers part of a wily coyote cartoon
so i want to get to some synthesized questions on this but let me ask you one or two more things
that you mentioned earlier you you've said several times barring an energy productivity
miracle what what's on the horizon that what why would that help and is there anything on the
horizon that you're you're seeing there yeah so an energy productivity miracle would
basically contra you know would basically offset the dynamics that peak cheap oil is putting in
motion right so basically to the extent that the world is concerned about the real value of sovereign
debt and treasuries specifically relative to their needed energy inputs now and in the future
that would allow them to say oh okay i have i i'm not going to run out of energy the real value
of debt is not going to collapse against energy i can buy debt again i we can move back toward
that other system we can we don't need to change the system as radically and as quickly as we seem
to need to but but it's not specifically energy productivity in this case because we could have
a miracle in some energy technology that has nothing to do with liquid fuel that is the transport
vector of the global system so it's kind of got to be a miracle in in that arena as well right
yes you know basically or it's equivalent right so you commercialize small fission
and build the infrastructure and now all of a sudden you actually can and you don't have
battery material constraints and so now we can run EV cars and trucks to replace those fuels so
yes exactly you raise a great point in terms of the liquid fuel constraint
and do you see in your research at your firm do you see any promising energy productivity
miracles on the horizon the short answer is no not that won't require basically a yield curve
control implemented by the fed to monetize industrial production right so there are small
okay can you can you explain that because i i actually think we're headed for yield curve
control as well but i i don't think we've talked about that on this podcast what is yield curve
control and why is yield control is just the central bank uh drawing a line over the bond
market in terms of yield so basically the fed comes in and says we are not going to allow
the tenure treasury bond to trade above four percent and they print as much money as they need
to ensure that the tenure treasury never goes above four percent so basically by so that's
what bank of japan has been doing exactly exactly so if yeah so so here's a naive question hold on
a second so if we're worried about higher interest rates because the government has to pay a huge
amount of our of our tax receipts to servicing our debt they could just say no the market clearing
interest rate of five six seven eight percent we're not going to allow that we're capping it at four
percent so that the government's going to only pay four percent on its interest but meanwhile in the
back door here we're going to be printing a lot more dollars to to pay for that is that is that
what you're talking about uh the release valve is the is the real value of the dollar and that's
exactly what the united states did during world war two is japan bomb pearl harbor shortly thereafter
the fed said uh we're going to cap the tenure us treasury bond at two and a half percent and the
three month that i think uh three eighths of a percent and we will buy whatever the government
issues and nobody lost a dime in their treasuries for those five years in nominal terms uh in real
terms uh those bonds fell sharply uh particularly after the war ended and the um the rationing of
goods came off uh real rates in the aftermath of world war two shortly thereafter so real rates are
just inflation adjusted interest rates real rates in the united states bottomed at negative 13 percent
in other words inflation was was 15 and your interest rate was two so yes okay but let's put
this all together luke um this spells an ominous economic future for the united states and and for
most of the world can you can you synthesize this and of course there's not one outcome it's not a
binary thing this or that there's a there's a distribution of possible outcomes but what
economically could you envision in the next decade in the united states based on everything
you've explained so far what would it look like to the average person and what are some
things that are quite likely in your opinion if we don't get that energy productivity miracle
which could be some sort of you know that i mean they could also be things like the united states
overthrows putin and gains control of russian resources and is able to redirect them not gonna
happen um if i'm not wishing for this or a caveat this when we talked about the big expense
being entitlements at 60 percent of 65 percent of receipts if something god forbid happens to a
quorum of the most expensive baby boomers in terms of health care and benefits where they you know if
you said luke i know for a fact in three years two years the unhealthiest 60 percent of baby
boomers will be dead and if that's the case that's an energy productivity miracle in ways
because you are going to reduce the draw on resources i'm not wishing for that i don't
think it's going to happen but it's no no no just conceptually these are all long shot things but
if those things don't happen then i think you are in for a uh in the not too distant future a dramatic
rise potentially non-linear rise in global capital costs which means interest rates united
states global sovereign debt corporates everybody and i think that ultimately uh given the obligations
of governments and western social democracies in particular uh drives them as a group into some form
of yield curve control possible varying degrees of capital controls light some of that could be in
terms of conversions into gold and bitcoin and things like that to your prior point the net of
it is i think we are in for a period at some point in the next decade where real interest rates in
the united states inflation surges in the united states across much of the world and real interest
rates are drastically negative for a period of several years so you go through a period of time
where inflation is on a sustained basis in the united states 10 to 15 percent for several years at a
time and ultimately the real value of this debt that is ultimately the problem is eroded in commodity
terms and energy terms and we wake up at the end of this period of time debt to gdp in the united
states and other western social democracies is at much more manageable levels from which central
bank can raise rates without blowing up the system and basically you have what amounts to a a debt
jubilee on a real basis right you're that the government gets a debt jubilee by virtue of
high rates of inflation and yield curve control for a span of several years except that debt
is a claim on future energy but when we issue money today the money is spent on real infrastructure
and real things with energy so that can't be inflated away so to me the the real economy has to
shrink relative to today based on the scenario that you stated the financialized economy yes not
so much you know the basically the gdp of you know the energy and the infrastructure and some of
the trades will you a good way i think to think about it is right now in the united states
you know this is not for political reasons but we have sort of the blue states and red
states and we've all seen the map and and if you look at the map blue states red states we've seen
these articles that have highlighted that essentially the blue states subsidize the
red states right the blue states or your surplus states and the red states run deficits within
the united states union and so the blue states which tend to be much more highly financialized
than the red states subsidize the red states what this world would look like is effectively
reversing of that where your red states are producing oil and food and and goods and and
the prices of those things relative to the things that the blue states tend to produce more of
bonds financial assets paper assets movies exactly so you end up with the reversal where
all of a sudden the red states will be subsidizing the blue states um as a result of that but or
after that but what about i mean i i can see that but it depends what global and us oil
production are and it also depends bigly on the complexity risk between here and there
because there are so many different supply chains and contracts and little spark plugs that are made
somewhere and and so what do you what do you think the the the likely impact on global
supply chains is there going to be a recognition that we need to shorten supply chains especially
for key goods and is that some advice that you would give to someone thinking about this stuff
yes it is advice i would give them i think there has been some recognition of that among
policymakers i think you raise a great point too as it ties back to the prior point of can us and
western policymakers constrain gold uh in that world and if the world if the bottleneck is energy
uh as we think it will be relative to dollars treasuries paper financial assets uh
that ties back to the why i think it might be so important about this brick the the bricks and
in particular the accession of these energy producers to the bricks or the entry into the bricks is
is you gold you can separate the western interest especially can separate from the real economy
oil they cannot and we saw that with russia what we do we sanctioned everything everybody
and their mother in russia everything and their mother in russia except oil we didn't touch oil
we've tried to cap it we but even then the oil has kept flowing the oil and and setting aside
grades and etc oil's fungible so if oil's the bottleneck and the bricks understand that the
situation in peak cheap energy necessitates a new reserve asset then whatever the sort of
gold the oil ratio if you will right if they say listen we value we value uh gold at a hundred
barrels of an oil per ounce not the thirty barrels that they do in london and new york
the fungibility of oil will make the global market go to a hundred barrels of an ounce
and it ties back to your point on supply chains which is if they decide that which they can by
virtue of their share of oil production by virtue of their share of population by virtue of their
share of a real production of basically everything else then the americans and and the english can
say well no no no that's not the right price and they can say fine then you don't get the spark
plug you don't get the the the complex supply chains call us when you're serious and you're ready
to pay a hundred barrels an ounce other than so you can see you control oil you can control
the value of the reserve asset and by extension you can control the dollar uh the value of the
international trade value of the dollar supply chain so yes all of it depends on the complexity
but you can see how these things can be used in a way that again because people don't think about
the primacy of energy uh the the you know the the primacy of energy of oil relative to the
financial assets they don't see this yet by and large some that's a small minority that sees it
but i think a lot more people are going to see it you know sort of when it hits them over the head
in coming years yeah i i happen to agree i mean i that's what i've called this podcast the great
simplification because we've complexified by adding energy and if we have suddenly the same
amount or less energy than before we almost by definition have to simplify the way we solve
problems in the way our our society is structured so let me ask you this and then i'll get to some
closing personal questions so you your organization the people that follow you the people that invest
with you are focused on the financial markets but what advice might you give to a leader in
either local or state or federal government or a future leader who is persuaded by the logic of
what's coming our way what what sort of um policy or macro advice outside of the financial markets
might you suggest that wouldn't get them fired that's the tricky part is i know the challenge
in this scenario and i'm not advocating for this i'm simply making an objective observation is that
in scenarios like this where you are effectively in a wartime emergency type situation
authoritarian setups have an easier time doing things than nations that are on a two-year
election cycle and much more heterogeneous in terms of the political uh well put a put a
finer point on it luke cheap oil supported liberal democracies yeah it it it absolutely did and so
to answer the question not to dodge the question i would say
you are going to need to run like it is now we're now getting to a point where
you have to make a long-term strategic decision which is implement industrial policy to build
resilience to build anti fragility to build relocalizing supply chains and the cost of that
is going to be the real value of your currency relative to commodities and it's going to be the
real value of your bonds and the challenge is that politically particularly here in the united
states and to a lesser extent in the uk the political power has resided with the debt merchants
the exporters of debt you know who has won in the last 40 to 50 years in the system it's been the
exporters of debt which is washington and wall street and they still have a lot of power they're
not going to want to hear this well and yeah see that's the problem is as we get closer to this
inflight this biophysical inflection point that you and i are discussing it's it's going to become
less able to have this conversation and no one's going to want to do these things until it happens
and it's going to happen suddenly so i that's part of the reason i'm doing this work is so we get
more humans thinking two or three steps ahead at kind of the inevitability of the money energy
nexus and start planning for the things that you're mentioning because i don't think we're
going to get a lot of warning it may be five or seven years off but i we're not going to get a
whole lot of warning no and you can already see like the crazy thing is is when central banks
stop buying your debt that's a warning when they buy gold that's a warning when china stops you know
when they start buying up supplies of this stuff i mean so by way of of framing of how far behind
our leaders are in this way of thinking there's a great book by helen thompson called disorder and
it's um very focused on energy energy policy etc at any rate bat it's about halfway through but very
early on in the book she notes that in o3 when the united states said and now we're going to invade
rock because they have wmd and they supported al qaeda despite very we'll say minimal evidence
to support that chinese leaders she said took that as a sign that there was something wrong with
global oil supplies because the american leadership had historically been sane sober etc and so their
read on sort of this seemingly insane you know insane move this completely illogical move was
there's a problem with oil and oil supplies and what do we do to start fixing they termed it
their malacca problem their malacca problem was five million barrels a day of oil plus goes through
the straits of malacca which can be shut down very easily by the u.s navy uh and so they got to work
on so but this is 2003 they were thinking about their malacca problem as a sign so they a 20 year
head start and our leaders still aren't quite there with the exception of some small groups
oh we're we're drawing down the strategic petroleum reserve to keep gas prices a little bit lower
basically to support the bond market right because when when oil prices went up what happened in
financial markets was our oil importing creditor friends china well this china friends china japan
went into current account deficit positions and so for what that means is basically they were
burning down cash well what do they are what do they sell to raise cash when they're burning down
cash because energy has gotten so expensive they sell treasury bonds that they've stored up so
you could see last year it was adding to the disorder in the treasury bond market
and so it's very poorly understood that this spr rundown uh you know the u.s faced two choices
last year when oil went up a bunch great let's take the strategic approach and use the price
incentive to drive consumption savings to drive investment in production it's or let's sell the
spr down to get oil down and just stuff all those problems that are real problems back under the rug
for a second because the treasury market's getting upset and of course the u.s leadership being u.s
leadership chose the treasury market and the short term expedient rather than the longer term hey
oil's 120 awesome that will get people to start converting into better fuel efficiency and the
evs and to increasing production and all these good things strategically
what am i uh let me ask you two more two more questions on this and then i'll move to my closing
questions so we have um a wealthy country but we have a lot of inequality and there are a lot of
people you know many double digit percentages of of our citizens have nothing or close to nothing
so in the environment that you're predicting with 10 to 15 percent inflation etc doesn't that
crush people with 30 grand in in their savings and they just have it in in in banks and all the
things that they're paying for are going up substantially in price doesn't this in the scenario
that you're uh projecting as likely doesn't this really really hurt the middle and lower class
in the u.s the short answer is yes the longer answer is that it depends on what they're doing
right if they are lower and middle class because they've been part of the blue collar and trades
workers and laborers in this country that have been on the wrong side of the financialization
of the economy over the last 50 years uh you know you're starting to see little signs of this right
when you see ups workers getting 100 or ups drivers getting 170 000 when you see around me plumbers
making 300 to 350 000 in cleven ohio when you know a nice house is 250 300 000 maybe 350 000 uh the
there is a re balancing that will take place it will require in a lot of cases
um flexibility but to the extent you are a a laborer skilled trades etc it's very possible
in that 15 inflation depending on your area you may be seeing 10 15 20 wage inflation at a time
when your 30 your mortgage is three so um right there's puts and takes but yeah if you're if you
don't have or are unwilling to sort of flex to that be be part of that area that is benefiting
already and i think will benefit greatly um as we sort of rebuild and restructure resure uh
unfortunately sadly i think it is a very difficult environment possibly for them
and speaking about the environment what do you think about the environment uh climate change
biodiversity loss plastics some of the other externalities that are not included in the prices
of of the goods and services that we pay for it's a tragedy the commons problem right ultimately
in terms of because nobody pays for the externalities um here we are uh so again it comes down to
what's the right thing to do is to better reflect what the real price is and that ultimately is
not just a political question because who decides what the right price is because now
you make an assumption about a future discount rate based on the deterioration in the environment
etc etc um you know what's the price of fresh water well to me in ohio it's really cheap i live
next to lake yerry to a guy in arizona it should be very expensive uh so it's not just a political
question but it's an unpopular one because in the end you have to pay more the answers pay more
to to to account for those tragedy the commons right we all like living in clean areas and we
pay taxes for it you know and and whatever your political or personal value uh is on that issue
peak cheap oil is going to make uh society's ability to pay more uh tougher i i say that all
the time in my research oil and energy energy broadly oil specifically is nature's discount rate
so peak cheap oil is just going to increase the discount rate on every other asset basically
every asset that everybody owns their house their car amazon trucking companies whatever
they all have with the exception of two assets they all have implied in their value a full and
growing supply of cheap oil you take away the cheap oil right what's the value of a house
in a far out excerpt in a place like california where public transportation stinks the you take
oil to 15 bucks a gallon the value of that house collapses you know if that person needs to get
into la from a whatever 60 miles away 50 miles away um commercial real estate falls etc only
physical gold self-custodied or custodied outside the banking system and self-custodied bitcoin
both of which have energy components with them them do not have that component that that
counterparty risk that energy counterparty risk because they have energy embedded in them
we could probably go on uh for hours i think i said it earlier but i don't talk to people like you
that often i'm talking to scientists and anthropologists and activists and philanthropists
so i kind of miss talking to wall street people but i don't really miss talking to wall street
people but let me ask you some some closing questions that i ask uh all my guests um you
have been working as a macro observer of uh the united states and the global economies as a career
choice so given everything you just told me what is your personal advice to the viewers of this
program at this time of of global upheaval and anxiety and this uh currency reform and
potential inflation and other things on the horizon i would say invest in maintaining
and building uh personal relationships uh personal health uh anti-frigil anti-fragility
in your uh in your in your life in your finances stay under levered you know don't don't go out
and borrow a bunch of money because uh i don't not say not to borrow any but make it productive
and don't over lever because the volatility of in financial markets and economies around what we
describe here around these some of these potential processes could be very great and so that's
that's what i've done in my own life that's what i mean those are the things that really
that really matter but you earlier said there's going to be a debt jubilee so wouldn't the game
theoretical move be to actually lever since it's going to be uh written off in the future
somewhat facetious but but not it's a great facetious question because it it highlights a
very important point which is if there's a chart actually from my my friend dan oliver
murmur can't capital and it shows one of the great let's take it to the extreme right extremes
inform the means one of the great hyperinflations of all time was in weimar germany from 1918 to
1923 1928 23 and we've all seen some version of that chart right so basically gold goes from 10
rikes marks to a trillion rikes marks over five years and you everyone's looked at that chart and
said yeah oh wow okay if there's gonna be a debt kind net debt you believe there's gonna be high
rates of inflation the optimal strategy is borrow a bunch of money buy that asset on on leverage
and then just let the inflation go and personally i thought that myself too i'd only ever seen that
version of the chart and then i saw this chart murmur from my friend dan oliver and it shows the
month over month price change in the price of gold as the rikes mark was going from 10 to a trillion
in gold terms basically going to zero and in in in in gold terms and what it shows is that if you
were levered levered long gold taken out in the greatest hyperinflation in history you lost all
of your money four or five separate times in five years and that's why i say yeah i don't think people
or understand they've started to see glimpses of it on wall street right when we've seen the two-year
treasury note trade like dogecoin back in march when we saw that the the repo rate spike in september
19 from two to ten overnight and the fed come in immediately and and do not qe we've seen little
glimpses of the type of volatility that this could spur not and that's in assets that we've never seen
inflate or volatility as you know as a former as a former bond guy like the treasury market
doesn't trade like dogecoin that the repo overnight repo rate that underpins everything else doesn't go
from two to ten in a day but it is started to and that's why i think it's so critical to be
under levered prudently levered against either productive assets or a place you can live and
grow with your family it does boggle the mind to see how many monetary claims on our physical
reality like how many tens and hundreds of trillions of of digits are out there relative
to the amount of oil and forests and copper and gold etc it really is something so a second
part to the previous question what about young people what what advice do you have to young
listeners who are becoming aware even if they might not understand some of the the archaic and
esoteric terminology you're using on finance and treasuries etc they can kind of squint and see
the picture that you're painting what what sort of advice would you give it's going to sound cheesy
but like fall in love start a family go to an art museum find what you're passionate about because
yes on one level is very scary on another level that opens up lots of opportunities for doing and
talking about things or or or or engaging in things that you can do as a career as a life's
purpose that otherwise wouldn't be available to you uh you know i mean just me talking to you
you know hopefully hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people will listen to this
around the world and that type of reach was simply unavailable even 10 years ago five years ago and
yet here we are so and then i think it's just having mental flexibility of you know it's like
Bruce Lee said be like water i mean i think 95 plus i say this to i have three boys and i say this
all the times that 95 percent of life is just showing up trying and then being persistent
when it inevitably you know it goes pear shaped when you try it the first and second third time so
show up be persistent or try be persistent fall in love be you know start a family whatever it is
that really moves you because it's easy to get worked about the finances and the possible
environmental implications of peak cheap energy all these things we're talking about geopolitics
but sort of like all the best things that have happened i'm 40 late 40s everything all the best
things that have happened for for me in my life are tied to having spent time with my family invested
time with my children pursuing a passion you know for me it's macroeconomics and talking with clients
and writing reports about it whatever it's those you know pursue those things that make you happy
and that are really um the really good things in life um whatever those happen to be for for for you
i have a feeling i might know how you're going to answer this uh but what is one specific issue
that you are most concerned about in the coming 10 years in our world to me the thing that's
scared the most concerning thing to me i don't want to say scared but but most concerning thing is
the intelligence and foresight strategic foresight of western leadership leading us into a
what i still think is a tail risk really bad outcome that to me and part of that is because
over the past several years uh i have been increasingly disappointed and surprised quite
frankly at exactly how poor the decision making has been and that is not just a reference to
american leadership the europeans in the last 18 months to me stunningly stunningly bad leadership
like like galactically stunningly bad leadership i those are the things that that concern me
we yeah we don't have a governance model uh nationally or internationally to face what's
coming that is what scares me y'all everything emanates from that yes peak cheap energy is the
cause but if we don't have better governance um we're we're in for a tough a tough road um i i agree
with you um so if you could make a wave of magic wand uh and there was no personal recourse to your
decision what is one thing you would do to improve uh the future one thing i would actually
if i could just do one thing i would give and this is again this is going to sound cheesy but
it i actually really there's an i think a kernel of truth here that i think is really important
and i would give every child a mom like the the mother my boys have had and i think you'd
have a much more peaceful a world i think you would have people that are armed with the ability
to have a governance model for to to talk about the things we talked about um i just think you'd
be in a much better place so that's that's what i would do uh my my boys have been very lucky
i've been very lucky but that's that's what i would do i think um i think that would go a long
way in fixing a lot of the world's problems i totally agree with you and the irony is is the care
and the uh the home things that the the mother of your three boys have done are not included in gdp
it's funny there's a meme that i've seen before right where um especially in today's day and age
there you know as the boys were growing up there was a little bit of uh well yeah i stay at home
and you sort of said that quietly and i remember a meme kind of totaling up the the gdp value of
what she did and like i said i can't afford you i'm gonna i'm gonna need to i'm gonna need to downsize
because i'm not making enough money to pay for all of this as it is accounted for in gdp in theory
so you you're exactly right and it you know that doesn't even include any of the tragedy of the
commons problems that a great mother fixes right in the long run well and and this is what's at
stake is figuring this out what is it that we really need um for a productive and sustainable
society going forward i know you're a very busy man thank you for taking the time today uh to talk
with me and um to be continued absolutely i i hope so i really enjoy our conversations i've been a
