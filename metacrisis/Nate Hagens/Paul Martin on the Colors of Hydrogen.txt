the way that we make 99% of the hydrogen world is we make it by by reacting fossils with with steam
and producing the hydrogen that way and releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere so if you take a jewel
and an energy loss as well yeah if you take a jewel of energy in the form of hydrogen it's
1.4 times as in this is in CO2 emissions and methane emissions as the same jewel that you
would get from just burning the natural gas to begin with unless you capture the carbon and store it
and if you make it from coal it's even worse it's two to three times as in this is
so from a climate standpoint if we didn't care about money or economic growth or net energy
just from a climate standpoint using hydrogen for a fuel generated from fossil fuels
generates 1.4 times the the emission impact as burning the original fossil fuel
if you don't capture the CO2 yes that's accurate if you don't capture it that's correct and how much
of are that 99% of hydrogen that goes to ammonia etc is sequestered today
uh a tiny fraction of a percent
a tiny fraction so right now hydrogen in our in our world economy is actually our use of it is
is a greater deleterious impact on climate than than the fossil fuels used to create it
that's right and it's a ghg emissions uh sector that's bigger than aviation
just making hydrogen right now i didn't i didn't know that than the aviation industry
how can the entire climate community not be squawking and talking about this all the time
that we're going to make hydrogen from renewable electricity it's just hope and in fact i've been
referring to this this hope that's been you know using people's willing suspension of rational
thought as a you know their hope is a as a way to shut off their rational minds i've been referring
to it as as the drug hopeium now i didn't come up with the idea of hopeium and people have been
talking about hopeium since the first time obama ran for the presidency at least and maybe before
that but the whole idea here is that um you know people not thinking uh clearly and rationally about
things let their hope run away with them and they say well you know we could use vast quantities
of electricity to to make something that we can burn and then we could use it in places in place
of things that we burn right now and wow wouldn't that be a wonderful world to live in but the
devil's in the details and he's not hiding i wonder if it's hope or fear because if given a
choice we either have to use less or we could create a lot more hydrogen people are going to
choose the hydrogen route even if it's a nodding your head sort of naive way or we could do it
smarter so you know the the wrong solution is sorry the wrong way to ask the question is we
can't burn fossils anymore what else do we burn right because the answer to that you can you can
hear eric idle from montipython saying more fossils in the background you know it it's the
wrong way to think about it it we shouldn't be looking at fuel substitution that's just simple
minded instead which what we should be saying is we can't burn fossils to do this thing anymore
move people around uh you know keep our houses warm etc whatever it is and heat some thing up
in industry how else do we do it without making greenhouse gas emissions that's the question
we should be asking and the answer to that question is almost never make hydrogen from electricity
okay and making hydrogen from natural gas and burying the co2 the trouble with that is the
worst a job you do of it and get away with it the more money you make so back to your original
question which is about the colors of hydrogen they're all the colors they view feminism as I
mentioned they try to make this pretty spectrum but the reality is 99% of hydrogen is blacker
than black and we don't have a word for that what is that black hole black or something uh so
what is black hydrogen just well you see there's the thing um in in this lexicon of of colors
black hydrogen is used to refer to hydrogen that's made from coal which is about a third of hydrogen
in the world okay and then they call hydrogen that's made from natural gas they call that gray
hydrogen even though it's 40% more emissive than just burning gas and hence it's blacker than black
and is black hydrogen also is black hydrogen also 40% or worse no it's it's worse that it's
worse still than just burning coal because you're starting with pure so great gray hydrogen is
is pretty black but not as black as black hydrogen that's right black this is the trouble we just
don't have it's it's like you know that the the Inuit have apparently many different descriptive
words for types of snow and we in English lack them because snow snowed us you know um they we
just don't have words for how black something can be if it's blacker than black and uh okay so black
hydrogen gray hydrogen what is blue hydrogen so blue hydrogen is kind of like you know when you
when you put those um uh those pucks in your your toilet or your urinal in order to to make it
look blue and sanitized it's the it's the notion that you can take you know gray hydrogen and bury
the co2 and it suddenly becomes blue you know uh so it's it's making hydrogen from natural gas and
bury capturing and burying some of the co2 that's what blue hydrogen is and it's really it's gray
hydrogen with an extra step yeah i call it bruise colored hydrogen because it's kind of black and
blue uh because of course in order in order to do carbon capture and storage first of all somebody
needs to pay you to do carbon capture and storage because it consumes energy and it requires capital
equipment that somebody's got to pay for uh and the energy that you use to run the carbon capture
equipment is often made by burning fossils so without carbon capture so it results in a bunch
of emissions and then on top of it you have the methane leakage up front which gets well first of
all you have you're taking methane in as a feed to make your hydrogen from so it's part of that leaks
you know world average one and a half percent but if you're getting it from russia it might be seven
percent of the methane that's leaking uh from the well to your uh to your plant and then uh when
you use that energy which you get from burning natural gas there's methane leakage associated
with that so you know by the time you've done with that there were a couple professors uh
howarth and jacobston uh did a paper in 2022 called how green is blue hydrogen and they
basically trashed the whole concept because they said look at at realistic methane emission rates
and using the 20 year time horizon for methane's um global warming potential relative to co2
this whole thing doesn't really even do anything it it generates as much co2 as if you didn't bother
uh you know as much effective co2 or global warming potential as if you didn't bother even
though you're capturing some of the co2 and burying it you're not doing a good enough job of it and
as a consequence the emissions are increasing per per joule or staying the same or only very
modestly in the best case very modestly reduced so that requires you to do different hydrogen
production a different way to get the capture to improve and that becomes very expensive and
you also have to take methane that comes with very low leakage so that means you can only get
methane from certain parts of the world
