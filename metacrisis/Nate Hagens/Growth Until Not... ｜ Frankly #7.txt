Time for another frankly. I would like to do more franklies. I have both a fiduciary and
a anxious feeling about these franklies because as world events gravitate towards the great
simplification. Telling the truth will undoubtedly be risky. I prefer to be a Monday morning
internet quarterback where I can watch people's speeches and the news and just reflect and
talk to my friends. But simultaneous with that I want to help society or at least I
intend to help society with both awareness and suggestions for responses. So I feel compelled
to say uncomfortable things and I will continue to do so especially with timely things in the news.
This week I watched an important debate between Jason Hickle talking about degrowth and Sam
Fankhauser talking about green growth moderated by Kate Rayworth with some fantastic visual aids.
I think what wasn't discussed in this debate is a third concept, a third scenario and in
reality a third rail which is the end of growth. So not something that will be green and tech
driven, not something that will voluntarily democratically reduce production but something
that out of momentum and running out of cans to kick we will be faced with a sharp drop in the
size of our economies and this is an uncomfortable thing to state. But I think it's also a really
important thing to state because it empowers individuals and communities to maybe ignore
the consensus trance of what society is telling us the future is going to be and change their
mindset, change their behaviors, change their ethos, change their networks because I don't think
society will en masse change. So I watched this debate with interest I took notes I would like
to review some of the high points of both of the gentleman's main logic and philosophy and let me say
those three people Kate, Jason and Sam undoubtedly at a party or a college lecture these would be
among my friends. They care about the same things, they care about the suffering of many humans,
the unbridled runaway consumption of our current economic system, the deleterious effects
our global energy hungry super organism culture have on nature other species ecosystems.
We all care about the same things. I think the logic of what's going to happen and what the
leverage points are where we differ. So let me first talk about green growth and Sam's presentation.
Briefly, I agreed with several of his main points, which is GDP per capita is a lousy
measure of human progress. It just shows the pile of stuff and doesn't measure distribution or well
I think we all kind of agree on that. He also had a point that was counter the degrowth narrative
and he basically said that environmental problems wane in people's priority when the economy starts
to suck. And so he thinks that the degrowth narrative is of misery and hardship is political
suicide for the narrative and I can attest to that because the end of growth narrative is even worse
than a degrowth narrative. And he also said that a little bit of income is good to help people cope
with climate. So on that very tiny boundary assertion, I agree with him. But if you care about
climate income is the single largest variable that correlates with emissions globally. So
more income more growth is going to be spent directly and indirectly on things requiring
carbon. So climate change, first of all, is not the problem. Climate change is a symptom of the
underlying problem of a social species finding a bolus of fossil carbon that is giving us right now
in 2022, the equivalent of 500 billion human labor equivalents added to our 5 billion real human
labors. And so to solve climate change with growth is pretty much an oxymoron because we will
innovate and create new inventions and new productivity and all that excess will be funneled
into things requiring direct energy and materials. So another comment on the the green growth narrative
that I disagree with is Sam mentioned that we have to increase energy efficiency and that will
bring emissions down. There is no evidence on a global basis that two centuries of inventions
and cleverness and new technology has reduced our energy consumption. We use the proceeds from our
inventions and funnel it back into the energy hungry super organism. Another of the green
growth tenets that I disagreed with is that we can easily grow through 2050 and beyond.
Now Sam did mention that at two and a half percent growth per year we will 10 times our growth in a
century, 100 times our growth in two centuries, and a thousand times our growth in three centuries,
and obviously that won't come to pass. But he does think we have another 30 years of growth easily
and I do not. First of all oil currently is the economy that may change in the in the future,
but 2050 is 30 years past what is likely peak oil in 2018 with some underlined six percent
decline rates on existing oil that are going to catch up very quickly and we're going to have to
run faster and faster to drill to keep up with that and invest in upstream capacity. So
I don't think growth can be extended for that much longer unless we have a miracle invention
of something and that will be deleterious for the environment. The other thing not mentioned by
either Jason or Sam was the monetary overshoot situation that we're in that we are growing our
debt as a global economy. We're doubling it every eight and a half years and we're doubling the GDP
which is the income stream required to maintain and service the debt every 25 years and that's
before oil starts to decline meaningfully. So we have this literal musical chairs moment in the
financial system and you can see it with Europe's response. They have two trillion dollars in margin
calls because of the Russian-led natural gas crisis. Who's going to pay those? The government
is the government's going to have to print more money buy more bonds guarantee these things and
eventually we can print money we can manufacture documents with guarantees but we cannot print
energy we can only extract it faster and what we have is a finite amount of low entropy low cost
energy. The other thing not mentioned is the complexity built into our six continent supply
chain system and the trust that was created when all countries in the world were cooperating
towards economic growth and now even with what's happening with Russia and China and India and
other countries this trust that we're all trying to grow the pie together and share
is starting to wane and then finally the other last point I would disagree with the green growth
narrative is it seems like green growth is in order to optimize carbon or to minimize carbon and
optimize climate outcomes. We are not going to optimize for one thing and if we do it's going
to be profits tethered to energy tethered to carbon energy. So when you optimize for climate
and this is what both Jason and Kate Rayworth pointed out is there are many other planetary
boundaries that are ignored or not optimized like nitrogen cycle and ocean acidification
biodiversity is a big one so we're trying to optimize this multivariate issue.
Carbon and climate are important I don't think we're going to en masse optimize for that so I
am very very skeptical of a green growth sort of trajectory. Jason Hickle in this debate talked
about degrowth and he defined it as a planned and democratic reduction of unnecessary production
in rich countries in a just way. Philosophically I don't disagree with that. I think anyone paying
attention knows that our economic system is not working for many people and that the costs are
back loaded into the end especially the environmental and some social and health and
well-being costs. I agreed again with many of the things that Jason Hickle said he commented that
our current economic system ignores human needs and chooses to build more SUVs that's true.
He said that the global north depends on an influx of resources and environmental input
from the global south this is also true. He mentioned that our economic system
focuses on a return on capital instead of the interests of people and he highlighted
there are over four million children in the United Kingdom living in poverty this is also true
and he also correctly criticized the green growth story by focusing only on energy because
even if we're able to have low carbon affordable scalable energy of the property and density and
transportability and EROI and everything else that we would need an increase in growth also
increases our material footprint so if we're going to double our growth our GDP we're going to
double our material footprint and this is already even at the tiniest scale of scaling a renewable
energy economy in the last two years the price of lithium is up 900 percent the price of nickel
and copper and cobalt and many other material inputs into a renewable sort of electrical system
are also significantly up so we do not have the amount of materials needed to scale this sort of
electrical renewable economy but my main critiques with the degrowth movement despite
being philosophically aligned is first of all there is a belief that we can decouple emissions
from GDP Jason even said this is the case and if it was not the case we're doomed those were his
words i don't think it's the case and i don't think we're doomed in either case but he was talking
about a cut of emissions by 50 by 2030 and 100 by 2050 this is just not going to happen we are
currently using renewable energy to extend the amount of fossil energy we have adding renewable
energy in our current system with a GDP based objective culturally is making emissions worse
not better renewable energy is making our climate situation worse of course it's not the fault of
the technology renewable energy is the right answer to the wrong question we could be using solar and
wind and geothermal to provide human services at a lower scale than we have now but we're all in
thrall to the economic driver of profits profits profits every quarter tether to energy tether
to environmental damage so energy and GDP are 99 percent correlated there are many countries who
are decoupling but from a climate change standpoint we don't care about those countries we care about
the global system and we're hitting new all-time highs with emission and energy use globally
and it's kind of a clue what's happening in germany they're beefing up their coal imports
they're importing coal by train because they don't have enough natural gas for electricity
and next week's topic they're going to wood in a big way another comment of the degrowth movement
that i philosophically agree with but practically do not is that a wealth transfer would be an
immediate reduction in energy use and it would improve equality well it was certainly improve
equality but the issue is there is a elasticity of consumption between the very rich and the
bottom two quintiles of society in terms of income and the top one percent of americans
i'm talking about spends seven percent of their income the bottom two quintiles the bottom 40
percent of americans spend 105 percent of their income so if we were to have a wealth transfer
simultaneously from the one percent to the bottom 40 percent there would be an immediate 15 times
give or take call on coal oil copper forest hamburger things at walmart ordering things
from amazon etc which would all kind of have an environmental footprint not only that but where
do you draw the boundary on equality because helping those poor americans then what about
poor people in other countries that don't have any access to energy service what about
unborn generations that won't be able to burn this uh 10 million times faster sequestered fossil
pixie dust than um that will not be available and we're burning it now if we burn it they can't
it's a rival good and not only that but what about the other species that every billion barrels of
oil and coal and gas that we burn makes the oceans more acidic and impacts the viability of food
webs for dolphins and whales and many other creatures so where do you draw the boundary
on equality is a question that i don't know the answer to finally my my other critique of of green
growth is that there are no mechanisms for a massive wealth transfer from the rich countries to the
poor countries there is a metabolism to our system in biology cleaver's law shows that the energy
use or the metabolism of an organism is its size to the three-quarter power and if you aggregate all
the 190 or so countries in the world and draw their growth trajectory versus their size the same
formula applies that our energy use is the size to the three-quarter power
more practically than that though is there is a momentum and a physics to the way that our global
system works and you can't just stop things or transfer things because of the complexity of the
built infrastructure there were lots of great ideas in the soviet union before it collapsed
but these long-term ideas of wealth transfers and means of production transfers are generational in
nature there are no quick fixes and the quick fixes because of the complexity run a risk of a
catastrophic failure so i just think the embedded momentum of the financial system and the productivity
of factories and infrastructure and roads cannot easily be quickly transferred from the north to
the south even if there was the political will so where does that leave us all i think there are
many growth critical philosophies out there there's my friend and mentor herman daily came up with
the steady state economy there's the post-growth concept how are we going to live differently
with lower material throughput in communities with regional supply chains etc there's the de-growth
movement there's the green growth movement all of these are growth critical in that they
accurately recognize that our current system is not functioning for everyone and not only that but
we're shoveling fuel into a runaway train and the future needs to have some midwives working on
steering that train away from disaster or slowing it down my view is that the momentum is so strong
that we will continue to shovel fuel into that train because we have to look at what's happening
just with indonesia, Czechoslovakia, Slovenia in the last few days with the indirect increase in
energy prices from the europe situation and there are riots and demonstrations in the street loss
aversion to humans is a real thing where the loss of something feels much more negatively intense
than the equivalent pleasure we get from gaining something so I think we are right to criticize
growth growth will continue as long as it possibly can we will pull out all stops in order to keep
growth going and then it will stop and when it stops because of the preceding steps and cans we
kicked there is a giant wily coyote moment waiting in the financial and currency systems
that is what I'm trying to inform and educate catalysts and pro-social humans both in their
professional careers and in their lives and in their communities to really think about and really
change their mindset and their behaviors ahead of that moment so that we can change the initial
conditions of that moment I think that growth ending in the next decade or so give or take is a
mathematical certainty but we have this financial leverage on top that we're going to have to deal
with so degrowth great idea I think as individual humans many of us watching this video listening
to this show can and should degrow degrowth for many people in the global north would be a healthy
thing both physically and behaviorally I think as Jason Hickel pointed out many people cannot
possibly degrow because they're already at the red line so I think anticipating an end of growth
as painful and anxiety producing as that is can inform better distribution and better
break glass plans ahead of that moment and so even if the people in the degrowth movement the
people in the green growth movement disagree with what I'm saying here let's just say that what I'm
saying is 10 percent possible let's put some resources and thinking and scenario planning
into this 10 possibility that an end of growth is coming this decade and respond from there
sorry for the long ramble I hope this was helpful and I'll talk to you next week about trees thanks
so
you
