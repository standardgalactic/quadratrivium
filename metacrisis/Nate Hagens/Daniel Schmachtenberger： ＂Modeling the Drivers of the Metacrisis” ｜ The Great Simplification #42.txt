Here is the long-awaited fourth installment in a series with Daniel Schmockdenberger.
We dive deeper into the nuances of humans with our relationship with energy, materials,
and technology.
How does technology intensify the multipolar trap on a world order based on growth?
Is there a way out?
Or could global solutions just make the problem worse?
We close this fourth conversation queuing up what our eventual goal was, which is a
what-to-do framework on bend and not break for society in coming decades.
Once again, here is Daniel Schmockdenberger.
We got really sidetracked on the last conversation, and I'm going to try to be a taskmaster here
to keep us on topic, but with you and me, who knows where this will go?
So here is my intent for this conversation.
This is part four of a series called Bend Not Break, which is the ultimate intent of
framing our macroeconomic human predicament, understanding the game board of the constraints
and challenges, which then inform the opportunities so that we can navigate coming centuries and
educate, inform, and inspire more humans to play a role at various scales of the challenges
we face.
So if you don't mind, I'm just going to briefly recap our first conversations.
Our first conversation, you interviewed me, and we talked about the energy, money, economic
growth basis of modern early 21st century society, and how we got here and our dependence
on fossil hydrocarbons, how we paper over some of our limits with increased monetary
claims, and what are the drivers of growth.
The second, you talked about the maximum power, which is that organisms and ecosystems
in nature self-organize to access energy gradients, and human societies are also very similar.
You talked about hyperagents and some other fundamental aspects, kind of building blocks
of your narrative.
The last conversation was intended to talk about different meta-macroeconomic framings
of how everything fits together, energy, materials, technology, money, human behavior, but instead,
we ended up going down a very interesting and personal track on why we prefer certainty,
why being scared about the future leads us, hopefully, to a post-tragic place where we
can understand our difficult reality and still be inspired to play a role.
And we really had a beautiful and almost intimate conversation, but it wasn't what I had intended.
So here we are today, and what I would like to do today is the global economy is running
into lots of risks and headwinds, and we read things in the news every day about the Bank
of England and the German energy situation, and I want to fly up high enough to explain
what is happening because the standard story taught in macroeconomics in the world's business
schools and colleges doesn't really have an explanatory story that makes sense of where
we are and where we might go forward.
I've developed a story which is that humans in aggregate are functioning as a kind of
blind amoeba or a superorganism that self-organizes because we use the market as the arbiter of
our decisions, that everything is outsourced to this exponentially growing system that individuals,
families, small businesses, corporations, nation states all make decisions to optimize
growing profits and accumulation of wealth, and if you aggregate that all, it's all tethered
to using energy because GDP is historically and currently around 99% correlated with energy
use and about 100% correlated with material use like copper or lithium or the plastics
or concrete or wood, that all that together is growing at around the same rate that GDP
is, and that we create monetary overlays on this whole system, and that system is not
being controlled by billionaires or by politicians, but it has kind of got its own emergent momentum
and metabolism, and so we're in this runaway train and we're shoveling fuel into the engine,
and so from that vantage point, we will keep growing until something breaks in the ecosystems
of the world, or we will stop growing, and then we have a geopolitical social response
to a smaller pie where everyone has less or on average everyone has less, and so this
is a blind superorganism that none of us directly control, so that's kind of my overview.
We could get into more detail there, but what I'd like to do today is have you unpack your
version of that narrative.
How does everything fit together?
If you fly up high enough and look down at how humans arrive to this point, how do energy
materials, money, behavior, technology fit together, and how does that inform the possible
choices and changes and governance and constraints of the future?
That was a mouthful.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, I think you and I got connected because a friend connected us, we recognized that
we were both trying to look at some of the dynamics that were underneath the various
types of risks humanity faces and not look at biodiversity loss and species extinction
and ocean acidification and climate change and all the planetary boundaries and war and
supply chain risks as separate issues, but see what they have in common that is driving them.
You talked about this in terms of dynamics of the superorganism and I talked about them
as generator functions of catastrophic risk, but I think we're looking at the same thing
using different lenses, and at this point our lenses have interinformed each other.
I think it's pretty easy to see that all the problems that we look at in the world, one of
the lenses they have in common involves the system of macroeconomics that the world is working with,
meaning that there's perverse incentive, that what generates profit for a company or a country
or an individual often does so at the expense of another company or country or other individuals
or the environment as a whole.
So then when that profit equals not just security and survivability, but also game
theoretic advantage of their ability to influence their own fate in the world and whatever mechanisms
they use to generate more profit than somebody else, i.e. better technology, that that can be
re-engineered and employed by others so you get these kind of races, like whether it's a arms race
militarily or just market-wise, you can think of it as a kind of arms race to be able to
convert the natural world into profit faster and increase relative game theory, that the
profit is, you know, modern economic theory is that that profit is a measure of production,
how much value we added to the raw resources and that we only profit if we produce goods and
services that other people want to buy, which means that it benefits their life because we solve
some legitimate problem, therefore GDP equals good, right? Therefore more total revenue means
more problem solved for more people and more total profit means that we were able to operate
efficiently and that the profit measure equals the amount of value that we added that is being
monetized. That's not totally untrue and we can see in the Pinker and Hans Ross slaying and other
kind of narratives the true part of that and none of us want to go back to the pre-novacating,
pre-pain killer world like those parts are true, but it's also true the profit is not just a measure
of added production but of extraction and externalization and that those profit numbers also
have added extraction, externalization and not just the profit but even the revenue numbers.
As you mentioned with oil, the way we price oil is how much does it cost us to extract it? It costs
a certain amount to get a barrel out. Now we have to sell it for more than that but we can't
sell it for a whole lot more because somebody else will undercut us price-wise and so it's a
cost of extraction plus a tiny margin determined by competition and that does not include the cost
of what the environment took to make the oil if we were going to make it ourselves so we weren't
using up a unannual resource and it doesn't include the cost of the harm to the environment
that happens and the burning of it, the manufacture, the refinement, you know all the aspects of the
pollution and the waste and this is obviously true not just for oil but for every single aspect of
the materials economy. An ecological economist would say that GDP counts the goods but doesn't
include the bads. Yeah, I think simplistically GDP is actually there's a really nice way to
talk about this which is there is a kind of meta-perverse incentive that everybody has economically
and technologically and politically but particularly economically which is to overemphasize
the opportunity and under-emphasize the risk of any new technology or new venture
and let's particularly look at new technologies so let's say I'm going to develop
AI for a particular purpose or it could be biotech or whatever any new technology if
if I emphasize for this AI what the amazing opportunity is it's going to allow us to do
protein folding stuff that will solve cancer then of course everybody wants us to move as
fast as possible because people are going to have family members that have cancer and
we're going to make a lot of profit associated with solving some real legitimate problems that
people care about. If we focus on the risk side too much yeah but if we can apply this to protein
folding that can solve cancer is this also going to be used for bioweapons that intentionally or
even via lab leaks haven't created those monstrous things end up wiping out everybody or could it
also be applied to developing better chemical weapons or a million other bad things if I say
all right I don't want to advance this technology for its opportunity without really understanding
the risk landscape well because let's say that I'm developing it for this positive purpose but
now that I've developed it it's out there the barrier of entry for anyone else to use it for
other purposes is way way way lower so it's not just what purpose am I developing it for but what
purpose is this new easier capacity usable for by anyone who has any incentive to use it if I say
I want to do a really comprehensive risk assessment and ensure that the combination of how we move
the technology forward with the regulatory landscape and the safeties put in place is actually not good
for the world then if someone else doesn't do that and they just say oh the risks aren't that bad
the opportunities are awesome they race ahead they get first mover advantage in the market
and they will end up getting the network effects of you know whatever kind of Metcalf law benefits
happen and so they just win economically and they'll be they won't be financially responsible
for the harms that it causes protected by limited liability corporation type laws and things like
that so the corporations will get to privatize the benefits and socialize the losses and as a
result nobody is incented to do good thorough risk assessment everyone is incented to do some kind of
plausible deniability box checking risk assessment that is not really a deep or honest risk assessment
and then claim that they couldn't have predicted that bad thing could have happened or their hands
were tied while they were following the perverse incentive associated with the profit metric
but if we did appropriate risk analysis for glyphosate or the examples you just said
if we did if we tested everything we would make no products at all pretty much
we would make a lot less products the world would be better
comprehensively and we wouldn't be facing the break issues that you're focused on it's just the
game theory of how to do that's very hard it's not just the game theory is hard right the game
theory is hard because unless you can make sure that everybody does those risk assessments then
you don't if you do the risk assessment you just lose right and so what it actually means
is the more ethical players have less influence and so currently the the multipolar trap is
well i think i'm more ethical than the other guy building the ai or building the crisper or
whatever and since there is a race and the first mover advantage is significant i have to win the
race to be able to steer the field so i'm going to go ahead and cut corners on risk assessment
because if i don't and even less ethical actor will run everything well my view is the super
organism doesn't include ethics in its decisions so we'll get to the so the super organism is like
if you take this multipolar trap that has all of these different actors in a race with each other
you would say that's a property of the super organism now we're dropping down a layer to say
that property of the super organism is what makes it to where all these players don't feel
like they actually have the capability of doing the ethical thing because they will just be kind
of priced out and even if they're ethical individual humans their position within the
economic hierarchy doesn't allow them to express their ethical view yeah in in general you know i
think we talked about this once that um if we look at china's taking of to bet or uh colonialist
taking of native american you know territories via genocide in the founding of the us it it wasn't
based on who the more ethical actor was it wasn't based on um which civilization should be in terms
of some philosophical true good and beautiful it was based on effective dominance which is the
combination of violence and economic productive capacity and so um given that what ends up winning
in a very darwinian sense and what is good in an ethical or philosophic sense or even in a long
term viability sense aren't the same thing that's at the core of something we have to address right
is that where you have a scenario that what wins in the short term forces everybody to race towards
that thing even if everyone racing towards that thing makes an entire system self-terminate in the
long term and that's what we call the multipolar trap it's expressed in the tragedy of the commons
the military arms race the market race to the bottom and you could define it as a property
of the super organism to exploit all the energy in its environment and then hit a cliff and
we know that like typically you have the peak number of cancer cells in a person's body right
before they die and then all the cancer cells die when they kill a host so the cancer cells
individually are utilizing metabolic resource faster than the other cells and reproducing
faster than the other cells so it seems like they're winning at at a very short term game
but they are actually then killing the hosts that they depend upon and so uh lots of people
have drawn the analogy that human presence on the biosphere looks a lot like a cancer
where it is maximizing its extraction from that which it depends upon in a way that is
actually breaking the substrate it depends upon so is the purpose of this conversation to
educate and influence cancer cells to become self-aware to change their behaviors well I
think one of the things we're also talking about that's tricky is
where it seems like the cancer cell behavior is actually following rational self-interest
defined by the game theoretics of if I stop being a cancer cell the body's still gonna die
right because I can't stop everybody else from doing it and so unless I can stop a certain critical
mass from doing it and this gets down to the if we don't cut the trees down but we don't have some
rule of law that makes sure nobody does then all it means is the other tribe that's in competition
with us cuts all the trees down we still don't get to protect the forest and they'll use that
economic advantage against us in the next tribal warfare and we're fucked so not only are we going
to cut the trees down faster than we need we're going to race to cut them down faster than the
other guy because we can't get everyone to agree not to which is why at least at first hearing about
the ecological biophysical narrative of the superorganism and you're gonna tell me where
where yours fits in here at least at first feels to someone that they don't have any agency because
what is one person's change due to this larger dynamic that you're describing
so if we take an example if we try to get hopeful and we say but let's look at where we did change
really bad things because some small number of one persons really did stand up for something they got
other one persons to stand up they got a critical mass and we shifted it let's take a couple examples
that are often given let's take cigarettes or mothers against drunk driving and seatbelts or
HFCs CFCs in ozone we could give plenty of examples but the it's true that we have not
that we don't have a history where we've never solved anything that matters ecologically or
socially like there are some times where people out of concern for the commons have
went against some profit stream and actually one a thing but they are different in kind than what
we're facing now and i want to point out where they're different in kind and different in scale
but go on they're different in scale and and different in kind in a way that's connected
so if we look at cigarettes and four out of five doctors choose camel cigarettes
we obviously haven't gotten rid of cigarettes but we've made it to where you have to be 18 to buy
them and they have to have a surgeon general's warning that this will kill you before you use it
and we've definitely decreased the total number of people that use cigarettes and they can't use
them in the buildings and stuff that took a lot of work a lot of people died of lung cancer and
second hand lung cancer first etc for a vested interest profit stream that knew it was wrong
from well before it was regulated but the sale of tobacco as big a deal as it was was not at
it was not the engine of creation for the economy as a whole it was one sector of the economy was
one product when we're talking about climate change as you focus on there are no industries
that don't need energy there is no such thing as even the possibility of any good or service
that doesn't need energy so when we're trying to deal with something that is the byproduct of
using energy itself it is connected to the machine of creation rather than one little area in the
same way that it's like HFCs and CFCs not every single industry was based on aerosol propellants
and so you were able to change that without having to change macroeconomics you really only had to
change an industry and so you could get enough force to do it when you're trying to change
something that is at the heart of macroeconomics itself the vested interest that are against it is
everything and it's not only that every industry and thus every single business requires it it's
that also every nation states geopolitical position requires it so literally power itself
is bound to it so the entire machinery of power will resist anything that would decrease its
relative power capacity and this is why from backing out of the Kyoto treaty to whatever the
whole history of the thing why has it been so hard is because if any
so there you know the market can get us to organize based on incentive but if incentive
isn't adequate and we actually have to use a anti-incentive we have to use a deterrent the
market doesn't really do deterrence well so you have a state that does that which is you make it
illegal and someone will get arrested if they break the law or their business will stop being in
the law break so we this multipolar trap that we talk about where there is some near-term incentive
where if any agent does that they win in the short term and it creates a race for everybody to do
that we've figured out how to solve multipolar traps inside of a nation state by rule of law
and monopoly of force and enforcement so we can say no we're not going to cut down all the trees
we're going to have a national park we're going to keep trees in the national park
and no lager is allowed to cut there and what that means is a monopoly of violence will
forcibly stop you if you're cutting there and take you to jail to protect the rule of law right
and so inside of a nation state we're able to prevent most multipolar traps
but we do not have international governance to deal with global ones and so then we end up getting
the various nation states competing with each other and you know this is both this is why there
is a desire for something like global governance is because the global oceans or the global atmosphere
or the global biodiversity or global commons that we depend upon can't have a situation where each
country if they make the right choice gets disadvantaged so that nobody makes the right choice
the reason we don't want a one world government is because how do you have something that has
that much power that doesn't become corrupt and how do you ensure that there are checks and balances
on it so we do need something like effective global governance which does not have to be a
government it can be a decentralized process but that still allows us to solve the multipolar traps
so we'll push back a little bit on that because even within countries the pressure to continue
economic growth even understanding and deeply caring about some of the negative impacts of decisions
these countries are powerless to do it look at germany right now they're importing train loads of
coal and they're taking down old growth forests for trees this has nothing to do with the global
situation they are compelled to get energy to keep their industries going of course it's a
externally imposed emergency thing because of ukraine and russia but there's lots of examples
like this that to keep the the mouths fed we make populist well look at brazil that's not a global
thing they continue to tear down the rainforest to grow more soybeans for beef and that's an
economic decision within the country of brazil of course it's a global thing is if any country
does not grow its GDP relative to other countries that are its overall geopolitical position is
going to decrease and so a country does not have total sovereignty and last time you and i were
together with sammo he was asking the question of uh how many countries are there actually in terms
of entities that can make real strategic decisions and there's not 195 there's like 10 or something
like that he said one hypothesis is only countries that have nukes the other hypothesis is only
countries that have nukes and or some critical control of an aspect of the global supply chain
that everybody needs but basically has some play on power that is fundamental and everybody else is
to some degree a vassal nation it's an interesting conversation but you're right the it's not like
a country has total sovereignty within it because it also has to do with external pressures and in
a global media world it has to do with internal pressures and so the external pressures do force
everybody to keep up with growth right it's kind of the nation state keeping up with the
joneses in the most kind of destructive way um but the point is if you have rule of law
and a monopoly of violence you can bind a multipolar trap it doesn't necessarily mean you will it
doesn't necessarily mean they'll be very politically feasible which is why there are no nations that
have done that for oil because they just couldn't right they couldn't because there is no way that
they would maintain economic viability within the overall global system that exists um so what
we're mentioning is no country is going to take the lead on properly pricing oil and say you know
we're gonna um we're going to price oil at the actual cost that it would take us to produce it
renewably um in terms of how we manufacture those hydrocarbons and how we process the externalities
and the price is 10 or a thousand dollars a barrel depending upon how you price it but it's a i mean
a gallon but it's a fuck ton up from where it currently is um they would be so radically
disadvantaged gdp wise relative to every other country in their ability to build militaries or
keep up with trade or whatever and particularly the leading nations aren't going to do that so the
us isn't going to do it if china doesn't china is not going to do it if the west doesn't and as a result
um you have the situation where any nation has an anti-incentive to lead accept paradoxically
given my worldview and i'm not sure you agree with this a country that was that chose to do that or
was forced to do that to simplify first and beat the rush would have major economic and social pain
now but would self organize in a way while the rest of the global system is still intact that
they may be more resilient 20 30 40 years from now based on what they were forced to do now
the challenge is always the gap between when you start to do the thing and how much advantage
everyone else gets in that time and what they do relative to you in that time before your thing pays
off there's a time to roi on it right it's the same with like getting into um getting off
it's it's energy per unit time it's power which we talked about before so so you you're you're
i don't i'm sorry to interrupt but implicit in what you're saying is something i fully agree with
which we're in this rapidly rushing river and and we can't swim upstream we're compelled to go
downstream with everyone else until there's a waterfall or the river calms or or or whatever
it's it's it's a it's an economic compulsion globally at least for the near term yeah so the
competitive interests do force us to keep up with the game or
or lose as a result of not keeping up in that game lose in ways that are intolerable before
the roi of our new investment happens the answer to that the why the name of this whole thing has
been not break is if the major players can come to an agreement to all recognize that future state
and decide to uh be willing to accept constraints on their own behavior knowing that the other ones
will also accept constraints on their behavior some kind of voluntary agreement because unlike
in the nation state example i gave where you can have a monopoly of force there is no international
monopoly of force because how do you do how do you enforce a deterrent on countries that have
nukes and critical parts of your supply chain it's very hard the cost of implementing the deterrent
is oftentimes worse in the short term than whatever you are trying to avoid so you just
leave it alone so okay we don't get off fossil fuels or we have a nuclear war it's like or our
entire economy breaks because we can't do import with china or they can't do export with us or
whatever so the cost of deterrent is a very real thing to have to factor so you can't force that
thing you have to somehow reach agreements with agents that are hopefully capable of being rational
enough to see that the alternative in a way in a time period that is not so far out that it's
unreasonable to think about the alternative is much worse and this is i think the whole reason you
have a podcast and the reason i podcast with you and like that is to try to show the inexorable
world situation if we continue on the path that we're on such that those who are in the positions
of power could come to make the kinds of agreements that make those choices possible for each other
that bring about a different better long-term world situation and it would by definition have to be
people in those 10 real countries that hold the reins us china russia france germany u k and a
couple others probably the us and china agreeing by themselves would be enough to move the entire
world that way but probably it would require both of them and that's hard yeah let me just ask you
sidetrack question and i have a note here to myself do not ask daniel sidetrack questions on
this episode but it's it's only a partial sidetrack so you just describe the logic of how nations
are compelled to continue to grow so that they don't get behind what about individuals listening to
this did can they get out of that trap in their own behaviors and plans
yeah it's an interesting one i think
can individuals change their behaviors in certain ways that are important to do regarding
um their consideration of did this meet come from a factory farm did this product come from a
sweatshop how much total shit do i actually need um is this packaging ever going to break down in
the environment like can they start to be considerate of those things and should they be yes should
they be because that choice will make much difference to the whole no it's not going to
should they be because if they do and communicate about that and all the people who are compelled
to do that it can change the nature of culture and status enough that enough people do that the
cumulative effects are meaningful yes that's true um is there a lot of tricky stuff to consider
like then everyone's incentive to virtue signal in the hope that that compels other people to do
things in a way that oftentimes actually produces more um backlash than anything like you know
there's sensitive things there i think a lot of people who are smart and caring get hopeless
around their own personal behavior for a couple reasons one you and i are both talking on a
computer right now so that we can do this where we know for sure that the mining of the rare earths
needed to make these semiconductors were in uh mines that employ slave labor and in supply chains
that put toxic mining tailings into fresh water and that use fuck tons of energy and on and on
the alternative green laptop doesn't exist because there's not a completely separate supply chain
for cobalt somewhere or for lithium or for semiconductor manufacturing the green laptop is
is you and i living in the same community and meeting in a in a forest glen instead of on the
computer but we're trying to maximize our impact not minimize our impact so that's the point is
that you know a lot of people will start to realize okay every single product i can find for the most
part was has some input from global supply chains even if it's that the materials to do it were
transported across roads that were paid for by nation states that were backed up by militaries and
you know taxes that go to those things like whatever it is and so then you're like all right
well i'm going to live in the forest and only you shit that i make by hand that i find on the
forest floor the chance that i'm going to radically influence the world is pretty low and my decreased
consumption is not going to affect the overall story so there's almost a way in which that's more
of a like i want to wash my hands clean of being part of our species at this time but i'm actually
not taking responsibility for what i do to meaningfully affect it and i think that there is an
ethics of action and inaction i'm ethically responsible for what i could do and don't as
well as what i do i like that there's also the positive externality of using less and and all
that making you personally more flexible on the bumpy road to come well so i think people should
be thoughtful about this though i don't think they should try to be perfect about it because if they
try to be perfect they will be in a forest using nothing yeah and so but i think one of the things
that's important is to get i'm i am complicit with the world system every time i use my phone i'm
complicit with the world system every time i use money itself as an exchange for anything every
every time i drive on a road i'm complicit with the world system as such i can't think of myself
as an individual separate from the whole there is this umbuntu i am because we are and this is the
way the human world is right now and so i can't make myself like in perfect ethical alignment
independent of helping the species as a whole to move and there's something actually more
humble and and like interconnecting and important about getting that and uh now that doesn't that
doesn't mean okay well because i'm complicit with those things fuck it i'll just buy everything that
i want with no consideration one should absolutely endeavor to do the best they can on a number of
areas and also say my ability like i know how environmentally bad it is when i use planes but
you and i both go to places whether we're can interacting with governments or major corporations
to try to help them do better where the impact of the fuel on that plane makes sense relative to the
possible impact we can have on those institutions and um and it's hard because it's so easy once you
accept it it's both it's so easy to bullshit yourself right so all there is is like earnest
consideration of this so i think some people can get a little hopeless when they try to be perfect
with it i think the other place people can be hopeless is when they recognize that
most of the harm is on a Pareto distribution that is not the result of just consumer behavior it's
the result of military behavior major corporations things that aren't going to change not just based
on my behavior but my behavior plus the voluntary movement i try to create and that all of that
doesn't converge to adequate in time and so that's why there is also this other thing got a factor
of like okay it's not just about being less bad on the environment it's about transforming the human
techno sphere social sphere complex to actually be compatible with the biosphere that it depends upon
so not just how do i use less of this one that is incompatible but what is my role to play in
the transition of the human presence on earth to one that actually works with earth long term
well that's the going to be i hope the topic of our next conversation is is what are the pathways
at the various scales on what we can do once we understand this this meta overview
so we didn't get to yet like we just started to touch on the fact that the economy as we understand
it is incompatible with the biosphere that the production of goods and services that profit
is both a measure of production but also another measure of extraction and externalization that
until the economy does not have extraction and internalization as realities within it then
its accounting is wrong like it's basically just got messed up books because it's unrenewably taking
from the balance sheet of nature and unrenewably putting like it's unrenewably taking assets from
the balance sheet of nature and unrenewably putting costs into the balance sheet of nature not
accounting for in a way that breaks that if you just even get the accounting right then you start
to have an economy that makes sense but that that does require changes that would look nothing like
capitalism socialism or any type of system we've had to date well for one reason because if you
to use ecological economics terms if you internalize all the external externalities
most industries on the planet would be unprofitable so if you try to close loop this stuff
who bears the cost of that because if you the closed loop stuff is going to be a lot more
costly and so either the governments bear that cost or consumers bear it with much higher prices
or using less stuff and we're not going to voluntarily en masse choose that yeah and
we have to that's another way of stating the multipolar trap right which is that
this system where the cost is externalized to the environment in the commons
does seem to short term benefit us and and whether us means corporation country or person
and even though the aggregate effect of that system does self-terminate for everybody
and so we do have to voluntarily at a minimum adequate scale create a new system that doesn't
self-terminate or we get the effect of being we get the plausible deniability of saying we
couldn't have done anything else while being chained to and part of a system that is on a
self-termination path which is why understanding what the alternatives look like is key.
How did how did we get here how does everything fit together?
Energy, materials, human behavior, technology, birds eye view.
So I think the key insight that I want to emphasize is that
has to do with what is unique about humans relative to the rest of the species as best
we can observe and when I say humans right now I mean Homo sapiens relative to everything else
but it probably started with earlier hominids that had early tool making so somewhere between
Australopithecus and Homo habilis obviously all those other hominids are not with us
so I'm really just going to be but but that's important for the early part of the story
because we're talking about a curve that's maybe two million years old rather than just 200,000 years
old. As you brought up pre-hominated species it made me think that what you were just describing
between nation states today that there's not going to be a nation that's going to voluntarily give
up power and reduce GDP you could maybe apply that to pre-hominated species too and that's why
we're here and the Neanderthals are not. Yeah there are obviously arguments between scholars
on how this happened but one of the hypotheses definitely is that the reason the other hominids
aren't here is inter-species inter-tribal warfare and that sapiens dominance at various aspects of
um technology and coordination had them win that game could could be seen as the beginning
of this uh this whole trajectory that we've been facing since but um I do want to emphasize
a distinction between humans and everything else in nature. This is always tricky because
there's an old story of the difference between humans and the rest of nature that looks like
man's dominion over nature because you know we want to rise above our animal nature to some
angel godly oversell and that makes us separate enough that we have dominion over and then there's
kind of an environmental movement that wants us to say men are not the web of life we're merely a
strand within it whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves and see our unity with nature and our
dependence on it more wanting to offer something that has elements of both but is kind of distinct
which is humans don't exist without the rest of nature so we have to be stewards for it but what
is different about us allows us to destroy all of nature in a way that nothing else in nature can
therefore we have to be stewards or we don't continue to exist and the key distinction is
that the adaptive advantage that every other animal has is the result of genetics that result
from evolutionary process and the evolutionary process is um genetic mutation occurs most of
those mutations are not adaptive some tiny set of them are adaptive and though that increases
survival and reproduction and if it increases survival and or reproduction it gets selected for
the process by which a genetic mutation occurs is some copying error because a gamma ray hits the
thing or oxidative stress or a virus or something like that and those mutation pressures are pretty
evenly distributed across the ecosystem there's a million minutiae that we could get into here and
of which there are some differences but i want to kind of stay at the high level topology of the
thing that i think is is relatively easy to agree on so you don't get a situation where you have a
mutation that creates a radical difference the total amount of chains that occurs in a mutation
is going to be relatively small so major speciation changes occur through lots of compounding mutations
over a long period of time and then you have this co-selective process that if you have a mutation
that makes say a predator slightly faster it's going to be slightly better at hunting the prey
animal well it's going to catch more of the slower prey animals and so the faster prey animals that
still continue to avoid it in breeding with each other because there was already some natural
distribution in their genetics create faster prey animals so as the predator animal gets a
little bit faster from a mutation the co-selective forces make the prey animal get faster or vice
versa so the so that the change occurs through these micro changes and co-selective pressures
and then not just the prey animal but the prey animals relationship with the with the plants
that it eats and the adaptive changes that occur there you end up getting that the competitive
forces end up leading to meta stability of the whole system and up regulation slow but kind of
systemic up regulation of the whole with humans and like i said this started with earlier humans
we started being able to increase our adaptive capacity not through genetic mutation we started
being able to increase our adaptive capacity through abstraction through tool making and
through abstract coordination mechanisms people start to get into yeah but animals make tools
you can see even crows will use tools to break things open and chimpanzees will use tools and
the beaver will make a dam and the birds make nests these are extra corporeal adaptations
that they use yes but birds nests for any species are about the same as they were 10,000 or 100,000
or 500,000 years ago for that species they're not evolving their tool set and adaptation occurred
for them that involved them engaging with their environment in a particular way but they're not
recursively making changes on how they do that tooling the same with beavers the same with chimpanzees
and so you can see that a chimpanzee will use a sharp rock to cut something it'll experiment with
the rocks around to see which one experientially cuts faster and if you give it a knife it'll
use the knife but it doesn't design a knife it doesn't design the beginning of stone tools
because the design of it requires this kind of recursive abstraction that says this rock is sharp
this rock is sharper could i make one that is sharper yet in order to do that i have to understand
the abstract principle of sharpness and say what mediates sharpness so it has to do with
the hardness of one material relative to another and it has to do with the angle of the edge and
so the ability for the recursive abstraction that allows us to make a better tool and then see how
to make it again and again that occurred with some degree of complexity of recursive abstraction
process where probably like chimpanzee was right here and just on the other side of a line of neural
development was homo habilis and they had that ability and then it got doubled down with sapiens
and so you can see that we take an abstraction and then we do abstractions on top of it we don't
just see how do we make a sharper thing but then how do we attach it to a bow and arrow and go
ahead so i and my colleagues like john gowdy um attribute the origin of the super organism to
around 10 000 years when we found found agriculture and started to optimize for for surplus and you're
saying that the origins of the super organism was much earlier than that yeah yeah when you look at
a exponential curve that can be fairly flat for a long time and then start to verticalize
the roughly 10 000 years ago agrarian revolution was a major jump but i am going to go back
and look much earlier because already before that happened you had humans behaving as apex
predators in almost every single environment in the world 10 000 years ago and there's no other
animal at all that is like that and that's already a critical thing to understand and it goes along
with your extinct thing of the other hominids so as amazingly well adapted as the cheetah is to the
savanna or the polar bear is to the arctic neither of them survived in the other environment
and yet we were able to because of toolmaking put on clothes create shelters and go become the apex
predator of every single environment that was already really different because it wasn't just
that we could over optimize a single environment then come back into check we had the ability to
go become not only adaptive but apex predators in every environment after we over hunted an
environment it's not only the recursive ability to imagine abstractions and to invent technology
but it's also because we're ultra social we're not a solitary species jonathan height who's
going to be on this show soon in his book the righteous mind says that humans are 95
percent ape and five percent bee like we have a lot of behavioral attributes of the social insects
so that we copy and we coordinate and we collaborate in ways that other species don't
yeah so i chimpanzees are pretty social they're not solitary and bonobos are very social
i wouldn't say that it's about us being more social than them i would say it's about us applying
our abstractions recursively to our coordination mechanisms so language allows a type of sociality
and then written language and formal hierarchies and those are all basically technologies tech
nay of social coordination and so obviously a wolf pack that coordinates is able to
take down a bison the lone wolf never could um so we're not just looking at the adaptive
capacity of a animal but of its coordination our recursive abstraction gave us the ability to
keep making our coordination mechanisms change so we could go from the coordination that happens
in a band to a tribe to much larger tribes to early cities to and so you can see that we're able
to put the more to we're able to change our coordination based on tech that allows more
specialization and division of labor and whatever and able to change our coordination
mechanisms based on the size of the the number of people that are cooperating in the thing
i would say somewhere around 10 000 years ago is when we started to regularly pass the Dunbar
number and where um formalized methods of animal husbandry and agrarian revolution
made a massive jump but before that stone tools language and fire were massive jumps
that distinguished us from everything else and you can see that stone tools was us applying
recursive abstraction to the domain of atoms and we could extend our body's capacity right rather
than the genetic time it takes to grow a longer fang we could just make a spear that's longer than
anything right and then we could keep making longer harder sharper ones and we're able to increase
our predative capacity through a different mechanism it's not genetic selection anymore
it's tool making we're able to increase our predative capacity thus our capacity for
violence and extraction faster than anything else in nature can increase its resilience so
co-selection breaks and it's no longer that as the lion gets a little bit faster the gazelles get
faster it's that we get faster and we can over hunt an entire ecosystem faster than genetic
mutation can take up and then we can go move to another ecosystem over hunt it until we start
farming ecosystems and you know and so this is really different just and so you can see that
the stone tool was our recursive abstraction applied to the domain of atoms to extend our
corporeal capacity our physical body's capacity into instruments fire was abstraction applied to
the domain of energy right we could now generate warmth and move ourselves to environments that
we wouldn't have been fit and get calories from things that wouldn't have been calorically available
for us before via cooking and in doing so though of course we're converting the environment in the
form of trees or whatever into entropy into fire for our utility and language was us applying our
abstraction to the domain of bits or information processing so that we could have more complex
signaling and memory and the memory was so that we could take everything that we had learned and
pass it on via memorization of songs and like that before the written word because if you and I had
to learn math from scratch we wouldn't get to roman numerals but we get to learn what the entire
history probably could if I was really ambitious I might get it as far as roman numerals right but
but if you if you think about we're able to by the time where kids in grade school get the cumulative
effect of the smartest people throughout history thousands of years of their compressed knowledge
so language accelerated entropy on planet earth
it accelerated localized entropy and systemic entropy
and profit is localized entropy and systemic entropy right we're pri which goes along with
privatized gain socialized losses and so I would say with the capacity for recursive abstraction
and the ability to increase our adaptive capacity through a different process and a faster and
more recursively fast process than the rest of nature began the beginning of this thing we call
the human superorganism and the beginning of a process that is ultimately self-terminating
unless it changes process and so then of course the agrarian revolution was a massive jump and it
wasn't one jump it was like three or four or five jumps that we kind of stick together because
before the plow goat herding already out started desertification right our ability to
steward a whole herd of goats meant and protect them from predators meant that we could again
change the environment pretty radically where because we could protect them from predators
the goats could decimate an ecosystem of its plant life and yet it could convert a bunch of plants
that we can't eat into a bunch of goat milk or goat meat meat that we can eat so I would say
that was already a ability for us to maximize caloric extraction at the cost of ecosystems
then the plow and animal husbandry was a the single biggest massive step corresponding with
mechanisms of storage so that grains became really a thing and we've talked about that before
and then irrigation and hydrological systems became a massive thing so there were a few
jumps in the thing that we call the agrarian revolution but they were all jumps in technique
all jumps in our capacity to convert the rest of the environment into things useful for us
faster than the rest of the environment could deal with the adaptive pressures we were putting on it
and then we found the turbo booster in the 18th century and 19th century with fossil carbon and
hydrocarbons and you know I would say the you could look at all along before we used fire to
after we used fire we started getting those extra somatic or extra corporeal calories you're talking
about right like there's a lot of there is a lot of energy being burnt up in that fire to be able
to make food that I couldn't eat raw food that I could eat when cooked right so now the total amount
of calorie per capita is going up beyond the amount that people are eating that is being used to warm
the homes and cook the food and all like that so so a few things happened one was the population
started growing and two was the amount of resource per capita growth so we're on an
exponential resource curve both because of an exponential population curve and a resource
per capita curve simultaneously and each new technological innovation increased this either
allowed us to increase the population faster or the resource per capita or both and of course
again if you have a tribe that says we're not going to use the plow we think that's fucked we
don't want to yoke an animal and beat it all day long because the spirit of the animal we're going
to keep our animistic ideas and live in harmony with nature then they're not going to grow their
population the one who does yoke it and beat it will grow their population they'll win in tribal
warfare wipe the other ones out and so the means the value systems man's dominion over whatever
that corresponds with the tool use will be the ones that proliferate
and that means nothing about them being more true or good or beautiful it means them being more
adaptive in short-term zero-sum type games and it doesn't it also doesn't mean that they were happier
no the tribe that that remained animist might have had happy healthy lives they just died out
because they weren't competitive versus the other tribe now I have to come to because since I just
mentioned zero-sum if you look at a book like non-zero by Robert Wright that argues that the
long arc of history is that humans have been more and more positive some in their dynamics via
moving from tiny bands to tribes to much larger groups that have division of labor across a larger
group where each person rather than have to do everything they would need to survive by themselves
is able to do specialty roles because of trade where they can depend on others so you get more
specialization so you get more total goodness and that inside of the group you get fundamentally
positive some behaviors getting selected for because the group that does more positive
some behaviors gets through this is partly true this is partly true and it's key to underlying
the kind of pink or rosling narrative on the things that are getting better but it's of course
also true that the group that does more coordination or positive some type behavior within itself
within that in group does better in a war with an out group and the war is zero-sum or even
negative some and the pressure of the war forces that other thing to happen and so there's a
relationship between positive some things and zero some things that has to be factored together
and it's also true that what was positive some for the humans within the group was negative
some for nature it was those humans coordinating with more diversity and specialization which meant
more people able to extract more stuff from nature and turn it into useful stuff from humans at the
cost of the ecosystems and then the zero some dynamics with other groups meaning they had to
race to do it faster than the other groups thus the net effect of the total human social activity
was debasing the ecosystem that it depended upon and so that's the other key thing we have to get
is that when we're talking zero some or positive some it's always the pressure between the two of
those and that all of them including the positive some ones or positive some between humans which
is still externalizing the cost to nature and that's a really critical thing to get as we're
getting near the planetary boundaries now so our anthropocentric bias uh is started long ago
so then we go from and you know when we talk about the agricultural revolution we start
moving from kind of Dunbar sized tribes to early city states of a hundred thousand and then a
million people and with them you get the earliest kind of formalized religions and you get massive
class systems hierarchy different kinds of division on gender roles so the social systems
and the cultures change correspondingly once you get a whole lot of grain that is you know
better storable calorie than the meat of the vegetable stuff were earlier you start to also get
way more class system because who has who owns that starts to be very unevenly provisioned
and then with the class system emerges all the aspects of social hierarchy and all that you
also now get more incentive to get raided for all your surplus and so you have more incentive for
the tribal warfare so now you have to make more defenses around it and on and on before we get to
oil we get lots of innovations during that time that have from obviously the water wheels being
used to the on and on but we do get a pretty massive jump at oil and you know when people talk about
the fourth industrial revolution that we're in now the first industrial revolution being oil the
second being electricity the third being computation the fourth now being AI and all the Kurzweil
exponential tech that's a roughly good model we could some people talk about six industrial
revolutions but basically we can look at that there's like a step function in tech and then a
whole bunch of evolution within that epoch and then another step function and then evolution within
the epoch so I would put an asterisk on that that those revolutions all happened while the total
scale and quality of energy for the human enterprise was increasing every single year
other than the 1930s 2020 2009 and at some point the depletion part of the story
for coal oil and natural gas of which we get 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents per year
which is 500 billion human labor equivalent worst although you once told me that was a
gibberish number but plus or minus even if it's 100 billion it's a lot
what happens with those revolutions the tech revolution the industrial revolutions as we have
fewer of those exogenous laborers fossil laborers added to our economy is is a question I think
about a lot yeah when you demonstrate in the animation you made the carbon pulse and how
significant a step function that was and it really corresponds to population well right from the
agricultural revolution until the industrial revolution the population stayed under a half
a billion give or take and to go from a half a billion to eight billion in 300 years given
10 000 years under half a billion you're like whoa that's huge and we hit the first billion at like
1815 and that the other technologies that sit on top of that the electrification the computer
electrification of everything sit on top of and use that underlying energy substrate
that as soon as we hit the point of diminishing energy return on energy investment of that energy
substrate the story starts to change we hit a we hit an inflection point in the story and this
is what I think is so important about I mean one of the things I think is so important about your
work is that it's kind of obvious when you zoom back that the exponential growth requirements of
the economy and the finite planetary boundaries of earth are incompatible that thing doesn't get
to go forever and that's it is kind of obvious but I I really don't know if if more than a quarter
percent of I mean 25 percent of the population see that maybe intuitively or in their gut they do
but that sentence you just said should be understood by a first grader yes and it is
I think it's a fair thing to say let's get let's get everybody to understand that and start to
wrestle with it so let's say it again so originally the financial yeah what does originally mean
with the financial system we can go back to shells mediating barter the the idea of having a
currency that did was not the value itself but was an accepted mediation for things that have value
for goods and services it was it's supposed to be that money equals access to an ability to exchange
goods and services so what we're ultimately interested in is goods and services but of
course as soon as you start getting banking and you start getting the concept of interest
because if I loan you some money I stop having access to be creative with it and if I was creative
and I was growing stuff I'd be growing it during that time so when you pay me back you pay me back
with some interest that represents the growth that I would have had had I kept it which all seems
reasonable now we get a situation where the financial system has its own physics right it
there is a compounding interest of you're going to make whatever percent return you get and then
if you leave it in there the next year you're going to make compounding return on that much again
compounding return curves give you exponential growth rate so the whole global financial system
has an embedded growth obligation that is exponential meaning there has to be exponentially more
total currency in the system every year than previous and then to not debase the value of
the currency that means there has to be exponentially more goods and services that it's
related to otherwise you debase the value of the currency and the financial system collapses
so now the physics of the financial system rather than the financial system being indexed to the real
goods and services now the real goods and services are indexed to the financial system
where the embedded growth obligation just to keep up with interest let alone the many other aspects
of the financial system that create embedded growth obligation mean that there is a demand for
exponential extraction and exponential energy moving through the materials economy turning
into waste and pollution you cannot run exponentially more of a finite planet through a linear materials
economy that has limits on both the front and back side of that linear materials economy forever
so you hit limits of growth or planetary boundaries and since our last conversation
there's been a wellspring of media and research and twitter comments and ted talks
not so much about the energy side because that's been known but about the material limits
because lithium is 900 percent more costly than it was a few years ago
a woman named Olivia Lazard is going to be on this show soon and she has a pithy phrase which
I like which is in an attempt to decouple our economy from carbon we will recouple our economy
to materials so um there's an exponential driver there on materials needed for any energy
infrastructure scaling right so as you point out so well the hydrocarbons are a very energy dense
source of energy and for transportation in particular this is very useful the storage
dynamics so either if we if we want to get off them you need a lot of batteries or you need to
make hydrogen fuel safe or something like that and if you want to move to renewables for the
grid you still need a lot of storage because of intermittency and you need all the materials
necessary to make the windmills of the solar panels the you know whatever other physical
technology go ahead just had a thought is is is that trade-off or that choice or that path
similar to what you said earlier in this conversation about a nation
choosing to not grow so a nation that chooses to do live differently using renewable flows
is giving up some of the other attributes there's a lot of nations that try to do
100% or a large percentage of renewable energy in their electricity sector which globally is only
around 20% of our energy but look at Germany right now they were the poster child of let's do
the right thing environmentally and let's build a low carbon economy but now energy security
is taking a front seat over low carbon transition and look at what's happening to Germany
economically you receive so they were focused on building a low carbon economy in terms of their
domestic production of energy but obviously their carbon demands were imported when they
stopped being able to import it now they have to make up for it this is a point that you and I
mentioned in the first or second one which is that the sustainability metrics we look at have to be
global not national because otherwise you just export your shitty environmental metric somewhere
else so it's easy to say look we produce more dollars per joule than other countries so we're
beating the Garrett relation because we don't do any like mining or infrastructure in our country
we do software but in order to meet all of our needs we're using money to import that stuff from
countries that do that and if you balance it out the the energy and joule dynamic is 99% coupled
or our genie coefficient is better meaning our poorest people relative to our wealthiest people
there's less of a gap but it's because we import all the stuff from countries that have slave labor
and so if you really want to see how good a country is doing you also have to factor its
import export dynamics and figure out how to do attribution on that so real quick 10 second stat
the average american meaning you take all of our energy and divide by 330 million people uses 57
barrel of oil equivalents of fossil fuels per year and we use another 17 that are burned in
other countries in the finished products that we buy there's also the very good uh
there's an online slave calculator where you put in the you know how many plane flights you use and
how many kilowatts your house uses and how much stuff you buy how many people in your household
and it says how many people are uh in the third world in slave like or in entered servitude positions
to make your life work um that's another I've never seen that yeah it's another eye-opening one
because again the genie coefficient in my country might be really nice but the genie coefficient
in the supply chain that my life depends upon is probably not very nice um and so again this is
where we have global dependency global effect so you have to have global governance otherwise
everybody just does not in my backyard and sends the messed up stuff to countries that don't really
have much of a choice um and then has plausible deniability on their own metrics but it's like
that's not real um well I sure am looking forward probably not on this episode but I I'm really
keen to hear your insights and wisdom on the possibility and the the pathway towards global
governance because boy what's going on in the world right now seems like we're moving further away
from that then towards it and I I want to say just because it's such an easy major reaction to have
that when I say global governance what I mean is global government that this is some
new world order order one world government agenda for top-down total control and the debasement of
good nationalism and checks and balances on power and blah blah blah no of course I don't want that
no thinking person wants that um you know unless they assume they're the one who runs the thing in
which case they probably do um and that's important because of but uh uh this is the trade-off we have
to deal with there's a there's a reasonable percentage of the environmental movement that
wants that some sort of environmental authoritarianism unfortunately they probably have over focused on
the environment and under focused on other critical aspects of what makes the world not suck
or suck to that they're not realizing how dystopic a system that has no checks and balances on power
would be humans don't have a good track record at stewarding power well no bless oh bleach the
obligation of the uh nobility class to be noble does not have a good statistical track record
right that power is abused pretty universally has a better track record and so you know we we
talk about the third attractor where there's currently two attractor states for the future
meaning states that are most likely based on the kind of general dynamics we're on there's an attractor
state of increasing catastrophes and there's an attractor state of increasing dystopias the
catastrophes largely result from not having more coordinated governance and so everybody
all the country's racing to grow their GDP to grow their military presence and things like that
equals passing planetary boundaries and the destruction of the environment and
and that leads to cascading catastrophes of lots of types climate change leads to extreme
weather events leads to human migration leads to resource wars leads to large-scale wars leads
to breakdown of infrastructure and supply chain leads to more resource wars blah blah blah right
so that's the catastrophe model and there's a million different ways that can go to avoid that
model you have to be able to prevent those bad things from happening you have to prevent people
in the age of um cheaper and cheaper gene synthesis capabilities from building pandemic
weapons in their basements in the next few years you have to prevent all the countries from racing
forward on using up all the resources as fast as they can in competition with each other you have
to prevent them from military escalation and whatever in order to do that you have to have
some powerful control systems because incentives alone won't do it you will need deterrence and we
can do some proofs of why incentives alone don't do it well if you create powerful enough control
systems to check all the exponential tech and to check all of the externalities how does that not
become dystopic how do you have checks and balances on something that has that much asymmetry of power
on everything else so one attractor is increasing catastrophes the other is that the answer to
the increasing catastrophes is control mechanisms with no checks and balances to become top down
dystopic forces and even if we say no no no they won't be because we'll do we will make sure that
there is some good process of jurisprudence bound to the collective will of the people somehow and
transparency and checks and balances if you make a system that centralized even if the initial
governance of it is good isn't it capturable by negative forces eventually so how do you make a
system that has that much power that is not capturable or corruptible that's the other big
question so the third attractor we're looking for is able to prevent all the catastrophes and have
the coordination system that does that not be corruptible or capturable and that is threading
the eye of a needle and I I don't think it is impossible and it's also not easy
yeah I've I've heard you say that many times or some version of that and it sounds great I
I agree so let's let's thread the needle and I may be naive probably I'm naive but I still
believe that people listening to this program and people meeting each other that are developing
an understanding and a vocabulary and an awareness of the time and place that we're all on this
planet together roughly eight to ten percent of homo sapiens of all time are alive right now
that this is we we have to recognize how we got here in order to change where we're going
and I'm hopeful that some something emergent happens but I just I don't know I think we're
going to have to use less materially and we're not going to choose to do that and there are dangers
on on both sides like you said the oppression and and catastrophe so I really am keen to get to the
point of this conversation where we frame out possible responses at the international level
at the national level and you're probably less interested but I also want to talk about responses
at the community and individual level so what else would you like to cover on the macro overview
before we we get to that point yeah you were talking about some percentage of
homo sapiens coming to understand how we got here I want to come back to the argument we
had at the beginning of what is unique about homo sapien to say let's have some percentage of
homo sapiens understand what is unique about them that then also says what must become true of them
factoring that because we haven't said that quite clearly enough
we were obviously the result of evolutionary process but we were the result of evolutionary
process that gave us the ability to increase our adaptive capacity relative to everything else
in a way that is different than the rest of evolutionary process it is no longer genetic
mutation that is determining our adaptive capacity so if you want to understand the adaptive
capacity of humans first it wasn't individual humans that were selected for there were very
few places where they were individual solo humans it was groups of humans and it was groups of humans
with their coordination mechanisms that were themselves the result of our capacity for abstraction
where we did language and we left markers for each other and we started to do early things
and then obviously written language and whatever but it was also those early humans with our tools
it wasn't a group of humans with their bare hands that could take down a mammoth and it wasn't an
individual human with a spear that could take down a mammoth it was a group of humans with
spears and coordination that could do that and obviously and technology were both required
yeah we talked before about Marvin Harris's model that a civilization can be modeled in
terms of its infrastructure its social structure and its superstructure its infrastructure is the
the physical tooling that it mediates meeting its physical needs with its social structure is
the collective agreement field law basically law governance and its superstructure is its shared
values that are hopefully the basis of its law and its coordination what it's coordinating in
service to so it might be its religion its clan identity its national identity whatever so we can
say that from early on humans what was being selected for was groups of humans with their
infrastructure social structure and superstructure so it was groups of humans with their entire
tech stack because also it wasn't like it's not the spear it's also the hammer that we used to
make the spear and the ability to latch it on to you know with leathers to the base and it was
also the fact that we were able to feed ourselves with previously stored stuff because of the capacity
to dry meats and store them in storage vessels it was that whole interrelated tech stack right
and so what was selected for was the group of humans their coordination mechanisms which included
their social structure and their superstructure and their tech stack and then groups of humans
relative to each other were in intertribal coordination they would trade but also conflict
they would war which drove them to up regulate relative to each other but all of them were
regulating up regulating relative to nature on rap vastly faster time scales meaning able to convert
more of nature into human useful stuff and so given our capacity so the the first thing I want to
say is you can't think about sapiens without thinking about the group of sapiens its coordination
mechanisms and its tooling like implicit in us is all of that because we were not selected for
based on what's in our genome it's our genome plus the extension of that that was actually what was
selected for so when you think about sapiens you actually have to think about the tech stack the
coordination you have to think about all of that as a thing that's being selected for and then
to say because we have the ability to build these adaptive abstractions on top of each other
recursively faster than nature can build resilience to that we have the ability to
advantage ourselves at the expense of each other and at the expense of nature but in so far as at
the expense of each other drives us both up it's all at the expense of nature we have the ability
to destroy whole ecosystems in a way that no other animal can we have the ability now to like
genetically engineer new new creatures we have the ability to like it's so easy to see that we are
not apex predators when you think about a polar bear on a rampage how much destruction it could do
versus what's the video of the SAR bomb when we you know detonated a large nuclear weapon it's like
we we just are not apex predators we're a totally different creature because we have the capacity
to ruin the biosphere upon which we depend we have the necessity to steward it and but no other
animal has to consciously steward all of the ecosystem because they don't have the capacity
to destroy it the ecosystem as a whole stewards itself because of the relative cemeteries of
power of everything with everything because we broke those relative cemeteries of power and we
have so much power relative to everything else either we use that power in service of everything
or in service of our own short-term interests we debase our long-term existence that's the
new superstructure that we have to get I am because we are and the we extends to not just our in group
but all people because otherwise our in group is in an arms race with others that eventually
is too destructive for anybody to make it through but I am because we are where the we means the
everything that we depend upon which means all the other inhabitants of the biosphere that make it
bio-inhabitable for us and so we have and and what I'm saying is actually really simple
because our adaptive capacity has surpassed the process by which evolution usually creates
adaptive capacity our motive also has to transcend normal evolutionary motive
so does that come from education or gut realization or cultural evolution and
emergence or awareness by elites I don't know yeah all the above there's obviously
a disproportionate amount of influence that some people have relative to other people if you run
a major financial institution or you run a military or a nation-state but all those people
that you those are hyperagents and they are going to try to optimize their surplus
to get more power in the game that you said earlier so unless they recognize that they're
going to lose all that or they're going to lose their excess versus the rest of humans
or they're going to lose their planet or life because of a nuclear bomb or a runaway climate
change or something the they're still part of the rushing river going downstream with with
no incentive to change yeah obviously the the overall system disposition is kind of pulling
everybody along with it we do though the same capacity for abstraction that allows us to
build whole built worlds that are different than the ones that we evolved to fit into
the same capacity for abstraction can allow us to see this whole conversation that you and I
are having and say oh we actually have to get off of the current trajectory what would it take to
do that what are minimum thresholds that would take to do that and how do we go about bring that
about popular support absolutely does put real pressure on economic and political uh lever pullers
so do you need like a popular zeitgeist to change yes do you need people in key decision making to
change their understanding also yes those inter inform each other both um
and it's you know what we're what we're talking about is definitely a cultural enlightenment
of a particular type um a cultural enlightenment meaning distributedly everyone coming to understand
the nature of the world they live in differently and better more clearly in a way that leads to
different types of coordination and where the default is if i don't they're gonna therefore
i have to if that remains the default we don't make it for very long as a species or at least
we have enough catastrophe that whoever makes it through makes it through on a biosphere nobody
wants to be on um and so we have to get off of the if if i don't they're gonna so i have to
which means we have to get the capacity for coordination that does not maximize short term
self-interest but that is absolutely aligned with both longer term self-interest and a different
definition of self-interest because as you were mentioning before the culture that did the plow
might have been less happy overall and we're not saying it was we're just saying might have been less
happy or fulfilled than an animistic one but that wasn't what mattered the definition of best
self-interest games theoretically and the definition of best self-interest in any other meaningful way
are not the same and that's another really critical thing when we talk about profit and what's
fundamentally wrong with it we enjoy breathing we value breathing a lot we don't pay for breathing
right because we all just have access to an atmosphere if i cut some trees down
is there less co2 sequester and less oxygen produced so a worse atmosphere yes but so marginally so
that i it affects my breathing seemingly none at all but i immediately get the value of that
lumber and so for me it makes total sense to cut down these trees get the immediate benefit and
still get the benefit of the atmosphere does everybody running that calculus threaten the
atmosphere as a whole yes but unless we all agree to do something different i don't want to be
relatively disadvantaged and i notice the advantage of the trees more than i notice
the disadvantage of the decreased atmosphere so none of us pay for the atmosphere even though
every other thing that we value is not worth shit if we lose our atmosphere right and so if
something is abundant we don't bother putting it in the in the accounting system at all therefore
we end up damaging and debasing it we all want to watch the sunset and the sunrise and to hear
birds chirp but we don't have to pay for that and so what we end up putting our money into is
not things that we value but the subset of things that we value that we can extract that we wouldn't
have access to without the money right and that we can extract and exchange for other type of game
theoretic things so this is it's not just that we get the value calculus wrong and we're not
pricing in the real cost of the environmental externalities of the thing and what it would
cost to produce a thing it's also that what we put dollars into and what we value don't
equal each other because there's a lot of things we value that we don't have to put dollars into
and if i did put some of my dollars into protecting those things then i'm not maximizing my return on
agency because someone else who just takes those things for granted and puts all their dollars into
making more dollars ends up winning in a war and so what that means is what seems most game
theoretically beneficial and what actually optimizes for real value aren't the same thing
game theoretic value and real value have a major delta so the thing that we're saying we have to
do does not equal a decrease in quality of life it does equal a decrease in immediate game
game theoretic capacity relative to someone else but could be not only more sustainable
long-term but higher quality of life for everybody simultaneously so long as we get off of that
coordination failure calculus but by the time we recognize the loss of the birds or
the inability to breathe oxygen a it'll be too late and we'll just miss them
or not be around and b i guess the opportunity is to currently use our ability to have abstractions
and coordination to imagine those costs and have that imagination influence our current
behavior and governance etc that or bust that or bust which i think maps to bender break
we have to queue up our next episode which is going to be what do we do what is the framework
what is these four introductions to the main course of how do we bend and not break
let me first give you a chance to summarize you talked a lot about homo sapiens history of
coordination atoms tools inventions fire how does that correlate to our current
macroeconomic overlay how do those things all fit together if you want to give a
a few minutes summary that we can close on and then queue up the the next episode
yeah you and i talked before about how the superorganism perspective that you've shared
that i think is really important and good has put energy at the center of the consideration and said
the global human superorganism is increasing its ability to use available energy in the
environment and convert everything in the environment to available energy and that with
the agricultural revolution it made a pretty big leap in its ability for caloric surplus the ability
to convert whole areas of ecosystem into grazing land or you know monocrop land and be able to then
you know convert that to storeable grain was it was a huge jump in how much calorie
we could extract from nature obviously we were mentioning that fire was a pretty big one even
before that and agriculture is quite a few steps and that the ability to extract hydrocarbon energy
and then turn that into tractors and everything was a massive step and the way you visualize the
hydrocarbon pulse i think is really illuminating for people but what we're looking at is kind of
thinking about the maximum power principle from the point of view of a superorganism from the
point of view of energy return on energy investment even if we are already at the point of diminishing
energy return on energy investment as long as there is positive return at all meaning we get
back a little bit more energy than we put in we'll continue to use energy to do so as on a system
purely of incentive it takes deterrent to do something other than that and that we've continued
to innovate on methods of extracting energy we figured out how to take it from rock that has
uranium in it when we hadn't realized that before after figuring out how to take it from
you know fossil fuels it seemed like a totally useless thing before and etc
so what do we use the energy for the we use the energy to move stuff around and to configure
stuff into different forms that are useful for us so the use of the energy and the movement of atoms
are correlated we use the energy to mine atoms to refine them to manufacture stuff out of them to
process the waste of them move the waste out of our area and it takes information processing
to be able to do all of this well so there's this pretty tight coupling between the kind of
utility of associated with atoms the utility of energy and the utility of the bits or information
and as we mentioned in terms of like early humans stone tools were beginning of recursive
abstraction in the domain of atoms you know fire was one of the important leaps in the domain of
energy but even the ability to use tools like clothing to maintain body heat energy as opposed
to dissipating it faster to make us adaptive in other environments could already be thought of as
innovations and in energy and atoms intersecting each other that language was this kind of recursive
abstraction applied to information processing and so right now we can see that with what some
people call the third industrial revolution computation there's been this kind of radical
growth in information processing and a lot of new types of services and value and change in the
manufacture of goods that come from that and a lot of people have this hope that the information
processing gives us the ability to produce more value per unit of energy and per unit of physical
goods and therefore we can keep growing GDP without putting all of that as demand on the
environment because we can just do it through growing the value of software and I think you
require materials and atoms you and I would both say yes and no yes software might have less energy
and material demand per dollar worth of output but that there's that's not an exponential curve
it's another s curve where eventually you have a limit on human attention and it doesn't matter
how many movies there are or how much new software there is you get diminishing return on the value
of the digital stuff limited to human attention seconds and then when what you're competing for
is as you do more in the domain of software you're either applying software to human attention or
you're applying it to the materials economy because what else is there so if you're applying it to
the materials economy the innovation in software equals more efficiency at extracting and atoms and
energy extracting converting whatever or it equals human attention seconds for engagement
whether it's Netflix or Facebook or TikTok or whatever and if you do that then the competition
against groups doing that is a competition competition for human attention which ends up being
as our friend Tristan Harris and so many others point out a pretty bad race to the bottom of the
the brainstem for making maximally limbic hijacking stuff and so it's not like the
software proliferation just solves all the problems the software creates a whole new set of
attention hijacking belief hijacking capabilities which are problematic that can drive polarization
addiction low attention spans all those things and or it's simply adding efficiencies to
the materials economy where if you don't have some law or deterrence that limit the upper
boundary you have jevons paradox that when you increase the efficiency you just end up using
more total stuff because more new markets open up and so what we can say is that
sustained competitive advantage of a nation or whatever is not their energy or their atoms or
their information processing it's the binding of all three of those together and their coordination
of the humans within that and that those are fundamentally all tightly coupled to each other
and that from a purely incentive standpoint there will always be an incentive to pursue
whatever the maximum area of return is but to still pursue things that have any return at all
which ends up meaning you extract everything and that doesn't work long-term viability wise so
we do end up having to get something that is not just incentives but deterrence the only reason
you can have a national park is because the incentive for logging is stopped by a deterrent
called the rule of law that says we're not going to cut these trees down and so how do we and yet
the problem is if we're trying to prevent dead zones in oceans from where no one country is
putting all of the nitrogen there it's coming from lots of areas or putting all of the trash or
forever chemicals or whatever it is and in order to stop someone else from doing it and it's another
country you actually have to have war not just law because you don't have monopoly of violence how
do you solve those types of things this is where we realized that the global issues that we face
the global market we have a global market we don't have national markets right we have a global
market that and it's it's important to say that because of course we have national markets but
not really because the laptop that we're both speaking on required global supply chain so
without global trade we actually can't make anything and so we have global markets but we
don't have global governance the incentive alone on the markets will be too the the incentive alone
system is fundamentally incompatible with the biosphere it will continue to extra extract and
externalize and so you have to have some system of deterrence no we're not allowed to do that
at a global system how do we create that and how do we create that that is both
enforceable and non dystopic i think that's some of the tf of where we go next
and the other constraint that i will just add there is the biosphere limits as severe as they are
are not what's going to get us first because your concept of the third or fourth industrial
revolution using technology or in the modern 2020s case ai what that does do is it allows us to
increase enough productivity to pay back prior financial claims the moment we're not able to
service existing financial claims there is a musical chairs moment which may be getting closer
because of what happened in russia and ukraine and and in the uk and and so that is an additional
constraint on top of all the other ones that you look at um but that do you agree with that
all of the various domains are interacting with each other so global finance is interacting
with the environment is interacting with tech is interacting with regulation and so you can't
look at them in isolation and say do we get the catastrophe in this one first or in this one first
when we talk about planetary boundaries
say planetary boundaries with climate change before we hit the planetary boundary of
runaway climate change from albedo effect or whatever it is that would mean we can never fix it
or before we hit the point of venusification well before then we hit the point at which
we will hit the point at which extreme weather events start causing human migration
that will well we're ready that's already locked in we've already passed that point
on small scale so far you know syria was relatively small population and australia
was low population density but as soon as you have australia scale things in high population
density areas then you start getting world changing effects from that and um so that's a place where
we've already passed a planetary tipping point not in terms of the habitability of the planet
biosphere wise but the habitability of some areas for short periods of time that are enough
to cause migrations of people that cause resource pressures that cause wars that cause supply chain
issues so um yeah there's a lot of very near term things that can start to cause breakdown
of the world systems that meet people's needs uh that happen at the interface of a lot of these
areas not just one of them going catastrophic on its own okay um how would you like to lay
some breadcrumbs and a teaser for our next episode do you have an outline for how we should
um approach the bend versus break possible interventions for humans listening to this
show thinking about it and maximizing their impact on the human predicament as opposed to minimizing it
yeah there's a few things that we might talk about next time we could talk about
what are some of the nearest term risks that are quite possibly catastrophic enough that we
really want to prevent them otherwise we lose a lot of possibility if we don't well i mean nuclear
war is the all the elephants in the room as of october 3rd when this conversation is being recorded
in my opinion i would say large-scale war not including nuclear is a big issue nuclear war
is one nuclear war is not only at ukraine between russia and nato forces but since that has happened
and the whole world has got pulled into various aspects of or taken advantage of conflict uh is
real and iran uh armenia azure by john india pakistan china taiwan there's a lot of places
where the conflict has escalated in terms of the possibility of kinetic conflict and a number of
those places are nuclear equipped places so um meaningful war that was not possible during
pax americana is definitely possible now well you and i talk about this a lot off camera um so this
would be a completely another episode but let me just add one more thing to that i can't believe
today there's this like gleeful narrative on twitter uh francis fukiyama and others today
are tweeting that uh russia collapse is not far away and the next few days are going to be a
enormous retreat for russia and i'm just thinking to myself are they that naive that if russia were
to collapse that would be one of the worst possible scenarios because they have thousands and thousands
of nuclear bombs who would be in control of those why would they want not want to sell them to other
countries i mean i the mind boggles at the risk there um but um that that's digressing from our
conversation yeah i i won't get into the specific content of that but what i will say is as you
were mentioning earlier that some people for environmental concerns want to one world government
because they don't think anything else will be able to address the environmental issues in time but
they might be under factoring how bad a one world government would be from any type of government
we've ever had so far regard as far as class system dynamics and oppression goes um most people are
much more aware of the parts of the world system that they look at than the other parts and so they
are able to see something that looks like a win within that domain without factoring how much
that can actually be a loss in other domains yes and this is the problem of siloing and hyper
specialization in a radically interconnected world and i would argue that one of the deepest
generator functions of all of the issues that we face is that our primary processes for solving
problems externalize problems somewhere else because we define the problem too narrowly
and then we look for a solution to that narrowly defined problem that interacts with complex systems
where the externalities go somewhere else and then either someone notices those externalities
says no way and you get polarization or nobody notices it it happens and you actually get the
externality that's half of it i think the other half is that we use social sorting mechanisms
to solve physical world problems and the higher status person that you meet with people defer
to that person whether or not they actually have the technical or or wisdom to to to carry out the
the risk analysis or the intervention um it's just amazing to me at conferences and other places
that we defer to the highest status person to make the decisions which in our tribal ancestral world
made sense if we think about 1776 and the ideas of representative democracy at that time
it was one coming out of modernity you had this idea of the renaissance man polymath individual
who had a classical education who could actually understand the
science of government as george washington called it meaning the politics history economics
sociology as well as all of the areas of industry and infrastructure that were relevant well enough
to represent for their local needs and because the complexity of the overall text act did not
require that level of specialization obviously today that's utter nonsense you couldn't have
a representative understand the issues of nuclear deterrence and the electrical grid
and dead zones in the ocean and manufacturing chemicals and all those things so you're supposed
to have subcommittees that figure that out but um yeah we could identify lengthily the problems
in that system but there is a place where the total complexity of the decision-making stack
does require different decision-making processes exactly and if you don't and and the status thing
often was um what it takes to actually like politically actuate or make something happen
is a different set of skills and what it takes to figure out what the right thing that should
happen is and so the people who have the capability to navigate the status hierarchies and prestige
hierarchies and influence and whatever it is to make shit happen get in those positions
they're supposed to of course be advised by groups of specialists but they're also advised
by vested interest groups that want particular things to go through and um you know that has
all the problems that it does if we if we don't take the current system of governance as a any
aspect of it as a given that we will have representatives at the level of states um
that are called congressmen and senators and that will vote on propositions made by special
interest groups and we just said if we were going to rebuild governance from scratch 21st century
using all the 21st century technologies and factoring the types of problems that we have the
speed at which they occur the complexity how would we do it we would do it in a way that
doesn't look like what how in your nation state in the world runs today exactly um and ultimately
that is one of the things that we have to do so now you we were leaving breadcrumbs we have to do
okay we were leaving breadcrumbs so let me come back to breadcrumbs so there are some very near
term risks you mentioned nuclear and I think there are very near term risks in AI and bio weapons
in planetary boundaries in supply chains and quite a few things meaning there are certain
problems that the existing NGOs and nation states and corporations and IGOs collectively
are not on course to solve in time that if some additional action doesn't take place catastrophic
problems will occur and so those of us who are thinking about what to do are like well there's
a delta between what is on track to happen and what needs to happen how do we close that delta
and anything that is on track to probably happen awesome be very grateful that people are tending
to that look at the stuff that is not probably going to happen that needs to right um if you're
looking at putting you know new energy into the system somewhere so I think there's a bunch of
near term stuff where we're not going to be talking about fundamental change of the systems
we're just talking about how do we avoid this bad thing from happening and maybe we do it through
existing mechanisms like legislation or like getting the right uh people in the right elite
positions to change their mind about something or whatever um so I think of that as triage there's
all of the things that we have to do to simply buy time to get to keep working on deeper things
and there's a lot in that category unfortunately then I think of transitional things which is how
do we work with the existing systems that run the world so capitalism as it currently exists
nation states corporations as they exist and how do we make changes to them that are intelligible
to them that vector them in the right direction so when you look at you know whatever the work that
Larry Lessig and so many folks are looking at regarding ranked choice voting that would decrease
radicalization on both sides um and getting off of just two-party system and fixing gerrymandering and
public campaign finance and things like that those are not building totally new systems they're
things that are intelligible to the current system that would make it less terrible um and
they're worth doing and there's a lot of things like that that you can do to um change nation state
behavior or corporation behavior or things like that the the the b-corp type change in legislation
that says the directors are not fiduciarily obligated to maximize profitability for shareholders but
they are fiduciarily obligated to maximize movement on state admission while maintaining
profitability being able to get you know those types of little legal changes it would affect
corporations there's a bunch of stuff that is like it's not triage meaning it's not preventing one
immediate problem and it's not rethinking the fundamental logic of the system it's moving
the logic of the system in a hackable direction forward and then there's like the long-term stuff
if we were going to rethink it all from scratch we might not have nation states at all we might have
networks of city states because that makes more sense we might have you know how would we redo
it from scratch factoring not just that all of our issues involve global supply chain so there
have to be global dynamics involved factoring that if regulation moves slower than the speed of tech
then it's not going to be able to regulate the thing that is moving much faster than it so if
tech is moving on on compounding curves with exponential tech how do we make a system of
regulation that can keep up with that now that we're in a new era where open publishing had always
been good for science but open publishing of the pandemic viral gene sequences that are found
through gain of function equals increasing everybody's ability to make decentralized
catastrophe weapons in the age of gene synthesizers we have to kind of rethink info sharing there's a
lot of places where it's like whoa the the problem space of the world and the affordances of the new
tech mean that we kind of have to rethink long-term governance from scratch and so
triage transition in long term are three time horizons in which I think about moving forward
that's one model I'll just add this before you comment because I'll put these two together
and then I think and then the infrastructure the social structure and the superstructures
another model what do we have to change in culture in our collective values and what the
definition of the good life and what's meaningful is what do we have to change in our governance
and coordination systems and what do we have to change in our fundamental technology governance
coordination and economics we have to change in our fundamental technologies and how do those
in our affect each other and what are necessary activities in each that lead to necessary and
sufficient collectively across those time horizons those are that's one way of thinking
about what we might want to cover next so is would that be a three by three grid
yeah there are some other threes that we might add in there to dimensionalize the grid three by
three by three grid um if we added that the agents that are playing our hyperagents,
aggregors and institutions then we could add that as a z axis okay this is a good place to stop
so let us promise our listeners and viewers that we will try to fill out that grid with ideas,
directions, um hypotheticals to pass the baton to more humans to engage on this because a lot of
people are the walking worried they know something is horribly wrong that something is on the horizon
and they want to and are willing to play a role in this so let's try to really um both of us kind
of think about that grid and come up with some suggestions and directions uh in a in a um live
creative conversation between the two of us good I look forward to it I have really enjoyed the
way that this series has progressed so far there's one last thing I would share this time
it's a little bit weird might seem off topic but um I've had a busy last week and was under
slept and so I slept long last night and I had one kind of recurring dream all night long and it was
so it's just relevant as we're coming into this podcast which I know I'd be doing today
and the dream that I had all night long was
this movement the world had the people had at scale to it started with recognizing water as sacred
and rather than seeing how much water we could divert for irrigation and agriculture or for
industry and like the kind of power associated with hydrological warfare and domination and like
that there was a sense of the sacredness of the cleanness and aliveness of all the water where
it was deep enough that it changed the motive where everyone was really trying to steward the
cleanness and the availability of water and then of course that also moved from water to
all of the flows of life and so a movement from the utility value of nature as a natural resource
which is of course an inherently commodifying term for life to the sacredness of it and are
like the honor of getting to be in a stewardship role with the sacred
and it was just interesting as we were about to have this podcast today that I had like
12 hours of just that dream on repeat all night. I love that
but given the framing that you just said we are approaching a life or growth choice
but to recognize that water and other life is sacred would be outcompeted by people that and
nations and agrigores that choose growth over life until something else happens and that is the
question or one of the questions. Life or growth unless we talk about growth on a different dimension
so we just talked about the z-axis I would say that are in the next phase we don't stop having a
evolutionary imperative or growth imperative but it moves it moves dimension and it requires
increasing the dimensionality of our reason for being of our calculus that the increase of the
quality of life personally and personally transpersonally the sacredness is actually the domain in
which growth starts to happen that and that there is a way to coordinate towards that that
actually isn't outcompeted by the existing violence domination extraction profit stack
and that can both remove the pathological competition mindset from itself while not
