Plastics, as we said, are man-made synthetic materials, and the feedstock to make them
is the waste product of fossil-carbon refinery for fuel, and this waste product kind of gave rise
to this whole chemical industry. And plastics are incredibly useful. I don't want to let there be
any doubt about that, including for preserving food stuff. The problem with the material is that
it's not inert, so that means that chemically it can interact with the environment it comes in
contact with or with the food stuff, in the case of food packaging, and we call that migration.
So, chemical migration basically describes the transfer of chemicals from the packaging into
the food stuff, and that happens for smaller molecules. I don't know how much chemistry you
want to go into, but basically when you make plastics, you polymerize these molecules that
we call monomers, so these are waste products of our refinery, they're small molecules, and
with a very clever, complex, aggressive chemical reaction, a chain reaction, we make big polymer
molecules, so that's up to 10,000 repeats of your monomer unit. It's one big molecule, and the
polymer is what gives your plastic its moldability, because it's a big molecule, it moves slowly,
it's waxy, and that gives you this formability, moldability, incredibly useful property of plastics.
Now, when you make plastics, you have the monomers, you have a couple of catalysts, and those chemicals
are not pharmaceutically pure grade, right? So, you buy whatever you get on the market at a good
price, and so maybe you've got 80, maybe 90% purity, and the other 10 or 20% is gunk, but that gunk
will also be part of your chemical reaction, and that will also be present in your finished plastic,
and so you actually have a lot of different chemicals that make up plastic, and this is what
fascinates me about this topic, and it has for the last 16 years that I've been working on this,
even the people who manufacture plastics don't know the exact chemical composition of the finished
material, and so we're putting this material in contact with food, we know that its chemical
constituents can transfer from packaging into food, but we don't know exactly what those chemicals are.
