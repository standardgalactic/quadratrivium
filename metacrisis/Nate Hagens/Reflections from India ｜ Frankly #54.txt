Greetings, or should I say Namaste.
I am just back from six weeks in India and lots to report.
My experience there, my insight about humans' behavior, myself and the future, I'm just
back, I've been a little under the weather and I wanted to re-enter the podcast recording
space with my reflections on India.
What an amazing, crazy, beautiful, unexpected place and I think they're at the ground
zero for many of the things that are going to be coming our way in coming decades.
So here's a brief reflection on my first exposure to the country of India.
Of course I've always known that India has almost one and a half billion people.
In subcontinent it's very warm there, it's an ancient culture, but in my mind these
were always facts and until I went there and stayed there and met and lived with and communed
with the people, it really hit me now, it hit my limbic system what that country is going
to experience and it's no longer hypothetical.
So India has one billion, 450 million people approaching one and a half billion, that's
relative to 300 some million for the United States, so five times more.
But their country is about a third the size of the United States, so they're 15 times
more population density and they use mostly coal for energy, around five percent of India's
energy is renewables and Modi just announced last month that they plan to double their
coal production by 2030.
So they recently have been pulled into the global superorganism, their culture is really
really old with a lot of traditions and ancient values and the way the family is and sacrifice
and community, I mean it wasn't that long ago that India was the largest economy in
the world and then there was the British occupation and since then they have kind of been a laggard
in global economy until very recently their economy is growing at over six percent a year.
They're really integrating into global consumption patterns when I was there and you would get
YouTube ads for Play Gin Rummy and all these sweet snacks and the consumerism of the West
is slowly bleeding into this culture.
So I think climate, the scene in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mystery for the Future where the
opening scene was there was a wet bulb event where millions of people died because they
couldn't cool properly, I don't think that will be too science fictiony in the future.
We had a near the end of my trip, we had a meeting with a bunch of Indian NGOs doing environmental
and social work, some of them will be on upcoming Roundtable podcast.
One of the questions addressed migration and people said there are going to be huge migrations
in the future and one of the participants was like well I understand the need for that
but they're going to take our jobs and we have to be cognizant that people that live
here have livelihoods and we don't want migrants to take our jobs and the response was no we're
talking about you having to migrate north because it's going to be too hot to live here
and I was shocked to see when I was there how few people understand climate change let
alone why it's happening and India's role and what's going to happen to India in the
future.
Certainly the NGO leaders and the elites understand it but the common person there does not understand
climate change, they understand that things are getting warmer but not why and what that
means for 10 or 20 years from now.
When I was there I was in the south of India in a town called Auroville which was an amazing
community not really like the rest of India but it was 100 degrees in Mumbai a couple
times when I was there in the middle of winter so I think that some parts of the Indian subcontinent
will become uninhabitable in coming decades and beyond and migration of people both northward
perhaps into Russia or other places but also into India from Bangladesh is a real issue
that I don't think is on a lot of radar screens.
One of the most profound insights I had was the Indic ethic I didn't even know what the
word Indic was and someone said you've heard of Indica and I'm like oh yeah I've heard
of Indica but it's the Indic not religion but just the whole origin of Indian philosophy
and thinking and I was just blown away at how wonderful the people were there and it
makes me think that at less than one tenth of the energy per capita of the United States
how generally happy and stable and outgoing and solid and warm people are there.
44% of the people in India work in agriculture relative to 2% in the United States.
They do import a lot of oil but they're a food exporter and in talks with Andrew Millison
and I'll have him back on to talk about this India can do things ahead of the great simplification
that other countries aren't doing like massive permaculture projects the way to have water
catchment systems to hold the higher standard deviation of rainfall planting trees for response
to global heating you can globally cool and I need to learn a lot more about this because
it's their deep culture and they're just totally non-western way of looking at the world so
I do think that I can't put my finger on it but there's something huge there that could
play a role in our future like some non-violence Gandhi-esque approach to what's coming at a
guy and type scale so I'm going to be learning and talking to more people in India about what's
possible and what's happening there to be honest when I went over there I thought that everyone
would be angry at the United States because we've burned more fossil hydrocarbons than
any other country on the planet they didn't participate in the great acceleration economically
except very recently and they're going to pay the brunt of the global North's emissions and so this
is kind of like the back-end cost of colonialism is going to hit them and yet the spirit and the
culture of that place is just seems really resilient to me one thing I'll add there are
60 million stray dogs in India and only 10 or 15 million that are owned by people there were
dogs everywhere and I'd never experienced that before and in the north they're like wild roving
packs of dogs that it's dangerous to go out because they'll attack you where we were most of them were
fed at night by you know people would set out food for them but there are dogs and cows and
you know it's just such a crazy place I didn't have alcohol because it was illegal there the place
I was in Tamil Nadu and nor did I have meat with the exception of a fish curry and one chicken
tandoor lunch but I gained weight when I was there because there's so much rice and and dosas and
bread and and desserts but I had an amazing time I'll close this brief re-entry with with this
observation the day before I left to come home I did my second presentation as it were to a group
of six-year-old Indian kids and I showed them pictures of birds and video sounds of birds
in Tamil Nadu and we had like a a test so they would mimic the peacock or the hawk cuckoo or
or some of the other birds there and they gave me the biggest hug they like jumped on me like a
mountain and wouldn't let me up and it was just this feeling of oxytocin fullness which I will
explain what I was doing there and my takeaways and my next frankly but then the next night but
when I was leaving for the cab about 10 of the young people that were at this mandala this convening
with my coach they also gave me this massive group hug and they wouldn't let me go to my cab
and I had I eventually made it to the cab and I had to go back to my my room and pick up my backpack
and my four little dogs that I had adopted were all in my porch like saying goodbye to me and so
this this feeling of I don't know love is not the right word but the togetherness and community
I landed in Minneapolis and I had parked my car 45 miles away so I didn't have to pay for parking
there were 14 people on a van that rode for 50 minutes no one said a word to each other
to anyone not even to the driver it was such a stark contrast going from a poor country
extremely poor yet rich in social capital coming to an extremely rich country that
certainly on a relative basis is poor in social capital I have a lot more to say about my trip
about India about the world I have my next 33 franklies mapped out in my mind there's lots to
say lots to discuss this is a very important year for our species and our world and our culture
more come
namaste
and
wow that was so nice you seem beautifully
