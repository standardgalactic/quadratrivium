But at the moment, we are facing a level of geopolitical tension and geoeconomic race
and coupled with fragmentation over supply chains, which is sending markets into all kinds of
panics, that we're essentially seeing that new scramble for resources. It used to be the scramble
for Africa, now it's the scramble for resources writ large, and indeed the Global South is at
the center of it. And this is what needs to be stopped, because if we go down that road,
one, we know what the scramble for Africa gave in terms of legacies regarding global
inequities and inequalities, poverty, political sort of conflicts that needs to be avoided at all
costs, because it's just otherwise trying to, the result would undo any type of effort that has
been put into place over the last 17 years, trying to work towards more peace and more development.
The second problem, and this is where I think that to a certain extent, we need to create the right
sort of narrative and political and economic framework in order to try and reason with power,
is the fact that if we are to, you know, if we were to delve into the scramble for resources,
we would actually plunder the planet on our way to decarbonization. We will actually lose
the future of humanity trying to save it on behalf of the climate, and this is the ultimate irony.
