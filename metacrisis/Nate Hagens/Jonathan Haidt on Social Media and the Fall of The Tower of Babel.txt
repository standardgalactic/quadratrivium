So my argument was most people are reasonable,
but when you get this huge rewiring of social media,
which begins in 2009 with the like button
and the retweet button,
and it really reaches fruition by 2014, 2013, 2014,
you get threaded comments.
You get now everywhere you go,
it's not just comment on this post,
it's comment on the comments on the post.
So now you get people fighting
and arguing within the comments.
That's when I believe the Tower of Babel fell 2014.
And so you ask, how could we get a more humane system?
Well, if what social media did in those years,
I believe is it super empowered the far right,
the far left trolls who are almost all men
who have a personality disorder
and Russian agents or other foreign intelligence agents.
Those four groups, it was like Mark Zuckerberg
and what's his name from Twitter?
So it was as though they said,
here, how about you guys get a hundred X more influence?
Let's just try it.
Okay, you get a hundred X more influence.
And then what happens?
The middle 80%, they're like, this is like, I hate this.
Like, I don't wanna be here.
And so most people don't speak up.
So I believe what happened
wasn't that humanity went insane
or Americans went insane.
It was that a country of overwhelmingly sane people
suddenly found the dynamics altered
within this space of just a few years, just a few years.
Twitter was even a nice place when I first got on it,
like 2009 or 2010, whatever.
In just a few years, the dynamics were altered
so that now it's just nasty.
And it's that nastiness that's made it easy
for a single person who's upset
to force a professor to be fired,
to cause embarrassment to a university, whatever it is.
This is what's driven us insane.
This is what I call structural stupidity.
