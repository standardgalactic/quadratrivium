I think that if we look at the the 19th century and the the real rise to economic preeminence
of Britain, I mean Britain had obviously established itself as a perhaps the dominant
naval power even in the 18th century by the middle second third of the 18th century before the
industrial revolution but its economic preeminence comes with the industrial revolution
and if we say then like well why did Britain industrialise before any other country in the
world? I think that the answer is not only that it had significant or abundant domestic coal
but also because they've been using coal actually for a very long time for heating
purposes pretty much again unlike anywhere else going back even the 12th century certainly in the
by the 13th century it had incentive to find ways of extracting deeper coal. The steam engine the
first purpose of the steam engine was to do precisely that to be used in mining and then the steam
engine ran off coal so you kind of like it's a it's a circular phenomenon. If you then look at the
way in which British naval power developed in the 19th century and you look at something that I think
is pretty significant in world history which is the and I say world history very deliberately is
the first opium war and the opening up of imperial china it's British steamships that now are able to
be much more powerful than any sail-based navy could be. If you then look at the German story
Germany is advantaged like Britain by having coal a lot of coal but unlike Britain it actually doesn't
have iron deposits that are adjacent to the coal quite a lot of the iron deposits are in Alsace-Lorraine
France doesn't have coal even just saying that like that explains I think quite a lot as to why
between 1870 and the creation of Germany through the Second World War Alsace-Lorraine is a central
part of the conflict between like France and Germany explains why the European coal and steel
community the first part of the European project effectively was a means of giving France access
to that West German coal. If we then bring oil into it the thing that's really hard for every
European power except for Austria really in the beginning of the 20th century is they don't have
any domestically. If you look at the beginning of the 20th century the two large oil producers of
the United States and Russia I don't think it's a coincidence that they are going to go on albeit
in the case of Russia in the form of the Soviet Union to dominate the 20th century geopolitically
to take over the European imperial powers by contrast are going to be you know eclipsed.
Britain tries to deal with its oil problem which it does sort of moderately successfully
by extending its empire around oil i.e sphere of influence in Persia what was Mesopotamia what
will become Iraq in the post First World War. Germany loses desperately in that contest during
the First World War it ends up with nothing in the Middle East. It tries to take Baku which is the
basis of the now Soviet oil industry and fails. So Hitler's invasion of Russia has puzzled
historians but you suggested it was at least partly about oil did I understand that correctly
from your work? Yeah I mean I'm not the first person who's made this argument though people who
know a lot more about this than I do but I think that if you understand that Germany was in from
its point of view and this is I'm not talking about Weimar Germany so after the First World War
in a really very difficult position because it had lost the war in the Middle East is its bank
made well one of its most important basically it's most important bank Deutsche Bank which
had effectively operated as its international oil company in the pre-1914 world held 25 percent of
the shares in what was then called the Turkish Petroleum Company which had the concession for
drilling in Mesopotamia and as part of the peace then Germany had to hand over or Deutsche Bank had
to hand over that ultimately to France so the Germans begin in the Weimar period on a program
of creating synthetic fuel which is essentially to create an artificial version of oil from coal
Hitler expands yeah Hitler expands that program but there is no way that he can engage the Nazis
under Hitler can engage in wall of conquest without much more oil supply than they actually have
by the summer of 1941 it's pretty clear that the conquered territories that Germany Nazi Germany
has by that point plus synthetic fuel is not sufficient and Hitler was I would say apocalyptically
obsessed with energy he thought that the only way forward for Germany if it was going to stay in the
war was to conquer Baku which is in present day Abadjajah which was then the center of the Soviet
oil industry
