You're listening to The Great Simplification with Nate Hagins, that's me.
On this show we try to explore and simplify what's happening with energy, the economy,
the environment and our society.
Together with scientists, experts and leaders, this show is about understanding the bird's
eye view of how everything fits together, where we go from here and what we can do about
it as a society and as individuals.
Today's guest is senior scientist at the Nelson Institute for Environmental Sciences
at the University of Wisconsin, Professor Steve Vavras.
Steve is a climate scientist with a specialization in Arctic climate dynamics and has contributed
to IPCC modeling of Earth's paleoclimate and future climate.
Today, Steve and I discuss the state of current climate modeling, the potential implications
of an ice-free Arctic and other aspects of our rapidly changing environmental situation.
Global warming and human macro systems are incredibly complex.
I found our discussion helpful to understand the context of our current climate situation
and I hope you do too.
Please welcome Professor Steve Vavras.
Hello, Steve.
Good to see you.
Nice to see you too, Nate.
You are an IPCC climate scientist and an environmental science professor at the University of Wisconsin,
but going way back and I don't know the answer to this because we've never talked about it,
how did you first get interested in the environment and studying Earth's climate?
Well, my interest in climate is kind of a combination of my long-term interest in weather
since I was a boy growing up in Indiana where we had lots of tornadoes and thunderstorms
and blizzards and the like.
So I was interested in weather for a long time and then when I got to college I developed
an interest in environmental issues and one of the big issues at that time was acid rain
and that's a natural for anyone with an interest in weather.
And so this was sort of mid to late 80s and just at that time climate change was emerging
as another major environmental issue by the late 80s and so that became natural to merge
my interest in weather with environmental concerns, acid rain and then climate change
and so then when I had time to pick grad school decided that the climate would be the way
to go.
So I followed that path and haven't looked back.
Not to go down a sidetrack, but whatever happened to acid rain, I used to think that
all the lakes in upstate New York and Ontario were infertile for fish or things like that
but I haven't heard much about acid rain lately, do you have a 30-second update on that?
Yeah, it's a great policy success.
So it was a combination of policies that I think a major national cap and trade system
put in place that worked and then another solution was people built taller smokestacks
to kind of spread out some of the pollutants so it wasn't so concentrated in the Ohio
Valley and so the combination of those things has meant that we virtually never hear about
acid rain anymore in this country at least.
So it's encouraging, it means that policy can be effective in these kind of issues.
So in that case, the pollution from burning coal for instance was a local and regional
thing so if they're coal plants in China, they didn't result in acid rain in the Adirondacks
but CO2 is a different story.
Exactly, CO2, methane, those are globally mixed and so the solutions do require some
different strategies.
So it is true that acid rain is much more of a localized problem and the other reason
why it's become less of an issue is because we burn a lot less coal than we used to.
So that's yet a third reason but that's not true everywhere.
Obviously in China it's still a big coal burning country.
Does China have an acid rain problem today?
It's a good question.
I don't know.
I would assume they do but I haven't followed.
I think India might be in the same boat.
We know that there's some really bad air pollution at times in China and India that make the news
every winter when the air is more stagnant so I assume so but I haven't really followed
that.
Okay, thanks.
I want to ask you on, you are a climate expert but also specifically an Arctic specialist.
Just to get us off in the right direction, can you give an overview of the importance
of the Arctic for Earth's climate and with respect to climate change?
Yeah, so the Arctic and the Antarctic are Earth's freezers in the climate system.
So they're the one end of the temperature spectrum, the tropics being the other end,
the hot end, the oven and so between those two extremes our weather happens and the reason
why we have interesting weather in the Middle Attitudes especially is because of that competition
between the polar regions and the hot tropics and sometimes one gains the upper hand, sometimes
the other end gains the upper hand but it's that dynamic, that in equilibrium that results
in our day to day weather patterns and the storms that we get and jet stream meanders
and all sorts of things that we can talk about later but the Arctic is critical then because
it is one of the poles or one of the bookends of the system.
Another reason is that we have so much snow and ice locked up in polar regions, if that
substantially melts it means for one thing that sea levels will rise and that's a major
climatic concern these days.
So I've read just recently that the Arctic is warming roughly four times the average
of the whole world so what are the implications of that and my understanding of global hydrological
wind cycles is that they are based on the temperature differential from the equator
to the poles and if the poles are warming rapidly that temperature differential declines,
does that have an impact on our weather and our wind and all that?
Right, so in terms of global weather patterns this is the concern is that the weather, the
jet stream, say the speed of the jet stream winds that really are the highway for our
day to day weather systems, that strength and how meandering the jet stream is depends
on this temperature difference between the warm tropics and the cold poles.
The bigger that temperature difference, generally the stronger the jet stream and the more west
to east it flows.
With climate warming the tropics warm but the Arctic warms a lot more as he said up
to four times as much and so that reduces that temperature difference between high and low
latitudes and it means that it should slow down the jet stream winds and it makes them
more prone to meanders too and that combination of a more meandering jet stream and a slower
moving jet stream can often lead to extreme weather events that are very prolonged and
persistent over a number of days whether it's drought, heat or flooding.
So we both live in Wisconsin and the last few winters and summers if I recall we've experienced
polar vortexes and these heat domes are these related to global warming the mechanism you
just mentioned and the jet stream and you can you specifically describe the mechanics
of how this polar vortex comes into being and stays.
This is a huge topic and it's a controversial one there's a lot of people doing research
on it and one of the questions that you asked is how it's related to climate change.
It's such a difficult one to answer because these sorts of polar vortexes and heat domes
are natural too I mean regardless of climate change they've been happening forever.
So when one of them occurs it's difficult to pinpoint and say well this one is because
of climate change that one wasn't.
What we need to do is look partly at statistics to see if the frequency of these are changing
in which case that might be related to climate change and whether the intensity of these
is changing which might be a result of climate change.
So for instance just this past summer just a month or so ago Europe broke all time heat
records got up to 104 degrees around London unprecedented there and so that would be an
example where we could say well yeah they've had heat domes before but never won this intense
and similarly last summer in the Pacific Northwest Canada said it's all-time temperature record
121 degrees Fahrenheit I think and so when you start to get intensities of events that
are outside the historical record then we take notice and possibly attribute it to climate
change in this case a warming climate.
So in your research does it suggest that polar vortices are going to get more common in the
future is that not something that comes out of the models.
The jury is still out on that so this is a topic that I've been studying for about a
decade and there's it's a mixed bag between what the climate models project and what some
of the observational evidence shows.
Theoretically like I said with the weekend jet stream or weekend jet stream winds tending
to be more meandering as the Arctic warms faster than lower latitudes one would expect
that these polar vortices breaking off from Arctic air masses would become more common
but at the same time as the Arctic is warmer it means that the formation of these air masses
is also warmer and so it's possible that we might get more frequent Arctic air masses
in the future but they wouldn't be as intense as they used to be so instead of maybe minus
30 degree air maybe they'd be more like minus 10 degree air which is still cold but it wouldn't
be as severe as before but it is a conundrum in the past decade we've had two very high
profile extreme cold waves in Wisconsin 2014 and 2019 including some of the coldest temperatures
on record in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois and yet it's happening in a warming
climate so it shows that it is possible to have these counterintuitive daily weather extremes
even though the climate is unmistakably getting warmer.
Except we are emotional creatures we humans and I remember those cold snaps here in Wisconsin
and you go out and talk to people and they're like climate global warming is bullshit it's
30 degrees below zero because they can't see the longer term distribution and these are
still tail events within a warming distribution.
Right exactly we all have a recency bias so.
Yes exactly can you walk us through there's lots of discussion about positive feedbacks
and tipping points especially in the Arctic can you give us a kind of an overview and
a mechanistic understanding of various tipping points in the Arctic?
Yeah so if positive feedback is a vicious circle so if something happens that causes
something else to happen that reinforces the initial forcing so for example the Arctic
is full of these positive feedbacks like with ice cover the climate starts to warm we start
to melt ice cover melting ice exposes either dark ocean or darker land that allows more sunlight
to be absorbed more sunlight being absorbed warms up the surface even more so you get
even more snow and ice melt and so it just feeds on itself and it makes it even warmer than it
would have been without these amplifying feedbacks and so one of the reasons the Arctic is warming
so much faster than the rest of the world is because of these positive feedbacks in that region
in and snow and ice is a lot more prevalent in the Arctic and the Antarctic than it is
elsewhere in the world so there's the potential for these initial warmings from more heat trapping
gases in the atmosphere to have a much bigger temperature response in high latitudes than
they do even in mid latitudes and certainly more than lower latitudes and so that is the concern
there's still plenty of ice and snow cover to melt in high latitudes and so as the climate
continues to warm these positive feedbacks will continue to be operative so you mentioned ice
and snow having a lower albedo than dark water but what are the other feedbacks higher albedo
reflectivity higher albedo higher reflectivity of incoming sunlight what are other feedbacks what
what about the permafrost is that considered part of the Arctic feedback potential and tipping point
yeah so one of the concerns about permafrost is that there's a huge amount of carbon stored in
the frozen soils of the Arctic in fact there's more carbon stored in Arctic permafrost than
exists in the entire atmosphere and so if even some of that carbon were released into the atmosphere
because of thawing soils permafrost degrading and that carbon getting back into the atmosphere
that could be a really strong positive feedback so that's one additional positive feedback
potentially in the Arctic the jury is still out on how powerful that might be or how how and when
it might happen but another one is the loss from ice sheets so Greenland and Antarctica and the other
hemisphere are prone to potentially rapid ice loss and we're seeing it right now through a phenomenon
in which the warming waters of the upper ocean get underneath the glaciers and help to melt it from
below and they melt these ice shells which are kind of like door jams stopping the the backed up
ice sheets from flowing into the ocean and when you remove that stop it allows a lot more
glacial ice to cave into the ocean and so it could really accelerate how quickly the ice sheets
in Greenland and Antarctica melt and so that's another potential feedback that's could be very
important and then a third is the boreal forests so right now we have a lot of tundra as you get
far enough north a little bit south we have extensive tree cover the so-called boreal forest
which is dark and if the boreal forest spreads far enough that provides a lot darker surface
potentially year-round compared to the tundra which is white in the winter and so that too
could absorb more sunlight and act as a positive feedback so scientists are interested in the
Arctic because of all these positive feedbacks and it's a very sensitive region of the climate
system as a result so the last I looked at the primary literature granted it was a few years ago
it seemed that the rcp 8.5 which you and I have talked about before which is now being
finally recognized to being biophysically implausible like we likely don't have that much
affordable carbon to burn was the only scenario where huge positive biological feedbacks occurred
like permafrost methane some of the things you just mentioned if we were to use more realistic
fossil fuel scenarios like the recent iea or the ar6 moderate action scenario what does that imply
about some of the feedbacks that you just mentioned are they moderate do they not kick off at all or
does it not matter we're going to hit them regardless or what is this a recent science
suggesting about that well it does stand to reason that if we have a lower estimate of future carbon
emissions that some of these tipping point feedbacks that are really potentially extreme
like massive permafrost thought and ice sheet collapses that those become less likely at least
in the near term i mean eventually beyond 2100 it's it's really hard to say when you go beyond
a century in the future but one of the few pieces of good news i would say in recent years regarding
climate change is the realization as you've talked about for a long time that some of these high
end emissions scenarios are implausible and so maybe more of the moderate expectations or scenarios
are probably the future that we're most likely looking at i remember like 10 years ago or whenever
we first met you you would get in a better mood when you would talk to me because i would explain
that to you and you were so worried about climate change that any news that we weren't going to hit
those outlier eventual rcp high numbers that made you more hopeful about the end result
definitely and and that's something that a lot of climate modelers like me have been slow to
to grasp most of us traditionally have used the the very high end rcp 8.5 and and it's equivalent
without realizing understanding really that the economics and some of the other factors societal
factors would probably make that very unlikely and so i've i've made a lot of climate modelers
happier because of that information well i don't think we're out of the woods because even though
i think it's becoming more widely known that we don't have that amount of fossil hydrocarbons
to burn and the ipcc may be overly optimistic on how much of that is in the system i think
possibly the complexity and rapidity of the biological feedbacks may be underestimated
in these these global models do you have a thought on that it could be because the biochemical
aspects of the system are the the hardest to predict including human behavior i mean we're
part of we're bio right and so trying to predict human behavior is extremely hard anyway but even
if you limit it to more of the traditional biosphere i think those are a lot of wild cards
that we don't have as good a handle on whereas the climate models when they were designed they
were based on you know fluid dynamics which is something that doesn't have the agency of thinking
the way let's say tree cover it's like boreal forest expanding would have and so the biological
feedbacks are a lot harder to anticipate yeah not only that i mean the climate models the new ones
are some of the most complex models ever created but that's just the climate system if we add on
to that the social the financial the complex six-continent supply chain the aggregate and
individual human behavior it's unbelievably complicated but let me ask you on that so
you're a scientist you work on models so you know that there are things that we don't know
and that there are also unknown unknowns as far as climate change per se setting aside human
behavior and and energy and such but as far as climate change how much are unknown knowns and
unknown unknowns still out there or have you guys really honed in on understanding how the climate
works well i guess by definition an unknown unknown is an unknown right but in terms of
adding more complexity we have added more complexity and that in a way that's good because
it's a better representation of the totality of the system but it also makes the the models more
complicated it makes them harder to diagnose it also can make them a little harder to behave
correctly because it when you try to calibrate the model based on the historical climate record to
make sure your model is accurate it becomes increasingly difficult to produce as realistic
assimilation as we'd like when you add more of these complicated feedbacks in and so for
instance clouds have always been a bugaboo is trying to handle those correctly as we add more
complex cloud physics that we know are realistic it also makes it harder to control these models
and their behavior so it's it's always a constant struggle among climate models to add complexity
but not so much that you change your models to the point where they they're no longer trustworthy
is there one or a half dozen climate modelers on ipcc that are like
one-ring rules them all they they understand the whole system or is it a bunch of people like you
that have a specific expertise that are adding that into the system and no one person understands
it all now it's the definitely the latter so when when i go to conferences it's become so
interdisciplinary there are people who's you know who's scientific language i can't even understand
and they can't understand mine so you have oceanographers glaciologists biologists chemists
computer scientists all sorts of people in the climate modeling world and we we talk to each
other we try to understand each other's language so to speak but we all are coming at it from a
different perspective and that can be useful because you make sure nobody's forgotten anything
but it can also tend to bog you down compared to the early days of simpler climate models that
were essentially just representing the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere in the ocean thank you
okay let's get back to the arctic so if the arctic is warming at four times the world average
wouldn't it be possible that even if the earth eventually stabilizes because of declining
fossil carbon burning at one and a half to two degrees celsius above pre-industrial doesn't that
imply like five or six degrees celsius in the arctic and wouldn't that be enough to in turn
kick off more of those tipping points and feedbacks you mentioned yes it would and the the so-called
arctic amplification of global warming is a very real thing we've observed it in the last several
decades we know it from the paleoclimate record from the geologic past when times of dinosaurs the
the poles were ice-free hard to believe but it was the the warmest the biggest warming region of the
world compared with other regions like the tropics and of course in climate models they've been very
consistent that it as the the earth warms the arctic and eventually the Antarctic warm more too
and so you're right so these the concern is that any sort of tipping point feedbacks not just the
snow and ice albedo feedback that we talked about earlier but some of the massive ones that are
wildcards like huge carbon loss from permafrost thawing or greenland ice sheet destruction
or collapse of one of the Antarctic ice sheets those kinds of tipping points as we get more and
more warming in the globe and amplified in high latitudes that's what keep climatologists up at
night is worrying about those sorts of wildcard scenarios so let's talk about one of those scenarios
there's a lot of doomsday talk on the internet on this topic and many topics actually uh and
there's also outright dismissals of climate risk but one topic in particular that i've heard a lot
about especially recently is a blue ocean event in the near future and some people assume that if
there is a blue ocean event that signals runaway climate change due to the lower albedo and absorption
of more incoming heat etc so first of all what is a blue ocean event when is the last time that
earth experienced that and what do you think about if that happens in the future or what does it imply
well by blue ocean event i assume you mean or ice free conditions in the in the arctic ocean for
example correct as we transform from white to blue yeah yes so this is the direction we're
headed and in terms of seasonal blue ocean so summertime ice loss complete ice loss in the
arctic ocean it's likely based on climate modeling that that's going to happen as early as the next
few decades so that wouldn't mean annual completely blue ocean all winter long but in the summer for
at least a period and as the climate warms even more that means more and more months would be blue
instead of white as they have been so the first time that that happens in a couple decades maybe
then at first it's just a seasonal but while it's seasonal that itself would be a positive
feedback which would accelerate warming around the earth because of the incoming heat absorption
right and it's not binary it's not like all of a sudden once we have one that has complete ice
loss it would have massively different effects than the year before that was nearly complete
ice loss in the summer but that is true so it would have these you know broader consequences
the last time we think that the world and the arctic was really significantly warmer than
today unless ice cover was seasonal ice free potentially ice free conditions was the last
interglacial period which peaked 125 000 years ago so over a hundred thousand years it's been
since we're looking at some of the changes in the arctic that we're expecting in the near future
to put that in perspective that that kind of warming that we had 125 000 years ago
was enough to raise global sea levels six to nine meters so that's about 20 to 30 feet
compared to today we're worried about potentially one meter of sea level rise in the future haven't
we in the last 25 000 years the sea levels risen over 400 feet so the low level of the ice sheets
are low levels of sea level rather during the the peak of the last ice age the last glacial
maximum about 20 000 years ago sea levels were about 120 meters lower or about 360 feet lower
than they are today it's a huge drop I mean enough to connect Russia with Alaska for example so since
then in in rapid fashion during the last 10 000 years or so or 20 000 years there were these massive
increases in the rate of sea level rise over time those got slower and slower as most of the
ice sheets had melted and so over the last 6000 years the sea levels haven't changed dramatically
but during maybe 15 000 10 000 years ago we had some of these meltwater pulse events where he had
these huge levels of sea level increase but one of the concerns about sea level rise is that not
only does it have huge consequences because people around the world disproportionately live on coast
lines but it has such a long-term effect so even though even if we could get carbon emissions
under control and get temperatures moderated through policy changes and and other actions
sea levels would continue to rise and so this is going to be a problem with us not just for years
or decades but even centuries because there's such a long big time lag in the response of sea
level to climate warming so what about the mechanics of situations that are really difficult to model
because they lie outside observe parameters or system states I'm not aware of any published
literature but what might change with a permanent seasonal blue ocean in the Arctic when the heat
loss in the winter from the ocean to the atmosphere overcompensates heat gain in the summer
from a lower albedo heating the atmosphere disturbing the jet stream what would happen
if the center of cold in the Arctic which is right now like at the north pole is no longer
the north pole but moves to the Greenland ice sheet which would be at that point the remaining
cold mass would the jet stream like tilt significantly more you walk us through such
a change or do I have that all wrong perhaps from first principles is that being considered at all
yeah so this is these kinds of scenarios are what we can test in climate models and for instance
people have done a quite a bit of climate modeling of the last interglacial period in part to study
that very question and so we know at that time there was a lot less sea ice at least in the summer
Greenland was also the Greenland ice sheet was also largely contracted but we can look at those
kinds of climate scenarios or climate periods where we we might lose enough sea ice to shift
toward the cold core being around Greenland and look at how the climate model thinks the jet
stream would behave so one thing to consider is that it wouldn't necessarily mean a fundamental
transformation of atmospheric circulation right now we have two major jet streams one's called
the polar jet stream that's located farther north you know sort of 40 to 60 degrees latitude
and the other being the subtropical jet stream that's located around 20 or 30 degrees latitude
no matter what the climate we're going to have both of those jet streams but their location their
speed how wavy they are those are all sorts of things that can and probably would change
with climate change either colder or warmer or even these drastic kinds of climates that
you're describing in which Greenland becomes the core cold pole and we no longer have extensive
ice cover in the Arctic Ocean so getting back to the seasonal ice free Arctic do you think that
that it's possible that could happen and then 10 years after that we have the same season we have
ice in the Arctic again or is it a tipping point of no return yeah it's a good question people
have studied this and that's something also that's pretty amenable to addressing with climate
models and it looks like in the case of sea ice loss that it's not irreversible so if we did start
to lose ice cover seasonally if we found a way to cool the climate the ice would come back and so
that's encouraging when it comes to things like the loss of ice sheets like Greenland or the east
Antarctic ice sheet or west Antarctic ice sheet that's a different story because that's a much
slower process and there are various other feedbacks that would probably prevent or largely
thwart the ice sheets from returning anytime in the near future so sea ice is a faster responding
part of the climate system and probably it's not part of a tipping point mechanism the way some
of the other components could be that makes sense here's a dumb question you are known and at on
your website and everything as an Arctic specialist when you say that does that also include Antarctica
or not a bit of yes and no so most of my studies have been in the Arctic but I also have studied
the Antarctic and the nice thing about using global climate models is that you can look
anywhere in the world and obviously the Arctic and the Antarctic share certain similarities
but there are also some important differences so one of the things people always point out
is that Antarctica is a landmass surrounded by ocean and the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by
landmass so that the north pole is right in the middle of the Arctic Ocean whereas the south pole
is right on the Antarctic ice sheet so there are some fundamental differences between the two
and it's largely because the Antarctic has that gigantic mass of ice that it is slower to respond
to climate change than is the Arctic so one of the reasons why we hear so much about the Arctic
and Arctic amplification and so forth compared to Antarctic amplification is because the Arctic
really is responding more quickly more dramatically at least in the near term than Antarctica but that
said those positive feedbacks can and likely will kick in eventually in Antarctica and that will
provide even more oomph to the warming when that happens. I'm going to ask you some personal
questions at the end of this interview but for now I'm just curious if we just stick to climate
change not human systems or our economy or our culture or anything like that of the things that
you research what thing keeps you up at night what aspect of the climate system or the feedbacks
that you've been discussing are you most worried about? A lot of what I hear about ice sheet loss
concerns me a great deal partly because I don't think we fully understand it when you look at the
uncertainty bars in the IPCC report they're very large around sea level traditionally the IPCC has
made projections on the very conservative side about how much sea level will rise in the future
but others have pointed out that it's entirely possible that we're going to see much larger
sea level increases in the future in the near term even in the next century than the IPCC has
warned us about and then like I said before long term sea level is a something that's not going to
just stop even if we can get temperatures stabilized that'll continue long into the future and because
so many people live along coastlines it's so expensive to move there's all sorts of problems
societal problems that come from sea level increase that is something that concerns me a great deal
personally and of course I'm not a climate scientist but of all the impacts sea level
rise is one of the ones I'm least worried about with respect to the oceans there's a
certification there's the change in the thermal hairline circulation and the amock you know
overfishing the impact of the food webs on cetaceans and other things I worry about those
things more than sea level rise because they seem to me kind of not permanent but semi-permanent
and we can always move inland a century from now I'm not belittling sea level rise but to me
that just doesn't strike my emotions such as some of the other things I mentioned
well and some of the things you mentioned are more immediate you know overfishing that that's
something you know very immediate ocean acidification again a long-term problem kind of an invisible
problem compared to sea level rise but it's still very much there and if we have time to talk about
geoengineering solutions one of the criticisms that's been made of that is that some of these
schemes that have been proposed might be able to help curtail the rise in temperature but they would
do nothing to reduce the problem of ocean acidification because they don't find ways to
reduce the carbon in the atmosphere that's ultimately acidifying the oceans we are a problem
solving species and when we isolate the problem instead of looking at the system we end up pushing
the problem elsewhere and yeah let's talk about geoengineering it will we reach a point as a culture
where the impacts on climate and what's coming ahead are so obvious that policymakers around the
world will have to take drastic steps what do you think about that eventuality and what are some of
the geoengineering things that are being discussed that that you find at least plausible or possible
yeah so I think the key word that you use there was culture whose culture whose country who's
making the decision who has the power you know all of these things are up for grabs right now I
think it's an incredibly thorny legal question that we've not even scratched the surface on
there are geoengineering schemes that are relatively inexpensive the one that's been proposed the most
is pumping sulfate aerosols high into the atmosphere sort of recreating a and artificially
creating a major volcano so when we get major volcanoes the the nature naturally spews a lot
of carbon into the atmosphere sulfate aerosols high into the atmosphere and that creates kind of a
an umbrella that blocks some sunlight and so temporarily for a year or two the climate cools
a bit and then it rebounds but those sorts of geoengineering schemes have been shown to be
relatively inexpensive which means that someone or some country could do it in terms of the cost of
it but that raises the big question who has the the authority who has the power what if there are
unintended consequences which there almost certainly would be how do we navigate this legally
not ethically too but legally as well I have no idea how we're going to cope with this if people
try to engage in these geoengineering schemes on a large scale some of my speculation and some of
my earth day talks and it may border on science fiction but I can see the energetic economic
logic of it is that we continue to grow our economy which is measured by GDP but GDP only
cares about the gross energy not the net so if we're throwing more money into drilling shale oil
all that extra cost goes to the drillers and the pumpers and the frackers so it grows our gross
GDP but that energy and money have to come from somewhere else in the economy and I can envision
that 30 50 years from now we're spending a lot of our energy to get energy that we need and we're
also spending a lot of our energy to mitigate the damage to the environment which means that
outside of those two sources of energy there's a lot left a less left for hospitals and ballet and
fancy restaurants and air travel etc but it almost seems like we're going to have to somehow
globally think of geoengineering strategies at some point I'm friends with the people who
run Vesta which is an organization looking at crushed olivine rock that they put on beaches
it's like green sand and then the ocean comes and pulls it in and the waves churn it and it
absorbs CO2 and sequesters it and it sinks to the bottom of the ocean I don't know how scalable
that is I think the energetics of it actually look favorable but like you said the legal frameworks
of how such a thing would meaningful scale are beyond our current ability right yeah other people
have proposed brightening sea ice or brightening snow cover to try to reflect solar energy there's
all sorts of things that one could do but who has the authority to actually do it and you need to
have some way to to evaluate whether it's effective and what any kind of side effects are so and I
mean this as a compliment so far on this call you are speaking almost as if it were a peer review
conversation perfect science uncertainty facts but I know you as a person and I know you are very
emotionally invested in the environment and that you care deeply about these things how do you manage
as a human phase shifting between being an impartial scientist compiling and describing data and
being a human with emotions and anxiety and ethics and a family yeah I get that question a lot more
and more in fact as this problem becomes more apparent it is critical I mean one thing to say
upfront is that all scientists are human first and scientists second and my obviously I'm no exception
so I'm I'm emotionally alarmed when I hear these new stories pretty much every day about some new
impact or discovery about the climate system and climate change so there is that on the other hand
day to day I am focused on on my job trying to meet deadlines get a paper out get a proposal
finished that sort of thing and so I necessarily have to put blinders on and have to kind of put
some of that the worries aside at least temporarily not unlike a surgeon who better not be worried
thinking every step of the way how he or she has this person's life in their hands
because that's he wouldn't want them to be broadening their their mindset too much for that
reason too but you're right you know it is hard it's increasingly difficult I would say to separate
some of the emotional concerns from the science and then you know broad-scale ethics I just think
you know here we are as a human species and we have the potential to really alter the normal
course of the planet in terms of our climate system and that's something that humans haven't had in
the past like we have now and I feel honestly like we're really failing and so there is that
sort of really deep sense that wow you know we as a as a species are really screwing things up
and and there's going to be long-term consequences and we are definitely not rising to the challenge
and time is running out I know you know this but climate change is only one of many other
human-induced human impacted environmental crises like biodiversity population decline of
animals in sex fish etc endocrine disrupting chemicals habitat loss all those things
are climate experts as siloed as many other disciplines in the academy or climate scientists
by definition look at complex issues that interrelate are they more systems aware would you think
I would say that climate scientists have become more systems aware over the years when I started
in this and it was less of a policy topic it was more of a science pure science topic I would say
that people were narrower but it becomes very much apparent as time goes on how you have to look at
the entire system including economics your specialty politics that's a huge one we saw how
difficult it is to get any kind of climate bill passed so you really have to take all these things
into consideration and nobody's an expert on all of it and as you were asking before about you know
how interdisciplinary this is you have to have experts from all these different areas and and
try to find a way to speak a common language to make progress on this really really complex problem
so while you have the microphone literally what would you wish more people would ask about arctic
dynamics how and on what questions what instrumentation like remote sensing field expeditions
would you like more of future research focused on well one thing that I think has been understudied
is the how the Arctic is going to change in the summer most studies have looked at how the Arctic
is going to change in the winter because that's when you get the biggest signal in terms of temperature
change and you know changes that potentially changes in the jet stream and so on so a lot of
energy and attention has been focused on that understandably but I'm concerned about what's
going to happen in the summer as we lose ice our snow cover in on land we don't talk about that as
much as losing ice cover in the ocean and what that is going to mean in terms of extra heating on
land changes in agriculture forests and even changes in the atmospheric circulation last summer
there was big news because northern Siberia hit 100 degrees for the first time ever recorded
and it's an interesting and important threshold but obviously we wouldn't expect things to stop
there but when you think about how an area that we this north of the arctic circle hitting over 100
degrees that really does give you pause and so I think that in terms of something that I wish
people asked more about I would say it's how Arctic summer conditions will change so I'm going to
put you on the spot here that you can just wear your personal citizen hat here and speculate as
opposed to your climate scientists hat but if you had to guess of where things eventually
equilibrates out as far as temperature above pre-industrial time do you have a middle of
professor Vavas's internal mental distribution on that or is that something you don't even speculate
on? I only speculate as far as the climate model endpoints go typically we use 2100 your 2100 is
sort of the endpoint somewhat misleading it's not like climate change is going to stop in 2100
it is misleading it's like as if the climate doesn't stop changing then right exactly exactly
yeah so I have my sort of you know mental distribution about where we go through then
but beyond then it's almost like all bets are off because we don't know what kind of societal
actions will be taken or not taken this century for sure but where let's just say 2100 where is
your own distribution there? I generally I don't see a reason to to steer away from the the standard
IPCC estimates which haven't really changed dramatically over many many years you know
doubling a CO2 around a three degree Celsius type of warming obviously it fluctuates depending on
which model and newer estimates about emissions but I try not to get too fixated on that because
that is always a moving target to me the most important thing is that even the low end estimates
of where we're heading into the future put as far beyond anything we've been in the historic past
and so if we start nitpicking on on exactly what numbers are I think we lose sight of the
big picture which is that we're we're moving into a new era in terms of anthropogenic climate
change and what humans and other ecosystems are going to be experiencing. So I told someone at a
dinner party last week when I was in Europe that this year will be on balance the coolest year the
rest of our lives and mathematically that seems totally logical to me given the trends and given
the models but emotionally that sounded like an outlandish statement. Do you have any comment on
that? Well yeah it is an extreme statement but it could well be true just like every year it's
we're only going to see higher and higher carbon levels right? CO2 has been going up and up every
single year there's no reason to think it's not going to be higher next year than this year.
But even if we stopped burning fossil carbon this year even if we stopped there's an enormous amount
of warming built in because of prior CO2. Yeah exactly we talk about the the extra heating and
the pipeline even if we were to shut off the carbon emissions now that that would continue
into the future and that's why this is such a what do they call it a wicked problem because it's
it's you know carbon dioxide and methane are invisible they have such long time lags so even
if we take action now we don't see the the effects until many years later politicians are elected on
two to four to six year terms they're not elected on hundred year terms so it just it's almost like
everything is conspiring to create this massive knot of a societal crisis to try to figure out.
Yeah and things that are good for climate are going to be bad for the economy
generally except for the easy things like contraptions like carbon capture and sequestration
or let's build more solar panels because solar uses less carbon than coal or gas which is true
but we're really not using less oil and gas we're adding the renewable energy to the total
pie of human energy I mean if you I'm sure you know this but you overlay a chart of CO2 with all
the convening of parting parties climate change international conferences there's pretty much
one-for-one correlation all those meetings have not changed the trajectory. Right right well
one example is China they're getting kudos in some respects for their expansion of renewable energy
but at the same time they're growing so fast that they're also expanding their fossil fuel use
so it exactly which way do you look at it so it can be both. Exactly so Steve do you have any
suggestions for how people living in advanced economies most people listening to this podcast
can prepare themselves and their communities either for the warming that's already in place or for
some of the economic transitions that that you and I have discussed in the past do you have any
recommendations. Well some of these are win-win strategies we can look for low-hanging fruit
things that in terms of adaptation that will have benefits in the short term and will have
climatic benefits as well for instance urban tree cover is one that's a really low-hanging fruit so
to speak that's one that trees are a natural air conditioner we know it's an environmental
justice issue places that tend to be poorer inner city locations neighborhoods that have a lot worse
urban heat islands lacking parks vegetation gardens having more trees in in cities for example
would be beneficial in terms of carbon drawdown it would also be beneficial in the immediate term
whether the you have a warming climate or not summers are hot and then it would have a long
term benefit in terms of a natural air conditioner kind of green infrastructure so I would say that
that seeking those kinds of benefits that have dual purposes are ones to seek out and a lot of
experts have pointed out which ones are the easiest to implement in the near term and the cheapest
and so there's some good advice out there are ready to follow so you're a teacher let me ask you
two questions about that do you you teach various climate what is the class you're going to teach
this fall are you teaching a climate change class well I I mainly do full-time research but I do
advise I mentor students and I give a lot of educational talks to the public and so forth
so I am in the I do wear an educator's hat for sure and what specific recommendations do you
have for young humans who become aware of all this well well there's so much to learn right
in some ways it's really the young people who are teaching us because when you look at surveys
time and again it's the young people who are taking this climate issue a lot more seriously
even to the point where they they often cross political party affiliations in terms of their
positions on climate change and so I'm I'm really inspired one of the things that does give me hope
is that young people are taking this seriously compared with middle-aged folks like me and older
people and they're going to be around a lot longer and they're going to experience a lot more climate
change than I will and so it does give me hope to think that the folks coming up who are younger
and are going to have assumed positions of power in the coming years are are ones who are taking
this issue to to hard and more willing to take action on it so what do you care most about in
the world professor vaveras well I care all about a lot of things obviously aside from climate I would
say what's on my mind lately is peace the fact that we're you know the war in Europe is very
troubling and I would say a lot of justice issues in the last a couple years obviously since the
the George Floyd tragedy we're thinking more and more about social justice environmental justice
and so forth a lot of these things are issues that were swept under the rug for many many years
and they're they're coming to light now and so these are things that are close to my heart and
some of them are tied together with climate change like environmental justice well I'm thinking
about that more and more as climate warms and events in the world get worse including wet bulb
problems in very high humid places high temperature humid places places without air conditioning
the concept of climate justice is going to become almost undeniable because a lot of the global south
never burned any fossil fuels and yet they're going to bear the brunt of a lot of the impacts and
it just seems like a huge ethical you know quandary in coming decades yes yeah oh absolutely and so
the heat that you're mentioning is one great example another one is sea level rise that is
affecting and making it more difficult to live in low pacific island states and their contribution
to the problem is next to nothing I study the Arctic and coastal erosion in the Arctic has
become a huge problem to the point that some villages in Alaska have had to relocate because
there's so much erosion along their coast during storms as the climate warms and yet they too
contributed next to nothing to the problem so for a lot of us depending on where you live
we start to see climate change as oh you know it's it's hotter this summer or you know maybe a
discomfort or I have to run my air conditioner more different things like that but it's not an
existential threat to most of us at this point whereas for some people it already is and it's
beginning to become more so and when it happens to people who have contributed less you know next
to nothing to the carbon emissions it makes you realize just how unjust it is yeah and you know
I'm stuck in model land and reading western news feeds and last week I was at a poly crisis
conference in Europe and I spoke quite a bit with a muslim woman from Djibouti and she was telling me
that the knights are getting so warm in her village where she's from that the animals are
struggling not the lions and elephants but like the oxen and animals they use for
for their food and it's starting to become an issue with some of the animals so this is something
we don't really think about here when we're doing a podcast in Wisconsin but these things are
starting to happen around the world more and more right and you alluded to the wet bulb temperature
so if listeners aren't familiar with that that refers to the combination of heat and
humidity getting so high that it becomes physiologically impossible to cool through sweating
sweating depends on evaporation and it works well when you have enough dry air to evaporate
the sweat but if it gets so hot and so humid that that process no longer works effectively
that can lead to some you know places being absolutely uninhabitable and you just can't
you can't live it's not even a matter of being outside and toughing it out drinking enough water
you just can't make it there and there have been some instances in recent years when we've
crossed that threshold at which humans can no longer be effective in cooling themselves through
sweating and as those areas expand become more frequent that is a obviously a huge human health
concern and it'll mostly happen in the the hotter regions especially the middle east
that seems to be ground zero right now for that that kind of episode thank you that was very clear
and I think I also read recently that new forgetting about the temperature change from climate
that the research has shown that the wet bulb temperature that's tolerable is actually lower
than was previously thought meaning that more people will be at risk in in coming decades
with a similar temperature increase so yeah and we already know heat is the number one
weather related killer at least in this country so there's no reason to think that that won't
continue as we get warmer and warmer so what are you most hopeful about what in your life in
your world and seeing what's happening in society what gives you hope steve well I mentioned young
people that gives me hope not just because they they they're interesting and enthusiastic and have
a new way of looking at things compared to jaded older people like my generation but also because
they are taking this more seriously so that gives me hope it also gives me hope to study history
you look back at history and there have been a lot of crises societal crises when it looked like
all hope was lost my parents grew up in the depression and world war two and they tell
me about times when it just looks so bleak like you know what was going on in europe with
nazis fascism like england was going to fall there for a while in 1940 people didn't have
enough to eat the depression seemed like it was going to go on forever there was no way out
and yet we found a way to to combat that and get over it and so that does give me hope that even
though i think that the climate crisis is a different animal in terms of how encompassing it is and
what a wicked problem it is it's still a human made problem and therefore it has human made
solutions they aren't easy and they can seem politically intractable but they are problems
that we've created and that we can solve it's different than if we had a a deadly asteroid
coming at us like the dinosaurs were facing when there was really nothing that could be done
so speaking of solutions or responses if you were benevolent dictator and there was no personal
recourse to your decision what is one thing you would personally do to improve human and
planetary futures i don't even know how to answer that question i guess the first thing i would do
is resign as dictator even a benevolent i would abdicate but i i think what we need to do and
this isn't like an original thought we we need to figuratively turn down the temperature right now
i think that in terms of finding solutions we are so politically polarized right now
that we can hardly stand to be in the same room with each other social media doesn't help this
problem i think it's made it worse adding fuel to the fire but you know we we can't even have
civil conversations with our neighbors and with people of different say political viewpoints
and i think that's extremely troubling you know a lot of what we're hearing about right now and
political instability uh questions about our our how sustainable our democracy is after all the
the questions that certain people have heard about the integrity of our elections i i find
this terribly troubling because this is really getting at the core this isn't like well you have
a different view on tax policy than i do so we'll find some compromise this is really getting at the
core of our quality of life and so if i could find a way to turn down the temperature uh in
especially political discourse i would try to do that so merging your two thoughts there before
you abdicated you would turn off the internet and that might solve that did you see the movie
don't look up i didn't see it but i've heard a lot of people say that i should see it and of course
it has a strong parallel to the climate crisis i thought it was excellent it was so creative it
just implicitly showed how difficult the social overlay of these natural resource environmental
problems are that we can't we can't even talk about them because people are expecting to hear
happy stories because they don't have agency to to deal with this so i do recommend you watch it
thank you so much for spending your time today is there any closing thoughts advice wisdom for our
listeners steve uh well i was i was gonna close with the statement that climate change is a human
caused crisis and so it has human solutions but i've already said that so i won't close with that
but i'll thank you for your excellent questions nate as always you've pushed me to try to understand
the system better and more broadly and i appreciate that and i know our listeners today will get a
lot out of it as a result thanks to your insights and your creative questions i'll give you a holler
next time i'm in madison my friend thank you for your time and be well thanks you too take care nate
