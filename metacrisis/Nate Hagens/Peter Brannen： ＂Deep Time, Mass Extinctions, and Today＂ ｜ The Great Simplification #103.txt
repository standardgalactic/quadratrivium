And it might be that, you know, civilization is more brittle than the biosphere.
You might not need a proper mass extinction to bring down global industrial civilization.
You just need one of these run-of-the-mill sort of climate events that happens once every few
tens of millions of years, rather than one of these apocalyptic things that happens once every
hundred million years or so.
Greetings. I am very pleased to welcome Peter Brannon to the show. Peter is an award-winning
science journalist and contributing writer at The Atlantic. He's particularly interested in
geology, ocean science, deep time, and Earth's carbon cycle. So in this show, we kind of nerd out
about the importance of carbon to Earth's prior mass extinctions. Peter previously wrote a popular
book about Earth's prior five mass extinctions called The Ends of the World. He is currently a
visiting scholar at the Cluj Center at the Library of Congress, as well as an affiliate at the
Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
This is a topic that I find fascinating and is relevant to all of our futures. Please welcome
Peter Brannon. Peter Brannon, welcome to the program. Great to see you.
Thanks. It's great to be here.
In your case, I think you may be in Colorado, but given your expertise of the world,
I put where I thought Pangea might have been in the past on my globe in the past in your honor.
Okay, I appreciate it. I'm actually in DC right now for the fall for a fellowship,
but yeah, I just moved out of Boulder, Colorado, which is sort of a dream
for someone like me who's interested in geology and all things Earth science.
And bike riding and hiking and everything else. I love Boulder. We have a lot to cover.
Let me just first ask you, right off the bat, you're an expert on Earth's mass extinctions. Why
should viewers pay attention to this podcast? Well, I wrote a book about the so-called Big Five
mass extinctions in Earth history. And the reason why I wrote that book is because
I had sort of noticed that in the geology community over the last few decades that the
conversation had changed from how it sort of existed in the public imagination, where
with the success of the asteroid impact hypothesis in 1980 and
who was first introduced in a pair of papers written by the Lewis and Walter Alvarez
and another one by Jan Smith. And then a decade later when they discovered the crater,
geologists sort of thought that they had this general explanation for why mass extinctions
happened, which is what happened when big rocks fall out of the sky. And in the last three years,
as geologists kind of fanned out across the world and looked into the earlier mass extinctions to
try to tease apart the causes of those, they thought maybe they'll find a similar layer of
asteroid dust or a big crater somewhere. And for the most part, in these other really sort of extreme
chaotic episodes in Earth history, some of which were much worse than the
extinction that wiped out the big dinosaurs, there wasn't evidence for an asteroid impact
really at all at any of them that's very convincing. And instead, people have been
investigating these other sort of kill mechanisms intrinsic to the Earth system itself, that in
some ways, each mass extinction is different. But the focus has turned more towards things kind
of intrinsic to the Earth system itself and things changing. And in some of the same ways
that the lovers were pulling today, you know, we're not we're not quite at the level of devastation
as these ancient mass extinctions, but it's sort of concerning that we're starting to see sort of
the first check engine light signals that we know from Earth history. If you go as far as you can
in this direction, you can literally do the worst things that have ever happened in Earth history.
So we'll get into the specifics of those. But I thought that was sort of newsworthy and
worth bringing to the public attention that the conversation had sort of changed in the
Earth science community. So if the check engine light on Earth is on, who are the expert mechanics?
I would say it's geoscientists. I mean, and I especially people with a deep time perspective.
So I think in my book, I refer to it as, you know, if you're having chest pains and you have a
history of heart attacks, like that's what we're experiencing now, sort of the first warning sign.
So in a lot of the ancient mass distinctions, you see things like, in some cases, huge eruptions of
CO2 out of these kind of mind bending volcanoes. You see evidence of warming and ocean acidification
and the ocean losing its oxygen. And a lot of the same things we're seeing today
in an extreme level in these ancient events. But what's sort of alarming is that, you know,
it is in our capacity to kind of reproduce them if we really don't get our act together,
that we're even in the same conversation as these sort of psychedelic horrors in the deep
past is kind of amazing. Except most people have no idea about these mass extinctions.
So you mentioned the word deep time. I have a chapter in my book for students,
reality blind on deep time. Your book is all about deep time, which for you and I,
we can geek out on that. Can you define deep time? And why is it important that we educate
young people and maybe all people about deep time?
Yeah, I mean, I think it really just sort of evokes this idea that in the same way that
distances in space are kind of our, you know, when we evolved on the savannah as primates,
we were not, we did not evolve to sort of intuit these, you know, quantum distances
or distances between stars. It's just, you know, these are scales that we have no
sort of way of reckoning with. So in the same way that astronomers come up with sort of
mnemonics or aids to help them think about these expanses, so of geologists because the
time behind us in the rear view is similarly expansive and mind blowing. And I think most
people don't really appreciate this. So, yeah, sorry. No, no, no. I mean, the way that I talked
to my students about it is our ancestors evolved to define and have words for one, two, three and
many. And even today, I don't, I think a million, a billion, a trillion are just fancy words to
represent a lot, but a million seconds is like 12 days. A billion seconds sounds a little bit
bigger is like 31 years. So when we think, when we look backward, it's very difficult
for the human brain to comprehend these time periods on Earth. So what I do with my students
is I hand out little pieces of amber with insects in them that were alive 90 million years ago.
Or I have, I think you've watched my podcast in the past, I show this, this is two billion-year-old
column of cyanobacteria stromatolites. And when you hold it in your hand and this thing was alive
two billion years ago, it gives you a little emotional mnemonic to think like, holy crap,
this existed two billion years ago. Right. I mean, that's one of the things that's
so strange about the geologic record is you can have intervals in it. So there's a thing called
the great unconformity from, it's primarily known from North America, but a similar pattern exists
over a lot of the world where something like a billion years has sort of gone missing. And there's
a lot of debates and fights about why that is. But you see that it's just huge erasure of Earth
history in the fossil record. There are outcrops here and there, but it's way more rare to find
things from that interval. And then you can find an imprint of a raindrop that fell on a specific
day two billion years ago. And it's just sort of this, these changing scales are just sort of
mind-blowing. So how could we possibly find evidence of a raindrop that fell two billion years ago?
So you do actually, there are fossil raindrops, they're sort of on a
sort of a muddy surface that got hit by a raindrop and then was covered in sediment,
and it just gets preserved as this little impression on the rock.
Yeah, but the way that I sort of, it's a tool that I use in my first book, and I often use to
demonstrate sort of these expanses that we're talking about. I borrowed from the geologist
Robert Hazen at the Carnegie Institute because I just think it's really evocative and sort of
mind-blowing is that if you imagine every footstep you take is a century and you go for a walk and
you guess, how long does it take to get to the beginning of Earth history? So you take one foot
step back and it's 1923 and the Ottoman Empire has just disbanded and World War I ended and
the night side of the planet is still pretty dark because electrification hasn't really happened
most of the world. That's one footstep and a lot has changed. You take 20 more in the Roman
Empires there, 60 to 80 more and there's woolly mammoths and you haven't walked that far and
sea levels 400 feet lower and there's Antarctica's worth of ice on North America and there's camels
and lions in North America. So the world's totally transformed, you've barely walked down the hallway.
So you must think, oh, it's probably, I don't know, a mile to the dinosaurs and then a few miles to
the beginning of Earth history. But in fact, you would have to walk for 20 miles a day for almost
four years to cover the rest of Earth history. So those are the expanses of time that we're talking
about and once you start thinking in those scales and you start to realize that we are doing things
on this planet that are almost unprecedented over a lot of that span, then it sort of brings home
just how radical the experiment we're running on the planet really is. So that's why I think it's
important to think about tariffs on that scale. I happen to agree, which is why I invited you to
share your research and your outlook on this. Okay, with some of my scientific experts that
we have a wide array of listeners, some may know your work a lot and some may not know it at all.
Could we do a speed round of the five mass extinctions, name them, when they were, what was
the general impact and what was the cause, try to do it in under two minutes per, which as a science
writer and someone who studied these things deeply is probably difficult, but go for it.
Yeah, well, I think it helped the like sort of mile post for people as the dinosaurs because
everyone knows the dinosaurs. And the dinosaurs sort of evolved on Pangea, but that is, you know,
Pangea started breaking up about 200 million years ago and dinosaurs evolved about 245 million years
ago. So we are, with the first few mass extinctions, we are way before Pangea, we're way before the
dinosaurs. So the first mass extinction, so the Cambrian explosion has happened in about a half
billion years ago. And there's this sort of progression of life and it really flourishes in
this age known as the Ordovician period, where there's this thing called the Great Ordovician
Biodiversification event and where species on Earth triple over, I think it's about 10 million years.
And all the life is basically in the water, you might have a few little sprigs of archaic plants
sort of on lake margins and things. But for the most part, the interior of the continent looks
like, you know, the Mars Curiosity rover feed. But the action is really under the waves. And
you have this whole world of sort of invertebrates and squid-like things with cone shells and things
that sort of look like horseshoe crabs. So that's sort of the world we're in. And the Ordovician
ends in this devastating ice age, where sea level dramatically falls and the ocean circulations
upended. And it's thought to be, that one's actually thought to be caused by declining CO2,
possibly from weathering of the early Appalachians. So some of your listeners might be familiar with
the idea of enhanced rock weathering to sort of sequester CO2. And the planet does that all on
its own. And it was very effective at doing that, maybe in the lead up to the extinction,
CO2 passed the threshold. But it takes a really long time for that to pull CO2 down.
Yeah, yeah. So these are on the order of, you know, 100,000-year processes. So
and in later mass extinctions, when lots of CO2 goes into the air and it gets really hot,
eventually the earth is rescued by these weathering processes that happen over hundreds of
thousands of years that sequester that CO2 and cool it off again. And that's going to
happen in our future too, like if you wait long enough. So this was the first mass extinction
and what was happening on land there? Not much. Not much. There might have been the first sort
of inkling of plant life trying to establish a beachhead. But for the most part, there's not
much going on on land. And it was covered in ice pretty much at then, right?
Well, when the ice age struck, this is so long ago that Africa and Saudi Arabia are over the
South Pole. And so what's interesting is that, so I'm from New England originally, where you can
go hiking and see remnants of the last ice age, because you'll see these sort of scratch marks
on the rocks from where the glaciers were. And that's from only 20,000 years ago.
In the middle of the Sahara Desert and in Saudi Arabia, you see similar evidence for ice sheets,
only they're from 445 million years ago from this extinction. Africa's not over the South Pole
anymore. I hate to keep interrupting you, but sometimes I wonder which is more amazing that we
evolved from the sea, from the last universal common ancestor, and all the forms of life and
navigated through all these mass extinctions. And 99% of the species to ever live on Earth
are extinct. Is that more amazing? Or is it more amazing that we figured all that out,
and we can look backward in time and get clues. And scientists like yourself can puzzle this
together and tell a story about the history of this planet. I just find it amazing.
No, I mean, I'm similar. I feel grateful, very grateful to live at a particular time on Earth
where I have access to this story and can be reasonably sure that it is somewhat
adheres to what actually happened. Unlike previous creation myths that every culture
comes up with, we have a pretty rigorously defined story of where we came from. There's
still a lot to discover. That was one of the surprising things in reporting the book,
is how open-ended some of these questions still are that we're looking at other planets
for life, but we really don't understand the steps that made this place habitable.
So it's a very exciting time if you want to get into the field to answer some of these big
questions. As is my prerogative and frequently what happens as the host of this podcast,
I've interrupted your speed round several times. Oh, no, it's okay.
Okay, that was the first mass extinction, and that was called what?
The end-order vision mass extinction about 445 million years ago.
Okay, what's next? The next one around 375 million years ago is this thing called the
late Devonian extinction. The Devonian is a weird time because it's an age of 25 million years
where you repeatedly have pulses of mass extinctions and one really big one and another
pretty big one at the end. By the Devonian, the planet has changed pretty dramatically.
There's now trees and forests, first of all, in the middle and late Devonian period.
Fish have started to waddle onto land, so our ancestors are showing up.
Arthropods, insects are on land as well. So this whole land ecosystem is taking off in this period,
but weirdly, it is sort of racked with pulses of extinction. And it's actually,
it's in many ways a mysterious sort of age and especially the pulses of extinction,
but I would say the weight of evidence is on the, actually the evolution of trees and forests as
driving a lot of the sort of chaos that's happening. So I like to think of this one as sort of trees
embarked on this incredible geo-engineering project of where the land previously had been sort of
uninhabited, spreading out all over the world, developing things like roots and breaking up
rocks and seeds so they can push inland. And as they did that, they are releasing all these
nutrients from the land, things like phosphorus that are washing into rivers then out into the
ocean and they're driving these pulses of anoxia. So the ocean's losing its oxygen repeatedly
in this age of extinction and devastating sea life. And sort of, I guess ironically in a way,
a lot of that dead life that died in these extinctions is what we frack now.
So in the Midwest, a lot of that stuff is Devonian. It's from these pulses of anoxic
seas that buried all this carbon in them because you have all this life that's dying and falling
to the bottom of these seas and there's no oxygen so they don't decay so that that carbon just stays
there for 380 million years until a weird primate decided to come along and dig it up and start burning
it. But another consequence of this extinction is trees are also very good at sequestering carbon
and when they're fueling these big algae blooms, that's bearing a lot of carbon. So there's
evidence as well for pulses of ice ages in this one as well. So the first two extinctions are
pretty weird. It gets more cinematic, I would say, with the latter three, but they show that it's
really changed that is the environmental change on a pace that life can't keep up
is the thing that's driving these things because you can pass these cold thresholds that can wipe
life out and then in later extinctions you see incredible heating and life is adaptable and
it can bend but it can also break and I think that's what's happening in these extinctions.
You know, it's talking about theatrics and drama. I have Peter Brennan on the podcast
talking about Earth's mass extinction sitting in Washington DC where the eye of Sauron is directing
its gaze around the world and there's a police car in the background during our conversation.
There's an allegory there. I don't know what it is. Okay, keep going.
Okay, these next two I can sort of speed through because they're basically the same thing happens
two times in a row. So 252 million years ago you have the biggest mass extinction of all time.
There's no real close second place. It's called the end Parmian mass extinction. It's also known
as the Great Dying and it lives up to its name. Life at this point, you know, it's starting to
get a little more familiar but we're still before dinosaurs. This is still sort of an alien planet.
But there are reptiles on land. There's things that look like reptiles that are actually closer
related to us that are on land. There's trees and forests and life has recovered from these
previous mass extinctions. And on land there are these big sponge reefs or on the ocean there are
these big sponge reefs and things like trilobites are still swimming around and you know a great
place to actually see what life was like in the Permian is if you do what I did and you go to the
Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, Texas, they have this wonderful sort of reef diorama
and the reason why there's a reef diorama in the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum is because
all this life again left behind a lot of trillion dollars of carbon in Texas.
But at the end of the Permian you just have this completely devastating mass extinction
where you look for fossils in the millions of years afterwards and sometimes the rocks are
almost empty and it takes about 10 million years for the earth to fully recover. There's all sorts
of weird signals right at the mass extinction boundary like this thing called a fungal spike
which might be the signal of you know and the most dramatic interpretation is it's just stuff
rotting all over the world. It's the only extinction that really affects insects and what caused it.
People thought you know with the dinosaur asteroid you know maybe there's a big evidence of an
impact in the Permian and there really isn't but what there is in Siberia is this incredible
expanse of volcanic rock known as the Siberian Traps which they're one of these things called
a large igneous province or when they happen on land a continental flood basalt and it's really
just the continent kind of turning inside out. The amount of lava that erupts in in Siberia
at the end of the Permian is kind of mind-boggling. It was enough so the volcanic rock that's
you know the magma and the lava is enough to cover the lower 48 United States a kilometer deep
in this stuff so when we talk about Yellowstone it would cover a few states and a few inches of
ash it would be very devastating to you know global industrial civilization but this thing
is just on a totally different scale. But as sort of dramatic as lava coming out in Russia is
you know that doesn't explain why things at the bottom of the ocean on the other side of the
planet are going extinct and so it's not the you know the proximity to the volcanoes that's
killing things it's the gases that are coming out of the volcanoes and these things would have
been emitting all sorts of horrible stuff so you know mercury maybe there's some mercury poisoning
they were on their way up through the Tunguska basin in Russia they're burning through a lot of
gypsum and halite and putting all sorts of ozone destroying chemicals in the air
but what's really been sort of honed in on as the kill mechanism in this extinction is all
the CO2 that came out of these volcanoes and it truly is a mind-boggling amount but on their way
up they would have burned through vast coal deposits from previous ages and natural gas and
limestone so they were you know igniting fossil fuels and limestone to an insane degree
and you see evidence of something like a 10 degree Celsius rise in temperature the oceans
lose something like half their oxygen I believe there's evidence of ocean acidification so all
these things that we're sort of seeing today this is like the RCPA 8.5 just you know a few
hundred years out you know maybe we're not going to reproduce it but it's kind of amazing that we
could actually it's in our power to sort of bring about another end permian mass extinction
well we're gonna we're gonna get into the details of that but just to just to be clear
and a couple of questions I don't think even RCPA 8.5 comes close to the amount of carbon
that was emitted in in that time because what happened was that was over thousands or even
yeah the 10 thousands of years so we can't reproduce what happened but what we could
possibly do is reproduce the effects yeah right so it's interesting because we could never admit
as much CO2 as the Siberian traps did the estimates are on the order of tens of thousands of gigatons
to some exceed over a hundred thousand gigatons so that's just completely out of the question
but we are as far as we can tell we're doing it about 10 times faster so the rate is faster
and for things like ocean acidification it's the rate that matters and you know the the earth has
ways of washing CO2 out of the system on long time scales if you have a if you have a huge one of
these big volcanic events but it takes tens of millions of years you're probably not going to
acidify the ocean it's probably not going to get that much warmer because the planet is continually
sort of scrubbing it from the atmosphere through these things like weathering it's when you really
jackknife the the system in a short amount of time but yeah it's it's definitely an open question
how relevant are these analogues to what we're doing today and the fact that it's an open question
is what what worries me I would say so slight tangent here interrupting you again but I think
it's relevant because sometimes on social media you well quite often you hear oh well a single
volcano emits more CO2 than all of human industrial activities so human CO2 is is not a big factor so
what is the deal with volcanoes and what's obviously there were the Siberian traps which
is a thousands of years of giant provinces of of lava basalts and and CO2 but what about something
like Mount Pinatubo or Monolea or or modern volcanoes how does the the CO2 equivalent of
volcanoes on land or in the sea compared to the scale of modern industrial fossil carbon burning
yeah so I mean the best estimate I've seen is that humans emit 100 times more
CO2 every year than all the volcanoes on earth
CO2 is the second most abundant gas that comes out of volcanoes other than water vapor so they are
they are I mean this is a good thing that that volcanoes put CO2 up into the atmosphere
the earth needs CO2 so that it's not a snowball earth situation and so the plant's kind of food
to eat so it's this is the planet that sort of is fundamentally the behavior of CO2 on this
planet is fundamentally what makes earth earth it's this thing called the carbon cycle and it's
supposed to come out of volcanoes sort of move between the oceans and atmosphere and through life
and then back into the rocks and then they get subducted and they come out of volcanoes again
but what we're doing is really it's not like the background rate of CO2 emissions from volcanoes
and it's more resembles these once every 50 to 100 million year sort of crazy events
that you see in the fossil record leave it to those clever fire apes
so those are are you still haven't okay go to the fifth one then okay no the fourth one
so basically 50 million years after the end permian life picks up the pieces and
starts to look modern which is a weird way to describe a world that has you know dinosaurs
are evolving but you get the first you know you get dinosaurs evolving and we still have
there's twice as many species of dinosaurs today as there are mammals so we're still sort of an age
of dinosaurs yeah first modern they're birds 10,000 species of birds right right um the first
modern mammals evolve uh the first you know modern conifers and stony corals and uh you know the
pieces of that would eventually make our modern world are sort of evolving in the wake of the
worst thing that's ever happened so if you're looking for a sort of silver lining to the
the worst thing that's ever happened it's we wouldn't be here having this conversation probably if
it hadn't happened um and the world would look completely different um so that's very that's
very meta peter yeah yeah and i've said before i just have easy is easily could have written a book
about the mass radiations after the extinctions as the extinctions themselves because it's just a
spectacular sort of the rebirth that happens as the destruction is um okay so it's
worst thing ever 252 million years ago and then two around 201 million years ago you have this
thing called the entriastic mass extinction and basically the same thing happens it's it's not
quite as bad but uh as pangia is rifting apart you have this thing called the central atlantic
magmatic province um starts erupting in another one of these big huge uh continental flood basalts
in the seams kind of where pangia is ripping apart um so you find rocks that are a lot like that are
these flood basalts that are dated exactly to the extinction um in new jersey across new york city
and the new jersey palisades uh brazil france morocco uh nova scotia so it's sort of this another
one of these sort of continent scaled eruptions gets really hot uh ocean acidifies loses its
oxygen 75 of life on earth goes extinct and so that one i've described the kill mechanism already so
we can jump to the cretaceous which is the one everyone knows about uh and this is 66 million
years ago when the most charismatic kind of creatures in the fossil record the big dinosaurs
get wiped out in possibly the most spectacular way imaginable when this uh rock the size of
Mount Everest hits the planet going 20 times faster than a bullet um
but what's strange about that extinction is at the same time there is another one of these big
volcanic provinces in india this time uh and i would say researchers are still trying to tease
out the relative uh effects of the two things that are going on at the same time essentially
um and given the importance of these volcanic events in previous mass extinctions it just seems
like a bizarre coincidence that it's also happening at the end of the cretaceous uh to put it in some
perspective these are called the decantraps and enough lava erupted out of them they could cover
the lower 48 united states in 600 feet of lava so nothing to sneeze at but not quite as big as the
Siberian traps um i would say the smart money is still on the asteroid but it's it's this
still very much a you know intensely researched area yeah peter ward has been on the show before
do you know peter i've interviewed him before yeah i interview him in the book actually um yeah
so he he thinks it's a combination that we were starting to see the effects of a carbon pulse and
the and the um the asteroid was kind of the coup de gras um yeah yeah it's weird as people
have gone back to date both the asteroid and the volcanoes um you know if you can get something
within a few tens of thousands of years the date down that is incredibly precise um and so i've
seen papers where there's a warming pulse before there's a warming pulse after and you know we're
still yeah so so let me ask you that um as a scientist um
i just got this bizarre uh self uh perception in my mind as i'm speaking did you ever see the
movie best in show uh i did a long time ago where where fred willard is just asking these
knucklehead questions of comedy oh it's a shitsuit i kind of envisioned myself in uh fred
willard's role interviewing you as a scientist about this like i i care about this but i know a
tiny fraction of what you do so a lot of my questions might be naive but i'm playing the
role of my viewer who might not have heard this stuff before so how do we know as scientists
to date something uh within 10 or 20 thousand years even of something that was 60 or 200
million years ago like how confident are we of that and what is the process right well first
i should correct you i'm a science writer and i like to think that i do translation from the
science world to the the general public perfect don't want to don't want to claim the mantle
necessarily of scientists but at this point i feel like i've sort of earned a honorary membership
in the geoscience community well how many how many hundreds and hundreds of papers
have you read to get to where you could write these books um many many hundreds uh and i would say
that um people have asked me or have said i want to write a book but i'm not sure about what and
i've said then you don't want to write a book because it needs to be you know saturday morning
and all you can think about is going to read more papers on on a topic so were you like seriously
when you were writing uh end of the world um were you like oh god i gotta i gotta do this
chapter and i have to learn about that oh my god i can't wait till this is over or were you like
oh i want to find out the answer to this puzzle yeah no i was completely obsessed the whole time
and um i mean that's almost become a hazard of the job is that now i'm very in the weeds and i
think stuff is interesting that you know my editor would never find interesting right
i feel the same about this podcast but go on how do you know with yeah um
so the i mean a lot of it is is you know you need to get lucky finding a uh strata that is
easily datable um and so like volcanic ash layers are really uh are sort of like the the prize that
you're looking for those because those you can use uh radioisotopes um you know you find these
things called zircons which trap a certain amount of you know uranium that you know decays to lead
over uh you know the half life of it so if you know this thing hasn't been messed with at all
you can tell when it came out of a volcano uh within you know i'm not sure what their bars on
those are but within tens of thousands years i think and there's other systems there's like argon
and there's a bunch of these and so people sort of you know you're looking for an ash layer for
sure there's other ways you can do it too you can correlate uh you know there's big dramatic
dinosaur fossils bones and things but most of the fossil record is these tiny little
shelly creatures that you'll find in limestones and things i thought it would my my first one
of the examples i give my students is lake sui getsu in japan every spring they have the cherry
blossoms uh um that bloom and then they fall to the bottom uh and then the leaves fall to the
bottom so there's these alternate white and green layers and they drill down and they got a hundred
thousand years of these layers and then they did carbon dating to see uh and they were like
really really close to a hundred a hundred and ten thousand years ago with carbon rain but what
you're talking about goes way beyond what carbon dating could do correct yeah i think carbon dating
sort of beyond like 50 000 years i think it's kind of useless uh just because the half life of it
but you can find much longer lived uh radioisotopes um yeah and you but you can also that's how we know
that's how we know um all of the um the history of the the one century per step going back for
20 miles a day for as long as you said we know that from isotope dating of of different elements
uh yeah and um you know i think the age of the solar system we know because you know you get
these meteorites that have just been pickled out in space since the formation of the solar system
and uh they preserve signals that go all the way back to the beginning of the birth of the solar
system wow but yeah i mean another way you can do it is if you know you have a good you know
extinction exposure you can correlate the sort of like weird little life forms you know do they
look like the one on the other side of the planet where you have dated it well um so it's it's been
this it's this huge sort of distributed global uh correlation game of you know what strata is when
and where the fossils were in the strata and how does this one look like that one over there on the
other side of the planet so it's kind of amazing that we've pieced together this story of the history
of the planet through this uh thank you for all that um a follow-up question um you have listed
five mass extinctions i would argue there was more than that because for instance i showed
you this stromatolite before yeah that was probably the first one two billion years ago uh where
their waste product was oxygen uh and we had a co2 nitrogen atmosphere then
and that killed off themselves because other things would evolve to eat them uh and they couldn't
you know photosynthesize the same way that they used to but were there lots i assumed that um
there were many many extinctions that were not quite to the level of a mass extinction that we
would refer to as minor extinctions so what is the threshold to be called a mass extinction
and how many minor extinctions uh are scientists aware of yeah i mean depending on how you count
there's dozens of minor mass extinctions um and some of them are pretty dramatic uh the the big five
are sort of notable because they pass this sort of arbitrary threshold of it seems like something
like 70 over 75 percent of life on earth goes extinct species wise um but uh let me let me
clarify that 75 percent of species which not necessarily 75 of life right although to wipe
out a species you know you can have something that loses 99.5 of its individual members and it
doesn't go extinct um and you're doing this without hunting or any human like you are making the
chemistry of the planet so unpleasant that you are driving the majority of life on earth extinct so
we're doing all sorts of bad stuff today overfishing and hunting and and uh happens to have fragmentation
and this has to be all kind of climatic and chemical and to do that um is pretty dramatic
so here's a question that will lead into your second book which you're writing now uh and
it'll be part of our discussion of all the mass extinctions and all the dozens of minor mass
extinctions how many of those were related to co2 pulses um well they're all related to
dramatic changes in the carbon cycle so like when I was describing the all of you know well yeah I
mean just because life is uh made out of carbon so when the asteroid hit if it was the sort of
darkness that did it it shut down photosynthesis so there was less energy available to flow through
food webs through this organic carbon um so that's but specifically the warm pulses from
volcanic co2 I would say the majority of them there's there are a lot of large igneous provinces
uh throughout earth history and a lot of them are timed really sort of eerily to all these
to many of these minor mass extinctions or at least like reorganizations of life on earth
if they're not a major if they're not a mass extinction um sort of dramatic changes so so
most of the minor and mass extinctions in earth's history were eerily correlated with co2 pulses
largely from volcanic provinces yeah I think that's fair to say why don't most people know that
well I think a lot of this research is fairly new um or at least hasn't pierced the public
consciousness because you know in the 90s all those asteroid movies got made and uh there hasn't been a
a disaster movie about her I guess there have been but sort of well don't look up is is becoming
eerily accurate the more I think about it yeah I actually haven't seen it um it's one of those
things where it's I'm sure be preaching the choir but I should probably I should probably check it out
but no it's a little bit of a comedy and I thought you were gonna say you haven't seen it because
it's too painful for you but that one wasn't really painful it was kind of funny but I can't
watch like BBC Planet Earth anymore I used to love those shows I just get too sad yeah no I understand
that um although there is a new Netflix series that one you have to watch it's narrated by Morgan
Freeman Life on Earth is it called oh yeah yeah it's all about what you're talking about I mean
it's about the the evolution and they use computer uh AI to represent different dinosaurs and it's
I've only watched part of it but it's so good so far yeah no I have friends who have been
consult or consultants on on that show and so they're they definitely do it right on the BBC
bringing this stuff to life yeah excellent so um minor mass extinctions CO2 pulses we are living
through what I refer to as the carbon pulse which also most people don't understand that we're
drawing down ancient carbon uh millions of times faster than than it was sequestered
many many more questions uh Peter I wrote down some things as you were speaking what are your
thoughts on you mentioned that after what what did you say uh 10,000 years or 100,000 years after
a mass extinction um things start to recover because the earth generates a life what what are
your thoughts on the Gaia hypothesis versus Peter Ward's Medea hypothesis which is the contrast
that earth is is trying to get to an equilibrium in the service of of supporting life and Medea
hypothesis the opposite which is the earth eventually finds ways to kill off life um
what are your thoughts on that I think there's truth in both of those I don't think there's
really a teleological uh and there's nothing that earth is sort of straining towards
um so in the book I'm writing now I've sort of my eyes have been open to this idea that um
life ever since its origin has sort of been this a channel of energy dissipation through
carbon chemistry that was opened uh you know at hydrothermal vents you know for 3.5 4 billion
years ago um that was unavailable to the planet before and when you have systems that are out of
equilibrium they'll find these sort of channels of energy dissipation and life is really this
planetary process that does that so if the if there's any sort of like end goal I think it's
this sort of second law of thermodynamics uh straining towards equilibrium along with the
rest of the universe and life is just a channel that a that a planet sort of explores uh to relieve
the frustration of of systems that are out of equilibrium that was all very abstract but um
if I was going to think about the planet and sort of these broader you know what's the point kind of
terms I think that's that is a sort of unifying concept uh for me increasingly is that um
you know hurricanes relieve the upper ocean of the heat in them and they're these complex
dissipative structures uh that no one is there to organize but they somehow um make these you
know beautiful structures to dissipate this heat and people have made the analogy that that is what
life is doing as well just in a different domain in the carton carbon chemistry um so I don't know
if that was too left field but I caught I caught the ball the fly ball to left field and now I'm
going to throw it back to you okay are are humans just energy dissipating structures as aggregate
civilization I've thought about that I think there's a like yes because we are
um like all life we find sources of free energy and we dissipate it and that's how we've
you know stayed alive and uh but there's a risk of sort of naturalizing the last
two centuries which you know there is human agency and there's historical contingency
and humans are sort of different than sort of just a blind uh you know thermodynamic process
but then sometimes I think well maybe we're not uh and I think if you have this you know
this this hugely out of equilibrium system where you have tons of flammable stuff underground and
you have tons of flammable air above and you have this fire creature in between them like it better
not figure out how to reunite these these two reservoirs to interact with each other and that's
sort of what's happened in the last few centuries but even if we are even if we are as a species
as a modern culture an energy dissipating structure that is uniting the two don't
unite these two uh areas there is the possibility that there's a heisenberg principal uh phenomenon
at risk that knowing that we are uniting those two spheres maybe gives us the possibility to
restrain ourselves maybe which is the purpose of this podcast right no I think that is the
you know the reason why I don't you know just become totally nihilistic is that
yeah in some ways we're like the asteroid or we're like one of these big volcanoes but
there's a steering maybe there's a steering wheel on on this sort of
agent of chaos and and destruction and I think that's sort of the open question for the
next few centuries is whether we can control this or whether you know we're just gonna
wait around for the planet to correct us and then figure it out why why would you say
next few centuries and not next few decades well it'll definitely be focused in the next
few decades the the sort of window to meaningfully uh the window in which we can you know really
change the trajectory and not get too far down this sort of scary dark path uh that we've seen
before in earth history really does depend on what happens in the next few decades but
I mean I'm I'm only now dipping my toe in sort of human history in this next book and for me
even thinking on centuries is uh you know ridiculously uh short so I'm trying to think
in shorter time scales but um the planetary process is like if we have any ambition to live
into geological time into the future um we need to start thinking on how can we live
in accordance with these cycles that take place over thousands and if not hundreds of thousands
of years so dinosaurs if you include birds have lived over 200 million years humans have been
300 thousand years in our in our modern form anyways so yeah we have a long a long ways to go um
in theory in possibility we do so uh we are 45 minutes in and I have a long list of questions
for you Peter Brennan um you are originally a science journalist with a focus on ocean trends
what was it like working on that subject oceans um did you and do you feel like I do that um
a lot of the ocean related topics are under reported and under acknowledged by by mainstream media
yeah I think there's this tendency to sort of see it as happening out there and you know it's
like learning about something happening in space basically it's this vast unknowable thing um
and it's hard to get people to feel much sympathy for um you know the plight of a
baitfish like menhaden menhaden or uh you know even cod and things like that but
the there is no division between you know life on land and life in the ocean we depend on the
ocean for a habitable planet um just as much as the ocean relies on you know mineral nutrients
from land uh there's no real disentangling um these two systems but you know reporting on the
ocean I think anyone who who does so you know learns pretty quickly that a lot's going wrong
in the oceans in some pretty worrying ways um so you know you have coastal pollution and nutrient
pollution um and warming which is driving this loss of oxygen in the ocean so the the oceans have
lost two percent of their oxygen since 1960 and that might not sound like much but when you're
talking about percents of oxygen change in the ocean again these are sort of uh geologically rare
to see a change that big in such a short period of time and and the two percent I assume is accelerating
yeah um what what would happen if if uh the oxygen on lands dropped by two percent
I probably wouldn't be able to go for a bike ride the way that I do yeah I think you'd definitely
feel it I'm not sure what the respiratory effects would be but there would definitely be there would
definitely be effects um we I mean we've changed CO2 by you know hundreds of million yeah but we're
talking in on the range of a hundred parts per million and already plants have 30 percent fewer
pores on their leaves since the start of their industrial revolution these things that they
fundamentally use to mediate their relationship with the outside world when CO2 is high they
want to minimize their their water loss so they reduce the number of pores on their leaves
and you see this in geological history during high CO2 periods plants get fewer pores and we've
already done that since in the last you know 150 years this huge physiological change in plants on
earth that has untold effects on the water cycle and and so like very small changes in these things
kind of dramatic effects on the on the planet and life wait a minute I didn't know that so
since the industrial revolution all plants many plants a sampling of plants have have fewer
the ones they've studied so there are these there's this global warming event 56 million years ago
where it gets about five degrees warmer and CO2 briefly goes up from these volcanoes in the
north atlantic and you see in ginkgo ginkgo leaves in the fossil record they're the number of
pore the density of pores on their leaves shrinks and people have used this to try to
reconstruct CO2 over time just looking at the number of pores usually on ginkgo leaves
so that that would be the plant equivalent of me moving from Canada to Florida I would be shedding
my clothes and wearing less clothes because the temperature was different yeah it's an
adaptation it's a it's evolution on these on such a rapid timescale that's driven by this
injection of CO2 in the atmosphere I don't I forget how we get on this topic but yeah
the uh well you you brought up this I'm going to get back to your original question but this is
something relevant to again the the memes that we hear in the news because people correctly claim
that CO2 helps plants grow and is a natural fertilizer but then the implications of that
making it out to be an expansion from where we are today at 420 some parts per million
a further expansion to 500 or 600 or 700 parts per million would be good for plants it would
be good for crop yields with higher concentrations how true is that and what are the tradeoffs to
that phenomenon yeah I mean as with a lot of these sort of cherry picked things there is
truth to that plants do like CO2 they photosynthesize by taking CO2 and through these pores I was
talking about on the on the leaves um and in fact actually I looked this up before we talked that
there's there's at least one study that came out in 2021 that said that the global annual
levels of photosynthesis have increased by about 12 between 1981 and 2020 so you can just
look at that in isolation and say well what's the big deal this seems like a good thing
but anyone who's looked into this the the big problem is the world's going to get a lot more
erratic so there's going to be worse droughts than there have been and when it does rain it's
going to be you know worse storm than it's ever been and you know the grain belts will shift
around sort of we're we're just making the planet more unpredictable and I feel like our global
system sort of relies on predictability and tomorrow looking something like it does today
but there's some there's some crops like corn I think is expected to dramatically decline
under future warming scenarios so when we talk about this is the same way of looking at
stock market returns there's an average and then there's a standard deviation and what you're saying
is higher CO2 because of the impact on weather is going to change the standard increase the the bands
of the standard deviation which means we might have really good yields or like no yields on average
they might be higher but but here's another thing that I've looked into I don't know if you
are aware of this but plants when there's more CO2 it affects the distribution of where they put
the energy within the plant right and sometimes we don't get the same nutrients right that we would
can you speak to that well no I've seen the same study you have that there there's this
sort of prediction that the plants will become less nutritious but I also think that I think
there was a study came out recently saying that even like yields in total will actually
decline so it's it's not my air of expertise but I think if anyone confidently tells you what
you know the world's going to look like it in a relatively geologically
unprecedented level of CO2 they're kind of they're they don't so
I don't know that you've watched it yesterday I had a podcast released with Sir David King
a former science advisor chief science advisor to the UK
and one of the things we talked about
is that and also I have a podcast that will come out in two weeks from this date which is
October 26th with Jeremy Grantham and we also talked about people's attitudes towards global
heating and I said well half the people still don't believe in climate change and and
some of the things that you're talking about Peter and he interrupted me and he corrected me
and he's like half of the people in the United States not half of the people so I think there
really is a misinformation a lack of education or some failing in our science communication
perhaps offset by different incentives to really understand what's going on here now granted
once we agree what the problem is the auto mechanics are diagnosing what's the problem
then there's a different a totally different discussion on what to be done
that I understand that people might respond differently and it might affect their identity
or their situation I get that we still need to have that conversation but I don't think
we're even there like half of the people in our country do not recognize that we are alive during
a carbon pulse prior carbon pulses led to minor and mass extinctions this is a big deal capital B
and D yeah any thoughts on that well yeah I mean this is I might have sort of touched on this when
I was talking about the importance of deep time but I think most people don't really understand how
rare and extreme the planetary experiment we're doing on the as far as we know the only
habitable planet you know that we know of is in Earth history and for me that was the biggest sort
of eye-opening thing and I was actually reading Peter's book Peter Ward's books in the early
2000s that kind of alerted me to this and then actually when I was working on the oceans or
writing about the oceans I did this fellowship at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
there people were looking at these sediment cores from tens of millions of years ago and showing
this line in this chalky sediment that just turns to clay for 200,000 years during this
ocean acidification event and it's thinking on once you realize you know some people will talk
about you know there's the little ice age the medieval warm period and there's
Locky and Tambora and these things are not even remotely on the same scale of the change that
we're imposing on the planet now and some of them are kind of spurious like the medieval warm period
yeah was in in Europe it was there's evidence that the climate was a little different but it was
sort of a reorganization of the climate rather than a complete phase shift which is what we're
sort of pushing it towards so yeah I mean for me I've also found that talking about climate change
in it from a deep time perspective has been a way sort of a Trojan horse for some people who
have their minds made up about it where they've only heard about it as these things that happen
that happens on computer models and it's all in the future and it's theoretical and if you start
talking about you know these science fiction worlds from hundreds of millions of years ago and you
explain how the carbon cycle on CO2 actually works on the planet people I've found are more
receptive to sort of this message well that's why looking at human history and human behavior is
so central because the way that our brains are as short-lived biological creatures is we have to
see evidence of something before we change our minds and our behaviors but in this particular case
if the carbon pulse fully manifests by the time we see the evidence of a mass extinction we will
have been part of a mass extinction. Right yeah so that's a scary possible thing at play in some
of these mass extinctions is you know you'll see these volcanic eruptions happening over the course
of sometimes hundreds of thousands of years but the extinction pulse is usually pretty quick
everything sort of goes to hell and some people like Doug Erwin at the Smithsonian Institution
is sort of trying to figure out whether it's you have this background stressor and then once you
switch in a mass extinction mode it's more of a network collapse dynamic so he compares it to
this blackout that happened on the east coast in the early 2000s I think where it goes back to a
software glitch in a control room in Ohio and suddenly the eastern seaboard all the way up to
Canada went dark and it's not that it was caused by that one thing but it was because this plant
this system was you know you take enough you chip away at the different components and you're
going to find that one that makes sort of the whole thing collapse non-linearly and so we don't
really know where if that is how mass extinctions unfold then we don't know where the event horizon
really is which makes concert I so I wrote this part of my book was excerpted where I said we're
not in the sixth mass extinction yet because if we were you know it might be completely game over
and people sort of took that as like oh I'm saying it's not a big deal what we're doing and I wasn't
saying that I was actually saying conservation is doubly important because we don't know where
this threshold is if that's how these things actually unfold because by the time you're in
mass extinction mode it might be too late to do anything and you're in the sort of like network
collapse dynamic so what is your new book about and do you have a title for that and when's it
going to be done and out yeah so over the course of writing this book about you know the bad things
that can happen in earth history when lots of CO2 comes out of the ground I realize that there's
this much broader story to tell about carbon dioxide and the way the carbon cycle works for a
general audience the sort of show reintroduced them to this thing they've heard about in the news
as this you know random industrial byproduct that comes out of smokestacks as sort of fundamental
to how the planet works which is one of the reasons why you don't want to mess with it too much
and so hopefully the book is coming out next year I'm finishing it up now and the title is
quite grandiosly the story of CO2 is the story of everything so we'll see if I can
so good luck with that when it comes out please come back on the show and then we can we can talk
about that lots more questions here Peter on the topic of CO2 I asked this question of Sir David
King and I will ask you I'm sorry to use you as a sounding board for common memes that are
minimizing this but I think some of them take hold and I and I want to get your scientific answer
here so pre-industrial CO2 parts per million were near the lowest of the last you know ever
really it's about as low as it's ever been yeah about as low as it's ever been 280 million
parts per million now we're 425 430 so if you think about that we've gone effectively from
three parts per 10 000 to four parts per 10 000 big deal and there are graphics showing
little grains of sand and there the white one is the CO2 and we added one per 10 000
how do you explain that that actually is a big deal
well I mean
this was science that we had a pretty good you know it was starting to mature as a science in
the 19th century when we discovered that CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas and you even have
people like Fonte Arrhenius who this Swedish chemist or physicist who made this calculation
in 1896 that if you double CO2 it'll get about four degrees warmer which is still
roughly in line with our best supercomputers so the physics of sort of the spectroscopic
yeah sorry but just why why why would it like a doubling of a tiny tiny thing
is it that potent in how it absorbs infrared radiation and keeps the thermal blanket on earth
yeah it is it is that important and you know an irony is and it makes sense once you know
our history that this is about as low as CO2 has ever been it got down to about 180 during the
peak of the last ice ages and then about 280 and the as we came out of the ice ages now we're up to
420 but we have pretty good proxies for what CO2 was in the geological past and the last time it
was at the level it is today was the Pliocene when you had the North Shore the Arctic Canada
looked like Michigan basically and the last time it was a thousand parts per million there were
alligators at the North Pole and sand tiger sharks in Alaska and palm trees in Alaska and we know
that you know water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere but water vapor
uh isn't the primary knob it responds to the level of CO2 and the reason is because CO2 takes so
long to take to come out of the atmosphere that um you know warms planet up and then the feedback
is you get all this water vapor which is a really potent greenhouse gas but until you get that CO2
out of the air again the temperature of the planet isn't isn't going to come down whereas
water vapor cycles through the system very quickly so it's sort of unusual in that in that respect
and one of the reasons why people describe it as the principal knob governing the earth's temperature
so I don't know if I answered your question but to answer my question would take the full interview
but people who minimize these risks of human cause global heating frequently point out that
CO2 levels and temperatures were higher to much higher in our geological past without threatening
life uh so how do you explain that yeah well I've never really I've never really understood this uh
objection because you know they'll say things like what I just said which is well 50 million years ago
CO2 was high and life was perfectly happy with alligators at the north pole and like how is that
relevant and imagine if we jump from our world partitioned by borders and national creeds and
language and global trade and within a few centuries you're in a alligator at the north pole world
it's true that that was the case 50 million years ago but that would be unfathomably
uh destructive for us and it's again it's this thing about the rate of change that
you know the early eocene when that was true you're coming out of the greenhouse of the dinosaurs
um and the planet had been pretty warm for a pretty long period of time and then there's this
slow descent over the last 60 million years or so where CO2 has been declining where suddenly
passed this threshold rear in these glacial interglacial cycles which is the world that we
evolved on we did not evolve on the cretaceous hot house of the dinosaurs we evolved in this
we're an ice age animal so we're really not evolved for that uh that that older world when
it's true life was very happy but that's just not our planet well putting on my Fred Willard best
and show uh questioning hat would would humans even be able to live in at the CO2 levels of the
late Triassic or the early Jurassic uh not eight billion humans but would humans have been able
to live and thrive the early Triassic would have been really the early Triassic is probably about
as hot as it's ever been um I think things that put things cooled down over the course of the
Triassic but then they get super hot again in the the next mass extinction but no I think
in the warm periods in Earth history it would have been intensely unpleasant because there's
also uh we have a sort of climate niche and with each degree sea of temperature rise the
atmosphere can hold seven percent more water vapor so just imagine the most you know a brutal New
Orleans summer day uh and then make that even worse and that's sort of a you know the regular
state of affairs so every one degree sea the humidity on average is going to go up seven
percent the water content in the air the atmosphere can hold seven percent more water just because
it's uh expanded um so that that's why you can have such more powerful storms and it warms up you
just have more energy and more water in the system um and moving through it faster
and I've I've asked a few people on the show um about the wet bulb temperatures so you don't
really need to define that but how worried are you about the um the combination of more humidity
and higher temps on human health especially in places that don't have access to air conditioning
yeah I think it's hugely worrying um and we're starting to realize that the
you know the thresholds are actually much lower because a lot of these things are theoretical
and you read what how the the wet bulb temperatures actually defined you're imagining someone sitting
in the dark naked doused in water with gale force winds on them and that is the and that's not the
situation that is where the thermal sort of tolerance comes in it's what level beyond where
even that doesn't cool you off uh that's sort of the wet bulb threshold but in the real world
these effects will kick in much sooner because people are working people are outside there
so I think a paper came out recently saying that you know even with two degrees of warming
we're going to start passing these thresholds uh over you know in pretty significant parts of the
world um from a geologic perspective you also see physiological adaptations to warm so you have
these transient warming events like this one of sort of offhandedly mentioned a few times 56
million years ago where horses in the interval of the warming which is about takes about 200,000
years for this thing to play out horses get smaller briefly and then they get back to their
normal size because uh it's easier to to dissipate heat if you're if you're a smaller animal um so
we see you know if we make the planet really warm for 200,000 years there probably will be a fossil
animals adapting to that um in fact I think fish are getting smaller as well so it's possible we
will re-evolve back into homo florensis the hobbit man yeah yeah I mean we can't imagine I mean
we're doing a planetary experiment here in deep time in real time I mean this is right it's great
you and I can be in a climate controlled environment with uh uh effectively zoom cameras and lights and
do this but it's it's really freaking profound it is time that we are alive um yeah I I think
I'm sort of motivated in part in my work to show people that climate change is almost like this
cosmic uh cosmically important issue it's not just another it's not the uh acid rain it's not
methyl mercury it's not uh the you know it really is this thing that's geologically pretty profound
and we don't know what's going to happen but we do know that when you when you go down these
roads they get that things can go pretty wrong some people talk about uh the conceptually
the venous venousification of earth can can you briefly say what the co2 situation is on venus
and how we know that and is that relevant at all to earth's future I don't think it's relevant I
think we're actually too far away from the sun to cause a runaway greenhouse effect I'm pretty
sure that's true um but the the atmosphere of venus is both 90 so we're 0.04 co2 I think
and the atmosphere of venus I think is like 99.5 co2 and it's also way more uh uh just a crushing
atmosphere uh and it's hot enough to melt lead and so we don't have to worry about that but you
there's a long way between now and venus that where it can get pretty unpleasant
well on the way um this is another peter ward thing on the earth clock of life
we have around what 500 million years left before the sun expands and the oceans boil and and
and all that right but 500 million years is a lot potentially uh I think that's still pretty
kind of an open-ended question exactly how long of a lifespan we have
that the earth is habitable to um you know complex multicellular animals uh
there's a study last week about how in the next supercontinent which is 250 million years
from now it's mostly going to be an uninhabitable wasteland so that's not too far I mean it's very
far in the future but uh wait why is that going to happen the next supercontinent just because
of all the tectonic shifts that happen on very small time scales are going to aggregate into
some new pangea called uh brannon yeah I think it's called pangea ultima is the name they've
given it oh really oh okay I mean there's just thing called the wilson supercontinent cycle
which is we've had a few of these things um you had pangea and then before then it's the planet
the continents are sort of disparate but before then you have this thing called rodinia which
is another supercontinent and if you you know we've been breaking apart for around 180 200 million
years ever since you know new jersey and morocco used to be contiguous and they've been pulling
apart um since then but it's projected that another 250 million years we're going to be
in another one of these situations and what we know about from earth history is supercontinents
are not very pleasant places to be uh things usually go wrong and uh for all sorts of interesting
reasons but um the sun will also be brighter sorry I said the sun will also be uh significantly
brighter than it is today so it'll be a pretty unpleasant place so I think we need to get through
the first few the next few decades and centuries yes let's focus on that let's focus on that um
so speaking of that um there are other cycles in addition to co2 pulses the sun also affects
our climate obviously um as another debunking or another point that's commonly out there that it's
the sun that is responsible for our climate not uh cattle or or uh volvos could you describe the
interplay between solar uh um forcing and co2 forcing over the last you know several hundred
million years well um you know the you have these very regular solar cycles um every I think 11
years or so but over a cosmological time scale the sun in the you know course of being a main
sequence star is diffusing hydrogen to helium um and increasingly getting brighter over time so it's
about over the past 250 million years or so I think it's gotten something like 10 percent
brighter and you know some people have said that this is actually has over time sped up the
hydrologic cycle and increased rock weathering and actually is responsible for this sort of
secular decline of co2 from hundreds of millions of years ago to today is actually if the sun's
getting brightened to offset it co2 has been going down um which is an interesting idea uh
but there's that there's a wild paper a few years ago saying that because the sun is slowly
brightened over over the past few hundred million years that if we actually did push co2 up to you
know an end permian level it would be worse because we're also dealing with a brighter sun um so we
we actually could do something totally unprecedented which is a little frightening uh I think you
know the the ice ages are complicated to talk about because they are sort of paced by these
astronomical things like the tilt of the earth and the uh eccentricity of its orbit and the
obliquity and and so there are all these sort of things the planet is doing around the sun that
changes the distribution of sunlight on its surface that can uh you know in certain latitudes
are favorable to the development of ice sheets um which can account for sort of the rhythm of the
ice ages but to go in and out of the ice ages the last few uh the last two and a half million years
it's also these co2 feedbacks that happen that you can't explain why um the planet warmed and
cooled without these co2 feedbacks included but there have always been these there's there've
always been these orbital mechanics going on it's just that co2 and earth's past has been high enough
that it isn't really you know relevant to ice sheets so if you go to the Triassic Newark Basin
in uh outside of New York City you can see these rift valley lakes from where pangio is pulling
apart and you will see the the lake level rhythmically change sort of over the same timescale that we
have the have had ice ages and it's because uh these what are known as milankovitch cycles which
is the the way the earth's orbit interacts with the sun to to sort of rhythmically um change but
you see the lakes get deeper and then they you see sort of mud and then you see these deep layers
and mud and and so these things have always been there and you can't explain uh you can't explain
the the broader changes without co2 um the earth is complicated yeah well it's complexity is one of
the reasons that we're not doing anything about it the other reason is we're addicted to our current
consumption and comfort and convenience and status but complexity is a huge challenge on all these
things the whole human ecosystem and and the metacrisis every topic is complex and then when
you integrate them there's an even a bigger level of complexity i will say this though while you're
speaking i do think we need more of of the following uh uh integration we need the science
and then we need a science journalist like you to amass everything and then there needs to be a
podcast or a communication vector you need all three of those things because any one of those
areas is not sufficient right to get the the complexity out to people to integrate uh in
their understanding of our world yeah no and i i'm you know it's a struggling to explain some of
these concepts just because i know them and they come naturally to me but i forget what it took to
to build up uh to that point um and you can you can pull out little you know cherry pick things
here and there in earth history but unless you understand the broader context um like the role
of the sun or uh yeah well i will i will say this that you are a brilliant and captivating
and poetic author the the ends of the world um is an excellent book could you uh you know briefly
opine on what the difference is between the end of the world and the end of civilization or even
the end of civilization as as we come to understand it now yeah so you know i think when
i say i tell people i wrote a book about mass extinctions and that is sort of a defined term
in paleontology but sort of more colloquially people just think i'm talking about you know the
collapse of civilization and it might be that you know civilization is more brittle than the biosphere
uh you might not need a proper mass extinction to bring down global industrial civilization
uh you just need one of these run up run of the mill sort of climate events that happens
once every few tens of millions of years rather than one of these apocalyptic things that happens
once every hundred million years or so so i don't know whether um i don't know whether two or three
degrees of warming is uh dramatically uh devastating to the current global network society we have uh
it is a complex non-linear system that we don't fully understand in the same way we don't really
understand the the food webs that collapsed and some of these mass extinctions so um or it could
be that you really need to destroy the world to bring humans down i do think humans are probably
not not going extinct anytime soon we're incredibly adaptable and we made it through crazy swings in
the ice ages um but can what we have come to know as you know modern industrial civilization
maybe that disappears much sooner than than humans do so well and it it could it could disappear much
sooner um even without any of the co2 impacts that you're discussing right right um if you follow
my podcast um so from a perspective of another carbon pulse on planet earth this one caused by
volvos and volkswagens and vacations as opposed to volcanoes you as a science journalist that
understands earth's past uh what what do we need to do and how um up until now i've mostly been
sort of writing descriptively and avoiding the prescriptive stuff but i'm i understand that i
understand that completely yeah but i'm increasingly realizing and i think this is sort of one of the
thrust of my next book is that human society is now a component of the carbon cycle and
it really is impossible to extricate uh politics and economics from uh planetary science um
um so we need to negotiate a way of living on this planet that is in uh
you know within the proper context of our role in the carbon cycle and not one that sort of drives
it as far out of equilibrium as possible as fast as possible because we know where that leads um
so i don't know specifically i mean i i have trouble making heads or tails out of out of policy um
i just know that we live in a very exciting time because something has to change um a real eye
opening paper for me was actually one of your former guests uh tom murphy where you know he just
does it back in the napkin calculation that if you even have the most conservative relationship
between energy and economic growth and of course there is one because we can't just hand things back
and forth through each other forever and see the economy you know go up forever um if you have this
very conservative relationship between energy and and uh the growth of the economy within 400 years
the oceans are boiling away just from the waste heat of the economy and within a thousand years this
this it's more energy than the sun puts off in all directions so 400 years obviously that's never
going to become become a problem because we're not going to make that much waste heat but something
is going to change and 400 years not even geologically but in human history is not that long um so
whatever comes next is going to look dramatically different um and i don't know what it is but it's
exciting to be alive at a time where we get to sort of chart out that future however scary and uh
you know terrifying that prospect is um so i'm not i'm not answering your question sort of intentionally
because i'm not smart enough to to work on on the policy stuff well or you're or you're too smart
and wise that you know that your role is to um paint the picture uh and this as soon as you go
into prescriptions your audience is much smaller um so i i get it let me ask you this though this
you can give me your personal opinion um you've listened to this podcast uh you've done a ton of
research on the current unfolding co2 pulse you're aware of some of the complexities and
the fact that probably rcpa 0.5 and the other rcps are are maybe energy blind and they assume that
all this stuff will be extracted because the molecules exist um but if you had to describe
the the the distribution in your mind of uh the carbon pulse what's the midpoint of your
distribution of eventual temperature increase on on earth you mentioned two to three degrees
Celsius from pre-industrial times earlier do you do you have an opinion or are you just unsure?
I am totally unsure and it's because i'm also completely skeptical of um you know you'll see
these a lot online passed around of these charts to 2100 about our co2 emissions or our energy use
and i've seen you know very reputable versions of those graphs that are literally outside the
range of uncertainty within their first year and these go to 2100 um so i think the future is way
more open-ended and the range of possibility is way kind of scarier and broader than most people
think may i mean or maybe i don't know what i'm talking about but um i do think they're also
as you do the link between energy and the economy is uh i think an under theorized um
sort of area and i think the coming out of the pandemic was sort of a helpful exercise for humanity
because it reminded us that you know the economy isn't just charts on a graph and price discovery
and things it's a physical material world it's flows of energy and it's a material
and if a supply chain you know can't get a thing from this part of the world to that part of the
world or you can't ramp up energy production fast enough then you see this shock in the global economy
and there are people working on that that are you know making understanding of the economy
a much more physical thing but i think that's sort of the cutting edge and something that
we're really going to have to figure out um if we're going to figure if we're going to figure
anything out one of my deepest hopes is that um your very distant descendant the peter junior to
the eighth uh power a hundred thousand years from now is not uh uh if he or she exists seeing a layer
of nuclear uh residue uh in in the geological record of the future uh because i that i think
that is um the most direct path to the next mass extinction and i'm really hopeful that we can avoid
that yeah i think i mean the thing that really keeps me up at night is the unknown response of
the carbon cycle itself so there's this tendency to think that we are it's only going to get as
hot as we we all let it basically and i think that is generally the output that you get from a lot
of models but i know people who study geoscientists who study events deep in arts past who actually
attribute a lot of the chaos to pushing the carbon cycle sort of out of bounds enough that
then it kind of goes on a on a bizarre trajectory and i think the more we push on the system the
more chance that there is of something sort of unpredictable and like that happening i'm sure
you've seen the data the last few months peter this is being recorded on october 26th um are we
in a phase shift right now um with the uh reduction in ice the global temperature the storms the
floods uh or is this just el nino linkedin we're going to mean revert i've tried to navigate the
conversation among atmospheric physicists and it seems like there's some debate about about that
exact question and i'm you know not equipped to come down with a judgment but uh it could be either
the fact that it's a possibility that we could be entering a new regime is certainly frightening
but i think you know it's possible that this is just el nino and um and you know the natural
climate variability in the same way that the you know so-called warming pause was natural
variability that people sort of pointed to as indication that warming it slowed down you know
these there's a lot of noise in the system and it's extracting the signal out of it that's difficult
but uh yeah i mean there's not been the new york times by uh atmospheric scientists the other
week asking whether global warming was accelerating i saw people debating that online but it's
definitely frightening that um i've heard people say oh what's all happening much faster than we
thought and that's not true at all you know james hansons testimony was uh 25 years ago or 25 years
ago so 35 years ago so it's right on schedule that i what i worry about is that that sort of
linear trajectory gets a little steeper so hopefully that doesn't happen
so uh given that i know a lot and care a lot about this topic i could keep you for three
or four hours but um i want to be respectful of your time if you have a few more minutes i'd like
to ask you some some personal questions that i i'd like to ask all my guests so you're a science
journalist uh used to live in boulder now in dc writing another book you obviously think about
living through the co2 pulse and you're aware of energy the economy geopolitics as an observer of
these systems do you have any personal advice to the viewers of this show at this time of
what some call uh the metacrisis um i think it's figuring out what you lever you can push
what your contribution is there's a risk in just sort of being saturated by the news or
refreshing your social media feed and just feeling overwhelmed but you know figuring out what the
pressure point is uh that you can contribute to whether it's answering these fundamental science
questions or um organizing if that's more of your skill um and if you give yourself a concrete
goal you can feel a little less helpless uh in the face of this stuff for i mean
i think especially with with social media uh and sort of this just terribly addictive uh
you know constant feed of of dreadful news from all over the world
disengaging not in a sort of apathetic way but trying to step back from the news i mean that's
one of the great gifts of you know earth science and geology is i'm able to think on longer time
scales than just you know who's the next speaker the house going to be um because if you're constantly
reacting and you're not doing any strategizing or organizing or um difficult work then you're
not going to have the most adaptive response to i'm this is all very vague uh but no it's it's
good advice to uh to your podcast host as well because we are i mean everything is unfolding
it's not just climate it's geopolitics its interest rates are going up it's affordability it's
inequality uh i mean there's it's it's just a tragic and beautiful and amazing time to be
alive and i think you're right that that knowing that this deep time perspective
it it's it makes it a little bit more of a story and i don't know it feels calming to me that we're
part of this planetary evolving yeah i mean there's something consoling to know that the
earth will be fine in the long run not that that matters on human time scales it's more just than
what an utter shame and embarrassment it would be to get this incredible sort of cosmic gift here
at the uh where that planet's been handed to us on a silver platter we live in this miraculously
habitable place and within a geological eye blank who we could completely screw it up you know
the earth in 10 million years even if we do that there's going to be cool animals and the earth
will be in it you know won't even have any signs that we were over here unless you're really combing
the earth looking for extinction boundaries where we where we disappeared um but yeah we live on
human time scales and we care we care about you know relationships in our lives and you know people
we love and unless we figure out how to live in concert with the planet's sort of cycles then
there's the chance for a lot of short-term misery in the next few centuries for human beings
are you married you have kids i am not i i think i would also change my perspective
yeah well uh i mean i don't have kids either but i used to teach kids uh or 19 year olds
what recommendations do you have for a young person listening to this program
the world that i know best which is the research community and the academic community it is
increasingly the problems are going to be interdisciplinary um
and there's a lot of resistance to that in academia um people who sort of
try to make grand sweeping statements about that unite several different fields
are often attacked for doing so sometimes good reason but um
that's where all the big questions are i think and uh so if you're going into academia and
i think it's i think it's good to explore you know not the well-trod territory but sort of
try to unite these these different fields like
current global geochemical cycles and human history or the or the global economy um
it seems like that's where a lot of the exciting uh kind of work is
so this is a question that i think uh i'm going to start asking my guests which is i believe
that one of the largest underutilized human resources in the world
is grad students and postdocs that are following the academic superorganism and the linear
reductionist uh worldview that could be asking really relevant questions in their research
to the metacrisis and kind of the things that you were just mentioning so in your field climate
oceans extinctions can you offer a few big questions that postdocs should or could be working on
that need research and answers or is that field relatively covered in in that space you know
you'll have these rock boundaries where the extinctions happen you know it happens in a layer
you know what happened within 20 000 years but the dynamics of how those things actually play out
we don't have a century by century sort of accounting which is what's sort of scary about
them they're kind of black boxes where we know everything goes wrong so that's still very much
an area that's open um the how this planet became habitable if you're interested in that that is
still very much a open question um the rise of animal life and the oxygenation of the planet all
these things that you know from my perspective the more i learn about earth i used to be a
total space nerd and dream about going other planets and the more i learn about this place
the more i realize just kind of how special it is and how what a bizarre series of accidents
there is in our geologic past that to get us to this point to have this conversation so if your
imagination is fired by these sorts of big cosmic questions that's definitely an area to go into um
and yeah i mean it's these interdisciplinary topics so um
um
there are i've seen conferences recently that are about how to energy and information
structure society throughout human history um what is the relationship of
how humans are organized and their interaction with the sort of physical and enter energy world
around them um and if you're a if you're in a getting a historic history phd and you propose
that you could be you know laughed out of the room because it's such a abstract and bizarre
topic but i think if we really want to understand what the phenomenon of humanity on the planet
really is it's trying to bridge these these worlds um because if we're going to persist
into geological future we need to understand how we're how things like society and institutions
are now structuring the nature around us well here's a specific one um yeah i'm sure you're
familiar with uh jeff bezos and elan musk's attempts to get to outer space to eventually
colonize outer space um which given what you just said we don't even know our own planet uh
quite well enough but you just mentioned you used to be a space nerd but you've also studied
the history of life on earth do you think there's life on other planets and what's the the math and
the logic of your opinion i think there's i mean depending on how out there you want to get if the
universe is extraordinarily big and possibly infinite which there's some reason to think
it's somewhere in that ballpark then it's a mathematical certainty that mean you are having
this conversation it's just repeating at a certain distance over and over again because
there's only so many uh there's only so many arrangement of of atoms that you can have in a
certain space that you're eventually going to do all the combinations and start repeating again so
this is just actually uh i've seen a paper where it has the exact just how many meters you have to
go away it's like 10 to the 10 to the 26 meters away there's an exact replica of you so that's
the super out there question but or the super out there answer but yeah i think there's definitely
i think there's probably intelligent life out there i would imagine given how unusual this
planet is and its history is they're probably so far away that it's sort of we're not really going
to talk to them um because i do think intelligent life is very rare just given the number of contingent
steps that took us to get here i think life is probably a pretty general phenomenon especially
if it is this sort of channel of energy dissipation that planets is available to planets um that yeah
if you have alkaline hydrothermal vents that's somewhere else in the universe and the chemistry
is pretty pretty similar to our early solar system you'll get you'll get life but uh getting energetic
aerobic intelligent life is probably pretty difficult and so for the indeterminate future
we are left with this pale blue dot which is where we'll make our stand to quote Carl Sagan
um thank you for your um research and your time today and i really look forward to um
reading your your upcoming book next year and maybe we'll have you back for a
um a co2 or extinction roundtable yeah that'd be great thanks so much for having me i'm a
i'm a big fan of the show and so it's a it's an honor and pleasure to be able to talk to you today
