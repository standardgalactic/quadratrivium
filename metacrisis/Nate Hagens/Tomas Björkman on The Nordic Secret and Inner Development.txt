Your second book Thomas was called the Nordic secret
Let's just start with what what is the Nordic secret?
Okay, so I said first of all
Mentioned that I've written the book together with Lena Rachel Anderson my Danish
friend and colleague she she's a philosopher and and author and she really
Did the the most heavy work on on that book?
So full credit to Lena on the Nordic secret
What we do in that book is that we unpack a very important part of
The history of the Nordic countries and the fact that we
Just a little bit more than a hundred years ago all the Nordic countries at the end of the 1800s were amongst the poorest
non-democratic
authoritarian
Nations in Europe we were so poor that at the end of the 1800s up to 30% of the working population in
Sweden emigrated mainly to the to the you to the US and then just a few generations later
Even before the Second World War, we were all amongst the happiest the richest the most stable industrial democracies in the world and
Many of those benefits are still amongst us. We are starting to lose a little bit of this but
The fact that we manage the transition from a pre-modern society into a modern society
So well
It's worth investigating because I think that we as a civilization are now at a similar transition
from
Modernity into some sort of new
Society so what can we learn and the learning and the secret around this is that we had some very
visionary
Intellectuals and politicians in all the Nordic countries a hundred years ago who knew the importance of
Inner development and inner growth and the specifically the connection between inner growth and cultural evolution and and societal
evolutions and
They knew that in times of rapid societal change and uncertainty. It's just so
Easy for us humans to want to have an external authority to hold on to
Dogmatic religion or a strong authoritarian political leader
but these intellectuals and
Politicians they didn't want to be authoritarian leaders
They were firmly committed to build
Democracy and they knew that the only way to build democracy and be and keep democracy is if you build it from bottom up
So they wanted to find a way where they could
facilitate
the inner development of
Capacities in a large scale a large part of the population on a large scale and
specifically help in this very important adult development
step
Where we go from being
Again depended on an external authority being outed directed
To become inner directed to connect with our own inner compass and be able to in a much much more profound way
Hold the complexity of rapid social change without freaking out
100 years ago
This was a hundred or even a bit more a hundred to a hundred and fifty years ago
It was at the end of the 1800s and the way they went about to do this was extraordinary
Because what they did was that they created
Educational centers or even we might use the word retreat centers because these were small centers out in nature
specifically
Dedicated to helping young adults in their 20s to
Take these important developmental steps
and when this program
So I should say sorry at the turn of the last century yet
1900 there were a hundred centers like this just in
Denmark
75 in Norway and a hundred and fifty in Sweden
where young adults later on with full-state subsidy could spend up to six months in
retreat
with a specific aim of
Trying to develop their
emotional and cognitive complexity and
becoming agents becoming conscious agents and co-creators of
the new society
What did those exist in France and Germany and the United States at that time?
Well
I have not as such no no no I'm not not in France
that this originally came from a German idea about
How we as humans have the capacity life long capacity to come to continue develop our
Inner
Capacities or emotional and cognitive capacities that was from the German building philosophers
Like Schiller, Goethe, Herder,
Thonhund, Balt, Hegel
This is where the market comes in again as if we quantify all the
Things that our ancestors valued were parsing it into a dollar and the dollar doesn't reward some of the things that you just said
so it's almost as if Scandinavia already had a
People planets profit hierarchy a hundred years ago. It was just you know, yeah
Yeah, no no no very much because we back then German was our first academic language, so
our
Intellectuals back then were actually reading these German philosophers in
in original German language and of course as I was about to say they all reacted against the Enlightenment's
Materialistic view and the view of our mind as a rational machine
They were very much into nature the relationship between humans and nature
the relationship between our
Inner capacity to develop our mind and consciousness and how that inner development was always done in in
relationship to culture and
Cultural development so with that view that it is important to facilitate
Lifelong inner development not just for the benefit of the individual but for the benefit of societal development
Then of course these ideas come very
natural but when we then later on lost that worldview and
Definitely after the Second World War if not a bit earlier reverted to the Enlightenment
materialistic worldview then
these centers as
Inner capacity building centers or consciousness development centers didn't even make sense to us in our understanding
So today we believe that these centers were mainly adult education
Which there were to a certain extent absolutely
But the important reason for their establishment was really to to empower people to take these important
Developmental steps to be able to not just have the knowledge
But to have the inner capacity to act as co-creators of the new world and do those still exist today
They do they do many of them do exist but but we today we have more the impression that they are
around lifelong learning
rather than
Developing these capacities, but I should answer your question there if they exist in other parts of the world
And there is an interesting twist there. I show you a copy of the book. This is the Nordic secret
Do you recognize the woman up in the corner there?
No, it's a black American woman and this is her mugshot
It's Rosa Parks Rosa Parks
Who refused to give up her seat on on the bus in Alabama and the reason and you could ask
What is Rosa Parks doing on on a cover of the Nordic secret that together with the German Philosopher's GÃ¶tten Schiller?
Well, she has said in many interviews that what gave her the inner compass and the strength to
Actually remain seated on the bus
Even if she know that the law of the land said that she should give it up to to that white guy
Was the fact that she had participated in one of the in one of these developmental centers
Not in Scandinavia, but in the US
Because there were an American guy called miles miles Horton
Who in the 20s spent a year in Denmark?
Learning this concept and then going back to the US and
starting for folk high schools, which is this concept is called in the US of which the Highlander
Folk School in Tennessee is
the most
Notable one where Rosa Park Martin Luther King and a lot of people in the in the civil rights movement
participated and they actually paid to play these four schools in in the US played such an important role that
President Obama at the end of his presidency when he had the four heads of states of the Scandinavian
Countries or the Nordic countries at a state visit
Said something along the line and this is still available on on YouTube this speech
That you Scandinavian countries have given a lot of gifts to the world and I don't know if it was
Dynamite and the IKEA or whatever, but but a forgotten gift and perhaps the most important is the concept of the folk high schools
Because if it hadn't been for that
Originally Danish concept and that that had come to the US I
Would probably not be standing here in front of you as the first black American president. So that's quite strong
