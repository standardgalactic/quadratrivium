I guess you could say that the language is just not translatable. Like, I don't think that it's,
I don't think that you can really say, um, so even, we don't call the land the land,
it's not an object, it's a grandma. Like, it's not, like you asked the question earlier, did,
you know, do you think of things as relatives, like I think of my, yes,
that we absolutely do. And we treat, we treat it as such. We know that, that, you know, the earth
is where you go back to. We all come from the earth and we all go back there. And there's,
there's a lot of, there's a lot of understandings that still exist today about how, how we treat
our grandmother. And when we talk about the Black Hills, we had a lot of elders who stood up and
they protested when that court decision came down. They, they were upset and they would put
up signs. This is when I was a little girl, they would have, um, their protest signs would say,
never sell your grandmother. Never sell your grandmother. The land is sacred. The sacred
is not for sale. And we, we just adhere to that. We're poor. We don't want that billion dollars.
It's a huge source of pride. It is very important today. It's as important today as it was 40 years
ago. I, I would say that there are some people that would say, like, we could do a lot with that
money. And there are some, we're not a, we're not monolithic, like any people, like we have people
who will say, like, we should probably take that money. And, and, uh, I would say that by and large,
I don't know any of those people. Most of the people that I know say this is, it's just so
cohesive. It's a, it's a cohesive understanding of what we're going to do and what we're going to
pass on to our grandchildren to do. And that is to fight for the return of the lands
and refuse the money.
