I mean, I think, Nate, that we're all in a process of exploring to understand what is
a healthy masculine and what is a healthy feminine.
And when I speak to full spectrum leadership, it's not only about those four levels of our
humanity, it's also about we all have masculine and feminine traits within us.
And I want to be living in a way that gives me access to all of my masculine and all of
my feminine at any given time.
And not to be pigeonholed because of what body I came in as.
So I don't think that men are designed for transaction.
I do think that men carry a certain biological capacity for actually caretaking and nurturance.
It's a different relational focus, perhaps, than the feminine focus.
But when I reflect back about ancient cultures, and one of my favorite models is actually
the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Six Nations in upstate New York, and their model for democracy
is that the men and women are treated as full equals.
And they tell stories that when the founding fathers came to them to borrow from their
confederacy for the creation of the U.S. Constitution, part of what the Iroquois said
to them was, where are your women?
How can you do this without your women?
And besides that, this slavery thing, it's going to be a problem for you, and you're
going to have to deal with it sooner or later.
And so in their system, the women actually choose the leader of the tribe.
And they choose him by observing the little boys to see who has the leadership qualities
most needed for that role.
And they have the power to rescind that authority from the leader if ever they feel that he's
not serving the common good.
