Virtually every economist, if you ask them who's the father of economics, gonna answer Adam Smith, and in a sense, I was
inclined that way, except that I've read previous economists to Smith as well, including the physiocrats. And
my attitude was that the physiocrats were more advanced on important issues, both macroeconomics
and the role of energy in production than the Smith was.
Who were the physiocrats?
They were a bunch of 19th and 18th century French, mainly French, but also some Irish economists who
worked in France. And this is before we actually had the term of economist in many ways.
So there were people who were trying to analyze how the production system works.
And they're called physiocrats because the leading personality, the leading intellect in the group,
was Francois Connais. And Connais was the physician to the king of France. He was working at the time
when we were having the very first autopsies to find out, you know, what was inside a body.
Because for a long time in the West, there were religious rules against carving open a dead body.
And Connais was involved in this. He found all these tubes running all over the body
and had this vision of a system of circulation for the body. And then when it came to looking at the
economy, they had the same idea. There's a system of circulation. Goods go from one spot to another,
money goes in the opposite direction. And there was this sense of saying,
we can see the economy is a dynamic system in the same way we're now realizing the body is,
because all these tubes flow down and flow back up again, the arteries go through the body,
they become veins, come back up again, there's circulation of blood, there's mixing of blood
with oxygen, all these sorts of things were the vision. And in that sense, the basic paradigm
they started from wasn't mechanics as neoclassical economists have ended up doing,
it was biology. And that was a far more sensible starting place.
