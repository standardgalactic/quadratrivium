You're listening to The Great Simplification with Nate Hagins. That's me.
On this show, we try to explore and simplify what's happening with energy, the economy, the environment, and our society.
Together with scientists, experts, and leaders, this show is about understanding the bird's-eye view of how everything fits together,
where we go from here and what we can do about it as a society and as individuals.
Gerardo Ceballos is a well-known ecologist and conservationist working on animal population ecology.
He is world-renowned for his influential work on global patterns of distribution of diversity and extinction risk invertebrates.
Gerardo and I have a wide-ranging discussion about animal populations.
The sixth mass extinction is new project called Creatures United and how we can better care about and protect Earth's remaining biodiversity.
This conversation got kind of intense at times.
Well, because the subject matter is so important, what's happening is so tragic and is so little regarded in our national discourse.
I hope you listen and learn from my conversation with Professor Gerardo Ceballos,
and perhaps it will change how you think about the natural world in some small way.
Okay, my friend, we have a lot to talk about.
You have written numerous books and are a very heavily cited ecologist.
Your books range from mammals of Mexico to the annihilation of nature, and we're going to talk a lot about this.
But first I would ask you, how did you first get interested personally in studying animals and animal populations?
Well, as far as I know, my parents say that since I was very, very little, I used to say that I was going to study animals.
I didn't know that it was biology.
But then when I was like 12, 13 years old, I got a book.
There were like tiny books, and I got one.
The third one is called The Last Schema, and it was the story of the Schema Curlew,
who was the most abundant species on the planet, and it was a novel written in 1954,
and basically talks about the last two curlews who will refrain from Patagonia in Argentina to the Arctic.
And one was killed, the female, and the male continued the flight.
It was one of the longest migrations in the planet.
And he spent the whole summer singing for females, and nobody shows up.
And I got full of anxiety thinking that I could go to the streets in my city and another city and another city without finding another human being.
And at that point, I decided that what I wanted to do is to save species from extinction.
And then at high school, one of my teachers taught me that it was ecology and so on.
But basically, that was the origin of my interest in extinction and animals and so on.
So you started with your heart, and then your head followed?
That's exactly right, and I think I'm still a lot of what I do is from my heart,
and then I just frame it in terms of the science to be able to make it available to everybody.
OK, so, Gerardo, today, how many species exist on Earth other than humans, and how do we know this?
Well, that's a very interesting question.
We know so far that around two million species has been described since 1758 when Linaeo
created a system for classifying animals on plants and organisms on the planet.
But what is very, very interesting is that the estimates, the current estimates of how many species are in the planet
range from 50 million to several billions.
But just we take the most conservative thing that we estimate that there are around 50 million species of
plants, animals, and microorganisms in the planet, and we have described only two million.
That means that most of all the biodiversity in the planet is unknown to science.
And this is not surprising, though, then that every year more than 18,000 species are scientifically described.
And in terms of mammals, there are not only rodent or small animals that include big animals like whales.
Last year, two new whales were found in the waters of the U.S. and Mexico.
And since 2000, more than 80 species of monkeys has been described.
In 2017, a whole new species of orangutan was found in Sumatra.
So the wealth of the biodiversity in the planet is really unbelievable.
It's amazing.
And what is unfortunate is most of the species are unknown to us.
It almost feels paradoxical that soon after discovering some of these species, they might go extinct, you know, in some of these cases.
In many cases, for instance, one of the most interesting stories is that the stellar Sikao, it was described 27 years after it was found
in the 1700s in the very islands.
And it was found actually by the Bittus Bering expedition to Alaska and this area in Russia.
And they collected, and after it became extinct, it was described.
And there are species like the Saola that is the largest at 100 kilogram, 250 pound animal, antelope-like animal,
which was described in Vietnam in 2006, something like that.
And it is most likely extinct now.
So many of those species are at the brink of extinction when they are discovered by science.
So I don't think you can definitively answer this, but the number of species alive today as a conservation biologist,
how would you estimate that versus 10,000 years ago or even longer ago than that, the same more or less?
Well, the most important part of this is, like right now, we have the highest number of species in the last 700 million years in the planet.
We are in the pinnacle of species diversity.
And this is well established because we know how many species have been accumulated.
And remember that evolution is a trade-off between extinction and speciation.
And basically, during normal times, there are more species evolving than species becoming extinct.
And we know now that there are more species than in the last 700 million years.
We also know now that, unfortunately, in the last 10,000 years, we have lost a great deal of species,
but also population and also of individuals of those species.
We don't know exactly how many because we don't know how many there are.
How can we know how many there have become extinct?
But we have good grasp for what has happened in the last, let's say, 100 years in terms of what have we lost.
Well, I know most people in the United States, we have this fascination with dinosaurs and Tyrannosaurus rex and Brontosaurus.
And they lived 70 million years ago.
And most people don't realize that North America was a veritable Serengeti, like 20,000 years ago,
where we had five species of giant cats and beavers the size of a Volkswagen and, you know,
bully mammoths and like unbelievable biodiversity not that long ago.
Well, I mean, this is what we know that the Pleistocene extinction in the Pleistocene is the last two million years.
In the last late Pleistocene, let's say 18,000, 20,000, 30,000 years ago, a lot of the species,
the biggest species become extinct in the planet.
And this is a combination of a couple of things, changes in the climate in the planet.
Remember, then in the maximum glacial, 18,000 years ago, there were around three kilometers of ice on Kansas.
Just to give us an idea how different was the planet.
But at that time, when humans start to disperse from Africa, they start to exterminate some of the largest species.
There were still some mammoths alive, something like 4,000 years ago in some of the islands in Alaska and in the region.
So in the last few thousand years, humans, we were able to exterminate most of the larger animals, like mammoths, mastodons and so on.
Many of them directly and many of them because we destroyed the prey of the large carnivores.
And as those carnivores eventually succumbed to the lack of food, to the changes in the climate and the human exploitation.
Fast forward to today.
How many roughly vertebrate animals with a backbone, how many vertebrate species are there on the planet?
Well, vertebrates, we mean by vertebrates, mammoths, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes are basically around 40,000, 45,000 species in the planet.
50 million or so.
Out of the 2 million species that we know, around 45,000 are vertebrates.
And many, many more are still on the sky, but we don't really know how many will be at the end, accounted for.
Just let me tell you that if we maintain the pace of describing species like we have been doing since 1758, they will take a few thousand years to complete the description of all these species.
So it is impossible that we will know how many species and what are those species in the planet.
That right there, what you just stated is one of my greatest wishes of all time.
That 2,000 years from now, we are still cataloging Earth's species.
That will be wonderful because if in 2,000 years or 3,000 years, we will still be cataloging a species, it will be great for two reasons.
Once we will still be here, humans, humanity will be still in the planet.
And second, it will mean that our activities didn't impact so much the planet.
So many of those species will still be alive at that time.
Well, we're going to get into the factors that influence that.
But first, let me just ask you a personal question.
Do you have a favorite animal or a favorite vertebrate?
Well, yes, I work with jaguars and bison and many animals.
But I think perhaps my most preferred animal are flying squirrels.
We have those here in Wisconsin.
Yes, and we have them here in Mexico.
I discovered them in Central Mexico many years ago.
And they are so unique, so beautiful that I become really in love with flying squirrels.
Most people think I prefer jaguars or something like that.
I love them, but I really like flying squirrels.
You're at some property in your hometown there in Mexico, right?
Is there nature and wildlife there?
Or are you in a big city?
I live in a city.
It's a big city, but around the city there is still a lot of forest.
And I have a ranch close by that is basically just in the middle of a forest.
And we have a lot of wildlife there.
Do you have a wildlife camera where you go and see what ran by in the night?
I have a couple here and I love it.
Definitely, that's one of my passions.
One of my passions is to photograph wildlife.
And I travel with my family and I have forced them to go with me to Africa, Asia,
to so many places to take photographs of animals.
Yeah, I've been really fortunate to go to Africa several times.
I would have to say my favorite animal is the cape hunting dog.
And I've seen three packs of them live in my life on three different trips.
So I love wild animals.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, I know I'm lucky.
I mean, my story just briefly, my parents moved around a lot when I was a kid
and my mom always took me to zoos when we were in cities.
And I would sit in the front seat of the car and scan the horizon for animals
even when I was three years old.
So whatever it is, that's what motivated me.
I think it occurs and it's a blessing.
Yeah, well, I mean, at the end of the day,
that's what's sacred to me is the animals that we share the planet with.
And I question how our culture is stressed with economic and poverty
and political things.
Could we ever have a cultural consciousness where we recognize the species
that we haven't even described yet and we're changing their ecosystems?
Could that ever be like primary in people's heads?
I know it isn't yours and many of the people that we have as friends,
but could that ever be a cultural calling?
I don't know.
I definitely don't know.
I see some good signs that were going in the right direction,
but I see so many bad signs that were really in a bad direction.
Just in Mexico right now, the Mexican president is investing a lot in fossil fuels.
I mean, who in his right mind would be investing in fossil fuels?
And he was mocking the other day the U.S.
because somebody in the U.S. said that they were investing in electric cars.
And he said, oh, come on, why do you invest in electric cars?
And this is the president of the one in Mexico who is like the 11th economy of the planet, you know?
Let me tell you that people ask me a lot of times why I don't,
if I am interested in people in saving other people's and so on.
And of course I am, but to be honest, I mean, my major quest in life
is to save as many species of plants and animals from extinction.
I know that if we manage to infect other people with this idea,
these species are our companions.
These species have been with us since our first ancestors three million years ago
start to walk through evolution towards what we are now.
And those companions, those species, plants, animals who have been with us along this journey,
it was what we are destroying, it was what we are killing.
It was what directly or indirectly destroying with our activities.
And for me, that really makes me wonder if we don't have any sensibility to understand that.
What hope we have for humanity if we don't even know how to treat those species
who have been working with us.
Do you think it's more that we don't care or that we don't know or some combination?
Well, definitely it's a combination of that we don't care because we don't know,
but sometimes we know and we don't care because the society,
we have been moving to that idea that to having wealth, to accumulate things and so on
is better than anything else.
And most of the young people here in Mexico throughout the world
are feeling that there are failures if they don't have a house or two houses
or three houses and a car when they are 20, 22, 23 years old.
Many of them, I mean, I see so many young people who have grown so detached from nature,
from understanding the value, the beauty of all these manifestations of life.
I wonder if we ever want to change.
And I have seen that this has become even worse with the advance of technology
with cell phones and tablets and so on.
I mean, most of these children never go out to play.
It really makes me wonder if we're going to win this battle
with all the technology and all these stimulus
taking the people, children, young adults and adults
away from what really matters in terms of the environment.
Because you can get the same neurochemicals from a phone
that you could from going on a bird watching trip in the forest
even though it's a total false representation of it.
You can get the same stimulation from games and pictures of animals
where it's a lot of effort to go into the woods.
And so our brains can be hijacked by technology
when the real thing is just out there.
It's definitely that they're being hijacked and you're right
that our brains, the same regions of the brain
that are stimulated by alcohol, by drugs or by pleasure
or different kind of things, by entertainment
are being moved by these video games and so on.
But let me tell you, when I was young, when we were kids
we didn't have to go out far away.
We would go outside in the garden and play there
with dirt and with stone and rocks and I mean
I understand that sometimes it may take a lot of effort
to go out away, but I don't know, when you were a kid
we just go out anywhere, sometimes to the forest
and sometimes to our garden, sometimes even to the streets
and we have a wonderful time having the same kind of stimulation
than they have now with this fake stimulation
with their cell phones and so on.
We were blessed, Gerardo, we were blessed with that.
When I grew up, when I was in grade school, fourth, fifth, sixth grade
I would come home from school every day, get my dog
and we would go into the foothills of the Siskiu Mountains
in southern Oregon and I would just explore for three hours
till dinner time, looking at trees and finding salamanders.
Every day that's what I did, looking at deer and other things.
I always, I knew there was a small, small, small chance
there would be a mountain lion out there
and that's like what made it really exciting.
There was a movie called Citizen Kane
where Rosebud was his sled that he longed for his childhood.
That sort of experience in the natural world
kind of carefree is my Rosebud
and that's perhaps why we're friends
and we're having this conversation.
It is so interesting because when I was at junior level
we lived close to Toluca, this city is called Toluca
and I was very deep but at that time it was small
and just next to my house there was a lake
and I will spend, I will go home, have a lunch,
Mexico lunch, I want two, three in the afternoon
and then go to this place and until my parents
will have to come to look out for me at seven o'clock,
eight o'clock at night when it was really dark
because I will be, it was so addictive
that I will spend day and day and day looking for salamanders
as you say, snakes and raccoons and bats and so on.
Those were the years that really formed me as a naturalist.
I wrote my first paper that obviously was a kind of
really bad in the sense but it was like a natural history paper
on the natural history of the water snakes on that lake
because I will remember and I will write
what were they doing in the spring and the summer
and the winter and some, sometimes I will see
what they were feeding on, who were spraying upon them
and so on and I managed to write something
like a 10 page thing that I saw was my first paper.
My parents used to laugh and say,
this is so weird, my kids are so weird
but they were very supportive and as you say
we are incredibly lucky that we have that
and this is what I tried to give to my children.
They were able to go and let me tell you this story.
We used to go to Africa and those places
and I used to say, okay, we go to Disneyland
and then we go to the Everglades
so we go to this place in Europe and then we go to Africa.
And then one day my 16 year old, since he was becoming a teenager
he said, oh, where are we going this year to college
and I explained the places we were going to Africa
and I said, do I have to go?
And I said, no, you don't have to and I left him
and we left and then three years or four years after work
he said, when are we going to Africa?
And I said, why?
He said, because I'm dying for Africa.
It was amazing.
I managed to understand the value, the beauty of all of this, you know
after passing his teenager years
and they love, they don't do science
and what they do is one of them is a scientist, a mathematician,
the lady and the other one is in finance
but both of them really love nature
and both of them really are balanced
on understanding the value of having this education.
Well, building on that
and I want to make sure I have a lot of questions for you
about your research and your prognosis
but is it possible that we growing up in affluent countries
are privileged to care about the environment like we do
and that most recent generations
and many places on the earth today
are just concerned with making a living
and how they're going to feed their families this weekend
and they don't see the environment from a bird's eye view
the way that you and I are discussing it
so is environmental concern the way that you and I see it
is that a privilege of this fossil fuel bonanza period
that we're going through?
Well, it is a privilege
but it's not a privilege only of the people who are more affluent.
I work a lot with people, local people here in Mexico
sometimes they are the owners of a large tract of forest
tropical forests in southern Mexico
and what I find is incredible
they obviously are not rich at all
they really sometimes have difficult times to feed
and most of the time when we go there and help them
to find ways so they can protect their forests
while making some money or by protecting it
it is incredible how much love, how much pride
how much attachment they have to nature
so I mean we have been people for instance calling me
and I said okay we have two cows
and they were killed by a yawar
and I said I'm so sorry
and I said what do you want to do?
I said well we don't want to kill the yawar
is there any way you can help us to pay a little bit
or something for those animals
that we can recover a little bit of our losses
and I said you don't want to kill the yawar
I said no no we don't want to kill the yawar
we basically are invading their land
and this is a story that happens time after time after time
when we are lucky in the planet is the people
poor or richer or in between
who has the possibilities to enjoy nature
for whatever reason
in some cases it's because they live next door to nature
although they don't have a lot of money
and sometimes people more affluent with us
who can live far away from nature
but we can go rather often because we have the means
so this takes me to the point that
determine if you are going to care for nature or not
if you have a lot of money or not
Do you think that we have some sort of evolutionary
relationship with nature and affinity
like E.L. Wilson referred to it as biophilia
is there something that is irrespective of our current
modern consumer culture
that is ingrained with us
our relationship to nature what do you think about that?
I think definitely we have some grain
this relationship with nature with animals
and it can be for instance most of the
when small children are afraid of darkness
and I think this is a manifestation of our recent past
where if you were not afraid of darkness
you will go crawl out of the house
and you will be eaten by a hyena
or bite by a snake or whatever
and the same thing I mean
most of the people that I know
even if they have lived in the city
once you take them to a park
or once you take them to a forest
I would say probably 99% of them
they will enjoy it
and they will feel so quiet so calm
so definitely we have evolved
in nature and the forest
the lakes the animals
the plants, well plants and animals
are part of our evolution
many human beings are still part of that
I mean I don't know of the 8 billion people
but I don't know maybe 2-3 billion
but probably more are still in close contact to nature
this is on the one hand
on the other hand being bombarded by these ideas
that having wealth is what counts
is causing a lot of problems
but if we think that we have this link
that's something that we need to exploit
towards trying to get conscience
at the global scale
for saving the biodiversity
well like you I'm a scientist
and I have a scientific mind
so I can't explain what I'm about to tell you
but my first time in Africa
I went with my dad
he was on a hunting trip
and I just went when I was 21 years old
to take pictures
and I felt this affinity
like I was coming home or something like that
it was like this primal feeling
of connectedness
the first couple days in Botswana at that time
it was a really odd sensation
but I just so loved it
I will never forget it
and that's very interesting
because my kids and us
when they were the first time in Africa
we were crossing the Serengeti
and we spent like 15 days there
and I remember
I don't know which one of them said one afternoon
wow this is so beautiful
it feels like home
exactly in the same feeling
that you would describe
sitting down on the
a heap looking at the horizon
as it feels like home
it's our home
it's where we come from
definitely there is that affinity
okay so
with that entree
let's get into your work sir
you recently wrote
co-wrote a paper
estimating the challenges of avoiding
a ghastly future
catalogued a lot of
risks to biodiversity
species, ecosystems
could you just give us an overview
of your general findings
either in that paper or generally
you know what percent of natural ecosystems
have been lost in the last
50 years, animals, etc
well I think one of the most
important contributions
I have done in science
has been to try to understand
what is the magnitude of
the extinction crisis
and I was fortunate to go to
Stanford to do a sabbatical
and meet Paul Ehrlich
and talking to him
I developed these ideas
and I wrote the first paper on
extinction species extinction
in Mexico in 1992
something like that
when there was the first president
in Mexico who was very neoliberal
and at that time I thought
I wrote that
it would be really good
we will take care of
the important thing of the environment
but also could be the tipping point
to make a humanity
in really bad shape
and then I went to Stanford
and I got exposed to so many people
and so many ideas
and then one of the first questions
that I wanted to answer is
at that time many people would think
that extinction was bad
but it was part of evolution
and speciation
and that's the basic
one of the basic processes of evolution
working there first of all
I was one day listening
to Paul Ehrlich talking about
populations extinction
and it occurred to me that that was one of the critical
points we were not
understanding the magnitude of extinction
because we were looking at
the species that become extinct
it's like if you go
and see the problem of a big
demia like they were having now
just counting the people
who died, obviously this is just
the final end
and a tiny part of the whole problem
so at that time
I wrote a paper with Paul Ehrlich
on what we called Web Alloy
for the first time what was
the magnitude
of population extinction in a whole group
in the planet, in this case mammals
we were able to
gather a database with the
distribution of species in the 1900s
and the current distribution
that was around 2000
and what we saw is a
brutal, literally a brutal
destruction
of populations of many species
the range was
like very big range
100% was contracted to
20, 15, 50%
so the range contraction
obviously implicates the
losing the populations
because the first time
I could see that the magnitude
for what we were doing to the
planet, biodiversity
in terms of the extinction
was really big.
So you're saying that if
you just count the extinctions
like the Dodo bird
or the Tasmanian tiger
that you're actually underestimating
the magnitude because there's a
difference between population extinction
and species extinction.
That's actually very important.
Let me give you an example.
If we have jaguars in Mexico
it doesn't matter
if they become extinct here
if there are jaguars in Brazil
in terms of the role
and function they play
in ecosystems and
in the provision of environmental
services that is all the benefit
we get from nature. So
disappearance of populations
are basically like extinctions
Is that what's called an ecological extinction?
Yeah, it's an ecological extinction.
It is similar.
Ecological extinction is when you have
species in an area
let's say
first of all population extinction
all species are made up
by several populations
and when the species become extinct
we have lost all the populations
but those populations
at the local and regional
level
are so important that when you lose them
you lose the value
and it's like it was a whole extinction.
Can you give an example of
one of those species and
that that happened? Just as I said
the elephants, you see the distribution
of the elephants, they were just at the beginning
of this century
almost one million elephants.
20 years ago? 30 years ago
there were one million.
And now there are 250,000 elephants
in the whole world
in the whole world, in whole Africa
so if you see
the map of the distribution
you will see an area
most of Africa will be covered
by the distribution of elephants
now you will see just dots
dots in the continent
small populations dispersed throughout the continent
so it means that we have lost elephants
in most of Africa
and by losing them
we have lost the role
and there are many roles that the elephants have
and let me give you two examples
on the one hand, for instance
they dispersed lots of plants
that they eat and then maintained the savannah
because they destroyed trees
to eat the bark so the savannah
when you lose the elephants are invaded
by
scrups and trees and eventually
you lose the savannah and you lose
the grasslands with so many animals
so the elephants are critical
to maintain the savannah
but recently other scientists have shown
that when you lose the elephants
and other angulates
and other species of larger mammals
that feed on plants
the grasses grow
more larger and on those grasses
the populations
of many rodents exploit
become very abundant
and those rodents have many diseases
that affect humans
so by losing the elephants
you are losing the composition
of the plants and then
this is causing a massive
increase of rodents
and those rodents transmit
diseases to humans
to domestic animals and to wildlife
so who will think
that the elephants
the presence of the elephant will be linked
to the presence and the abundance
of rodents in Africa
A conservation biologist might think that
but you're right, we don't normally think
in terms of systems, there is that
story, I don't know how true it is
in the wolves and the ecosystems
in the Yellowstone
similar sort of thing
it's very similar and it's basically
correct
so in the case of the elephants
just to highlight that
what are the main reasons that we've gone
from a million down to 250,000
in the last 25 years
well, basically
it's poaching
we are losing habitat
as more humans
population, we need more food
so more habitat
of the elephant is being destroyed
to plant crops
but basically the main problem
is we're still killing
elephants for
their ivory
just to give you an idea, 15 years ago
an elephant was being killed
every 15 minutes
an elephant was
illegally killed
even now an elephant is being killed
every 40 minutes
illegally to take their tusks
to the markets, especially
in China
and what is really incredibly surprising
is that the tusks
are useless
they use them for ornamentals
and for some crafts
but we're killing the elephants
because this huge appetite
for ivory and now the
the mafias in China
and in Africa and Mexico
and in the US
the mafias dealing with
the trade of animals
and in this specific case
of African elephants
have more power, more money
more guns than the guards
and many times that the local governments
it's a real, real
bad problem
I had another guest
I don't know if you know paleobiologists
Peter Ward
but he told me that
when we moved to ivory
and now of a sudden
deep coral reefs are being unearthed
because they're taking giant clams
as a replacement
for ivory that there's a big demand
for giant clams
because they're starting to change
the demand away from ivory a little bit
I don't know the details
of the story but
well the problem is
who needs ivory
I mean who can live without ivory
and who needs three houses
exactly, I mean
the pandemic is related to the trade
of animals in China
and civilization
the pangolins, the bats
if you put web market
in Google you will see horrendous
photographs and videos
of the way the domestic
and wild animals are
in cages in this market
in very unsanitary conditions
so it's very easy
for a disease to jump to a domestic animal
so to humans
so to be honest
it is the time
it is now the right time
to try to stop the legal trade
of animals although
saying it's easy
but the legal trade
of wildlife and plants
it is so big that
in terms of money
it's almost as big as the drugs
the drug trade
is it going to changing GDP
as our cultural goal
do we change the taxes
and the rules
or do we change people's aspirations
in other words do you devote all your money
to anti-poaching
people with rifles
and night goggles and things like that
or do you change the cultural
demand for
ivory and pangolin
and all that other crazy stuff
which is the answer
I think the answer is simple
in the sense that
it's impossible to have just one answer
the answer is we need to have
all of this we need to have
right now goggles and people
fighting to save the wildlife
and we need to try to change
corporations
and countries and the GDP
in other words
this is a complex issue
of a complex society
of a complex humanity
so what I'm saying is like
there is not simple answers
but the more
answers and the more
solutions we have
I think the easy will be
eventually to reach a society
that for me it's very easy
the new society coming from COVID
coming from this massive destruction
that were happening
will have to have two simple
elements it should be
socially more just
and socially sustainable
if you think it's so simple
obviously it
conveys the complexity
of this moment of humanity
but who will
in his right mind
not think that having
less poor people
and having more equitable
more equal
being more just with the poorest
will be good and who wouldn't
be thinking that protecting
forests and protecting more animals
and having more better less pollution
and so on will be
in better shape
it wasn't that long ago
that black humans
were treated and considered
subhuman it wasn't that
long ago that women
didn't have rights and couldn't
vote is it possible
that our culture will
recognize what we're doing
and extend some of these
recognitions to other species
especially
conscious self-aware species
like dolphins and bonobos
and things like that
culturally do you think that's possible
well definitely it's possible
it is very very possible
as you say in the 1970
we have the minority revolution
the racial revolution
the women revolution
we have the sexual revolution
we have the non-traditional
revolution and it happens
and it happens incredibly quickly
I try to think
like in the 70s or the late 1900s
in the late 1900s
the whole planet
suddenly has
all these new paradigms
that would change completely
the way we work
marxisms with Marx and we have
evolution with Darwin
we have psychological
changes with Freud and we have
the ideology and so on
it took
many years to catch up
now with the technology
that we have with the spread
in the social network and the instant
distribution of information
I think we have
a great great opportunity
we can use those resources
with these new ideas
and I see many of it also
many scientists many politicians
a lot of important
groups of people
talking about the right things
so I don't know if we will have enough time
before we collapse
a civilization
because the damage we have done to the
planet like a climate change
species extinction, toxification and so on
but what I think
and probably
I may be wrong but what I think is what
we are experiencing right now
is one of those times in the history
of humanity where many things
start to change and suddenly
they will change enough
and they will change us to the right direction
I hope you are right about that obviously
let me ask you this question
you know David Attenborough
is very popular and famous
for his narration of
wildlife centered shows
Planet Earth and some of these
shows are so stunningly beautiful
I grew up I used to watch
religiously Marlon Perkins
and the Mutual of Omaha's
Wild Kingdom
and it was like a rite of passage for my family
we would watch it I think Sunday nights
I would just so look forward to it
I can't watch those shows anymore
Gerardo
I can't watch Planet Earth
and every once in a while
like I live on a farm here and I walk out
in nature every day
and I have to do it for my mental health
but
sometimes I look at the nature
and I am just struck by this
dual lightning bolts
part of it is just the awe
and the beauty
and the wonder of nature
but it's a bittersweet feeling
because I also glimpse
fast forward ahead at what's going to happen
in the next century
to the nature and I feel this overwhelming
sadness and so as much
as I care about these things
and talking to scientists like you
and getting the word out
sometimes it's too painful
to be directly in it
do you know what I mean? You must know what I mean
Well, yeah
I am kind of weird in that sense
because
I have been working with extinction
and we changed the paradigm
and we were the first to show that
the species we lost in 100 years
we have been lost in 10,000 or more years
in normal times
and I have been able to be
like I said like the chronicles of death
in where we say
how many species have become extinct and so on
and
the population extinctions
and we called one of our terms
we call it the biological and
election because when I was
at the school
at high school
extinction was still selective
not yet animal or very restricted
ranch animals and so on
but now it's a biological and election
because basically a small or big
largely distributed or small distributed
beneficial or non-beneficial
and so on all kind of characteristics
that you may have all of those
species have become extinct because of us
in other words
the characteristics that will make
species more prone to extinction
has been wiped out by the
massive assault that we have in nature
so we call it biological annihilation
and I get sad and I get
sometimes get really down
but
I really think that I have this ability
and I'm glad I have it
because
the more I feel the heat
the more I push harder to harder
to harder to try to change the whole thing
yeah I totally agree
and that's what I'm dedicating my time
on this planet to doing
and the biological annihilation
of our planet
species let's be honest
yes it's reaching a crescendo
level but it's been happening for
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years
every human alive in the last
500 years has witnessed
part of this or it's happening during their time
so since you and I
have been on the planet in the late 60s
what percentage of wild animals
have been lost since around 1970
this is exactly what is mind blowing
since the 1970s
we have lost around
80%
of all the animals
what? 80%
of all the animals that used to be
in this planet have been lost
since 1970
so not the species but the numbers
of animals? Not the species
the individuals, the individuals animals
80%
of individual animals
have been lost
individuals who were part of populations
and populations who were part of species
some of these species have become extinct
some are the blink of a species
some of those species are still
more or less abandoned
those species are abandoned but in general
all of those
have lost so many individuals
just to give you other examples
in the 19, in the 2000s
something they published a really
well researched paper
where they chose that
at that time only 2%
of the large species
on the planet remain
compared to 1960s
2% of the charts
2% of the tuna, 2%
of any of the big fishes
that were still present in the ocean
we have wiped out at that time
98% of the large
fishes in the planet
and another example
is not only the big animals and the vertebrates
and so on
and this example
a rather good
and amazing good scientist
from Argentina
he used to live in Mexico
his name was Rapoport
and Rapoport one day
he wrote a really nice
book in Spanish
where he mentioned
that the changes there were
we were making in the planet
you could see them while driving
your car
and it's that example that when you
used to drive your car
there will be so many insects
splash on your windscreen
and now you can drive
for edges
I remember when I was not so long ago
I was still like 20 years old
in Mexico the gas station
you will stop and there will be
one guy coming to clean up
your windscreen and also the radiator
because the radiator will have so many animals
stuck by
that the car wouldn't
cool down properly the engine
so they clean up the radiator
and they clean up the engine
and there was a person specifically doing that
as part of the service of the gas station
that is gone because the insects are gone
so I had another one of my
guest is Daniel Pauly
who came up with the scientific
concept of shifting baselines
which is that we can remember
50 years ago what the windshields
were full of insects
but we can't look at really
yesterday or the day before yesterday
every day kind of blends into the next day
so we assume that what's happening
is normal because it's happening so slowly
on a day to day basis
on a decade to decade basis
it's tragic
but this is also part of our culture
it's part of our evolution
remember that until very recently
we didn't have to worry
about what was going to happen in three months
or one year
we didn't have ways to store food
so we were worried about
what was going to happen the following day
and if you were in a cave
living in a cave and suddenly
you will see smoke in the horizon
you will have to pack up your stuff
because you know the other tribe
and other group will come in and you will have to run
so basically we are
very well
developed, I mean we have very well evolved
to perceive things
as the normal
everyday, oh it's going to rain
but our rain
hasn't had the capability to understand
this long term
small changes on the one hand
but also remember that
until 1970 something
when we saw
the first photograph of the planet
on this massive boy
black boy, we understood
it was the first time that we could see
what the whole planet it is
so now for us it is kind of
easy to try to imagine what the world it is
but
in terms of our evolution
this kind of understanding of what's going on in the planet
and that's why changing the whole planet
is incredibly new
so it is incredibly difficult
for us to try to
first understand and then to grasp
the consequences of what we are doing
here in my garden in Mexico
how this is affecting the rest
it is not that because we are stupid
it is simply a mixture
of cultural and biological
factors
I'm realizing Gerardo that
I could probably talk to you for 4 hours
and not cover
half of what I want to ask you
but let's just cover as much as we can
because I have so many questions for you
let's drill down on what you just said earlier
you said that elephants
the problem was
the number of humans were encroaching on their
habitat and poaching
but what about insects
what has caused the drop in insects
from the people at the gas station
clearing them out of your radiator
and windshield to today
let's put it in a larger framework if you want to
I see humans
your guests have talked about this
population, the growth of human
population, consumption
technology and so on
has caused major environmental problems
and those problems that are global
when I grew up and was studying
biology there was only one
global environmental problem was
the relation of its own layer
that fortunately we were able to solve
but then climate change
pollution
toxification invasive species
emerging and emerging diseases
over exploitation
habitat encroachment
habitat destruction
over killing and so on
all these massive
impacts of our activities
both directly and indirectly
is what is causing the destruction
of plants, animals and microorganisms
in terms of the insects there are several theories
and I think
that what is happening
it changes regionally
the region is pesticides in other regions
it's more climate change and so on
but what is clear is that this
is happening so for instance
in many places the
massive use of pesticides like in
Central US have destroyed
so many species
for instance
just recently we heard that
the monar butterfly
was declining and after
several studies and so on
they found different reasons for the decline
but one of them was the use of
herbicides to kill
plant invasive plants
in crops and one of these
plants is the food plant
for the butterflies
so we kill the plants
not because we want to kill those plants
because it's just part of the plant that you want to kill
if you want to have your crop
free of hers
but those particular plants are
the unique food for the monar butterflies
and when this was
done at a continental scale
then the population collapses
aside from that we have in Mexico
the places where they are
where basically we are talking about no more than
maybe 200 acres
where those million butterflies come
every year just in my
half fragile is the area
that these 200 acres disperse
in a few million other acres
can be easily wiped out
by fires, by illegal
logging and by climate change
so insects are a good example
to talk about how
different factors
human factors are causing
the destruction of species
in different scales
in different parts of the planet
for elephants a hunting could be really bad
for other species
like paradoxes in Mexico is poisoning them
because they
compete with cattle and so on
it just has an aside how many jaguars
are there left in the world
how many are in Mexico roughly
well roughly the jaguar
is the most abundant of the 6
larger cats
fortunately there are still around
60,000 jaguars left
but 60,000 is just a fraction
of the 150,000
that are estimated that there were
at the beginning
of the 1900s
or more
in Mexico let me tell you this is one of the things
that give me a lot of hope
in Mexico I organized
a group called the Alliance for Jaguar Conservation
in 2005
and we are assuming like
60 people from like
30, 40 different institutions
and scientists
and lawyers and so on
very different people
and in 2010
between 2008 and 2010
we did the first
national jaguar census in any country
so we
designed a way to
census the jaguars in Mexico
and we come out with the 4,000
jaguars and 4,000 jaguars
was very good because at that time
we thought that there were 1,000
jaguars no more in Mexico
so 4,000 jaguars was a good
good news but then
we repeat the census in
2019 and bingo
because we have been working so hard
with the government and the local communities
and so on the population grew up
4,800
in only around 10 years
now we're going to do the next year
the same the third jaguar census
but
in general we still have
60, 70,000 jaguars in the whole
continent and in Mexico we have
around 5,000 and those are good news
so if a species is
really decimated in the population
you mentioned
large predatory fish are at 2%
I'm sure there's some mammals that have
that level or worse
but there's still a viable
population is there a level where
they get to where the
genetic diversity is so small
that if they interbreed with each other
there are problems so even though there's enough
animals
to breed there's that
problem I think I read something that that's happening
with cheetahs to some extent
that's a very good question
what you read about cheetahs
it was the idea
in the 90s or something
but
our understanding of genetics
has become so good
that fortunately there is not a
single rule for instance
the vaquita is this
purpose found in Mexico
only in the Gulf of Mexico there are
probably 10 to 12
and there was a new recent study
showing that this 10 to 12
have enough variability
if they recover to live properly
and there are some cases like the marine elephants
who at one point
there were 100 only left
and now there are more than 300,000
what's the elephant
how do you call the marine elephant
oh the manatee
no no the elephant seal
yeah elephant seal okay
so it's like the elephant seal
at what point there were only 100 left
protected in Mexico
this is a really interesting
story in 1920
a Mexican president declared
Mexico a heaven
for marine animals and that saved the
great whale, saved the elephant seal
saved a lot of marine mammals
but anyway the elephant seal
you know there were only 100
now there are more than 300,000
those are the ones who goes to the
coast of California
and in the Año Nuevo reserve
this is the
only one, two colonies
now they go to the continent
most of the time they go to
Ireland because they were free of predators
but anyway there are 300 animals
and they have not much variability
but with the variability
they have they are doing fine
as a rule
we say that 500 animals
is very critical
if you have less than 500 animals
of any species you are
reaching the point where
genetics and demographic factors
and other factors are putting you
to a really big problem
although as I mentioned
there is a lot of variability on that
and we just
published a paper in
2020
where we look at
the species who are at the brink of extinction
and this is coming back to
what you mentioned
on functional extinction
we call them zombies because
those species are living dead
they are still alive
if you have 500 individuals
100 individuals divided in several populations
basically the ecological
role that you have
that you used to play is gone
but also you are facing so many demographic
genetic population problems
that you almost
zoomed to extinction unless
there is an intervention of humans
so this is a factoid
that I know well
and I think more people are becoming aware of it
but you know it cold
if you compare
the approximately 8 billion
humans and all of our livestock
our cows and pigs and goats
and sheep
how does that compare to the number of wild
animals on the planet
well that is a very good question
there has been some
paper published that
when I read it it just made me
really almost faint
because they have
estimate that when you took
all the vertebrates of the planet
you know mammals
vertebrates and feedians
you compare them to domestic animals
is 30%
of the biomass of the planet
is made up by
the 8 billion human beings
36%
4% is made up
by all the thousands
of species of vertebrates
and the rest are domestic animals
mostly cattle
and poultry
so just imagine
only 4%
of the total biomass of the planet
is made up by wild animals
and the rest
the 96%
is made up by humans
and the domestic animals
so we have
been able to displace them
we occupied most of the land
and we have been able to take off the energy
that those species use
and we are realizing that we have lost
80% of all the individual animals
since 1970
because we basically are occupying
the land and we are using
the energy that we used to use
and if you look at
the vertebrates it's even more dramatic
if you look at the 11,000
species of vertebrates
and the domestic
poultry
70% of all the biomass
is made up
by domestic animals
and 30% is made up
by the 11,000
wild species of birds
so it's not surprising
then that we have lost 80%
of all
the individual animals in 1970
because we are copying their land
and we are copying the energy they use
so 70% of the weight
of all the birds on the planet
is two species
chickens and turkeys
and 11,000
comprise the other 30%
so I was fortunate
to do an earth watch expedition in Ecuador
Ecuador is not much bigger
than Minnesota and Wisconsin where I live
but they have if I recall
2,000
masomenos species of birds
and the entire continental
United States only has 800
so this tiny country
there are 2,000 species of birds
including
150 species of hummingbirds
and in the United States we only have 8
that's amazing
yes some of these places are amazing
but you were talking about
the 60 minutes and so on
well I'll get back to that
but I just wanted to say one other thing
we consume 70 billion
chickens
and turkeys per year
and they're not all alive at one time
because it's only 10 or 11 weeks old
because they breed them
and they can't walk
and they harvest them early
it's overwhelming
it's overwhelming
especially when we understand
and it's now
much more widely known
that this is taking
a trajectory
that unless we change it
it will cause the collapse of civilization
and it's going to cause
the collapse of civilization
not by the end of the century
100
it will cause the collapse of civilization
in the next 50 to 20 years
or if you are optimistic
30 years
I mean what we're talking here
the good news is the window
of opportunity
there is still a window for opportunity
but it's rapidly closing
and we don't have decades
to put our act together
we have very very few years
and that's what becomes
difficult for people to grasp
and this is why
so many people
prefer not to think about it
and get distracted with something else
because it...
Why did you say that we're going to have a collapse
of civilization
possibly in the next 15 to 20 years
for what reason?
Because most of the studies
in terms of species extinction
on climate change
on pollution and so on
are at a tipping point where
pandemics like COVID
like lots of ecosystem services
and so on are becoming so big
and the rate of change
is much much faster than we anticipated
So this is on top of
oil depletion
and economic overshoot
and finance and all that
agricultural problems?
Exactly, this is a site
we can have a collapse similar
a collapse related to
issues or to political issues
or to social issues
talking about the environmental issues
there is the probability
that in the next few decades
there will be a collapse
of civilization but when people say this
that people say Gerardo
that sounds like ridiculous
just think about it
we have now a pandemic that has put us
basically on our knees
and it wasn't the worst
virus and the worst
environmental disease that we have faced
in the last 50 years
Ebola is much worse
the Malibu virus is worse
the Lasha fever is worse
anyway, right now
there are more than 2 billion people
who don't have cleaning water
there are almost 2 billion
or more than 2 billion people
who don't have enough to eat
in the next few weeks
there are 100 or 150 million
ecological refugees
who are working in such
many of these places
and you see the conditions
that millions and millions of people
are living right now
this is collapse
this is the definition of collapse
if you are an elephant or an insect
do you have also undergone a collapse
exactly
so obviously all these species
who are being driven to extinction
by your activity
are part of this collapse
the collapse of the
natural systems
that are essential for human survival
the animals
that are disappearing
are part of this collapse
the plants that are disappearing
are part of this collapse
the massive losses of ecosystems
are part of this collapse
and then the reflection of what I said
of these problems
on billions of people already
for me this is
already that we are entering
in the collapse
that just will become
massive
and global
if we don't do something in the next few decades
but what I'm trying to say
we cannot predict exactly when
but to say
that it will be
at the end of the century
is probably responsible in the sense
that it giving us
a false sense of security
that was still 80 years
so I want to come back to this
but I had a thought while we were talking about
chickens
I think there's a paradox in the human brain
I have chickens
only for the eggs and for the companionship
I have 17 chickens
and I love going out and sitting with them
and every night there's two of them
are rooster, floyd
and blanch this hand that I stroke
before I shut them in at night
and I go
they're my friends
and they're so interesting, they're dinosaurs
and yet
I eat chicken
I don't eat pork at all
and I rarely eat beef
but I do eat chicken
so I'm just processing this
in my brain talking about the 70 billion
chickens that humanity consumes
I consume some of those chickens
and yet I love
my chickens and I don't eat them
so what's going on there
and why are these two things happening
in my brain
and what does that suggest
for greater consciousness
I don't know, I'll just ask you
well, I don't know but what I know
it is basically
excess on behaviors
I mean
it is perfectly right
I think it could be perfectly balanced
if we eat meat once a month
or once every month
but when you eat every day meat
the excess on what we do
is what causes the problem
I mean if I have a house
if I have a car
that's fine
for instance I have to travel a lot
and use planes
and I don't feel remorse because I know
I'm causing pollution
but I think
it is much more important that I travel
to say jaguars and big chunks of habitat
and then to stay in my home
without flying
the balance is that
we have to balance our act
and what you're doing with your chickens
and eating chicken, basically
I'm sure you are balancing that, you're not eating
well, it's
what I teach my students
and we wrote in our book that
the time now isn't to minimize
your impact and be a smaller
part of one-eight billionth of the
of the planet, it's to maximize
your impact and do whatever
you have to do and have
a good moral, ethical, environmental
hygiene and make good decisions
but try to be impactful
at larger scales like you're doing with
your work. That's exactly what I was
trying to say, that's exactly what
for instance if I stay home
I will reduce my impact
but I won't have any big impact
for instance we're having
in Mexico there is a project right now
called the Maya Train
a project pushed by the government
and this government has been the most
anti-environment
ever in Mexico since I
was at high school
and regardless of that
I helped the project
once was approved
part of the project, I helped them to design
in such a way
that we created why life passes
because the project will be done
you know, first of all
it was done and follow the law
so
you may say philosophically I don't like
trains or you may say politically
I hate this government, I don't like the train
but if it was done properly
with the law, that's the right
they have the right to do it and a train
has much less impact than
more highways and cars and so on
anyway, we work with them and we create
the largest project on the planet
with why life passes
in 700 kilometers
we managed to put 300
why life passes, massive thing
and then they change the director
and with the new one
it's a really bad guy
it's really bad, it's messing this up
so we're not working anymore with them
but I didn't close
up my work
for saving the forest in
the Yucatan Peninsula because it's happening
so I go there often
and we design a project where we are
benefiting
probably 20,000 families
and we're saving right now
almost 700,000 acres
directly by paying
ecosystem services to the owners of the forest
and these are the ones I tell you
that they are so proud and when they have
a little money that they have enough
to live, they will be
the first to defend their forest
and not only that
it occurred to me
how can we create a series of
protected areas that we end up
we will end up with 3
million acres protected
with the local people
with the help
or without the help of the government
so this is exactly what you said
while I have to work with the government
and everybody was, I mean
the people close to
in favor of the government said I was in favor of the train
the people against the train said I was
betraying nature and all kind of things
if I was guided
by science and what was right
we did a really great
impact but as you say
this has to be guided by ethics
and in terms when you are a scientist
by the scientific knowledge
that will help to minimize
the impact of those projects
and maximize what we can say
Excellent, I am going to ask you
more about your work in a minute
but I have a core question that I wanted
to get to on this conversation
Harado, what is
a mass extinction
and is a sixth mass extinction now
inevitable?
Well, in the last 700 million years
we have a good fossil record
to be able to see three things
in the history of
biodiversity of life on earth
one is
that the balance between
extinction and expesiation
has been positive so we have more
species now than ever
as I say before, this is the first thing
second, we have seen
in this fossil record that there has been
five times
when suddenly the extinction
rates become much, much higher
than the expesiation rates
causing the loss
of most plants and animals on the planet
and that's not a population extinction
that's the species itself
that's the species, I mean
this massive loss of species
70% of all the species on the planet
or more have become extinct
and then
we know that this has caused by a
natural catastrophe
like the meteorite that impacted the
planet 66 million years ago
so we call them
mass extinction then
mass extinction has three characteristics
one is geologically
speaking really fast
hundreds of thousands or a few million years
second
it is wiped out
70% or more of all the plants and animals
on the planet and third
it was caused by a natural catastrophe
when we started to do our studies
on extinction that was exactly what I wanted
to see
if the rate of extinction
that we're looking at now
was similar to the rate of extinction
in the last few million years
or normal extinction
or it was elevated
fortunately for us
we saw that Tony Warnowski
a colleague of mine from Berkeley
they published a paper
where they gathered data from
thousands and thousands and thousands of
fossils as in fossil mammals
to determine that in the last few million years
the normal extinction rate
was basically
you will expect one extinction
for every 5,000 species
in a century
in other words you have in those million years
you will pick up a century
and at that century you have 10,000 species
you will expect two extinctions
if you have 40,000 species
you will expect eight extinctions
if you have only 5,000 species
you will expect one extinction
so that was the background rate
that was the background rate
the background or normal rate exactly
but for us it was like gold
because basically we have something to compare
what's going on
so we look at what's happened in the last 500 years
in terms of extinctions
of vertebrates
and then what's happened in the last 100 years
we're expecting things to be bad
but not as bad as we found it
I say we find that the species lost
in the last 100 years
because in 10,000 years or more
so when we published this paper
it was published in Science Advances
we thought that we would get a lot of criticism
and
surprisingly it wasn't
actually people did agree
and one of the criticism that we have
it wasn't a criticism but say
well this is happening in vertebrates
and it's correct it seems to be everything
it seems to be fine but it's not happening
in other groups
and then after our paper was published
we had to start to be
papers published in other invertebrates
you know
invertebrate plants and even
microorganisms
and now it's clearly
being shown that we have entered the seismic extinction
and
you say that it's inevitable
it is probably inevitable
if we really
put our act together and we slow down
the loss of populations
and the loss of species
and we restore a lot of the populations
and the species who are on the brink of extinction
but
this has to be at a global scale
and it has to be
it's impossible to be done
by actively protecting the places
it has to be done reducing
the use of carbon
and fossil fuels
basically reducing the magnitude
of the human enterprise
so we can reduce pollution, toxification
habitat destruction
over killing and so on
so as far as the
inevitability of a sixth mass extinction
and I know this
you'll have to give me a speculative answer on this
because no one knows
but what percentage of the risk
of an actual mass extinction
and what was the exact definition
like 70%
or is there a threshold
to be called a mass extinction
yes well I mean
this is kind of a standard
70% of all the
species has to become extinct
okay and do you think
the biggest risk of that
happening is climate change
or is it 10 things
all together or is climate change
the real granddaddy of that risk
no I think species extinction
is as bad as climate change
but it hasn't been understood
I mean just by itself
and we take out climate change
and we continue with the problems
of habitat destruction
over killing
diseases and so on
pesticides, herbicides
we will face a sixth mass extinction
if unfortunately
on top of us
we put climate change
that will mean that we will
affect many more species
much more rapidly
and there will be synergic
and additive effects
among all these issues
why is so complicated
so complex and so overwhelming
because it basically
involves all the human enterprise
okay here's a tough question Harado
do you think a collapse
of human civilization
would be good
for animal and other species
populations some people think definitely
so and others I've talked to think
absolutely not what do you think
well I would say
in different way first of all
what we have learned
from all the mass extinction
is that life has recovered
completely different way things
completely different species
there are no more dinosaurs
there are no more trilobites
but life has recovered
but it took 15 to 20
to more million years
so in other words I feel
somehow a little bit
less stress
when I think that
there is a nuclear holocaust
or something like that
life will prevail okay
now if a collapse
of civilization
is good or bad
it could be tremendously bad
in the sense and it could be
tremendously bad and it could speed up
the extinction crisis
just in mind that suddenly
there is not enough food in the US
and people has gone what will happen with the wildlife
they will go and kill deer or kill
forever to feed
and it will happen throughout the world
if you are in a place in Africa
and suddenly there is no more food
you will go and kill the last elephant
with no problem
so in that sense could be really really bad
and in the sense if there is
100 plus nuclear missiles
and then there is nuclear winter
and there is no photosynthetic
productivity in the oceans
I mean there is all kinds of scenarios like that
which is I am trying to work
for to as a bend not break
scenario
and I don't know exactly how that looks
clearly the sooner
that we stop emitting carbon
the better certain
populations will be
of organisms in the ocean
for one thing
but yeah it is a heavy question
to even think about
so what are
you do some work on endangered species
maybe talk a little bit about some of your
biggest challenges and biggest successes
on your own work
yeah well what we do in my lab
is basically basic science
and we do basic science
really powerful science
but
this is different from many labs in the planet
is that we
scientific labs is that we do a lot of conservation
in situ so we go
and work to save species
but also to save habitats and ecosystems
we have created
almost 2% of the Mexico landmass
is protected because of our work
that
we have been proposed to the government
in new areas
as national parks or biosphere
reserves and so on
and the other part is like
we work with endangered species
for instance we reintroduce
bison in Mexico
working with our colleagues
we created a reserve in other Mexico
in the US border
what we call
reserve and in that we reintroduce
bison we are protecting
the black fruited ferret
and the Mexican government
has reintroduced the wolf
and in southern Mexico we work with jaguars
we work with tapers, monkeys and so on
trying to save them
are you connected with a lot of grassroots
eco
teams around the world that are working on
issues because of your
centered node nature in this topic
with some, not with many
but some yes because
we are so unique in the sense that we
do science and we also do this work
so we are not as well connected
in that sense with other groups
simply we don't have enough time to do it
but yes we are part of some networks
and then the other thing we do
we propose and
protect areas as
nature reserves
we work with endangered species
but we also do what we call public policy
we propose the first
endangered species act in Mexico
that now protects
3,000 species
and we propose also we help to
create the national commission
on protected areas and so on
we create the first
program for recovery of
prairie dogs and
jaguars so we go
and then we do a lot of outreach
we do a lot of work
working with the local governments
and people and schools and so on
trying to
talk about these issues
but also talking many times
about the successes that we have
we have got a lot of success and
although it is small
for the magnitude of the problem
in Mexico or in the planet
those successes are very important
to talk about because it gives
cost to people and guidance
we need orders of magnitude
more people working or at least
devoting some time and resources
and effort and passion towards
this issue
what are some ways that people
listening to this program
who care about other species in the natural
world can make an impact
globally or especially in their local
ecosystems to help other creatures
make it through the coming bottlenecks
of this century
well first of all if they are
listening to this program to your
podcast they are already doing
something that is good
they are getting good information
I would say that anything
that can reduce our impact
locally at home
for instance if we are more affluent
and we can buy better
soaps or vetted foods
or use less plastic and so on
that's all good
if you go into the internet that puts
50 ways to help the environment
you will find literally hundreds of pages
that will guide you on what you can do
for instance never buy
wildlife as pets
never eat wildlife for food
try to reduce your impact
for instance I like
meat
but I eat meat every
probably once every two weeks
and before I used to eat it
two or three days a week
and nothing changes
actually probably my health is a bit better
in some senses but I haven't lost
my pleasure of sometimes eating meat
I just have to be more responsible
how to eat it
we buy things here at home
local things
for instance every Wednesday a guy comes
and sells us their
fruits and vegetables
that they got from here
and in the ranch that we have
we do exactly the same we grow
a lot of our own
legumes and fruits and so on
the other thing is to get
involved locally and
regionally for instance
it's very important at this point
the people that you vote for
has to have the right ideas in terms
of protecting the environment in terms
of putting the proper
laws and the proper norms
to reduce our impact
and the other part
it is incredibly easier now
to become if you are interested
for instance in saving the species
to become volunteer or to donate funds
or to do something
the species that you are interested
basically what I said
because there are no recipes
there are so many ways to do it
basically what we have to do
is to become actors
being expectators
really and now with the
social media and with the internet
we can really become
actors in a
big way
locally, regionally and globally
I think they're my sense
to be my network and so I'm biased
is a lot of people understand
this, a lot of people care about it
but the barrier
to entry is so high
that they don't know what to do
they want to do something
and I think sometimes you know my work
about the super organism and the energy
hungry entity that
humanity en masse has created
it's hard to fight that
but I think there are watersheds
and communities
and ecosystems around the
world where people listening to this show
live and you
can get a start right there
it's just how do you get started
I wish there was some international
network with
how to guide on protecting
your local creatures and
ecosystems does that
exist what do you recommend
on that? Well it does exist
and there are as I said
in the internet in YouTube and so
there are many
ways, many examples what you can do
but probably I mean
get closer to people like me
or you or to people or somebody
enkios who are doing a good work
it is hard but it's not
impossible and the examples
are now replicating but you just give me
a good idea that maybe
it will be good to have like a
a clearing house clearing house
for that and let me tell you something
I have been working with a new
project we call it first stop
extinction and I will call it
creatures united that
if it works
and everything seems to
be going in the right direction
it will be basically that
it will be a massive
moment we will try to
get the idea of
species extinction to
2 billion people in the next 5 years
specifically what is the problem
what is the magnitude, what I can do
and then to direct
the effort to basically
for things what needs to
I mean projects who are already working
saving species and ecosystems
then a database
who are already being built where you can
click in your neighborhood and see what are
the species and what the species are in danger
and basically and the third
part that we will be developed
is we will be kind of
the cleaning house you say okay I am
in Cahuaca, Mexico
I like to find out what are the
groups who are working in different species
and you can click it and it will give you
all the groups working there
and then you can go and search and decide
which one you want to support creatures united
creatures united and the idea
it is very ambitious is to be
to help to say
100 million hectares
1 million species
and to reach probably between 2-3
billion people in the next 10 years
and not only would that
help those species and ecosystems
but it also gives
a sense of the sacred
to those humans working on those things
that we are lacking in our lives right now
that is exactly right
and it is also will give
it will be like a solid
ground to
avoid many of the dangers
of possible collapse
it is very ambitious it is going
it is coming along well it has to be ambitious
so let me know if I can help you with that
I will and we will launch
on November and just to
give you an idea the idea is that
we call it creatures united
because these are animals dressed like
humans and it will say for instance
hey you
I am the white elephant
the white rhino I am becoming extinct
I need your help
I am talking on the name of all these
endangered species we need your help
please help us something like that
and then it will be shown in the
future we need to be
for two days be
on the walls
of the united nation you know that at night
they put their colors of flags sometimes
we want to put the creatures
they are showing how many they are
and where they are and why are they becoming extinct
good luck with that
I sense that people
already feel that this is happening
and it is too painful to go there
so it has to be coupled
with direct action steps
that people can immediately do
otherwise it is too sad
and overwhelming I think
but you are right I mean here you can donate
to projects who are already working
and saving the species
you can participate in our project
it will tell you what kind of thing you can do
for instance what product you can buy
reducing your impact
it will tell you what is the problem
of great trade
and what can you do to avoid it and so on
I think that is really important
because you think we need people
to find each other in communities
in Topeka, Kansas and Redwig, Minnesota
and Toluca, Mexico
that find each other
and actually try to restore the ecology
and protect the species
in their own watershed
within five miles of their house
and to have a toolkit for that
and I don't know how possible that is
I think about it I read that somebody
said that we need 400 billion dollars
to invest in conservation
and it will be enough to tip off the point
400 billion dollars a year is nothing
in a trillion dollar
economy
and what I said it is just like
if you have 1000 dollars in your pocket
and they say oh sorry
you have to spend 4 dollars
otherwise you are going to die
we will get it immediately
I mean that is why
I am so impressed and thankful
for people like you and Daniel
Pauley and Peter Ward
who are
because there is not a lot of funding
to learn about all the other species
that we are sharing the planet with
so thank you
I have some questions that are a little
personal that I ask to all my guests
if you don't mind
so Harada you are an animal researcher
expert but you are also a college professor
so what do you tell your students after hearing
about species extinction
and future risk do you have any recommendations
specifically for young humans
listening to this show
who are becoming aware of the
economic environmental risks
and challenges we face
well what I say first of all
that there is still time and there is still
we have a lot of responsibility
but also it is a great time of opportunity
so I say to them
that the most
open mind they are
and they are better prepared
academically prepared they are
let's focus on one thing and more broad
their knowledge they will be better
what I tell my students
and the people that I
take my classes is that
they have
to spend time understanding
the market understanding what
are the places where people will
need
the society will need specialized
people and that they have to think
how to put their heart
and their passion
towards those places
so they can have a decent
job to do that
and I put myself as an example when I was
studying ecology
the world wasn't even understood
and probably I was
one of the first probably 20
ecologists in the country
maybe less
and here I am
well off and I am happy
and I do what I wanted to do
at that time everybody would say
well you are intelligent
you are a lawyer or accountant
so you will money and then you will be
this as your hobby
and my father was very good and he said
send him to hell do what you want him to do
you took the right path my friend
my thanks
so what do you care most about
in the world Herado?
to be honest I care most
species that are becoming extinct
I am obsessed to save species
I mean obviously my family
first but aside from my family
the most important thing for me
is what I do
trying to save things
from extinction
in terms of my science
the kind of thing I have done
to be aware
and really understand the magnitude of the problems
and then to expose them
to as many people as I can
saving species, saving habitat
he gave me so much
happiness for instance
recently we signed a deal
saving this 700,000
acres of forest
just incredibly
I am very happy for the people who own that land
but I am happy for the
species who will be saved there
that's excellent
what are you most concerned about
of all the things we have talked about
in the coming decade or so in our world
main concern is we don't do
the changes that we need to do quickly enough
so we can really stop
the problem
avoid a collapse of civilization
and this is both personally
I am already enough
that I have lived a plentiful life
but I am worried about my children
I mean they are only 30 years old
and if things go bad
they will be
younger than I when they will feel the heat
of the whole problem
so that's my main concern
and my main concern sometimes I wonder
I mean have we been so
I feel like we have failing humanity
the people like me who are working on this
and we haven't been able to
turn the tide you know
so I know if this is not
it will be very
suburb or very bad
to think that we can have the power to change it
but sometimes I feel
worried that we haven't been able
to have a better impact
a much higher impact to change the tide
I feel it every day Harado
that we are not doing enough
but we are trying
so in contrast to that
what are you most hopeful for
in the coming decade or so
I am very hopeful because I am seeing changes
bright changes
I see that there is so many people interested
in what I do
or in the environment
and corporations, governments
TV series talking about this
I think I am hopeful
and at least in my mind
I imagine that we are
as I say like in the 70s
with all these revolutions
the minority, the women
the revolution
in the late 1900s
with evolution, geology
psychology
economics and so on
that really shape up the following
decade and for many
decades we are perfectly fine
I mean we were really
leaving a better world
from sometimes in the 60s and 70s
and then we lose the track
I agree with everything you just said
except for the revolution
in psychology and economics
perhaps I might disagree with that
but we will do that in another call
it was a revolution
it doesn't mean that it was a proper revolution
but it changed things
you are right about that
so if you were benevolent dictator
and there was no personal recourse
to your decision
what one thing would you do
to improve the human and planetary futures
if I could do it I would probably
get the experts
and find ways how to reduce
our appetite
for fossil fuels
and then take the decisions to curb it
on that note
do you have any other closing thoughts
advice or wisdom for our listeners
this has been a wide ranging
very deep personal
conversation and I thank you
do you have any other closing thoughts
well what I would say is that
I have devoted my life to work with animals
to save species and so on
and I feel very grateful
and I am very hopeful
I am very hopeful that
we together we will be able
to turn the tide
and as I said before
fortunately the window is still open
it is rapidly closing but still open
and I don't want to
believe it or not and I am optimistic
I really think that
we keep working hard
and we may
change the fate
of humanity and the fate
of biodiversity
thank you so much for this conversation
and for your lifetime of work on these issues
and I hope to see you again
soon my friend
thank you very much it was been wonderful
future releases
