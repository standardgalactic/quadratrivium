1. In today's episode, we discuss the role of sleep in clearing amyloid beta plaques from the brain, which are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
   2. During sleep, especially during periods of restful sleep, the brain's interstitial space volume expands, making glimphatic pathways wider and facilitating the removal of waste products like amyloid beta plaques.
   3. Research has shown that side sleeping may be particularly effective for this clearance process, as it maximizes the expansion of glimphatic pathways.
   4. If side sleeping is not preferred, alternative strategies include placing a pillow behind or in front of you to prevent rolling onto your stomach or back.
   5. The episode emphasizes the importance of lifestyle choices that can potentially reduce the risk of neurological conditions related to brain 'sludge' accumulation.
   6. Next week's episode will explore the brains of animals and their comparison to human brains, offering insights into both similarities and differences between species.
   7. A special overdose edition episode is also scheduled to be released before next week's main episode.
