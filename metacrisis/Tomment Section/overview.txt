Processing Overview for Tomment Section
============================
Checking Tomment Section/Mercury is the closest planet to all seven other planets.txt
1. **Initial Misconception**: Common belief suggests that Venus is Earth's closest neighbor in the solar system, a notion supported by many educational resources and averages provided by various organizations.

2. **The Whirly-Dirly Corollary**: Through personal investigation and mathematical analysis, the speaker discovered that Mercury, not Venus, is actually Earth's closest planet on average. This finding was formalized into what they called the Whirly-Dirly Corollary and published in "Physics Today."

3. **Solar System Simulation**: The speaker created a simulation to visually demonstrate the distances between Earth and other planets over time. They used Python's PyFM library to map planetary positions and calculated the distances using both the previously established methods (which include published averages and a method called "point circle method" or PCM) and their new method.

4. **Simulation Results**: After running the simulation for a period of 50 years (with a longer 10,000 year run without graphics), the speaker found that Mercury is indeed closer to Earth on average than Venus. The new method (PCM) provided results that were much more accurate compared to the old methods, with deviations of less than 1% versus over 300%.

5. **Final Conclusion**: The simulation and the PCM method both confirm that Mercury is Earth's closest planet on average. Additionally, Mercury holds the record for being the closest planet to every other planet in the solar system.

6. **Educational Outreach**: The speaker encourages viewers to consider these findings educational and invites comments or thoughts on the subject. They hope to clarify the distance between Earth and its neighboring planets with empirical evidence from the simulation.
