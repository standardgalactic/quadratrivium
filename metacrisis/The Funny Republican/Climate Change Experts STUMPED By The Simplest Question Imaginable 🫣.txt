Panelists, what percent of our atmosphere is CO2?
Repeat that question.
What percent of our atmosphere is CO2 carbon dioxide?
About five percent.
Five?
We'll get a seven.
I'll see there five and suggest that we
know that transportation causes 49% of CO2.
So that's why we're all working on energy transition.
All right.
So what number do you think it is?
Five.
Five.
Do you have one, Mr. Boyd?
So we've got a five, seven, eight.
I'm going to get the high end.
All right.
The answer is 0.04%.
Not 1%, not 1.5%.
It's 0.04%.
It's gone up from 0.03 in the last couple of years.
This is what we're being all contorted into doing
is this tiny change in CO2.
If we get below 0.02, plant life starts dying.
