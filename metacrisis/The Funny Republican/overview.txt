Checking The Funny Republican/Climate Change Experts STUMPED By The Simplest Question Imaginable ðŸ«£.txt
 The question posed to the panelists was about the percentage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere. There was a misunderstanding among the panelists; some initially thought it was around 5%, while others guessed 7% or 8%. However, the correct answer is that CO2 makes up only 0.04% of the Earth's atmosphere. It's important to note that this percentage has been increasing and currently stands at 0.03%, having risen from 0.04% in recent years. The focus on reducing CO2 levels is significant because a decrease below 0.02% can start affecting plant life negatively. This highlights the importance of managing CO2 emissions to maintain ecological balance and mitigate climate change effects.
