1. Cells process vast amounts of information with tiny energy budgets, suggesting they use coherence rather than classical manipulation. This is supported by the observation that the amount of information cells can process is way beyond what their energy budget would classically allow.

2. The energy landscapes for elementary systems are simpler and less numerous compared to more complex organisms like eukaryotes, indicating they use less energy for maintaining their boundaries.

3. The boundary of a system (like a cell) can be thought of as having three parts: thermal, informational, and memory. Each part can be sector-managed by the system or its environment independently. This means that what a system perceives as meaningful information might just be noise from the perspective of its environment, and vice versa.

4. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that all systems aim to minimize their free energy, which is the difference between their predictions and actual outcomes. This synchronization can lead to a state where both system and environment have perfectly aligned expectations at their mutual boundary, leading to a situation of entanglement in quantum mechanics.

5. The concept of entanglement implies that the system and its environment cease to be separate entities as they become fully synchronized or entangled. This means that maintaining the boundary is crucial for both the system and its environment; if the boundary is not maintained, the system effectively ceases to exist as a distinct entity.

In summary, the talk emphasized the importance of coherence and synchronization in information processing across biological systems and how these systems aim to minimize free energy to maintain their boundaries, potentially approaching a state of entanglement with their environments.
