 In this conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger, we explored the multifaceted nature of mental health and its connection to our broader societal structures. Key points discussed include:

1. **Awareness and Environment**: The importance of cultivating awareness and maintaining it through practices like meditation or engaging in experiences like Vipassana or ayahuasca retreats. Our environment plays a significant role in shaping our psyche, so surrounding ourselves with people who embody the qualities we aspire to is crucial.

2. **Practical Steps**: To embody the values we wish to live by, we should seek out communities and individuals who already exemplify those ideals. This can serve as a tangible way to maintain our awareness and commitment to positive change.

3. **Mental Health Approaches**: While we didn't delve into specific psychotherapeutic methods or functional medicine approaches for psychiatry, Daniel emphasized the need for an integrative approach that considers biological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of health.

4. **The Role of Leadership**: If Daniel were to lead, he would strive to create systems that allow individuals to thrive by addressing the root causes of mental health issues, such as societal disconnection and a lack of meaningful engagement.

5. **Continued Engagement**: This conversation paves the way for a follow-up discussion on cutting-edge functional medicine and therapies. We encouraged our audience to engage with us further, providing questions or topics they would like to explore in future episodes.

6. **Resources**: Daniel's work can be found through the Consilience Project and his old blog at Civilization Emerging.com. He is also a prolific podcaster with an impressive array of guests discussing a wide range of topics.

7. **Final Thoughts**: The conversation emphasized the need for individuals to take responsibility for their mental health by seeking out environments, communities, and practices that support their growth and well-being. It also highlighted the importance of integrating a holistic perspective when addressing mental health issues.
