1. **Bayesian Epistemology**: This is a way of understanding knowledge and belief that involves updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. It's not about turning people into Spock, but it does offer a structured way to think about incorporating new information into our beliefs.

2. **Predictive Processing in Cognition**: The brain operates as a hierarchy of prediction and feedback, using Bayesian principles to make predictions at each level of abstraction. Starting from the raw sensory input (layer 1), each higher layer refines predictions based on the input from the layer below until reaching the topmost layer (layer N) which makes the highest-level predictions about the world.

3. **Predictive Coding Model**: This model suggests that the brain is constantly trying to predict sensory inputs and minimize surprises. When something unexpected occurs, it's passed up the hierarchy chain until it reaches a level capable of addressing the anomaly, updating the predictions accordingly.

4. **Limitations and Criticisms**: While Bayesian methods are powerful tools for prediction, they require initial guesses or priors that can influence the outcome. This subjectivity is a point of contention, as it suggests that our conclusions may be biased by our starting assumptions.

5. **Real-World Application**: Despite its theoretical roots, Bayesian inference has practical applications and is used in various fields such as statistics, machine learning, and cognitive science to make better predictions and decisions.
