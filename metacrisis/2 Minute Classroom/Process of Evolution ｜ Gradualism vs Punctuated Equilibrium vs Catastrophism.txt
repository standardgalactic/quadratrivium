Thanks for stopping by. Today we're talking about gradualism, punctuated equilibrium,
and catastrophism. Now these are all processes of evolution. Now first we'll talk about
gradualism is small changes in evolution over time. So small changes occur gradually and
these small changes can add up to result in large changes or large evolutionary changes
within a species or between species. This can be observed in the fossil record by looking
at similar but different species so they can compare and see these small changes. With
punctuated equilibrium you have a long time with no change, that's the equilibrium, and
then a sudden large change in a short amount of time which is the punctuated portion. Ironically
this is also supported by the fossil record with the gaps that occur between fossils and
so it eliminates the need for those gaps to be filled by missing links. It just says there
is no missing link in there, it's just a time with no change and then there was sudden large
change later. Catastrophism is a sub-component of punctuated equilibrium so it fits under
that heading and when you have natural disasters that cause sudden changes in an ecosystem
then those changes result in rapid evolution by new species moving in and adapting and taking
over that ecosystem and that's catastrophism. So which one is accurate, which one is the
one that scientists and scholars use between gradualism and punctuated equilibrium? Well
they're actually both accepted as a viable process of evolution and it may even be a
combination of both which occurs and which is probably most likely. Check the link in
the description for more information and for more specific examples about these topics.
