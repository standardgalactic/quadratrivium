So, we are here today to discuss, I believe the title of this will be called something
like the psychological drivers of the metacrisis and what possible responses might look like.
And so, I'll start briefly with what do we mean by metacrisis and then ask you to share
some of the the short version of the model that you have shared at great depth and your writing
and your work and ask you to also share opening frames so that people who aren't already familiar
with your work can sort of come along, though everybody should if they're interested in this
go deeper. There's a lot of resources to go deeper. I'm also not assuming since we're we all just
know each other a tiny bit enough to have a sense of shared interest but not enough that we've already
done this. This is extemporaneous which is part of what makes it very interesting to me.
So, I'm not assuming that either of you share the exact same assessment of the metacrisis. That's
not implicit in you being here but I know from our conversations you both share a sense that the
state of the world has problems and impending risks that are serious, that are not automatically
resolving themselves, that are novel in history. So, we can just say the challenging state of the
world, what in the nature of human mind, the nature of human conditioning experience, we might even
find that the term psychology or cognitive drivers are insufficient, which is fine, has brought us
here and what might a different relationship to human mind, psychology, cognition look like that
might allow a more viable, better future. So, just briefly on the metacrisis frame,
before World War Two there was no risk that we could very quickly destroy the entire habitability
of human civilization. That was brought into being with very powerful technology, nuclear weapons,
and for the first time ever we had the ability to make a series of bad decisions and
radically change the possibility space of the world.
Before the Industrial Revolution we didn't really have the capability of destroying the biosphere
at scale, that's not as fast, that takes a few hundred years, but we're at the place where
the planetary boundaries in terms of species extinction, in terms of chemical pollution,
in terms of many planetary boundaries are being crossed. The Stockholm Resilience Center
published its update to the planetary boundaries framework just a few days ago,
that showed of the nine major boundaries they've identified we've radically crossed six already,
which means who knows if we were to change the direction already what would happen.
And that was the result of the Industrial Revolution and the technology that it made
possible moving us from half a billion people before the Industrial Revolution to eight billion
people and increasing the resource consumption per capita by about 100x in the industrialized world.
So 16 times the population, 100 times the resource consumption per population,
obviously without advanced tech we couldn't do that. So there's something about
the crises that we're facing and then obviously AI and synthetic biology and drones and cyber weapons
and the radically complicated six continent supply chain that is all a very novel human
technological development that wasn't true in any previous age. Without human technology,
there is no global existential risk that is human induced. There might be a meteor or something,
but not anthropogenic catastrophic risk. So we're in a unique position in time.
The poly crisis is a frame that a lot of people have heard that says rather than just focus on
climate change or just coral or just species extinction or just nuclear, we have to focus
on all these issues, and we have to recognize that they can inter-effect each other. That
one of these issues getting worse can cascade into other ones and that sometimes the solution
to one can make other ones worse. So the answer in World War II to how do we not have nuclear war
was mutually assured destruction and the Bretton Woods global financial system and a whole bunch
of like the whole post-war order, which did mean we didn't have nuclear war between superpowers.
But it was also part of what led to the six continent supply chain and exponential growth
connected to a linear materials economy that have pushed us to the planetary boundaries.
And so we can see solutions to some problems can end up leading to other ones.
The metacrisis frame, the slight distinction from that terminology from the poly crisis,
is that we're not just looking at the mini crises and how they can cascade,
but that there are underlying dynamics that give rise to them. Obviously humans are animals,
we're part of nature, we're also pretty obviously unique when you fly into London or into New York
or whatever and you look at the world, you see the Anthropocene in a way that
the next most environment modifying creatures are things like beavers. This is obviously a
radically different scale of environment modification. And so there's something about
human technology that arises from something about human mind, both our capacity to create it,
and then also how we utilize it. So some people look at the origin of the metacrisis starting
with stone tools. Some look at it starting with the agricultural revolution and the plow,
or the industrial revolution, or various places that I think they're all interesting.
But if we simply say we have a bunch of risks to civilization's ability to continue,
to continue well, that are real worth considering and different than they were historically.
It's also worth stating that most early civilizations don't still exist.
There is no more Egyptian or Ottoman or Byzantine or Mayan empire, and the collapse of those
civilizations has been academically studied, but they weren't global civilizations.
So there is some precedent that civilizations have a life cycle. We have the first six continent
global civilization, meaning the tech that is recording this can't be made in any country in
the world. The internet that is broadcasting this to people requires this global civilization to produce.
So metacrisis. I think everyone is aware of there's a lot of risks that we face,
and we can look at the economic drivers in terms of perverse incentives and externalized costs.
We can look at the game theoretic rival risk drivers in terms of arms races and tragedy of
the commons. We can look at the theory of technology, the way that technology itself ends up shaping
mind. We can obviously look at things deep in the nature of human psychology, our value systems,
our cognition. It's pretty clear when we look around that none of the other animals or plants
are causing possible self-induced extinction of planetary systems. There's no planetary
boundaries as a result of the activity of deer or algae or oak trees. So there's something unique
about humans. Is this innate to human nature and there's no way of escaping it? Is this something
that human nature can do, but it's not the only thing it can do that can be conditioned, that could
be conditioned differently? This is what we're here to explore today. Ian, obviously your book,
The Master and His Emissary, kind of answers this question in a way, which is, though it's coming
from a different angle, getting The Master and Emissary wrong would be said to be the
cause of all the crises that we face, the situation we're in. For those who don't already
have that framework, do you want to share your introductory thoughts on the human condition
that has brought us here? Yes, I agree with you wholeheartedly that we need to look for underlying
causes of a whole pattern of events that are not just unfortunate things that happen to happen.
We were doing very well and then suddenly people said the climate was changing and
the seas were polluted and so forth. There's a whole range of events that can be traced back to
the inevitable consequence of a certain way of looking at the world and that way of looking at
the world is, in my view, associated with and driven by a model of the world that is
present to the left hemisphere in a way that is not the case with the right hemisphere. In brief,
the right hemisphere seems to be more in touch with presence, with what actually experience
comes to us and what we inhabit, whereas the left hemisphere is providing a representation,
no longer the presence, but a map, a program, a theory, a diagram, but something abstracted,
categorical, removed from and not having the characteristics of the world that it is intending
to map. I should say that to anybody who doesn't know my work, you've probably heard that everything
to do with hemispheres is wrong and that it's outmoded and science has got past it. This is
not true. If you don't know my work, then forget almost everything you think you know about hemispheres
differences. They're not the ones that you were told, but there are, although we got the differences
largely wrong, not entirely wrong, but mainly wrong. That doesn't mean to say that there are no
differences and it wouldn't be important to find out what those differences are. That's something
I've researched for about 30 years. In short, the difference comes down to ultimately a mode of
attention, which is an evolutionary development that goes back pretty much as far as we can chase it.
We think back to trilobites and possibly even beyond. This is something in which there needs to
be two ways of attending to the world that are both very important but appear to be mutually
incompatible. One is that with which we grasp things. We need to get things in order to survive.
We need to get food. We need to handle twigs to build a nest or sticks to build a shelter,
whatever it is. We need to be able to latch on to something, precisely target it and get it.
That's so important that, in a way, one whole half of one's brain is largely geared to this
particular end, that of power. If you pay only that attention to the world, then you will be very
vulnerable because you won't see the predator. You won't see your conspecifics. You won't see
everything else that's going on, of which you need to be aware. Effectively, this is a difference
in which one hemisphere pays a very narrowly targeted, precise attention to a detail in order to
grab it and another kind of attention, which is broad, open, sustained and vigilant and on the
lookout for everything else, putting it very simply. Those two kinds of attention change what
we find. No neurodigital world will dispute that the two hemispheres attend differently. It's very
clear they do, and no philosopher will dispute the fact that attention changes what it is you see.
So, at the end of this, fairly obviously, if we attend in two different ways, we see two different
worlds. I'm going to grossly simplify here, but effectively in one, that of the left hemisphere,
the world is made up of little bits that attract attention, and they're things that we're already
targeted on because we know we want them. They're isolated, they're decontextualized, they belong
to categories, they're abstracted and effectively lifeless. Whereas in the right hemisphere, it
sees that everything is ultimately connected. It's connected, obviously, to the context of
things that are immediately around it, particularly powerful, but it's ultimately connected to
everything beyond that. That the world is never fixed in the way the left hemisphere needs to
fix things in order to grab them. It's not built up out of slices or pieces, but is in fact a whole
seamless flow, a very important word. And in this right hemisphere, where implicit meaning is
understood, because that's contextualized, and part of the context of that is emotion, the body,
other people, the world at large. So you've got a kind of mechanistic reductionist world
subtended by the left hemisphere, which is just a representation or a useful diagram,
and you've got a living complex world, on the other hand, which has characteristics which are
very much harder to pin down, but involve all the richness and meaning in life. Now what I believe,
and in the masternities I'm assuming my earlier book I traced in the second part,
a sort of path through the history of the West from the ancient Greeks to the modern time,
in which there were rises and fallings of civilization, and in which what happened was
that in each civilization, the two ways of seeing the world were used fruitfully together. And this
is not a difference just between science and the arts. Science needs both kinds of attention. The
arts need both kinds of attention. And this is how they flourished to begin with, and were highly
creative, but over a length of time they overreached themselves, they became too big, they became
stereotypes, they needed global administration that could be rolled out to parts of an empire.
And so we entered into a world very much like that of the left hemisphere, and very soon the
civilization, either the Greek or the Roman collapsed, after this moment appeared. I mean,
a complex story, but that's it in out there. And I think that we're in another, a third wave of
this, if you like, in the West, which began in the Renaissance with an incredible flourishing,
and almost unequaled anywhere in the world at any time, of everything, of interest in the sciences,
in the heavens, in art, in sculpture, in music, in poetry. This is an incredibly rich time.
And then from about the end of the 17th century, very roughly,
with the scientific revolution, we began to believe that we could understand everything in
terms of mechanisms. And this was a useful way to think. And indeed, let me be the first to say
that we have benefited from it in many ways. We have developments that very few of us would wish
to be without as a result of it. But unfortunately, it led to a philosophical error. And it's not just
as it were a philosophical error in an abstract way. It's one that runs deep to the nature of
how we experience the world. That is, we believe that the world is made up of parts. And that we
find reality by going down and down and down until we've got bits that are almost identical to one
another. Whereas in fact, almost the opposite is true, that everything happens out of the coming
together into complex holes. Now, when I say coming together, I'm suggesting that we do actually
temporarily start from, or temporarily, from parts, but we don't. In our minds, in our left
hemispheres, we start from parts. But in reality, things are whole. And what we call parts are
holes of another level. And they can't be understood only by the parts. This is a theory which is
sometimes called a Gestalt theory, because the Germans have this word Gestalt, which we don't
have an exact equivalent of, which means a hole, which cannot be accounted for by the sum of the
pieces, the parts. And we've lost that insight. And I think that what has happened is that a
combination of factors, and it's not exhaustive, but the rise of capitalism, the development of
empires, both geographical empires and commercial empires, thinking in terms of global generalizations
have led us away from the reality, which is always unique, implicit,
wrapped up with value, not just being sort of facts on their own, which is not to say,
by the way, that I don't have any truck myself with the idea that we all just make it all up to
suit ourselves. No, that's not the case. But nonetheless, our reality is something we experience
as a relationship between us observing and whatever it is that it's observed. And this goes
both ways. We are affected by it. And we affect what we see. We literally change what there is
there to see. Now, that vision is quite different from the one we have, that if only we can master
more and more using left hemisphere kinds of mechanism, we will achieve power and power will
make us happy. But the roots of happiness are very other than that, I'm sure we'll come on to that.
But effectively, we think we've accounted for everything when we think in terms of matter,
but much more important are values, a sense of purpose, and as far as I'm concerned,
a sense of the sacred. So that's really where we're at. And I think recovering some of what we've
lost is critical to making any progress. We can't just stick sticking plasters on the cancer,
we need to eradicate the cause and change the way in which we think about ourselves,
the world, and how we relate to it. Before we move to John's opening comments,
for those who aren't familiar, would you explain why you used the term master in emissary?
Okay, this is a kind of a fable in which there is a wise spiritual master who looks after
a small community so well that it flourishes and grows. After a while, he realizes he can't look
after all the business of the community himself, not just because there's now too much of it,
which is part of it, but also because if he's to maintain his overall vision and to see the whole,
he mustn't get distracted by detailed bureaucratic concerns. So he appoints his brightest and best
to be his emissary and go about and do the administrative stuff, a high level assistant.
And unfortunately, that assistant is hubristic, knowing much less than the master he thinks he
knows it all. And he thinks, in fact, of course, he is the real master. And because of his lack of
knowledge of what it is he doesn't know, he, the master, and the civilization fall into ruin.
And that obviously is an allegory which could be applied, I believe, can be directly applied to
the idea of relationship between these hemispheres, because one of them actually sees much more,
is wiser. And, you know, I'm not just using figures of speech. We know, and in the book I
demonstrate how we know, that the right hemisphere is not just more emotionally and socially
intelligent, which many people might assume is the case, but also more cognitively intelligent.
So where we have some evidence about what has happened to somebody's IQ,
we have measurements before and after, say, a stroke, where there has been a significant
drop in IQ, the insult is almost always in the right hemisphere. So it's very important that
the right hemisphere should remain the position of the master. And as long as the emissary follows
the direction of the master that sees more, it's very helpful and useful. It's a good servant
of the very poor master. So the question of why in the global civilization the emissary became
dominant relative to the master is something I want to get back to, but thank you very much.
That was a great opening. And something I should have shared in the opening is
I have tremendous respect for both Ian and John's work. Both have done these kind of
very deep histories of Western philosophy and very meaningful worldviews that address
the nature of mind, the meaning crisis. And yeah, I'm very honored to be in the conversation. So I
wanted to get both of your perspectives on the underlying drivers of the metacrisis that are
inside of human mind experience and cognition. So John, similarly, I would love to hear your
opening thoughts. You've done a very deep presentation of what you call the meaning crisis.
Yeah. And what I'd like to do as well as I'm doing my presentation, I'd like to show some
deep lines of convergence with Ian and I have spoken before. And we've
often realized that there's a lot of convergence. And one of the things I'm hoping to do is in this
with you, but for us to unpack that even more because we have more limited conversations in
the past. So I'm going to start, I will get back to the history in a minute. I want to start with
the present. We're in the UK, 2019, a national survey, very comprehensive survey, 80% of people
found that their lives are meaningless. Interesting. 43% think that's because of financial reason.
And that goes against a lot of the data that we have, that once your finances get you out of
poverty, they do not contribute very much to meaning in life. 34% seem to be getting a little
bit closer, at least in an intuitive way, when they attribute their lack of meaning to anxiety.
And let's just be very careful about this. Anxiety isn't the same thing as fear. Fear, you have
a definite object, something the left hemisphere would very much, there's the definitive thing,
I can point my attention to it, focus on it hard. Anxiety tends to be more atmospheric. It is
generally associated with the right hemisphere. And so what you've got with anxiety is you've
got a nebulous sense of disconnection. And this brings with it a sense of concern, arousal stress.
And of course, horror is exactly the aesthetic of when you feel like you're losing a grip on
reality. So anxiety is on the same arc as horror. Most of our horror movies are not actually horror
movies, they're just startle movies, where something jumps out at you and scares you. But
genuine horror movies, they give you a sense of what I'm talking about. Now, anxiety is low-grade
horror in that sense. So people are drifting along. And then what we can ask is, well, does that have
significant consequences? And we know from the extensive literature on meaning in life, not
meaning of life, which I'll make a distinction in a few minutes, meaning in life or a related
psychological literature, especially the work of Kelly Allen, the sense of belonging.
You don't have meaning in life. You don't have a sense of belonging. You're in serious trouble.
You're in serious trouble psychologically, physiologically, socially, probably predictably,
your overall health, probably your social economic status, it's predictive of lots of stuff going
bad. Of course, it's ultimately predictive of anxiety and depression, which by the way are
flip sides of the same overall disorientation, disconnection problem. It's predictive, of
course, of suicide. Although Tatya and Chanel has found evidence that people don't have to go
through clinical depression. Contrary to what we think, they can just experience meaninglessness
and go right to suicide without going through clinical depression. So just on its own, it's
predictive too. So 80% of a population has the state that we have pretty comprehensive evidence
is very deleterious to their health. And then you have a lot of sort of cultural
sense that this is happening. So the book I did with Christopher Master Pietro and
Philip Missivic on zombies, what did zombies become so prevalent? And the idea is zombies are
a mythgram that has arisen to sort of express, not necessarily articulate or explain, but express.
Meaning crisis will think about them, right? They lead by definition meaningless lives,
they've lost intelligibility, they can't speak, they move in collectivities, but they form no
communities, they drift aimlessly. Unlike other monsters, they don't have any supernatural connection,
they're just us decayed, right, and perpetually decayed. They're a perversion of the Christian
myth of resurrection, because they do not come back to the fuller life, they come back to the
lesser life. And then they got they got linked to another Christian myth, the apocalypse, which
is supposed to be the renewal of the world. But instead, it's the ongoing endless decadence of
the world. So the zombie mythology is a cultural expression of this. And you can also see all
kinds of symptoms. Of course, we have the mental health issues, death of despair in the United
States and the UK are becoming serious, serious problems. Related phenomena, the UK has set up
this Orwellian thing called the Ministry of Loneliness, which is like, because the number of
close friends we've been having has gone down. And Eberstadt has shown in her book,
how the West really lost God is this also has what you might call philosophical,
even spiritual consequences. Because there's a direct correlation between how much people
live atomically and alone, and how secular the society has become, and how how sort of
shallow people's ontology is. I'm not sure about her causal picture, but the correlation is just
undeniable. So this is having huge effects. You get it in the virtual Exodus, people want to live
in the virtual world, rather than the real world, they express this as an explosive thing.
And I think we can get a bit of insight into what's going on, what's missing in the main crisis.
What are they finding there that they're not finding here? But let me just finish a couple more
symptoms. We've got the weird political paradox that everybody feels disillusioned and disenfranchised,
but the political sphere has been has been now reappropriated and filled with religious fervor
and symbolic religious behavior. And we've given over identity and the meaning in life to our
political ideologies, even though we've lost faith in all of the institutions. This is a weird thing.
You have positive symptoms, though, you have the mindfulness revolution, people are seeking
fundamental transformation in attention, awareness, you have the rise of ancient wisdom
philosophies, there are more stoics now alive than were ever alive in the Roman Empire, right?
And of course, you have the ongoing thing, basically from Schopenhauer on of the increasing
investigations into Asiatic philosophies in which philosophy and spirituality, knowledge and wisdom
were not separated. And so that whole symptomology, let's go back to the video game. Well, what are
they getting in a video game that they're obviously lacking in the real world? Well, what they have
is they have a narrative structure. There's a narrative structure that tells them what the story
is and what part they play in it and orients them towards a purpose. So purpose. They have a
nomological structure. What do I mean by that? They have a sense of there's a set of rules,
laws and rules that make sense of that world. So they understand how that world works. This is
intelligibility or coherence. Second, that purpose coherence. Third, what else is going on in there?
Well, they have a normative structure. They know how to self transcend. They can level up.
There's a way in which self transcendence is available to them. And fourth, they get into the
flow state. They get into a state where they feel dynamically coupled and connected to their
environment. So what do we have? These are the four factors of meeting in life. These are the
things that you have when you have meeting in life. Contrary to what our culture says, purpose is
one of them, but purpose is not the synonym for all of them, nor is it the most important of the
dimensions. You need to have purpose, but it's not the same as meeting in life, nor is it
sufficient for meeting in life. The next coherence, the world can't be absurd to people. Third,
you need significance. What that means is you need something that gives you a normative
staircase, something that gives you a way by which you can get in touch with the really real.
We've got from the psychedelic renaissance and the work in mystical experience, and I'm involved
in that, that people seek out for its own sake this relationship with the really real, the more
real. And once they get it, they will, they're willing to change their whole lives so that
they are in deeper contact with that really real. And Yadin has shown their lives actually by many
objective measures get better. So that matters. The third one, the flow state. The flow state is
a very powerful, and Shiksanth Mahayya has done a lot of work on that, we could perhaps talk about
that. The flow state is a very powerful version of the fourth factor which is mattering. People
need to feel that they are connected to something that has a reality and a value beyond their own
individual existence. So you can, to find this out, you ask somebody, what do you want to exist even
if you don't? And how much of a difference do you make to it now? You could grab all of these
things together, and they all fold into this connectedness in sense making. We're connected
to the world. We're ordered to the world. The world makes fundamental sense to us. We are
fitted to the world. We belong in the world, belonging, sense of belonging, sense of meaning,
and love. My proposal is that that can ultimately be understood as reflecting
sort of the core of human cognition. I talk about the core four. I think we've split them
up for analytic reasons, right, which is attention, consciousness, working memory, and
fluid general intelligence. But I think they're all just four different dimensions of an underlying
core thing. And there's good functional evidence, behavioral evidence, and anatomical evidence
for that claim. I won't review all of that, but I'll just take it that that could be agreed with
that much controversy. What I think those, that general ability, that general intelligence reflects
is it reflects two meta problems that you have to solve whenever you're solving any problem you're
trying to solve in the world. And I understand there's two kinds of problems. There's problems
that are solved by having something, controlling it, and there are problems that are solved by
becoming something, problems distinction, which maps on a lot also to the left and right in many
ways. And we'll get back to that. But what I think these two meta problems are, and think about
your intuition, we tend to attribute intelligence to a creature the more we can see reliable evidence
that it can anticipate its world. Because of course, the amount of prevention, the more you can
anticipate the world, the more powerful your causal intervention. If I can avoid the tiger,
that's way less costly than fighting the tiger. And so the thing is, as you push out
sort of the light cone of your anticipation of the world, what you get is you get an explosion
of the amount of information, all the possible alternative pathways to get into your goal,
this just explodes in possibility. So even to take a very limited case, here's my initial state,
I'm starting a game of chess, I'm trying to get to the end, all the number of alternative pathways
outnumbers the number of atomic particles in the universe. And this is one of the core problems
going back to Newell and Simon that is at the heart of the AGI project. And so this is what you
can't do, you can't check all that information, like think about all the things I could pay attention
to, so overwhelming, think about all the things I could remember, think about all the different
combinations of sequences of sounds and movements and yet what we're all doing is going to zero
in on it right now. And what that means is it's not that you check everything,
you can't, that would take the rest of your life, somehow, and this is really important,
you ignore most of what's relevant, sorry, you ignore most of what's irrelevant, you ignore it,
you zero in on what's relevant. Now that's not cold calculation, and this is where I,
like this is a matter of care. We're different from AGI, still, how long is something we could
potentially talk about, we care about the information we're processing, computers don't,
we care about whether or not it's true, computers don't, right? So it's not just that relevance,
it's not just a calculation, it's a matter of caring, it's a matter of commitment because
whenever I'm doing this, I'm taking a chance, I have to commit to this because when I'm paying
attention to Ian, I'm not paying attention to what's behind me, there's a cost, there's always a cost,
I'm always, so there's existential risk at whenever I'm doing it, so there's caring,
committed, connectedness, and notice relevance is a connecting relation, it's like biological
fittedness, right? Relevance isn't in the object, it isn't in the subject, relevance is that what
binds the subjective and the objective together, I call it transjective, right? So that, and for
the name for all of that I use is religio, the sense of binding that carries with it, a sense of
profound meaning. And I put it to you that when people have access to profound meaning in all of
these dimensions, they get a sense of the sacred, an inexhaustible fount of intelligibility that is
not just an intellectual affair, but this connected living affair. But here's the problem.
The very processes that make you intelligently adaptive make you perpetually prone to self-deception.
This is my reinterpretation of the First Noble Truth, right? Because the very process that gets
me to be adaptive by focusing in and binding myself, and I pick, I mean this seriously,
this is normative for me, I'm bound, this is what I should do, I should be paying attention to Ian,
means I'm ignoring so much. And very often what we ignore can turn out to be the relevant
information that we actually need to solve whatever problem we're facing. So we are perpetually prone
to self-deception. And I want to talk just a little bit about, this is at multiple levels, but
what that means is, and this is a trade-off relationship. Whenever you try and solve
one way in which you're being deceived, you open yourself up to an alternative way in which you
can beepers. So I should pay attention to that. No, no, no, and then I'll lose the,
I'm always in a trade-off between what should I foreground, what should I background.
And so it's this very complex process. It's very complex, it's very dynamic,
it's co-created by the world and me, and also me and other people. Very complex, very dynamic,
very adaptive, very prone to self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior, both individually
and collectively. So cultures across the world have had to deal with this really tricky problem.
How do we ameliorate the self-deception without undermining the adaptive connectedness? Because
we can't just shut it off. And we have all these trade-offs. We can't just pursue simple panaceas
that will just do this. So we have to get this complex, I call it an ecology of practices,
practices that intervene in our cognition, our attention, our awareness in multiple places,
you know, checks and balances, very, like think of the eightfold path of Buddhism. It's this
complex set of practices and they're represented by a spoke wheel because they all interconnect
and they're all self-organizing. And when you do that, you need to set that within a community
that homes you because you need people who have been practicing it because this is just,
this is not a matter just of theory, this is a matter of transformation. And they need to be
able to guide you along the way. And then that community has to be set in a worldview that
legitimates it, a worldview that legitimates it. So another way of understanding the meaning crisis
is that unlike most cultures, we don't know where to go to cultivate wisdom. We don't know where to
go to ameliorate that self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior, foolishness. We don't know where to
go to enhance the connectedness, the religio. So it gets us into deep connection. And we used to have
a worldview that gave us both of that. This is how you connect deeper. And this is how you overcome
your fallenness of all use of metaphor. And that was the sacred, the sacred canopy, the religious
frameworks were the places that gave us worldviews, traditions and ecologies of practices for addressing
this. And because of the Protestant Reformation, the scientific revolution, actually I would even
start it in medieval nominalism. Yes, I agree. Thank you. And a lot of things. And then this has
just been put on methamphetamine, basically, since the advent of some of the hyper technologies.
We are in a position where we don't have a sacred canopy. We don't have a... I ask my students,
where do you go for information? They have their phones. Where do you go for science?
They're sort of hesitant, postmodern concerns. But I guess I go to science for knowledge.
That's the reasoning what the words can see. I actually just meant was knowledge.
Then I ask them, where do they go for wisdom? And they don't have an answer.
And they know that without wisdom, meaning in life is tremendously at risk.
There are so many things in that that I would love to respond to, but I don't... I mean,
perhaps Andrew, you would like to talk. Yeah, I mean, I think we get to play with
relevance realization in real time, because I would like to go into zombies and video games
and all kinds of things, but feeling into the highest useful, the questions on my mind that
like to hear what's on yours is. So thank you. And both having shared kind of opening frames.
Two top questions for both of you is etiology. So how did we get here? How did we get to
ubiquitous meaninglessness and nowhere to go for wisdom? How did we get to the master and the
emissary backwards culturally? And what is the relationship between this interior psychological
phenomena and the objective environmental catastrophes, nuclear risk, AI risk, economic
issues that we have in the world? So how did we get here? And how does the interior and the exterior
relate? What are the kind of causal dynamics, both directions? I would love to hear.
Perhaps you wouldn't mind if I don't immediately address those questions, but you've got somewhere
else. I think there's some some more more burning things that came up and we can come to that as
you've announced them and we will come to them, I'm sure. I mean, one was a reflection on what you
were saying at the end, John, about a, we can only attend to so much, we can only remember so much,
and we all need to balance the benefits and risks of everything we do carry as as Heidegger said,
you know, every revelation of truth is the hiding of something. And I think that is really important.
And what this brings to mind for me is is a couple of things. One is that filtering is
is creative, that if you like filtering of light is how we get colored patterns, we get films,
and so forth, life like a dome of many colored glass stains, the white gradients of eternity,
Shelley. So less is often more. And part of shaping and intelligence is knowing what to
get rid of because if you try to take too much and it wouldn't benefit. The other thing about it is
that it's not just a trade-off in the sense, well, we need a bit of this and we need a bit of that.
That is kind of true. But everything contains within it, if viewed in my mind anyway, if viewed
as a whole, it has a relationship with its opposite. And it only exists because of the being
an opposite. So it's like the two poles of a bar magnet. You can't have the north or the south
because they they coexist and co-create. And so what what is trying to do is rather like in
in the magnet or in a in a taught string of a musical instrument or the taught string of a bow
is to hold two things together that both need to be held, not just go flabbily to a point in the
middle, because then the string goes slack, and you've got no power for the arrow to fly or the
note to take off from the loot. So I think that's something important that we ought to bear in mind
is this relationship between the thing and its opposite. It actually also, if I may say, because
I was listening to your talk last night or the night before, to the Consilience Conference. Yes.
And one of the things I think there was this idea that, and well, you made a lot of interesting
points, but one of them was to do with, I've forgotten it.
What was the transjective relating the subject of an object?
Yeah, there's a bit of that. Well, there might have been something and maybe because let me try.
Yeah. Maybe there's wrong. One of the things I was trying to emphasize and one of the things that
a recovery of Neoplatonism, especially given filler's work on it, can give us is a re-emphasis
on the polarity rather than the poles. And I was talking about this. I try to use the Greek word
tonos rather than tension. I do too. Yeah, because the English word tension is
almost purely negative now for us. Yeah, that's right. Tonos, like Heraclitus, the tonos of the boat.
The tautness of the string. And without the tautness, there is no energy. That's right.
And whatever comes out of the tautness is orthogonal to the tautness. So the
arrow flies off at right angles, the notes come out in a way. So it's a very important
aspect of creativity. I just wanted to reflect on that. I wanted to comment very briefly on what
you said about anxiety in the hemispheres. Yeah. I don't think anxiety and depression
in my experience are just parts of the same thing. I think they're actually, they can coexist,
but they're not the same thing at all. And they don't need to coexist. Anxiety, I think,
is not lateralized. So I think there is anxiety created by the left and by the right hemisphere
and each of them holds it. Depression is a complex one. And I don't want to go into it in
any detail, but some depressions seem to me to be due to an unbalanced overactivity or
unopposed activity of the right frontal cortex. And that can be unopposed either by the left
frontal cortex or by the right posterior cortex. So it's slightly complicated. I just want to
put that on record because people may go away and say, well, I thought he said, you know,
and that's not what anywhere I said. I was just trying to, yeah, I was trying to indicate that
the phenomenology tends to be much more atmospheric in both of those. Depression and
anxiety rather than narrow focus. It's wide focused and ambiguous rather than.
To that extent, yes. But actually in terms of where they originate hemisphere wise, I think it's
it's hard to be more specific in the way you seem to be saying. And, and then there's just a
couple of other things that I want to pick up because we don't have to exhaust them,
can't exhaust them now, but we would want to sort of perhaps come to them. One is about purpose
and its nature. And the other is about values and meaning. So I agree with you that meaning and
purpose are not the same thing. But it's very important to make a distinction that will be
familiar to all three of us, but may not be in the minds of some people watching or listening.
And that is the difference between what I call extrinsic purpose and intrinsic purpose.
An example of extrinsic purpose is a photocopier. Its purpose is it was created to copy a sheet
of paper and make another image. But the other thing is that the purpose doesn't lie outside
itself, but in itself. They are in themselves purposeful. Actually, I believe that prayers
are this kind. It's in itself valuable, not because it produces a result, but also very
obviously things like music and dance are not pointless, but they're not, they're not
validated by a purpose that comes out. We have better health for it. No, they have value in
themselves. And the last thing I just wanted to raise, and so that when we're going forward,
we can come back to it and preference these things, is that very often people, I mean,
you said that we need meaning and we need to be directed. And I believe that values are things
that draw us from in front rather than push us from behind. And purpose also beckons to us from
in front and draws us forward. And of course, all our models are pushed from behind because
they're mechanical. But very importantly, these things exist as it were at the same time as
our striving towards them and actually cause us to strive towards them, not by pushing us,
but by calling to us, evoking a response. And that we ought to be careful not to think that
because of a frailty of the human spirit, we must find meaning in a basically meaning
that's cosmos. We must paint values on the walls of ourselves. I know you're not saying this.
But I just thought it would be worth clarifying. We don't have to sort of cheer ourselves up
by painting pretty pictures on the walls of a hermetically sealed cell. I reject that completely
and I imagine you do too. Indeed, we are contacting something which is real. And I actually think
that those values and purpose are essential to the cosmos. They're not things we made up.
So I don't want to exclude Daniel from the conversation, but I feel called to respond,
but I want to make a place for you. I have some questions I'll follow up with, but please go ahead.
So yeah, I mean, that distinction that you made, and this is just to provide convergence,
like it's well established in the lip of, you know, Emma Bile talked about intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation. And then the intrinsic motivation is much more predictive of creativity and insight
than extrinsic. But you actually need a bit. Optimal creativity is to have a mixture of the two
because you need the extrinsic when you're painting the cysteine chapel and you're painting the blue
of the sky and you just got to keep going. Right. And so you need, and it also gives you
corrective feedback because if you're just intrinsic, you don't have external judges and
things like that. But I, yes, and I think that's important. And I think that brings out an important
difference. I think the things that we think are intrinsically motivated, motivating are precisely
the ones that get us into that state of connectedness, religiosity. Optimal intrinsic motivation
being realized as a flow state, you do the flow state to be in the flow state. You don't do it
for any other reason. Right. And that sense of at one minute, that sense of super salience,
that's the beginning of the taste of the sacred as well. And so I think the sacred is our, is how
does reality disclose itself to us where we're in that mode of not work, but serious play that we're
doing for its own sake, because all we're doing, like playing music or going to a play, we're playing
with the, we're playing with relevance realization. We're in this serious sense, we're playing with
it, like, and we're playing with salience. And we're saying, if I play with this, what kind of
world is available to me? And I agree. I think, especially given the work of L.A. Paul and Agnes
Calard and aspiration, that we need to bring back the aspirational dimension, that we are bound,
right? And we have to bind ourselves to the future in the right way. And what's come out of this,
and this is, it allows me to make another point. And I know we have different language about this,
but I think we, we conversion, it's interesting. It's part of what's come out of the way to do
this is to quickly describe an experiment. Okay, so you go into a bunch of academics, and you say,
you give them all the evidence, all the arguments that they should start saving for retirement right
now. Take any challenges, any questions. You come back in six months, none of them are saved.
And that's to do with what's called hyperbolic discounting and the way our, our, our evolutionary
machinery makes distance, things in the, in the distance, much less salient to us than currents.
And that's why you procrastinate. It's why you eat the chocolate cake when you're trying to lose
weight, right? And it's, it's very adaptive because you don't even get that you're just overwhelmed
by possibilities, right? But now you come back to them, and you say, okay, what I want you to do
is I want you to practice this every day. Notice it's a practice, not just a belief. I want you
to practice every day. When you practice, like imagining, and we should talk about two kinds
of imagination at some point, but I want you to imagine your future self as a family, a beloved
family member that you've always cared for, and you need to continue caring for them. And you have
a lot of compassion and love for them. And I want you to do that every day. And you come back in
six months and you find two things. Now they're saving. And the ones that do the practice more
regularly and more vividly imagine it. Save more. Do you see what this is showing? That
the imaginal augmentation of the aspiration to do something actually is in a constitutive part
of being rational. Descartes reduced logos since making rationality to computation. And we lost
the fact. No, no, no. If I'm actually going, and this is Agnes Kellert's argument, if I'm trying
to become more rational, that's an aspirational project. That's me trying to become somebody
other than whom I am. I have to bind myself to my future self. This is religio again. I have to
get religio with my future self. And that's not something that I can do just inferentially. I
have to do this using imagination. I have to use this with connect. So I agree with you profoundly
that even the even the attempts to be more rational require an aspirate. So aspiration
and rationality have to be rebound together. One thing I want to push back on, but just because
I know you've got, see, I'm hesitant around the word value because the notion of value
comes up basically in the Enlightenment and it's part of the is, ought distinction
and things like that. Okay, do you want to challenge that? Because you don't have this notion
sort of predating the idea that value is. I think we're talking about terminology. Okay,
but it would be hard to say that Plato had no allegiance to the values of beauty, goodness,
and truth. I don't call those values. Or we can call them what you like, John, but you know,
let's not. No, no, what I mean is. I would use different words, but you know what I mean by
values. Well, I do and I don't. But I want to do what you did with one of my terms. I think most
people don't hear. See, Plato doesn't think we value them. Plato thinks we love the transcendentals,
right? And value is a statement of choice and preference. This is how Locke introduces it and
makes and you can actually see him change from we are called by the world to we choose and he
introduces the notion there. And what I want to say that is because I want to make the argument
again, and this is part of the overall that love is not a purely subjective matter either. Love is
not a feeling. Love is not an emotion, right? When I love somebody that can make me happy,
it can make me I miss my partner right now because I love her so deeply. It can make me angry,
frustrated, joy. Love isn't an emotion. It's a way of binding myself to another person.
And I think when most people hear the word value, because of its enlightenment history,
they hear choice and preference and what they want. And I don't think if we think we can choose
the true and the good and the people. Okay, so clarification is worth making. Yes, we don't
understand that we don't choose them. We are called by them. We are called by them to ask
to aspire. Now, I understand you're not using the word that way, but I think most people when
they hear value are using it that way. Well, thanks for clarifying that. Yeah, that's not what
I was meaning to say. And there's an important relationship between love and value. Both Pascal
and Shayla said that you can't actually value something until you love it. And most people
would think you don't love it until you know how to value it, but it's an interesting alternative
way of thinking anyway. But I would say that what I want to bring in that people don't usually hear
when they hear value is like Murdoch's point, like in the sovereignty of the good. Love is the
painful recognition that something other than yourself is real. There's a connectedness to
realness that's important if you're actually loving something. Yes. Well, perhaps we should
go to love already, but it's a huge topic. I mean, and I don't want to lose whatever it was. Daniel
Yeah. But I think this was valuable because I think we took a lot of sort of the common language
of modernity and even of postmodernity, subjectivity, objectivity, all the stuff. And we sort of
put pressure on it and shown that the presupposition that this is just the natural way
thought unfolds needs to be challenged. No, no. And above all, on the subjective objective divide,
which is not to say that the terms have no meaning, but just that I like you believe that
everything comes into being out of a relation. It doesn't ever just that or just in here,
but it is the coming together and encounter in fact, which is the root cause of our experience
and of our love and our valuing actually. Yes, yes. Anyway, yeah.
So there's something challenging in what we're trying to do here, which is,
as we've seen what we take words to mean, which words we use, what ontologies, what references,
what epistemologies, we haven't had time to all sync these. And as we probably all experience,
I certainly have when I want to do generative work with someone that has a different background,
that's where we have to start and realize some of our disagreements are because the word means
something different. And that takes a long time. And so I'm noticing that you mentioned
intrinsic and extrinsic purpose. You said purpose and meaning are not identical, but you
didn't make the distinction. John responded talking about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation,
which is not the exact same as purpose. And then there was a conversation around values,
there's a conversation around love around beauty. So these are all related, but not exactly synonymous
topics. They all obviously indicate something that we value, but we're wanting to speak to
value being intrinsic to reality, not just something we make up, which is you saying we're
not just painting values on a meaningless universe. There's something about the ontologies that give
us a meaningless universe that are part of the problem that we want to come to, that I think is
core to the meaning crisis, core to the place we find ourselves in and why you have to say
something like, hey, it's not that the reality is a meaningless universe that we have to paint
meaning on, but that reality has something like intrinsic purpose to it. So I'm just acknowledging
all the really fascinating topics that I'm not going to ask questions about or say anything about,
because in the short amount of time we have, feeling into what has the highest meaningfulness,
beauty, worthiness of love purpose without making further distinctions on which of those it is.
You said something about the intrinsic versus extrinsic purpose that I wanted to click on a
little bit, because extrinsic purpose being an instrumental or utilitarian concept,
the purpose of X is defined by its utility to Y and we're assuming Y has value. So when someone
takes that definition of purpose, they take purpose first rather than meaning or value or
beauty or love, they take purpose as the thing that we're looking for, which is itself a very
interesting question. They take the relative utilitarian extrinsic definition, then they ask
what's the purpose of it all. It's obviously a meaningless question, because there's nothing
outside of it all to say it is relevant with respect to and so it's easy to say, oh, there's no
purpose to anything and come up with nihilism as opposed to just recognize it was a category or you
were using too small a concept. Now you're talking about intrinsic purpose or intrinsic beauty or
intrinsic something. Intrinsic something that is worth something and you're saying that it also has
a pulling quality or a telos, right, that all that is has something like purpose that is not defined
with respect to anything else. It may be hard to define it all, which the Tao would say,
sounds very much like the Tao, it has a nature, right? So does the direction of reality or universe
reveal something about its nature that we that is worth aligning ourselves with, I think is very
interesting. I want to ask, I want to propose what I think is the generator of the metacrisis in your
framework and hear your response and then hear you build on it. But I want to just hear first the thing,
the definition of purpose as extrinsic that the philosophy of science can orient to. So you have
Big Bang where the laws are why they are because who knows and the constants are what they are and
at some point consciousness pops out and it's very easy to get nihilism in that model.
One could say that model is left hemispheric dominance epistemically and the left hemispheric
dominance can't understand purpose or meaning. Is that how you would say it?
When you talk about or I talk about values, I'm thinking of a hierarchy
drawn up by by Max Schaler, the German early 20th century philosopher, in which he had a hierarchy
of values, the base of which was utility. And this is the lowest level of his values. And then there
came things like, he called them values of life, but these were values of fidelity,
magnanimity, generosity, bravery, and so forth, a lot of which seemed to have gone out of fashion.
And then above that came beauty, goodness and truth, the spiritual or geistic of Arthur. And
then at the top of the apex of the pyramid was the sacred. And I think that structure has been
incredibly helpful to me in seeing what we're getting wrong because the value, the only really
driving value of the left hemisphere is utility. It's evolved in order to serve utility for us.
And of course, we need it because it's very useful. But we mustn't think that this answers
our questions or these this sort of level of value is going to give us the fulfillment that
is promised to us by our culture, which is all about acquisition and greed and competition,
typical values of the left hemisphere. So when we come to talk about purpose and its
relationship with meaning, what I would say is, first of all, to make the distinction which
we've really made, but it's the distinction between castes, finite games and infinite games.
Finite games have a purpose. And when you've achieved it, the game is over. Infinite games are
things that have the value in being performed at all and therefore eternally have that value.
We've got locked into the type of belief that everything is a finite game,
which it very clearly can't be. And the things that give us meaning, I think,
are for very obvious reasons, not specifiable as extrinsic goals. We should try and do this and
make that and so on. There's a level at which we have to guide ourselves and think, well,
we need to make a conscious effort to shift our values. But in the end, these things are not going
to be of that kind. They're going to be openness to an attractive force. And those attractive
forces are many, but they can boil down in some ways to three incredibly important things that
give meaning to life, each of which has been more or less trashed by our current civilization.
The first is our relationship with society are being bound to one another in the sense of
religiosity. The business of sharing one's life with people who share your values,
whom you can trust, whom you can confide in, whom you can eat with, play with, and generally share
a culture which may be based on a religion but has common rituals that we all understand.
That is one thing and it is extremely difficult to find any such coherence in modern society
for a host of reasons which most people will be able to fill in for themselves. But we don't have
that kind of cohesion anymore and we're increasingly isolated partly by technology and we live lonely
lives. The UCLA loneliness index has shut up in recent years and I think we mentioned loneliness
already and it's one of the key things that people say when you ask them about their lives,
they say they're lonely. Now meaning can't come from any purpose in being with others and belonging
in the social world and contributing to it in some sort of obvious extrinsic way. You can't
specify ahead of time what that value will be. You only know it in the experiencing of it.
This is the problem, it's the swimming problem. You can't have a manual that tells you how to
swim. You sit on the bank of the river reading, now I know how to swim. You had to get in the water.
The second is our relationship with the natural world in all its complexity and beauty.
So for most people until very recently it was almost impossible for their lives not to be enmeshed
with the surrounding natural world. Only in the last perhaps 150 years also have we become
isolated from nature and this is a really important divorce, a very, very important one.
The divorce from one another is very important. The divorce from nature and the sense of it as an
environment which is a technical term for something that surrounds you but not what you are born out
of which is what nature really means and what you return to. And the third is the relationship to
a realm of something beyond this. Again we've mentioned this I believe but it is the transcendent
realm or the realm of the spiritual or the sacred. And this to a lot of people now they've been trained
to think that this is a rather negligible issue, that it really is a kind of vestige of something
that hangs over from a primitive time when people weren't properly educated and they invented
superstitions to try and explain life. And I mean that is such a terrible, terrible diminution and
tragedy of what it is, travesty of what it is I'm talking about and it is a tragedy. So those three
things are what I believe fundamentally are most important for bringing meaning to our lives.
And I can't specify obviously what the meaning is, you know what is the meaning of life,
a question you cannot answer, although I believe it's 43. But that's what I would say about that
and it relates to the hemispheres in this way, that the left hemisphere is designed only for
acquisition and pleasure, getting stuff, having fun, it's more democratically driven than the
right hemisphere, it's more associated with addiction than the right hemisphere and it's
certainly more associated with getting a kick out of power and acquisition, whereas the right
hemisphere is more able to open itself to the sacred and to these other higher values that
I specify when we cap them now. So I think there is a very important thing there that we're guided
by something that literally doesn't see what it is that's pulling us or should be pulling us for,
that sense of directional purpose in life and the values that call us forward.
So I want to say something about this that I feel like is me restating how the hemispheric model
ends up getting imbalanced, almost obligately gets imbalanced in a way that leads to the
world situation we have and see if you agree with that. And I'm very much curious to hear
related thoughts. So you mentioned that the primary left hemisphere value is utility,
and you also mentioned the word power, which is a very important word, because then civilizations
have a relationship with each other that we can use social Darwinism to describe where there's a
selection process defined in war and defined in population growth and things like that,
where if a civilization has a relation, has our relationship to each other, our relationship
to nature and our relationship to the sacred, all maximizing utility, right? So we think of
human resources, we think of natural resources, and we think of religions as kind of narrative
weapons to be able to coordinate, then the culture that has those utilitarian power oriented views
in all those areas will win that war. It will basically seeing nature as a commodity, extract
more from nature to grow its population, to increase its resource consumption per capita,
to grow its technological base, to utilize humans, to use the, you know, Norbit Wieners,
the human use of human beings in the development of cybernetic systems that are then seen as
inexorably in competition with each other, so they're going to, so we have to kind of mentality.
And then there's either no sacred, there's just that which is good as that which doesn't lose,
which is kind of, I think it's very interesting that game theory was developed by von Neumann
at the same time we developed the bomb, at the same time we developed AI, and it was game theory
and economics as kind of the height of the reductionist experiment saying, based on a kind
of is-ought distinction that you'll negate, which I'm very interested in, that says since philosophy
of science is going to say what is and can't say what ought, then our best basis for ought is that
which doesn't lose in an assumed competitive dynamic, so game theory is the only thing guiding,
and I would argue that if you're only ought as game theory, and you have the ability for recursive
technologies that turn into exponential technologies that are in an exploitative
relationship with the environment, which even the term environment or natural resource is a
crazy term, and in arms races with each other, that that civilization is self-terminating.
But it's also hard to, it's easy to see how it won, right, how it emerged that way, because
any civilization that oriented itself that way a little bit more was going to grow its population
more, was going to advance its tech, was going to win wars, and then other ones
kind of had to do similarly. So what the values or the sense of sacred or the connection to nature
or each other that the Native Americans had before colonizers went there didn't matter that much if
their weaponry and technology and whatever was not going to compete. So the left hemisphere might be
less intelligent in some very important ways, because wisdom, I've never actually heard anyone
give a good definition of wisdom that doesn't involve restraint. It always ends up involving
restraint and binding in some ways. But the utility emphasis of the left hemisphere is very good at
game theory, and then it creates almost an obligate trajectory. And then nobody wants climate change,
but nobody can stop it. Nobody wants species extinction, nobody wants desertification,
but nobody can stop it. The overall topological features defining our world, nobody wants,
but the game theoretic relationship between we can't price carbon properly because if the Chinese
don't they'll economically beat us, therefore we have to externalize the cost. That game theoretic
relationship creates a topology that is actually driving us in a self-terminating direction and
nobody's steering because there is no sacred. There is no, we're very good at solving problems and not
very good at defining is this the right problem to solve, right? Is this the right goal to achieve?
That's actually why I was so drawn to your work is because that, I wasn't thinking of it in terms
of hemispheres, but I was certainly thinking of it in terms of capacities and predispositions of
mind, that the nature of mind that oriented to parts was very good at tecne and was very
oriented to power. And the power tecne thing together was going to win over the other ones
and then create this kind of obligate trajectory. I would love to hear you respond to that.
There's very little in what you've said that I would disagree with at all. We're in a bind which
is to nobody's benefit really. Gain theory explains why we get these things wrong and we
need to find a way out of this which involves restraint actually. I loved what you said about
that and in practice it's our lack of restraint that means that we're not wise, it's very unwise.
And there are two levels to that. There's restraint in general and self-restraint and the idea of
self-restraint used to be intrinsic to the rise of most civilizations. They were founded on a
generation or several generations that were prepared to make sacrifices on a personal level in
order to achieve something greater. That has moved out of the picture because the value of an hour
is about our personal gain. But sometimes if we can restrain ourselves from just pursuing personal
gain we could produce an outcome which would be far more beneficial for all. Of course this is
very famously a difficult thing to achieve because some people defect from the program. We're in a
situation where we need everyone ultimately to come around to a certain way I think if it's a
survive. Now how can we do that? Can we do it at all? I don't know but I believe that if enough
people are committed enough and model their lives on the shift in relations with society,
with nature and with the divine, if they can reorientate their values and stop seeking fulfillment
in a very simplistic and direct way which doesn't actually achieve its goal and worse is
distractive, then we could produce an outcome that would be satisfactory. I don't know if we can
achieve that. I don't know. I mean it sounds like we'd have to convince everybody. Really if we
convince probably about three percent of the world's influential people then we might be onto
something. So I want to come back to why the world's influential people might be the psychologically
least likely to be able to be convinced based on what it took to become influential. I'll come
back to that in a moment because you said maybe we only have to influence three percent but a
moment before you said if we're practicing self-restraint and anyone defects and they don't
restrain so they do the more short-term power thing than they win and then they create a world
that orients to that thing. So defection, sociopathic narcissistic defection is pretty key to this
thing. It is. I'm really curious to hear your thoughts, reflections on any of this but also
specifically how do we, what are the criteria, what is the evolutionary niche for the sociopathic
narcissistic property to be selected for and how would we close that niche? Because promoting
wisdom where it will always lose game theoretically is not that interesting. So there's something
about the relationship of wisdom and power and I would even say wisdom has to bind, it's a master
emissary thing and I know this is very uncomfortable as it should be but if the master doesn't bind the
emissary then everything's broken and so that which is power seeking has to actually be bound
which requires power by something that is not power seeking in the same way which is why Daoism
says the one who wants to lead everybody should run away from, the one who doesn't want to lead
and everyone pushes into leadership maybe you can listen to. So curious to hear your thoughts on
wisdom binding power, closing the evolutionary niche on power seeking, those types of things.
So much, yeah so the, I mean I think the, I agree with, first of all what you did was brilliant
and I really appreciate it. I'm likely and I'm a very significant agreement with it.
John Keeks made a distinction between goals and ideals and the word purpose equivocates
between them. A goal is an end state that everything else is in the service to and it's the utilitarian
where an ideal is not. An ideal is something that is part of the grammar by which you interpret
and make sense of yourself in your life and I agree and we even did that with the sacred. We took
sort of transcendent imminent and then we made this world, this is the Nietzschean critique,
we only had a utilitarian value for that world and then when we stopped believing in the upper
world this world seems to have no value. That whole framework I think has to be rejected which
is not a rejection of the sacred. I just want to make that very, very clear and so why I'm sort
of on that is because I think that this is part of the answer. You can break game theoretic
circumstances in which right you get people to remember certain things. So you can get some
very core ones like you go in a situation where you take $20, oh sure, in a situation where you
take $20 but here's two people but I got to give that person $40. So they're $60 and they get $40
and you get $20 and you take it and if you don't take it nobody gets it. No, I won't take it. So
people there's a symbolic thing that they're oriented towards and it's something like they want
to belong to a world that is a just world and that is more important to them than their own
individual immediate gain. That's the first thing. So there's a symbolic aspect and Robert
Nozick made a good point about this that we didn't put that into a lot of and for good reasons. We
didn't put it into a lot of the game theoretic modeling because it messes up all that modeling
in a lot of ways. And then that connects to we don't actually super value. This is the
sociopath right? We will significantly undermine subjective well-being if we have a reasonable
belief that we will get enhanced meaning in life. This is part of our evolutionary heritage as mammals,
we're also primates, we're also sociocultural and the prototypical instance we do this is
have a kid. When you have a kid all of the measures of subjective well-being go down.
Your health goes down, your sleeping goes down, your finances go down, your social connections
go down, your amount of sleep you're getting is going down, you're sick all the time, your partner
doesn't like you anymore and you're in a constant stress situation and you ask people well why are
you doing it? Like you couldn't pay most people, well why are you doing this? Well because it's
making my life more meaningful because they're connected to something again that has a reality
beyond themselves and right I'll use your term a value beyond themselves. He used another term
interestingly which was sacrifice. Yes. Which has related etymology to sacred. Of course. And
something you can't say that you know something is sacred if you aren't willing to sacrifice for it.
So please continue. And this is another thing to remember that the arrow of relevance for us
does not point to just how are things relevant to me. Yes we do have to feel connected to ourselves
because if we don't we're dissociated our agency is undermined. But as Ian said we have to feel
fundament not how are you relevant to me but how am I relevant to you? How am I relevant to us?
And how are we relevant to the world? And yes how are we and the world relevant to something
that grounds that world what Plato would call the good. And so I think that if we can get people
to remember this is what I would want to say. I don't even like the word remember. I want people
to be able to fall in love with all of these dimensions of being again because and this is one
of the this was Spinoza's big insight right. The way you overcome a powerful motivation is what
another powerful motivation is we can get people to fall in love again with being within between
and beyond. We can we can we can break the game theoretic. This is what Christianity did in the
Roman Empire. Christianity went out and it didn't unlike Stoicism that tried. I'm not saying we
shouldn't try and get the government but that tried and it had some success too. But Christianity went
and said there's a new way for you to love yourself. You are not the non-person the Roman
Empire says you are. Here is a new way Agape is a way in which you can love yourself and it's not
a hedonistic egocentric power. Here's how we can love each other and here's how we can love God.
And it captured the world and it captured a world that was one of the epitomies of a world
driven by power, competition, the lust for glory. So we have a historical examples of if you give
people if you can get them out of meaning starvation so they're not in a scarcity mentality.
When you're a scarcity mentality you drop into left hemispheric. I think Ian's right about that.
Your short term utilitarian right. What do I need? Because this is emergency mode. But if you can get
people out of a scarcity mentality and get them to fall in love with being again, connecting this
to themselves and another, then you can get you can call them to something that gets them to remember
that they actually do value trying to use your language, right? Connectedness more than success.
I really like the must fall in love with. I want to play with the scarcity thing for a minute because
the people that are pursuing power the most are not in any actual economic scarcity,
though they are in the perceived relative scarcity relative to the next guy competing
with them. And there are plenty of people who under scarcity share more. I've always found
fascinating that when there's a disaster either the best or the worst of people can come out
and so scarcity can go either way and abundance can go either way. So there's something about what
is sacred that is actually deeper than that even under scarcity can have someone sacrifice
and that even under abundance can still have someone totally self-centered.
Yes, but I did want when I was using scarcity that I was talking about meaning scarcity.
Yes.
Not economic. That's the distinction.
And one of the things that happens, for example, as people go up, this is an experiment, as people
go up a corporate structure and the corporate structures tend to favor people who have sociopathic
tendencies, what you also see is a measurable decrease in the ability of them to take the
perspective of other individuals. The ability to take the perspective of other individuals
is strongly predictive of how many deep connections you can form in your life. So they are actually
suffering a very profound kind of scarcity as they go up. They're suffering connectedness
scarcity in a profound way. And what I've been fascinated with is the number, and I
sure this is happening to both of you, the number of people who are in these positions and positions
of power who have reached out to me and said, I feel disconnected and there's that element of
almost of horror and absurdity. I feel disconnected. And the people I talked to in Silicon Valley,
I don't want my kids to go through this. I don't want my kids to go through this.
And this is what I mean. There is alternative motivations too. And I think they have also
an evolutionary provenance to the game theoretic motivations. And I don't think the game theoretic
motivations are metaphysically necessary. I think there are other ones that have an equal
power to motive. And because we have historical evidence, we have current evidence that we can
tap into those. But I think there's two poles to this. For us to fall in love with being again,
that's the agent pole. But the world as an arena in which we cannot, it has to be sacred to us.
Sacred is how the world is to us when we are falling in love with it.
Okay, I want to go into sacred. I want to say something about what you said.
You said that as people move up in positions, as we look at places where power is concentrated,
and we move up the power hierarchy, there are exceptions to this, but it is generally the
case that the people who are at the top of the power hierarchies are people who are both attracted
to and good at power games. And there are certain other things that are attendant and deficient
that tends to go along with that. And power, whether it's economic, social, or political,
follows a power law distribution. So one of the things I find very interesting is that
I think there's a mistake that a lot of sociology makes where we look at certain human traits,
like rationality or empathy or whatever, on a Gaussian distribution, and then say humanity
is the result of this, where realistically the actual power influencing things says that a tiny
percentage of people that are three standard deviations psychologically different than almost
everyone have most of the determining power. And then they create conditioning environments
that everyone else is conditioned by. I think that's really important, you know, hyperagency.
I have found that, like, we had a term psychopathy and then sociopathy, and now it's ASD and the DSM,
anti-social personality disorder, that there are types of people there that have higher and lower
ability to take others perspectives. And so there are people who have sociopathy or whatever you
want to call it that have lower ability to take other people's perspectives, but they're ones
that have higher cognitive empathy but lower embodied empathy. And the higher cognitive empathy
means I know how to play you, I know how to say what you want to hear in virtue signal.
And it's a very important point from a hemisphere point of view, because that cognitive empathy
is more based on the left frontal cortex. It's the simulation of real empathy.
Yes, exactly. And the real empathy or the emotive empathy is more based in the right
hemisphere. But also we know that sociopaths have deficiencies in the right ventromedial
frontal cortex, which is an area that's terribly important for forming any kind of emotional
relationship with anybody else. Whether this is a thing that they're born with or not is
not finally concluded, but I think it pretty clearly is something that they are born with,
that it could be a result of a certain kind of deficient parenting. What we're coming back
to there is that, again, there is this contrast between a connected world, a relational world
in which the values come out of the relations, and another kind which is a linear world of
target getting, goal getting, in which we think that what is valuable will come out of
completing that goal. And it doesn't. Yeah.
So I want to pick up on what you said, because I think that distinction is very important that
you made. And here, there's an ambiguity in taking a perspective. You can take a perspective
in that calculative way. That's different from taking off a perspective in which you care and
you try to see the world from that perspective. This is the danger in teaching people to perspective
take like the way rhetoric can do it, because you can create a very good lawyerly person.
Like what I've found is the people who are best at perspective seeking are either impaths or
sociopaths. They're good at perspective seeking because they really feel what other people feel
and they're seeking to, or because they actually don't have any binding to anything real. They can
take whatever perspective happens of utility without caring about a relationship. And so that's
the thing one has to really watch out for is the simulation of empathy. And it brings up
something. So you were talking about Christianity binding game theory. I'm not a Christian scholar,
so I'm just going to from the outside say the fact that under in the name of Jesus Christ,
who said, let he who has no sins cast the first stone, we were able to do the Inquisitions is a
really interesting act of mental gymnastics. And so I see that wherever there is a relationship
to the sacred that is authentic, and it starts to develop the ability to really move people,
there's power in that, then those who are seeking power seek to capture it,
and corrupt it. And so then all the religions become these mixed bags of an authentic beautiful
thing. And the way power ends up capturing them. And if they don't orient to power,
then they usually lose in a holy war, their population doesn't become very big or something
like that. I would love to hear. So because there's how do we have a how do we have a
proliferation of the sacred for which someone will make real sacrifices and for which whole
populations will that doesn't lose to other populations that don't do that, and that doesn't
get captured by power and perverted and distorted. Right. Okay. So first of all,
agreed. But I want to I want to I want to say
all the notion of restraint. Chris Annie was successful in pretty much keeping it as part
of the cultural cognitive grammar that people other than the male citizens were actually persons.
It was successful at turning infanticide into an accepted practice into something we find
horrific. So, yes, I'm not saying that, you know, the power structures came in. But there were
there was also enough, I mean, we, we are running on the fumes of the Christian sacred canopy,
and it's been what has been still keeping some restraints on this otherwise.
Milwaukee and machine that's running. And I want to what I'm trying to say is
I want to I want to I want to give us a sense of hope about this, that it's not the sacred
emerges, and then it gets consumed. The sacred emerges, there is the there is the push back,
there's the reframing, there's the power consumption. But some of the underlying cultural
cognitive grammar has been fundamentally changed. We haven't gone back to the Bronze Age,
we're still post axiom, we haven't gone back to the pre Christian age, we're right, that that's
not what happened. And so, I'm saying, I'm not denying that, right, I'm not denying that there's
the threat. But what I'm saying is, but if we could be more clear about what gets preserved
across the, I don't know what they're calling the re-entrenchment of the power dynamics. And could
we better, more better this time, focus our attention there, focus our cultural and even
our political commitments, we could perhaps do it better this time. I mean, I think we must,
this is exactly brings up a question I wanted to ask you is in the in the parable that you
told of the master in the emissary. I might argue that the responsibility for the failure of that
civilization or tribe or whatever you want to call it was the masters, not the emissaries,
because the master obviously misassessed. The master would probably have agreed with you.
And so, rather than say the master was wise and the emissary wasn't, so he did a Dunning-Kruger
thing and messed it all up, the master was missing a certain kind of wisdom in his assessment of the
actual realistic capabilities of the emissary. There was some stuff in his noticing the hole
that he wasn't noticing that was really critical for him to ultimately still hold responsibility.
So, there's an uptick in the master capability that could have kept that relationship right.
So, there's something about needing to be power literate, to be able to keep power from
corrupting a relationship with the sacred. I mean, rather than say that the master was
deficient in some way, one would say that there was an important relationship here which
required a certain degree of vulnerability. So, the master couldn't remain invulnerable because
he realized that he needed to not concern himself with certain things if things were to survive.
So, there isn't a squeaky clean answer to this. He had in a way to trust. In some ways, it's very
like the story of God and Satan, that Satan was Lucifer, the light bringer, the brightest of the
angels, God's right hand. And because of his power, hungriness, and his envy of God, everything
fell to ruin. But the end of that story isn't ruined because Christianity, again, I'm becoming
more and more convinced during our conversation, if nothing else comes out of it, how very, very
important the sort of overarching effect of a religion such as Christianity is for the survival
of a civilization. I mean, I've always felt that, but I see it more and more in what we're talking
about. But what you've adverted to earlier was the necessary sort of supervision. And
that is a difficult balancing act, as it is for the master and the emissary. And there's another
fable, which I tell at the beginning of part three of the math of the things, which is an
Onondaga legend, they're an Iroquois people. And they have the story of how, you know, because
creation was waning, there were these two brothers who were sent to sort of regenerate the power of
universe. And these brothers are not equal, like the master and the emissary. One of them is wise,
and he is called the one that holds the earth with both hands. The other is called hard as ice,
the flint. And his value is that he's got a tool that his father gave him, which is speech. And
the other is an arrow with which he can shoot. And this is an extraordinary, just starting there,
division between, as it were, the writers, but the story gets better and better as it goes on.
I can't tell the whole thing, but those are interested, the recording on YouTube of me
reading the introduction of this chapter in which we tell the story. But effectively, what
the good brother realises is that the bad brother tries to imitate the good brother,
because he's envious of him. He sees the good brother creating all kinds of wonderful things,
birds and beasts and flowers. And he tries to create and he produces only thorns and flies and
bats. And there's a sort of sense that he is dangerous left to himself. But he must also
not come too close to the good brother, because the good brother needs to preserve a degree of
his independence without which he is no longer himself. So they can't fuse, but one needs to be
subservient to the other, the one needs to have power over the other. But that is not something
that can ever be secured 100%. So you could never have the situation where the one that is wise
has that power, because one of the terms on which wisdom exists is that it sees beyond power. Now,
I know that you've made a very good point that there needs to be a certain degree of sort of
watchfulness and awareness. I agree about that. And quite how this is managed in a way that doesn't
actually vitiate the whole business of wisdom, because in most cultures, wisdom is associated
with, well, in Chinese, with Wu Wei, within action, the master does nothing, but nothing is left
undone. These remarkable and beautiful sayings of the Taoist literature. So we have to somehow find
a way of making that work. And I don't know what your idea is about how that could be made to work
A close friend and colleague of mine that you both know, Zach Stein,
talks about the distinction between power differentials in educational setting versus in
most traditional power settings. Specifically, he's talking about educative authority versus
propaganda in terms of information asymmetries. And that the key distinction, and this gets fuzzy,
but the key distinction is that someone who has information asymmetry relative to someone else
who could use that asymmetry to maintain the asymmetry and grow it, which is the impulse of
power traditionally. In the educative example, the educator recognizes that they have
an information asymmetry, but they're in a kind of fiduciary relationship where their goal is to
actually bring the student up to symmetry with them and even beyond. So their goal is not to
maintain their power asymmetry. They use the power asymmetry to close it. And whereas in most
power dynamics, if someone has an economic asymmetry, they use that increased economic power,
political power to both maintain it and grow it. And so we would say the first one is an ethically
legitimate utilization of the reality of a power differential. The second one is not a legitimate
one. But what that also means is let's say that the educator who's trying to bring this person up to
competence recognizes that there's someone else who's trying to exploit them. The educator now
has some ethical responsibility in their fiduciary responsibility to the student to also do something
over here, to do something in that relationship. And that is where I think it's very interesting is
if those who are pursuing the true, the good and the beautiful, those who are pursuing a deep
relationship with the sacred and wisdom don't do anything and don't develop any levers of technological
or economic or other types of power, low deceiving, so to speak, then they're leading the direction
of the world to those who maximally seek power orientation for the illegitimate use.
And so then you have to say, is it really wise to say I seed power, I seed power of the world to
the sociopaths, including in the risk of eminent extinction and the destruction of the sacred,
and not just the future destruction, but that 10 to 20 animals go extinct every day from human
action. That there are two orders of magnitude, more mammals in factory farms and in the wild
today. Like there's some ethical obligation of those who give a shit about that, to have that
give a shit, do something to be actual, as you say, actual, meaning that it acts. So are our values
actual? If they're actual, do they have a causal effect? Yeah. Well, they obligated to. I mean,
if I may just respond to that, I'm not suggesting that we just sit back and roll over and let everything
go to hell in a handcart. That's very far from what I'm saying. But what I'm saying is that even if
we were to find ways of reducing certain kinds of harm, unless they were accompanied by a growth in
wisdom, that really wouldn't achieve what we need to achieve. We would leave the psychopaths in charge,
actually. So it is a difficult one. I mean, your analogy is not meant to be perfect. But for example,
with the teacher bringing the pupil up to his standard and maybe beyond, which I like that idea,
and I think it's a real one. But if the student is in fact basically psychopathic,
then has he done good by doing that? I mean, once you start looking at the outcomes of actions,
rather than the motivations behind actions, you get famously into trouble.
There's three things I want to respond to. One is I'm hearing, we've been talking a lot about the
master versus the emissary, but it seems to me that we're in a weird problematic here. And I know
this isn't an accurate representation of your thought, but I want to pose it. But I want to also
state all three things because they belong together. One is, yeah, but that also requires that the
left hemisphere has some reverence for the right hemisphere, but reverence is properly a property
of the right hemisphere. And so you've got this weird catch-22 thing going on. And then I think
part of how we have done this, and this is why bringing up the educator is important,
is we've done this by saying, oh, but there's another variable in here, which is there's not
only individual cognition, there's the collective intelligence of distributed cognition. There's
something that comes out in a we, like what's here, that doesn't belong to you or to me.
But it takes on a life of its own. And of course, this is the whole tradition of the Ecclesia
and the tradition of the geist and the tradition of the logos and the Socratic Dialogue. We follow
the logos wherever it goes. And what that does is this is Plato's pivot problem. Because the
example you're talking about is exactly the problem that Plato was wrestling with with Socrates and
Elcibiades. Here you have the most attractive, not physically, but most attractive representation
of wisdom. And here you have this glorious figure who's attracted to Socrates, but is ultimately
properly a psychopath. Elcibiades is willing to screw anybody over for his own personal work
and betray everybody. And Plato really is vexed about why doesn't he turn? What makes somebody
pivot towards that? And then Plato wrestles with this and he has sort of two answers. One is
there's a sort of seduction. I hate to use that term in our charged atmosphere, but there's a
seduction, which is you basically get sort of the left hemisphere really involved with the
kind of stuff it likes to do, running arguments and discussions. But as it's doing that, you use
that as a way of getting it to pay attention to the non propositional in very, very powerful ways.
And this is why Plato writes dialogues, because the drama and the character development are as
important as the argument. We did a great disservice. We just took the arguments out and stuck them
over. All right. But if you do that, that's part of the answer. And then in that, what part of the
seduction is, and it's not, look, if you try to make somebody follow the sacred, it's not sacred,
right? Right. But the seduction is like, again, how we fall in love, right, is if you put people
into these circumstances where they can catch the fire of the logos, then they will often feel
called to reorient themselves. They will do the Plato's pivot. It's not an algorithm because it
was an algorithm. It wouldn't be the thing we need. We can't make it an algorithm. We're looking for
something algorithmic. We're fundamentally misapprehending the ontology that has to be at its
basis. But I've seen this when we do these dialogical practices, people say, and this is regardless of
where they come from, religious or secular, they say, this is a kind of intimacy I've always been
looking for, but I didn't realize it sounds like platonic anemesis, right? And then, and then if
they go longer, right, they start to, they start to move beyond the intimacy between, they say,
there's the we space or the guys or the logos, and they start to feel intimate with it. And then
they're called to that. And then some people are called beyond that they're called to through all
of that. I get a sense of intimacy with being itself and they get the possibility of falling
in love again. But I can't argue them into that. I can put them into a place where there's
orientation going on, where there's conceptual reflection going on. But this thing, we have
to structure it with a lot of finesse, so it takes on a life of its own and can draw us in so we can
get people to do the platonic pivot. That's, that's how we would address what you're saying.
Because there's compulsory kind of nature, if you like, that it's trying to compel a position.
And what you rightly are pointing out is that the things that really matter like wisdom and love
can't be compelled in this way. No. And if they are, they're no longer wisdom or love. There
was always a vulnerability involved here. That's terribly important in my view. And it's not
necessarily anybody's fault if that vulnerability leads as it usually does eventually to some kind
of a downfall. But without actually taking the risk, we can't have the great things that we have
had. So it has its own value and purpose, even if we can't actually always guarantee what kind of
an outcome there's going to be. Okay, but I want to pick up on the seduction. I agree with what
you're saying. Yeah. But what I want to say is, can we get, I'm trying to use your language because
I want to play with you. Can we get the left hemisphere involved with speech and logic and
it likes to play this. This is what happens. But it gets drawn, it gets drawn into something that
is beyond itself. It doesn't. That takes me back to a point you made early on that how can it ever
be that the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere have that right relationship? Yes. Because the
left hemisphere has this intrinsic loss of reverence or whatever. Yes. But I don't think
it's necessarily the case because I think the problem comes when we give too much power to
the emissary in that myth. So to begin with in civilization, the left hemisphere and right
hemisphere work very well together. The left hemisphere is given exactly that kind of a job
that it's good at. And if you like to put it this way, I'm being ridiculous at the anthropomorphic,
but it's happy to be in that role and to contribute. But the problem comes when we
start to lose, I'm going to come back to this thing about the value difference between the
right and the left. Because I think it's absolutely essential to the situation we're in. It's our
complete loss of orientation towards the right values. And what happens then is that the values
of the left hemisphere are encouraged and the left hemisphere starts to see only its own point of view
and it thinks itself in a Dunning-Kruger-like way to be more intelligent than it is. Okay. And I agree
with this wholeheartedly. And I want to say something that overlaps with Daniel, but he's saying
because one of the things that the Enlightenment, why it takes off, I would argue, is it gets a way
of really clarifying the difference between authority and power. And this is one of the things,
you know, so you've got Kant, right? And then I want to correct it with Hegel, but Kant is basically
saying, I know authority is when I recognize you as being able to say something that I will
fundamentally be persuaded of as true. So I recognize that you are, you know, this is a
Kantian model. His language is dangerous, but just let me use it for now. I recognize you as a
rational being. And therefore, I should acknowledge that what you say, I should take it seriously
and allow it to possibly persuade me. And then when I do something because you have persuaded me,
I do it because I have recognized you and you have recognized me. And then Hegel said, oh,
but this reciprocal recognition, which is what you get in the student and the teacher that you
don't get in the, because the master sleigh, this is Hegel, you don't have reciprocal recognition.
No, right. And importantly, that is not the relationship between the emphasis I talk about
exactly. And this is exactly. So one of the things I think the one of the things why the
Enlightenment takes off is because it brought this tremendous liberating clarification about
wait, wait, wait, we want, we want, we want all the governance, even myself governance to be based
on authority, which is based on reciprocal recognition. And Hegel says not only moment to
moment, but all of the people before you and all the people that are going to come after you,
the biggest possible distributed cognition machine you have, you want to be like listening to them
and you want to be trying to get the future to listen to you. And you get this tremendous model
of authority. And I think that was tremendously liberating. Now, and then what I see happening
is that some of the things that came along with that is how the right hemisphere started to
seed power or not realize that power is getting seeded. Because once you give, right, this, this
priority to this, right, then you start to give a, it's very easy to get into the idea, oh, but
all the, all that the reasoning is all of the, all that the rationality is it's not a way of being,
it's just a way of calculating Hobbes proposes this, right. So, right. The Enlightenment gives us
something that is tremendously of value. And I don't, I don't think we want to go back to
and give that back again. We don't want to go back to Master Slade. Right. And you, right. And so
we have to get to that, that, that point where no, no, no reason isn't about calculation. It's
about being with each other in a way that we are reciprocally responsible to each other.
So we are governed by authority rather than by power. That's I'm trying to answer you that that
is, that is possible for us. There was two things in the Enlightenment that got inappropriately
bound together. I think the very legitimate understanding of the difference between authority
and power, and then the illegitimate reduction of rationality, not as a way of being with each
other, but as a way of calculating each other's behavior. Which is in my terms, the handing over
of reason to mere rationality, rationality being schematic logic as a way of understanding things.
Whereas reason is a way of balancing rationality with the intuitions that come from a life well
lived from experience. And that is what is reason. It was always thought to be the main
purpose of an education. And yes, for 2000 years in the West to produce a reasonable person. Yes.
And that's what one would expect of a wise judge or a good politician. But we don't have that.
Right. So my language for that, and I don't think it's in any way different. I talk about
the ancient notion of logos. And with Descartes, you get it reduced to logic. And then we reduce
reason to just logical manipulation of propositions. And we lose all the other. We lose the perspectival
and the participatory notions. So you said something at the beginning I want to come back to,
which is how can the left brain have reverence for the right if it doesn't have reverence as a
capability? And I think this is something I said to Ian when he and I had a brief visit yesterday,
is what Gertl did with the incompleteness theorem was use math to show the upper boundaries of math.
Sure. But that's the Socratic project. That's what Socrates does, almost all of the dialogues
and in a poria, for that reason. And it's what the Guiana Yoga path and the Vedic traditions
is. Exactly. Of poems in Zen. It's what Tarski did with formal logic, using formal logic to show
the upper bounds. And I think it's exactly what Ian is doing in describing the master-emissary
relationship in a way the left brain can understand. Because, you know, I was saying earlier,
wouldn't the master be the more responsible party? I think they're both responsible, right? And so
there is a reverence the left hemisphere has to have for the right. There is a recognition of the
developmental maturity, capacity and relationship with the environment the right needs to have,
right? And we're of course using left and right hemisphere than the individual to also represent
forces in the world, distribution of people and like that. And I think the very best thing
that the parts-based, one of the best things the parts-based mind can do is recognize its own
upper boundaries being insufficient to what is actually worth caring about. In which case,
it has its own kind of transcendence, right? It has its own recognition of something beyond
itself worth listening to. So again, evolutionary provenance for this, right? I think one way I
would say of Ian's histiography is like the what should be properly opponent processing, and I'll
explain what I mean by that, has become adversarial processing. And this is also the problem at the
level of our distributed cognition. If you look throughout our biology, you have opponent processing
going on. Opponent processing is when you have two systems that have complementary biases,
and then you lock them together so that each is the best corrector of the other. So,
non-controversial example is the autonomic nervous system. You have the sympathetic system
biased in one way. It views everything as a threat and opportunity. The parasympathetic is
everything is right. And they're like this, and so your level of arousal is constantly evolving,
and there doesn't have to be any king or emperor over this because it is a self-correcting system.
Your attentional system, the task-focused default, you're constantly moving between focusing your
attention and burying it, opponent processing. Opponent processing between foregrounding and
backgrounding. I can go on and on. Why does nature keep coming to this? Because it is how you solve
the no-free lunch term. Every heuristic has a complementary bias. This is a mathematical
theorem and a proof. But, and this is one of the things I put in my original 2012 paper,
but if you put two complementary heuristics together, they can toggle between each other,
and you don't fall prey to the no-free lunch. You can escape the trap that you have to constantly
fall into the bias from your heuristic. Nature figured this out, and I think I would put it to
you if we understand it the way I've explained it to you, that the proper relationship between
the hemispheres could be opponent processing rather than adversarial processing. If each
hemisphere could come to see the other hemisphere as a valuable source of self-correction. Because,
as you say, they solve different sets of problems, well-defined problems, left hemisphere, very
ill-defined gestaltish problems in the right hemisphere, but this is also something not
at the individual level. Democracy requires this commitment, which is not game theory,
but it is, has evolutionary provenance. You are the best possible entity for me overcoming my
self-deceptive bias, because you have alternative biases, and I am the best for you. And if we both
commit to the geist, the logos between us, we can get the best self-correcting system, which is what
democracy is supposed to be, but not just for individual cognition, it's supposed to be for
cognition, distributed cognition. But again, I'm trying to offer you the theme you have that I
keep wanting to answer is, there's evolutionary provenance for the alternatives that are being
discussed here that can be tapped into. Did that land for you? Yes. I want to
propose something in relationship to this in both your thoughts.
One very simple way I would sometimes describe the generator of the metacrisis is that humans have
radically beyond evolutionary capability via technology development, and still using
relatively close to evolutionary motivations, that you can't apply apex predator theory to sapiens
and have a biosphere that doesn't self-destruct, because a polar bear can't make nukes,
and an orca can't kill all the fish in the ocean, but we can do both. And so we're obviously not
an apex predator. We're obviously something well beyond that, because the evolutionary process,
having most of the adaptive capacity in the other animals, be corporeal and very slow evolving,
and so evolving through processes that create co-selection, creates a symmetry of power,
whereas the orca gets faster, so did the tuna, and they get away, and as the polar bear gets faster,
the walruses get bigger, and all that kind of thing. And with the complexification of our
cognitive processes that could start to do techne, and I would say, I'm just going to call it
techne in general, both physical technologies and language, capitalism, etc., that our adaptive
capacity and our predative capacity increased rapidly faster than any of the rest of the
environment, increased its resilience or relative capacity. And so I would put the origin of the
metacrisis, not with evolutionary processes, but with the beginning of stone tools. And stone
tools were a pretty slow evolutionary curve, and so then with the agricultural revolution,
we got a big bump, and then the industrial we get a big bump. I think we get a big bump in the
upper pillar of the transition, and that's my response to, which is we get a big bump in the
upper pillar of the transition, in which we seem to get the advent of the appreciation of the sacred
that goes along. It is sowing into some of our biggest cognitive advancements. So you have the
technology, like you said, is like this, right? And then we get this bump, and we get projectile
weapons, we get calendars, we get, but we also get music, we also get representational art, we've seen
it. Here's my argument, actually. You're making it. Humans have been a very mixed bag
in, from a ethical perspective of the only creature that really scientifically optimized
torture, the most subjective suffering possible, but also the only one that will sacrifice itself
for other species and that can make the vow of the bodhisattva, right? Our abstraction allowed
us to search a very wide search space. So the most kind of beautiful, numerous stuff and the most
kind of horrific stuff. What I'm arguing is that that mixed bag that we have been with exponential
tech near planetary boundaries self terminates, and that we don't get to keep being that mixed bag.
And this now comes up to the vulnerability of if the relationship to the sacred is forced or
compulsory, it's not actually a relationship to the sacred. If you remove choice, it's not ethics
anymore, it's mechanism. And so there's a vulnerability in the recognition of actual choice
and in the honoring of choice. But we have to do that and fundamentally differently than we've
ever done, because if you say, how well have we stewarded our power historically? If you ask the
other species that we inhabited the planet with or the lower classes within civilizations or whatever,
that mixed bag stewarded it pretty poorly in many places. But we couldn't split atoms,
and we couldn't change genomes, and we couldn't make AI. So the question comes, and so let's
take AI for a moment, because splitting atoms takes G8 nation state level capacity to do,
it actually doesn't. The G8 has made sure nobody else gets to use it through the IAEA and making
sure that if anyone even tries to bomb them preemptively, because we don't want the power to
get distributed. And yet we're distributing the power of synthetic bio and AI rapidly,
that is, every bit is destructive to not just other state actors, but anybody in a way that is
unmonitorable. So when you have decentralized catastrophe weapons, and things that can create
the catastrophe, even by the intentionally good use, but with mistaken externalities from doing
too much narrow problem solving, and not enough, is this a good goal? Is this the right problem
orientation? And anybody does the AI weapon, everybody has to do the AI weapon, or they lose
by default, those types of dynamics. I would argue that that our abstraction capacity,
exploring that whole search space, the power sides of it end up, and you know, Robert writes
nonzero. Of course, you have a selection for increased coordination within an in group that
can do sometimes coordination with an out group that we call trade, but sometimes zero sum or
negative sum competition with an out group. So there's a shelling game where I'll coordinate
with you when it's in my benefit while reserving the right to defect on you, and that's in our
benefit. And if anybody does that, then everybody's in that kind of game theory. And if someone says,
well, we'll just sacrifice ourselves comprehensively, great, then there's just no more of those people,
those people are gone, and the people who made it through or the people who won the game theory
thing. So what I'm saying is that both through conflict theory, people who want to do messed up
stuff with this much technological power, and through mistake theory, people who are just,
I don't want to cause climate change, but I want to do stuff that requires energy,
multiplied by the content imperative of there's 8 billion people all wanting to do the same thing.
We go extinct in all those scenarios, or we at least radically lose
any definition of civilizational progress anybody could want to argue. I would already
say when you talk about the Enlightenment, that if you ask how was the Enlightenment and how was
generally the narrative of civilizational progress to the Native Americans, or to any of the Indigenous
species that works, Indigenous people that were extincted, or any of the other species or whatever,
the progress narrative is a very challenging narrative. And I'm not going to throw out all
of the baby with the bathwater, but we have to hold the complexity of it. But the question that
I'm really curious about is, given the amount of technological power that we have and that we're
rapidly getting, and given how much that power has already eroded the biosphere to the point of
tipping points, and given how distributed all the people are and there is no one king of the world,
I'm not saying we would want it, who can make choices, can we imagine a humanity that has the
wisdom to steward that power reasonably well? Well, here's my challenge back to you,
because you've made this argument before and I find it compelling, but I also find it frustrating,
because the argument is set up, but it basically says we have no examples from the past that we
can rely on, and then asks us to imagine the future, where how can we possibly imagine the future
without relying on the past examples? It's a request to do, and I know you're not trying to
do that. Do you see what I'm saying? I would argue that we have examples from the past,
temporarily, that we're able to use restraint via wisdom, via relationship to the sacred,
adequate to have their own population in some relative sustainability with its environment,
and some reasonable quality of life producing. I have indigenous scholar friends who've said that
the early indigenous wisdom traditions, we're talking 40,000 years ago, actually emerged in
relationship with human extinction of megafauna, and that they had already messed up and were like,
whoa, we're too powerful to be this dumb, we have to be a lot wiser, men are not the web of life,
we're a strand within it, whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves, that the first
wisdom traditions were already their response to the anthropogenic crisis. Then they might have had
a while of relatively good binding of that level of tech, then someone else got a higher level of
tech, didn't have the same binding, and then those people got wiped out or had to join the thing.
So I'm not saying we have no precedent of people doing a wisdom binding power thing. I'm saying
we have no adequate precedent to the current situation, because obviously we have a totally
different power dynamic. But it's okay to say that new stuff is required. So this is an innovative
question. It's innovating in the domain of wisdom question that, of course, draws on but is not
limited to what we have done so far. So to my ear, this just sounds like an exactive proposal. Can
we take stuff totally that's been working one way and repurpose it and stuff, like the way the tongue
has been repurposed for speech? Am I understanding you correctly? So you're not, because sometimes
I've heard- It has to be exactive. Right, okay, so it is- I don't think we were evolutionarily
selected to wisely steward AI. No, I don't think anyone would argue that. So we were
evolutionarily selected to have hemispheres that do this stuff, and it created- In the same way,
I don't think we were evolutionarily selected to cause the Anthropocene and all of the problems
and cause climate change. So I think the problems and the solutions are both exactive to the
evolutionary capacities. Right, okay, excellent. Now that's a good reframing, because then the
question is, how much hope can be placed in the sapiential, the wise-oriented
exactations compared to, like, let's call them the power dynamic exactations, the technological
power dynamic exactations. And it's difficult to know where we- I'm not trying to be difficult,
I'm just trying to say, for me, it's like, where would we stand to ask that question? What would
be the place in which you see us being able to, like, where are we standing such that we can look
at these two and say, I can make sort of- I don't want to say objective, but a relatively neutral
evaluation of these two and say, here's how we can place hope here, because you're not just asking
people to place hope. I hear you saying, can you give me good reason to place hope? Is that fair?
I think, so, you know, my process coming to this with regard to global catastrophic risk
obviously involved recognizing none of the other species were causing global catastrophic risk,
and people with stone tools couldn't cause global catastrophic risk, and people with bronze tools
couldn't. So it was a relationship to human mind, our mind's ability to create vast economic,
industrial communication, educational governments, technological systems, the way those systems
in turn reinforce patterns of mind that lead us to a novel situation of self-induced global
catastrophic risk that is increasingly eminent, and then saying, what do all these different
risks have in common in terms of the patterns of human experience and behavior individually
and collectively, particularly collectively, that give rise to them? Because if we can identify
those generative dynamics, then we can say a future that is not described by these catastrophes has to
deal with these generative dynamics. And so we talked about the third attractor of like neither
a future defined by increasing catastrophe, nor a control response to that that gives dystopias
what's left. And so really it's a what are the necessary criteria of a civilization that could
steward the amount of technological power we have well. So then this is great, this is helpful.
I think Ian and I have been trying to point out what some of those underlying generative
dynamics are. Exactly. And then propose, Ian, I don't mean to put words in your mouth, so if I
say something inappropriate, please intervene, but propose these ideas of wisdom, correct
interest, cerebral, intra-psychic relation, correct distributed cognition, replacing adversarial
with opponent, bringing back love of virtue, love of the transcendental, pointing out that those
aren't just every fairy, they have an evolutionary provenance so we can depend on deep motivations
to empower them. But I sense that you're still sensing an inadequacy in this. Well, I think
at an individual level, these are good thoughts. Right. At the how do you have those define the
way AI is developed and rolled out and the way synthetic biology is developed and rolled out
and the way that NATO and Russia engage over Ukraine is different. So one is saying what would
more why, like is there a basis, there's a philosophical questions, is there a basis
in reality for intrinsic purpose or meaningfulness or sacred? Is there, are there different
capacities, maybe hemispheric orientations within humans to understand that better?
I.e., are there ways of developing wisdom that could steward power better? That's like the
philosophic and then developmental at the individual level. But then it's the, you pointed out the word
defection earlier, right, which is the defection from the wisdom that is directing the power that
can end up leading to these kind of slippery things. And you can never totally close that. But in the
time of stone tools or bronze tools, the worst thing it could do was way less bad than the
worst thing it can do now. So I'm asking for better thoughts on what would it take to develop wisdom
at the scale necessary to actually have a human, a continuing human presence on the planet that
doesn't destroy itself or totally suck? Well, I've offered an answer to that, I thought.
Okay. But my proposal is we need to basically co-opt and exact the machinery of religion,
because religions have been able to do, they've shown that they are proper distributed cognition,
collective intelligent machines that can fundamentally reorient civil, at a civilizational
level. They have a, they can do that for good or for ill, right? And that what we need is
something like that. And I'm not proposing that I'm going to start a religion, because that's
a ridiculous proposal. But that, so I'm saying we have done this in the past. Yeah. And of course,
nobody makes a religion. There's an algorithm. There's a way in which I'm sort of a hide and
gary about that. The sacred has to somehow break through the way the complicated has failed in
the face of the complexity of reality and speaks in a new way. And something is called to that.
And then we have something like, but it can't be like the, it can't be like the axial religions.
It has to be as different to the axial religions as the axial religions were to the bronze age
religions. This is the proposal I'm making. Okay, great. So this relates to what Ian said a few
moments ago when he said, if I'm getting anything out of this conversation, it's how powerful
something like Christianity must be. So you were speaking to this hierarchy of values and
the utility values at the bottom, which obviously is not how the world is oriented currently.
And some sense of the sacred at the top. We mentioned wisdom being something that
has a concept of restraint bound so that utility is not always maximized,
that power is not always maximized in service of something that is other than utility.
You're proposing that religion has served this function before and that something like that is
probably needed. Obviously, we know the history of why church and state have been separated. We
know all of the critiques of religion that are worthwhile. What do we imagine the
relationship to some sense of sacred that is developable, that creates something like wisdom,
that creates something like restraint and power binding, that creates something like increased
felt meaningfulness, increased sense of coordination that is other than game theory.
What might that look like? Because it probably won't be just religion as its own domain. It'll
probably be how it relates to the educational system and to media and even how it's encoded
in economics and what are some of your thoughts on what the criteria of such religion might need
to be and what it might look like and what the transition from here to there or its development
might look like. I really want to be really clear that I am not proposing the founding of a religion
or anything ridiculous like this because relevance is not subjective. It has to be co-created by
reality and religion has to be co-created by reality. There's a sense in which reality has
to disclose something to us. I just want to reiterate that contextualization. Within that,
what I've been trying to do are two related projects. One is to try and look for what can
be exacted from the past. I want to use that language very carefully and see some of the central
things that come out of that. These are both very long arguments so it'll be very compressed.
You take a look at what becomes pretty much the spiritual backbone of the West. Arthur
V. Lewis I think has argued this very well which is something like Neoplatonism. Neoplatonism has
this tremendous capacity to enter into reciprocal reconstruction with Judaism, with Christianity,
with Islam, with science. It does this at the beginning of the science. It has this tremendous
thing. I think Filler in his wonderful book, in his series of essays, has made a very clear case,
a very good case that what Neoplatonism is trying to get us to do is give up
a substance-based ontology. I mean substance, not just in the Cartesian sense but the Aristotelian
sense, that we think of the world. The most real things are spatio-temporal physical things
to which properties bond and that relations emerge out of these things. Neoplatonism is trying to
say so. No, reality is ultimately about intelligibility or we can use something analogous from
our modern thinking. We have to play with it though, information and this is inherently
relational. Intelligibility, information are inherently relational. So reality is fundamentally,
primarily relational but it takes a lot of transformation of individuals for to get them
into seeing the ground of being as that the relations have ontological. Don't think about
this temporally because that's a mistake but they have ontological priority over the velata,
the things that are bound in to the relations and that way you can ground intelligibility and
information as fundamental, well, I don't see any word I use in appropriate but fundamental
features of reality, even that word is inappropriate. And then what you see, and it's this sort of
grand unifying field theory of Western spirituality, then you see Zen gathering together elements of
Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism and also coming to a very convergent kind of,
no, no, underneath it, isn't. It's actually the interconnectedness and the interconnectedness
and time, relationality is the deepest ground and you have, you have like a philosopher in the
West like Heidegger trying to open us back up to that and then you have the Kyoto school in,
right, in Japan trying to bridge between this and then what that brings back, what that brings
up is the possibility of what I call the philosophical Silk Road. The Silk Road belonged to no one and
that allowed people to commerce, not only a commerce of things, but a commerce of ideas,
but they needed a lingua franca and it was sort of Neoplatonism from the West and Zen from the East
and then there also seems to be interactions with Vedanta and other things. And what it gives you
is it gives you, like nobody owns this, just like nobody owns English, but it gives people a grammar,
right, a deep grammar by which they can enter into these large-scale recreations of fundamental
understanding of human being in the world. And so I think that's a real possibility for us.
By the way, there's a long history of trying to bridge between, there's like 40 years of history
in the West of what's called Zen Christianity where people have been mapping Zen, this is something
that people are, now I'm not saying that the religion of the future is Zen Neoplatonism,
I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is these two could be brought into, because they have
important differences, they could be brought into a profound opponent processing that could be that
from which the acceptation can occur. That's that side of the project. The other side of the project
is can we build ecologies of practices? Can we build networks of communities like what happens in
the early Christian church? Can we get them integrated with our best understanding of
meaning-making, of religion? Can we build these communities? Can we build these ecologies of
practices? Can we network them together? And I'm invested and involved in creating that and trying
to get, can we get this and this going together? And the hope is out of that can emerge the possible
acceptation and it has to be as different from the Axial religions as the Axial religions were
from the Bronze Age religions. That's the proposal. It's a project even. Now notice what I'm not
saying, I'm not saying I'm going to make this, what I'm going to say is can I get the very best
of what drew everything together, draw it together, put it into a living community, living
ecologies of practices so that there's a possibility that the sacred could speak to us again.
That's what I'm proposing. I think the sacred is beginning to speak to us again. That's my
observation. Yes. And I notice one of the nice things for me is that a lot of young people are
very interested in my ideas and they're extremely dissatisfied with the thin gruel of if you can
call it a philosophy by which our civilization now lives or fails to thrive. So I think there's
a thirst for it and I think it can't be compelled in any way. I don't believe we can invent religions
at will at any rate. I think they grow organically or are founded by communities in a way that
we don't need to think about reinventing religions. There are religious traditions,
wisdom traditions, spirituality traditions that are very robust. I've become less enthusiastic about
a kind of spiritual sense that is sort of made up to do with, you know,
I don't want to sound patronizing, but there are some kind of almost pseudo religious cults that
are growing up that I think could be quite worrying actually because a religion carries with it a
lot of power. That's why it's one of the few ways in which we can exert power. Not we can exert
power, but power can be exerted through us for good. I'm not saying it couldn't be for bad as well.
That is part of what I'm saying. But if we're to think of the things that we really need like this
closely or more closely bound society in which we learn to trust one another and share values,
that's extraordinarily important. I can't remember his name, but I think a third century Chinese
emperor said for a civilization there are three things that are important. Guns, food and trust.
If you have to give up one, give up guns. If you have to give up another, give up food. But if you
give up trust, you cannot survive. And that is what we are losing very, very fast. There's a sort of
way in which people now think which is that if I can get away with it, I should. So in other words,
we're relying on external pressures, external constraints, external restraints on us. And if
they aren't there, then we can just do anything, which is not, obviously it's not any kind of
morality, but it's also very dangerous because at some point faced with that kind of philosophy,
it will be impossible to constrain and restrain everybody who wishes to do wicked things.
So I think that's, I want to just say a few things. It may take a few minutes, but
so I think it will provide many things. It will provide a kind of structure, philosophical framework,
a sense of a tradition through which we can re-experience something very beautiful,
beautiful, good and true in my view, which is what the greatest art of our civilization has
produced. And I'm not here excluding other civilizations as anyone who reads my work will
know I derive a lot from Chinese, Japanese, Indian and other kinds of cultures. So there's that.
And I think also there is something highly motivating, which is, I think it's very important
that we get away from the idea that we are simply passive here in this world, that we come into it
and certain things sort of are blasted at us and we are receptive or non-receptive to them,
rather like a photographic plate or a sound recorder. I don't believe that's the way it works.
And on a whole number of levels. The first is that I think we have, we have responsibilities on
several levels and this needs to be said because it's not known anymore. One is, and I know you
would share this, that the way in which we attend to things changes what there is to attend to.
And that means that we are, whether we like it or not, we have a moral responsibility to be careful
about how we use and how we dispose our attention because we can create bad things by attending
in a certain way or we can produce a good result by attending in another way with a different
disposition of one's heart and mind. So I think that's one. I think another is that we may actually,
in some sense, help to bring about, at a more cosmic level, a turn for good, for promoting the
sacred. So I didn't think, my model of whatever it is that we mean by the divine ground of being
is not just sort of sitting there passively, but that it is interacting with its creation,
the creation that it has grounded, and that it is coming to know more of itself,
and its creation is coming to know more of itself in the dance of evolution that the two do together.
This is really a whiteheadier an idea, but it's one I find compelling as I find much of
whiteheads philosophy deeply compelling. And I think there are other ways too that we can help
prepare things in a way which is, even if we don't succeed, is a fine project to devote our
lives to. So in the Lurianic cabala, there is a story of creation which is rather different from
the one in Genesis, but it begins with the divine being, the ground of being ends off,
bringing something into existence because ends off is essentially relational, the foundations
of everything are relational. And I believe, and I think you have said this too, that I
certainly think that relationships are prior to relata, relations are the foundations of
everything. And the relata come out of the network of relations at the intersection
points, we see things that attract our attention, there's a thing. So if that's the case, then
anyway, you'd expect this divine being to want to create something that was other than itself in
order to have a relationship with it. And if God is, as is held in almost all spiritual traditions,
love, then love needs to have another, and it needs also not to compel that other,
because it cannot love something that is entirely predictable and under its control,
otherwise it's not other at all. So that view of the cosmos, which I think is wonderfully
developed in Christianity through the idea of a God that makes himself vulnerable by a creation
that is free, either to reciprocate his love or not reciprocate it. I want to come back to the
Cavalistic story. So the first act of this creative God is not to stretch out a hand
and make something happen. It's to withdraw. It's to rein itself in so there's a space for
something other. That's called sim sum, which simply means withdraw. And then the second phase
is called sheparate hechelium, which means the shattering of the vessels, because in this space
that's been created, there are 12 vessels, and a single spark comes out of ends off and
lands on the vessels and shatters them. In fact, it only shatters eight out of the 12, so explaining
why would take me too long. So let's just accept that. And then the third phase in which humanity
according to the Judei tradition has a particular role that only it is capable of carrying out,
which is to repair the shattering, to couldn't repair. And the idea is that we are tasked with
creating again these vessels so that they are more beautiful than they were before they were
shattered. And the image that always comes to mind for me here is the Japanese art of Kintsugi,
whereby a piece of ceramics that is broken is repaired, sometimes with lines of gold,
and is considered more special, more precious, more beautiful afterwards than it was before.
Now, if it is true that we have the capacity to see how to repair things, and no other
beings can see that, and I think that is probably right, is no disrespect to the rest of animal
life, that probably we have this ability to see other things and see beyond and foresee things
in a way that they probably don't. So I think if that's the case, then we have a special role there,
and we may even have a role in bringing about the existence of God, because that may sound very
strange, and possibly blasphemous, but the way in which I think this works is like this.
We all know Pascal's Wager. Pascal's Wager was a simple one. Either there is a God or there isn't.
If there is a God, then it's very important that we should recognize and reciprocate our relationship
with that God. If there is no God, then it won't do us any harm to behave as if there was a God.
But I think there's a third possibility, which is McGilchrist's Wager, and it has the first
two of Pascal in it, but there was a third one, which is that maybe we play a role in the development,
the evolution, the furtherment, the fulfillment of whatever is divine. And if that's the case,
then once again, we have an incredibly ennobling obligation, which is to make sure that we do
help that good progress in the world. So on various levels to do with how we dispose our attention,
the role we play in repair, the role we play in furthering and bringing about the divine,
we can influence things. And we may not be able to stop certain specific wars or whatever, but
that's never been part of what is imaged here. The part of what is imaged here is that we,
like it or not, are gathered up into something that we have to respond to. And I believe that the
reason for the being life at all, and especially human life, is because whatever it is that is the
ground of being needs response. It needs that response. And while it can be satisfied by the
response of the inanimate world up to a point, what life brings, because I believe all life is
sacred, but also the inanimate is sacred as well. The difference is not that one suddenly
is involved with consciousness and the other isn't. I think they're both manifestations of
consciousness. But the thing about life is that it can respond enormously much faster and to a
greater extent, so that things can move instead of having to wait for this very slow, slow process
with creatures like us. There can be an acceleration of the evolution of the cosmos
and the divine being that grounds that cosmos together. So all in all, there is an enormously
optimistic, in my view, and real. And I'm a skeptical person in many ways, but I'm also
skeptical of skepticism when it rules things out that we should open ourselves to. And if I'm honest
about my thinking, my reading, my experience of life as a person, as a doctor, and so on,
I do believe that this is the way the cosmos is and how we relate to it. And that is surely
something that brings hope, brings dignity to the human condition. And it also takes the burden
of us of having to solve certain specific problems. I'm not saying we shouldn't try to solve those
specific problems. We must. But it's, in a sense, secondary. It's like the role of the
emissary is to get on and find ways of purifying the oceans. This is terribly important,
but it mustn't stop there. Because, as I say, you could purify the oceans, you could save the
rainforest. And the only reason we did that was because of our own economy and for our own flourishing,
we would have lost the main reason, which is because these things are powerful, beautiful, rich,
complex entities that have their value in themselves. They are intrinsic in their nature,
not of extrinsic use to us.
Go ahead. First of all, I share that vision in a lot of ways.
As I mentioned, Kabbalah comes out of the intersection of neoplatonism with
Judaic thought. But what I would like to try and afford and not make, and there's
a big difference, you don't make wisdom, you cultivate it. You don't do nothing,
you cultivate the conditions, and it has to take place, and it has to flower.
I would like to afford something that can work at the global level that needs to be addressed here,
given the novelty of the global level of the problems that Daniel has. So I'm trying to find
something that is properly pluralistic. So running through Whitehead and running through
Kabbalah and running through Sufism is this neoplatonic framework. And then running through many
things, for lack of a better word, I don't like the word, but the East is its end sensibility.
And then there's ways in which really helpfully they converge, but they differ. So proper
opponent processing between them is possible. And the idea is this could take on a life of its own
such that something could, well, it exact out of it, emerge out of it. That's what I'm proposing.
And so I think that's needed because we need something where, like the Silk Road, everybody
can participate in it. But the Christian can go on the Silk Road and then return with their
Christianity enriched. The Buddhists can go on the Silk Road and return, and Buddhism
enriched. But there's also something that's alive at a global level that is also affording
something new to be born. That's the proposal I'm making. I agree with you. And there was
nothing in what I said that suggested that it was restricted in its scope. Yes. In fact, I was
talking about the way in which we actually have power, which is not mechanistic and therefore
to do with the effects of individual actions in human beings. But it was a relationship with
the cosmos, in fact. And one of the great sayings, of course, is to live the change
or be the change you wish to see. And so in all these movements, I think there has to begin with
one's own orientation and one's public commitments. These two go hand in hand. And you can't create
wisdom. You can't instill wisdom. It's not like that. But you can follow people or admire people
or model yourself on people. We all do this whether we realize it or not. We have people that we
have thought exceptionally inferential and venerable that we don't somehow have rules about
how to be that kind of person. But we know intuitively there is this kind of a person
and we get moved towards what that is. And so, sorry, do you want us to come in?
Well, there's two things about that. One is, yes, there's empirical evidence supporting this
and the other reason that it is singularly most predictive of people aspiring and carrying out
an aspirational project, properly aspirational, not utilitarian, but I should be better than I am,
is the degree to which they have internalized the sage, internalized the whole model. That's the
thing. And that's the perspective. Exactly. And then the second thing is,
what Thich Nhat Hanh said, the next Buddha is the Sangha. I think there's a way in which the
role model doesn't have to necessarily be an individual. It can be a community in a powerful
and new way that is also something. We also need that. And if there's going to be regeneration
and tomorrow I'm going to Bristol to take part in the local futures symposium, the idea there being
that if there's a future for us, we must generate it locally. We mustn't rely on the global everything
to supply us. We must start growing our food locally and trusting and using the contributions
and gifts of those around us, not just through an abstract machine like Amazon. Now, I mean,
that may be difficult, but it's an important aspiration. And I think it's necessary too.
So we need to be balancing in the sense of opponent processing. We need to be able to
pick up the things that need to be done at a global level. But we also need to be modeling
that at the local level. And what we need to do is create the circumstances in which wisdom can
grow because it can't be made to happen. All you can do is stifle it or permit it. It's like a
gardener cannot make a plant. The gardener can either permit the plant to flourish or stifle it.
This brings up a place where I was wanting to go, which has to do with
more local religion. First, I just want to acknowledge you were kind of reifying choice,
that we're not just receptive beings here, but we have choice. And inherent to reifying choice was
obligation. And that obligation was not imposed from the outside, but was the result of a kind of
recognition. And I really like that. I think that's an important thing, that obligation,
wisdom, restraint, I think are all going to be critical topics. And as you said, we can't
impose that on people. We cannot mechanistically make it, but it can be cultivated.
To your project, the idea of a deeply respectful, giving the benefit of the doubt inquiry into the
previous religious, philosophic endeavors that had some success, and some kind of synthesis,
not homogenization, but a synthesis that recognizes that they might orient towards different but
meaningful things and holding those together useful. I think this is really good. And I am
appreciating that you said Western and certain Eastern things. But what comes to mind is that
both what we call the Western and Eastern traditions are very new relative to most of
sapient history. And there's a reason I'm saying this, it isn't just kind of like the
obligate point to point out that there's a global south and there's things pre-civilization.
There's actually a really important reason I bring it up is if we've had some hundreds of
thousands of years of sapient existence, and we've only had these kinds of religious,
philosophic structures for some small number of thousands of years, most of human experiences,
and this other thing, and a big part of it was that it was always local. And that means that it
wasn't trying to create a memetic structure that's scaled. And there's something intrinsic to
memetic structures that scale that goes along with techno-economic military structures that scale
that I think is worth exploring a little bit. You were mentioning in one of your talks that
intelligibility is not just about abstraction, where all the differences go away, being able to
notice uniqueness and instantiation and distinction.
Difference has to be as real as sameness, and that's the fundamental challenge to reductionism.
Reductionism says only what things haven't shared is the same, counts as real.
So there's something about scale, standardization, and reduction that go together very well. This
has been pointed at like this is deep to the post-modern critique. And wisdom cultivation is
always unique to the moment. It's not trolley problems, right? It's instantiated. What is a
good choice in this moment utilizing all of the capabilities, left hemisphere, right hemisphere,
all the chakras, however you want to think about it, and also unique to this person,
unique to this time and context. So I find it interesting that like almost every indigenous
wisdom tradition that developed in much smaller contexts where everyone had much more intimate
relationships to each other, rather than abstracted relationship where all Christian,
where all Hindu, whatever, that they were all animistic. And so in terms of like the Catholic
and Hindu conversation around is God transcendent or God eminent, they, if anything, aired on the
eminent side, right? That the Creator is indwelling within the creation. And if the Creator is indwelling
within the creation, maybe also beyond any part of it. So transcendent, not meaning elsewhere,
but beyond any aspect, but indwelling in each aspect, then any destruction of anything is sin,
is a violation of the sacred. There's something about airing in the direction of eminence that is
less dangerous. Airing in the direction of eminence, yes. And there's something about
also at the small scale, like we're talking, we're having a conversation, a lot of people are going
to get to see, but we're not necessarily taking people through a practice that is inducing the
kinds of states, the right hemispheric state where the numinous is there. That's right,
where the sacred is there, where the intimacy is there. And I don't want to violate something
I'm intimate with. There's something about the small scale that has high intimacy, high touch,
in which I'm not relating to the abstract concept of they're Christians, they're on my side,
they're not Hindus on the other side or whatever. I'm relating to this unique person and this one
and this one. It is inherently, I think, hemispherically different. I was also thinking about
so I'm curious how much you see hemispheric dominance having to do with scaling is one question.
I'm also very curious about, and I've had other friends want to ask you this,
if matriarchal and metrophocal cultures had any difference in this particular way given the,
is there a evolutionary difference in tending the babies and tending life at warrants in this way?
And then we come back to the challenge that we have global scale problems that have global
drivers. If the Chinese are, the US has to and because the US is the Chinese have, we have to
deal with that. But scaling, if it involves standardization, abstraction, and a loss of
instantiation is inherently part of the problem. So how do we get something that is profoundly
instantiated, profoundly unique, profoundly local, and also cultivate that in a way that
has the distribution that it needs? Yeah. I'm sympathetic to animism and one interesting
thing here is if you experimentally suppress the left hemisphere for say 10 or 15 minutes,
people describe things that they would normally consider inanimate as animate. So they see
the sun as animate moving across the sky and giving energy. And if you do the opposite and
suppress the right hemisphere, they see things that we would normally think of as living as not.
So people are like bits of furniture or like zombies or simply machines. So there is a clearly
difference now. I'm so fascinating. I'm a panentheist. And I think that's an important analogy
if you like, but it goes further than animism and it manages to bring together
eminence and transcendence. So pantheism simply says God is all the stuff that there is.
Panentheism says God is in all the stuff that there is and all the stuff that is in God.
I think that is a maybe we don't need to explore that too much, but I would say that is a very,
to me, important and sounds to me feels to me a wise way of thinking about the world. And would
also, if taken seriously, stop us fighting between religious groups and would stop us just spoiling
the natural world and would instill a sense of proper reverence. And there's nothing, of course,
in religion that says that we've got we've got to see ourselves over and against other people.
In fact, in many religions, your first duty is those who are not of your kind. I mean, I know
that's part of Zoroastrianism, actually, but it's also in Christianity. And that doesn't mean that
the history of these religions has not been a war between those who really understood the mystical
meaning of it, of it, and those who use this as a lever for power and influence and and for
adversarial approaches, paragraphs. So all of that. Now you said something else. How do we,
what was the first thing that you scale, scale? Yeah, the thing about scale actually brings me
to something that I was thinking when I was listening to your talk to the Consilience
Project or conference, which is that you made the important point that
what gives something a sense of reality and tells us something about itself is in the differences,
not in the sameness. But of course, we need to be able to aggregate things in order to be able
to live. We can't experience everything as new and original and unique. Of course,
have to generalize. And both hemispheres generalize, actually, but in different ways. So the left
hemisphere generalizes by, there's a feature here that they have in common, whereas the right
hemisphere generalizes by there being a sort of what Wittgenstein called a family resemblance.
So there being a general gestalt holding together of things. But what's really intriguing is people
think that because the left hemisphere is focused on detail, that it must somehow
not involve generalization and that because the right hemisphere sees the whole, it's neglectful
of the individual case. It turns out that to understand the unique case is very strongly
dependent on the right temporary parietal region. It's the right hemisphere that understands
uniqueness. The left hemisphere doesn't understand uniqueness because it's already categorized
things. As I see, it's another one of those and goes in that box. So there's a huge literature
on that and some of it that I reported in my various books. But the point there is that there
are two ways of thinking of the small, if you like. One is the tiny part that is a detail.
The other is the uniqueness of something which is not strictly measurable. It's how big is the
uniqueness of your wife? Excuse me, this is not a sensible question. And also in generalizing,
the right hemisphere doesn't generalize in the sense of trying to find a way in which it all
fits a known schema, but sees the bigger picture. Whereas the left hemisphere manages to get that
wrong by not seeing the bigger picture, but seeing lots of examples that can be generalized.
So the conflict between sameness or oneness on the one hand and difference and multiplicity on
the other crosses the hemispheres in a recognizably different way. And I think what's important about
union and division is that we need them both, not just one, but we need them to be unified,
not divided. So at the meta level, union trumps division, but it must not abolish division.
So we need, in our ontology, to be able to at least distinguish. But that distinction doesn't
mean there's an irreparable separation. And unfortunately, in the way we talk, we often
think that if we differentiate, we've completely divided and sundered. Whereas it's very important
to realize that distinction is enormously important to be able to discriminate differences is
what we have a mindful functioning of and how we come to experience the multiplicity of life.
But it doesn't entail us in a sort of abandonment of a sense of the togetherness as well.
Well, I'd like to reply to that and reply to both of you. And again,
and the argument I was making at the Consolian's conference is that intelligibility is actually
the complete togetherness of the integration and the differentiation. If you have different
Exactly. So that's good. Yeah. But there has to be both for there to be intelligibility.
We agreed then, yeah. Right. And the Neoplatonists were very much on about that the one is that
it is not the one of the numerical sequence. They're only using that word because they go on
and on about this is not the numerical one. We're talking about the oneness of
of integration and differentiation, which are very hard. There is no logical oneness between
them. There is the deeper oneness of intelligibility upon which logic rest, logic, logic presupposes
that deeper thing. And therefore, we're called to it. And then what they get to see we we were
Cartesian and we think the appearance reality distinction is just the inner outer the subjective
the ancient world has had a different way of understanding the appearance reality distinction.
It was the one mini, which is the problem we're talking about. And it and what it did is it said,
this deep reflection Neoplatonism on intelligibility and the one in the mini, the emergence up the
emanation down to completely enter penetrating. Right. What it came to in like the coincidence
of the opposites is this idea, right, that Scantia and to a Tiva, right, that you have to be able to
see the whole and every part and the part as properly participating in all over the whole.
You get the same thing in the Zen, not the same thing. Sorry, wrong word. That's a logical word.
You get something convergent from the Zen tradition in Indra's net, how everything is the
center of everything else. And that it's a different way of framing things. And I would also
say the transcendent and imminent have to be completely interpenetrating. And you see
late Neoplatonist like Nicholas of Cusa, and like Erogena proposing this, I'm worried about our
category of animism. Because for me, it sounds like us trying to capture this transjectivity and
this transjectivity and then stick it into substantial things, which I think is I'm worried
about that. For example, I don't think life is a property of an organism. I think it's a property
of an organism in relationship to its environment in a profound way. And so again,
I think we're agreeing and I'm just trying to say that I think that if we can teach people
sets of practices that get them to realize this is a deep ontological truth, then they will be
called to new ways. And we can't say what they're going to be, but they can be called to new ways
of bringing the small and the large. I'm not happy with even those words, the imminent and the
trans, but they'll be called to new ways beyond our current grammar for how to bring them into
relation. That would be for me evidence that the new religion is emerging.
What do you think about that? Well, I'm curious, because the term new religion is provocative,
and especially in the presence of there being existing religions that have billions of people
in them. I don't think you mean that has to replace or supersede those existing ones. I think
it can reify them. And I think we probably all agree that all of the religions have different
ways of interpreting them, some of which lead to holy war and some of which lead to sacred
responsibility in different ways. And so the question of, because it's very interesting, obviously,
Zen and Vedanta and Lurianic obelism and Christianity are culturally different historically,
mytho poetically, but you could say that there might be certain underlying structures they all
have to have to orient the human adequately. There's almost like a meta metaphysics that is
necessary, where does it get the relationship of the one and the many? Does it get the relationship
of the determined and the free? Does it get all of those things? And it might be that those
meta dynamics have both the capability of giving rise to new philosophic inquiries,
as well as reifying the versions of the existing ones that are
capable of being in harmonious relationship with the other ones and capable of being able to
understand and steward the power of our technology well, which I would say if a religion doesn't do
that, it's not adequate for the purpose of being able to orient humans in the world today to steward
the world. You almost sung that and it was beautiful. That's good. Yes. Sorry, I got into this.
So then I think one question I have for you, since you've been thinking about this project,
but for all of us, is how might we imagine the reification of the existing religions
in a direction that allows them to have something meaningful to say about ecological
overshoot and planetary boundaries and AI and synthetic bioregulation and the war in Ukraine
and whatever, to orient them to be able to play a role in the stewarding of the world,
in the development of the wisdom individual, but the stewarding of the world locally and
not just locally, because it's all that, how might we see the reification of those religions
and the development of new ones or at least new philosophic metaphysical systems,
the interface, and then how do we see the interface of those with the other systems
of human coordination? If I value things differently, does my economic system change?
If I have a different relationship to what is a good problem to solve, does my tech design
change? How does education and media change, since those are affecting the nature of human
mind so profoundly? So the reification of the religions, the development of new
philosophic traditions, but also the development of those, when we say you can't force it,
but you can garden or nurture it, how do you imagine being able to garden and nurture
the type of adequate wisdom moving forward in all these ways?
Can I just ask you a little terminology? You used the word reify and reification a lot.
He uses it positively. I know, but do you mean validation? Because reification to me means
making it a thing, and of course that's what we don't want to make it. So I mean,
signifying. Yeah, so when I was saying to reify, I mean to be able to interpret the religion
in a particular direction that is commensurate with what it must be, given the constrained
humanity faces. So there's kind of like a pragmatic forcing function on the metaphysics.
It's like ray in the respect, looking at it promptly. That's how I was getting it,
and you're nodding, so I think that's landing. What is the real interpretation is what the
scholars will argue on? So there's an interpretation of what does this really mean
that can be different? And also, as you said, we're not just painting meaning on the walls of a
meaningless universe, but there is a, no, there is actually something intrinsically real they're
pointing to. There is, but there's no one way as you were saying it. That's very important.
That's what I was saying is that there's something like, almost like how every personality, very
healthy, psychologically healthy people don't all become the same, right? As we become psychologically
healthier, we don't become the same. Cultures also wouldn't become the same, but they would be,
and the culture is almost like the psychology of the many. The religion could be thought of that
way. Yeah, but that's how proper pluralism differs from the relativism. Like think about,
let's use a biological analogy. There are universal principles of evolution, but evolution doesn't
say that all the creatures are going to be the same. It in fact tells you that all the creatures
are going to be very different and contextually sensitive, not only spatially, but temporally,
right? So there can be universal principles that predict why you must be contextually sensitive.
Yes. And I think that's the kind of thing I'm trying to point us towards. And then what you
can do with, I mean, I think Ian has said this week off camera and me too, I got a lot of people
that come to me and say, you've given me a language so that I can go back and re-home myself in the
religion I was brought up in. And then you can think of, and you can think about that
homing process is a much deeper kind of education than what we now have. It's closer to what Zach
is talking about when he's talking about education as an installment, et cetera. So let's talk about
that kind of education. And then we could properly empower people. Let's do a concrete example.
Okay, let's see the proposal I've been making, not just me, people like filler, a whole bunch of
people, I think all these people are wrapping into this in powerful words. But filler makes this
argument in one of his recent books. Look, really try to get, really, really try to get
that the trinity within Christianity is saying that relationality is primordial.
Really get it. Don't think of this as three guys stuck together. Think about them completely
interpenetrating, interconnecting, relationality, intelligibility, the logos, the reality,
the indwelling in people, the spirit. See all of that is deeply profoundly relational. Go back
and start to practice your practices that way, live that way. And then people are going to find
different things with relevant and salient in the world and their relationship to the world.
And it could open up the like it could switch switch people from the having mode
to the being mode. It could make a difference in right in their relationship to their spouses,
but also in their relationship to economic systems. Like you understand.
Okay. So I want to, yes, the pragmatic question I'm asking is, so let's say the Vatican calls you up
or and says, we agree, we would like to have a uniquely Catholic version of this. And maybe
we're stoked if there's a uniquely Muslim and uniquely Hindu kind of enlightenment of similar
types, but we would like a kind of Catholic version. How would you change the way we approach
our practices, philosophy, etc. Or let's say that the minister of the Department of Education
reached out and said, we want to implement K through 12 a wisdom development process.
I'm very interested to hear your thoughts on how could the institutions
start to actually implement wisdom development practices, practices, insights, philosophies,
such that rather than just we're compelling the person on YouTube.
See, so this is where I think it's different from Zach. I think we have to create enough
enough ecologies of practices within the community before a reformation of education
becomes possible. Because unless the lived normativity of the culture changes,
attempts to change the education will just be co-opted by the current machinery. I've been
education long enough to see how that works. Everybody gets you got to do stuff with the parents
and you got to do stuff with the culture. If the kids are getting trained for the market,
that has inherent limitation. So it becomes tricky because to change anything, you have to
change everything. So there's some sequencing. You can't start with one thing. You've got to do
lots of things together. Exactly. Which if you change the grounding that has led to the problems
we have will lead naturally to these things flourishing at the slightly higher level.
But how we do that has got to be through an implicit process. Because if we try to,
as I'm constantly saying, if we try to instigate the things we think are valuable into people,
we have not instigated those things. Instead, we've instigated a kind of chain of
thought, which is actually contrary to the way in which we... This is your very first book, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You cannot make implicit things explicit without damaging them.
Yeah. That's right. That's against criticism. Yeah. So Apollonia's argument was...
And this is Plato's argument too. You can't make people wise. You can properly,
again, seduce them so that they can come to love with them.
But I was getting on to say that really. I mean, all I was going to say is we can't do it by a
direct approach, but we can do it by a more implicit and less direct approach. And that
approach is actually, sadly, not original, but it is actually to start
re-educating, I mean, or educating, what I'm trying to say. I think we stopped educating
children about 40, 50 years ago. We started indoctrinating them and giving them information
and testing them on how much of that they've retained. But we didn't do the really important
things, which are relational. All the people who really inspired me and taught me did so by
their being who they were, and by the way in which the spark jumped across the gap
in the way that Plato describes in the Seventh Epistle, that this is how philosophy is done,
not by writing it down. I mean, mysteriously, Plato completely betrays our philosophies in the
doing this. So we need to reimagine what an education is. That would mean freeing up teachers
from a dead weight of bureaucracy. In fact, that's one of the very practical things that could be
done tomorrow, which would be go around universities, go around hospitals, go around schools, and look
very critically at all the superstructure of management and so on. And I reckon about 80%
of that could go tomorrow and nobody would suffer. In fact, there'd be a lot more money for doing
the things that we really want to do. We've become sucked by a parasite, if you like, which is
the externalization of the left hemisphere's drive for control, which is administration.
And so, I mean, that's a practical answer to the question. But also, we need, apart from
freeing up teachers to teach in a way that is individual responsive and alive rather than
just the carrying out of procedures, we need actually to, I'm sorry, give people back their
cultural tradition. They need to read literature. It's not fashionable to say this, but they need
to understand the last 2000 years. Otherwise, they don't know what they're doing here. They have a
very shallow rooting. So we actually do need to teach history, literature, philosophy, music,
all like not just IT, not just procedural learning, but actually creative, empathic
understanding of other people, not sitting in judgment on our forebears or on other cultures,
but in fact, trying to see our way into how they saw the world. Because then we'll have
a stupider than we are. And they might actually have seen something we've lost.
Okay, so I have a proposal specifically, more practically, about this, which is,
first, I mean, first of all, just put a pin in something. The problem we face, of course,
is the bureaucracy has wrapped itself around a pseudo-religious ideology that justifies this
tremendously. And so that's problematic.
It's a pseudo-religion.
Yes, very much. And what I would want to say is, I don't think we should have teachers in any
one institution. So if you look, I'll just take the West, but there's parallel things elsewhere.
You had the university, you had the monastery, and you had the church,
and they were all interrelated. And one is a knowledge institution, but it has reverence
for the wisdom institution, or that's the monastery. And then you have the church, and the church is,
oh, but all of these ideas and all of these philosophies have to be, have to transfer to
real lives. If I may just add, also hospitals.
Yes, yes, yes. And what I think we need is we need to have teachers in multiple kinds of
institutions that are acting again in this, this opponent processing with each other,
not adversarial. Part of the problem is, you know, and then the Protestant Reformation comes in
and splits them from each other, and we get all that, all that. But the proposal is, you know,
because what we have is we have this idea that teachers are only legitimate if they're in this
one institution, and that, and we have anybody out, I face this, but the stuff I do outside of
the university is like, why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? All right. And I know lots
of excellent teachers that can't find a home in the university because they want to do the kind
of stuff that universities aren't. They don't any longer do. Right. So I think we need to think about,
we need to think of a living system of teaching institutions where you've got people sort of,
but they, they're bound together in a field again where the relationality is important.
This is the pole of knowledge, this is the pole of wisdom, and this is the pole of life,
and they have to all, and we, and we have that. And I think that's also something that we need
to think about bringing back in terms of institutional structures that could actually
transform society in the way we're talking. And I'd like to just add, sorry. We need to
encourage and provide institutional support for people who are bright to oversee the whole picture
to some extent. That doesn't happen in our culture anymore. It used to happen, and it used to happen
in this university, but now everything has shifted here as everywhere else in the Western world
towards ever greater specialization. Now, while we need specialists, of course we do.
It's not one or the other. We need people who also are able to take the broad right hemisphere view
and see, crikey, look what's happening here. And, you know, I believe that what I've done,
if I've done anything in my writing, is to open people's eyes. That's what I'm writing here.
Of course, once you see it, you see what's going on here. And we, we don't have any institutions
that do that. But back in the 60s, I think the Rand Corporation and others sort of put money
behind people that they thought were going to be good. And they just gave them a desk and an
office and a Xerox machine and said, you know, do what you want. And out of that came a lot of,
you know, genuinely innovative creative thinking. And we need to bring that back.
Could I respond to that? Just one thing. So, because this is dear to my heart, because I
represent, I represent the discipline that is all about the synoptic integration of
across the disciplines, cognitive science, and trying to create the lingua franca between
neuroscience and information processing, machine learning, psychology, linguistics,
anthropology, philosophy, trying to do that. And the, I mean, there has been a turning,
an increasing recognition by some about the value of this, because the specialization went into
psychology in which we incentivized people to innovate something that nobody else had
discovered before, finding the effect, the new effect, right? And this is one of the driving
motivations of the replication crisis. Because if you don't pursue synoptic integration,
you don't work out your theoretical grammar well, your conceptual vocabulary is vague and
equivocal. And then the fact that you get empirical data is almost irrelevant, because
if you get a vague enough construct that isn't bound responsible to anybody else's work,
of course, you can find empirical verification. And so the replication crisis has basically
started to put up a flag, some people are recognizing it, that we need the synoptic
integrators as much as we need the specialists. So that's, I just want to put that.
You both made this point. And I think when people look at the arguments about all the things that
are supposedly getting better in civilization, some of which are, they relate to things that
specialization does well. And when we look at the things that are getting worse and heading
towards global catastrophic risk, they look at the lack of integrate, they arise from the lack of
integration across specialty areas. I think that's actually very important.
So you were speaking to that the existing educational institutions have a history
that we actually want to revive some things from. And that we've like, we've actually lost
some very important aspects. You were also speaking to not just the educational institution
as a single thing, but lots of them, you didn't mention guilds, but also there,
that education needs to be many institutions and maybe in light of the current situations
of the world, some new institutional design as well. But you said something else that I found
really interesting when you talked about cutting some of the bureaucracy and administration,
which was almost like an externalization of left hemispheric dominance,
what David Graber calls bullshit jobs, that there's this recursive relationship between
kind of left hemispheric process and building a world that is the result of that that in turn
conditions that and that kind of recursive relationship means we're not just asking,
how can we develop things that will give people more wholeness, more integration, more
numinous, more sacred, but also how can we undo some of the things that are excessively
making us hypertrophic on the wrong modes of mind. And I think we have to do both.
One good thing that might come out of a scarcity crisis is that we find quickly what are the things
we can dispense with and what we can't, at least if we maintain enough right hemisphere overview
of what's going on. But I fear that now the power is concentrated in the hands of
frankly mediocre people who occupy administrative jobs and that they're not willing to really
relinquish that power and it's their validation. But we do desperately need to do it and you're
quite right that what happens is in a culture like that, people are trained to go into jobs like that
and the people who fit the role best are not the people you'd want to be making big decisions
about our lives, but they go into it and the thing is a positive feedback loop.
So how do we break the positive feedback loops that orient us towards the futures nobody wants?
Or at least weaken them and how do we simultaneously develop other positive feedback loops? Because
they have to have some positive feedback where they won't be able to do anything that move us in a
recognition of the sacred, wise individual and collective governance. We did not answer that
question in full. We spoke to different elements of what it might need to entail, but the clock is
saying that it is time that we must wrap. There are questions that we can answer,
questions that we can offer a direction for and questions we simply can't in the nature of things
answer. So I think we've done the best we can and I'd like to think that we could shout this from
the rooftops and some people just a few might listen. So this is my kind of closing question is
if some people do listen and respond and there's interest, maybe we'll deepen this conversation
and explore some of these. How do we weaken the existing positive feedback loops? How do we
deal with the fact that power is entrenched in certain ways currently? There's a lot of
very interesting open questions we could get into further, but in closing thoughts,
I guess now for the listeners who have made it through all of this, any closing thoughts that
might give them some sense of orientation or agency in the relationship to all these topics?
Well, I'd say don't despair. That is achieving nothing whatever and it's bad for the soul.
So we have a duty to see what is hopeful and we're not asked, nobody is asked to do the impossible.
We can only do the bit that we can and that means doing things in our own life and with our own life
and furthering larger causes in the way that we are best in a position to do,
but we all have a role and I think one of the things I try to emphasize was that although
the materialist reductionist picture results in a vision of the cosmos as a heap of junk
with no meaning beauty or purpose and that we have no role here. I would,
you know, I'd go to my death to defend the opposite point of view that actually it is beautiful,
is rich and it is our pleasure, our duty and something we should be grateful for to help
further that. Yeah, I like that you said I would go to my death. That's the sacrifice and service
in the sacred. It needs to be a sacrifice. I would want people to hear that the love of wisdom
and the love of being are real possibilities that there are already people of good faith and
good talent doing this individually and collectively and that that opens up a possibility
for a kind of transformation so that as you fall in love with being again instead of the
reciprocal narrowing that we've been just been talking about and how we get addicted because
that's what addiction is reciprocal narrowing a reciprocal opening is equally possible.
This is what Plato proposed with the Anagaga and that that is still actual and there are people
and communities and practices that you can go to to actualize that to realize that and
there is nothing stopping you from doing that right now. May I make a hemispheric comment?
The left hemisphere closes down to a certainty. The right hemisphere opens up to a possibility
and so what you've really said is we need to further the processes of the right hemisphere
which are always expanding and exploring rather than those that close down to the
arid bit of something we think we know. I'm not proposing cognitive closure, I want continuity
of contact. I know you. That's why I said it. I think the concern about religions that many
people have actually has to do with people orienting to certainty with them and then
close-mindedness and holy wars and whatever as opposed to the exact opposite, holding the mystery
at the center, holding the unspeakable, the unknowable but the real and so there is an epistemic
humility that is built in forever. We spoke about this yesterday and you said don't despair
but we actually, I liked in our conversation you were saying when we are
actually open to the beauty of reality there's a sense of awe and a gratitude and
humility that comes with that but when we're open to the beauty of reality being harmed,
which is in the factory farm and on the war field and whatever, we're also
feel the suffering of others. It's such that it's overwhelming and the overwhelm in the suffering
and the overwhelm in the beauty are related because if the reality wasn't beautiful you wouldn't care
and both of them make you transcend your small self and both of them motivate
the sacred obligation. So there's something where the sacred obligation just comes from
seeing clearly letting yourself be moved by the beauty of reality and associated with that
the meaningfulness to protect it and the role of the new religion philosophy whatever
insofar as it can help people be more sensitive to both the beauty and sacredness and thus a
protective impulse towards reality is what I am hoping people take away. Excellent. Well thank you
both. Yeah, likewise. This is joy. It has been a great pleasure. Really a joy. The end of you.
