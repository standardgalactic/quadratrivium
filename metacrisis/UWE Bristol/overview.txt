1. **Philosophy and Science Dialogue**: The discussion highlighted the importance of a dialogue between philosophy, particularly phenomenology, and cognitive science. Hedi El Kholi and Merleau-Ponty's contributions to understanding perception and action were mentioned as examples where phenomenological insights have influenced empirical work in cognitive science.

2. **Empirical Work in Cognitive Science**: Empirical work in cognitive science, such as the study of perceptual phenomena like precipitation, often benefits from incorporating alternative conceptions that phenomenology can provide, leading to more nuanced and accurate models.

3. **Diverse Areas of Science**: The term 'science' encompasses a wide range of disciplines, each with its own methodologies and perspectives. While some areas like physics may adhere closely to an objectifying approach, other fields like psychiatry or certain branches of social sciences might integrate subjective experiences more directly.

4. **Cognitive Science's Objectification**: Cognitive science often employs computational or dynamic systems explanations of the mind, which align with a third-person perspective. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether this approach sufficiently accounts for subjectivity and personal experience.

5. **Incorporating Subjectivity in Cognitive Science**: Some argue that cognitive science should evolve to better integrate subjective phenomena and the first-person perspective into its framework. This would involve rethinking how subjectivity is understood and treated within the field.

6. **The Role of Science**: The panel acknowledged that the term 'science' is broad, and not all scientific disciplines fit neatly into a single definition. The discussion pointed out the need for an expanded view of science that can incorporate subjective experiences and the first-person perspective.

7. **Appreciation for Michael Wheeler**: The session concluded with expressions of gratitude to Michael Wheeler for his insightful presentation, which sparked a rich conversation about the interplay between philosophy and cognitive science.

8. **Acknowledgment of Limitations**: Michael Wheeler acknowledged his own limitations in addressing the complexity of science and its many branches, as well as the importance of considering subjectivity within cognitive science.

9. **Open Questions**: Despite the rich discussion, there were questions left unanswered, reflecting the complexity of the topics and the ongoing nature of the dialogue between philosophy and science.

10. **Appreciation for the Audience**: The session also expressed appreciation for the audience's engagement and the valuable questions that contributed to a deeper understanding of the issues at hand.
