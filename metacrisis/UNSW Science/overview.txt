Checking UNSW Science/George Whitesides â€“ The Origin of Life.txt
 George M. Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, suggests that life should be understood as a process rather than a specific set of chemicals or materials. He likens life to a flame, consisting of numerous reactions with various properties emerging from these interactions. According to Church, the focus on life as a process is more important than the exact chemical nature of those processes.

Church also explains that in life, free energy is utilized efficiently by breaking it down into smaller parts and using each part for different purposes, which is a contrast to non-living systems that often dissipate free energy as heat.

When discussing chemistry, Church points out that complex synthesis in chemistry typically involves a series of reactions where each step is conducted separately due to the incompatibility of conditions from one reaction to another. He suggests that the system he presented, which includes a network of chemical processes, could be similar to what might have occurred in environments like alkaline or acidic vents found in hot spring fields.

Church acknowledges the importance of geochemistry in this context and notes that our understanding of the chemistry involved is currently limited. He also expresses interest in discussing these ideas further with an archaeologist over dinner, indicating the interdisciplinary nature of the quest to understand the origins of life.

In summary, George M. Church advocates for a process-oriented view of life and emphasizes the importance of understanding the chemical reactions that underpin biological systems, particularly the role of geochemistry in providing the necessary energy and catalysts for these reactions. He also highlights the gaps in our current knowledge and the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to advance our understanding of life's origins.
