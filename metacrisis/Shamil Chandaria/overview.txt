Checking Shamil Chandaria/The Free Energy Principle and predictive processing.txt
1. Predictive Processing (PP) is a theory that explains how the brain creates models of its environment to predict sensory input, minimize free energy (a measure of surprise or prediction error), and update these models accordingly. It's a framework that can potentially explain a wide range of cognitive functions and pathologies.

2. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has multiple entry points, with the low road entering through inference and the high road through Markov blankets. Markov blankets are informational boundaries that encapsulate a system and its environment, allowing for the modeling of external data.

3. The concept of Markov blankets is powerful because it suggests that wherever you find such a boundary, you're likely dealing with a system that is self-organizing and autopoietic (self-contained). This principle can be applied across different scales, from cells to ecosystems, and even to social systems or the Earth as a whole.

4. A system that exists over time is by definition self-contained and has a Markov blanket. These systems must also manage thermodynamic entropy to persist, which ties into the idea of homeostasis and active inference as ways to resist the second law of thermodynamics.

5. The application of free energy principles to every space thing implies that everything that exists does so by maintaining a Markov blanket, actively modeling its environment to ensure its continued existence and survival against entropy.

In summary, predictive processing under the umbrella of the Free Energy Principle offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how systems, including the brain, interact with their environments to maintain coherence and survive over time, resisting the inevitable forces of entropy. This framework has broad implications across various disciplines, from neuroscience to ecology and beyond.
