Feelings are essential, but they can't dictate our actions.
You literally inspect each other with our emotions.
We came here for a special purpose.
Let the purpose unveil itself.
Knowing what our doing is the same thing as not knowing.
They're not just trackers.
I'm gonna wear this and it's gonna help me do the right thing.
Wellness Force Radio Episode 96 with co-founder of the Neurohacker Collective
and Cognitive Enhancement Specialist, Daniel Schmockdenberger.
How can we optimize our mind-brain-body system for increased quality of experience?
The highest stages of human development that we're used to seeing
that seems so many standard deviations beyond normal can be the new baseline.
It's clear that people have radically increased demands on their cognitive ability.
There are more things causing distraction and competing for focus,
while an increased demand for productivity.
But they're looking for creative productive flow states
where their cognitive capacities and their creative capacities are fully online
and they have the right emotional state that goes along with that.
What could a person of normal intelligence do with their life
if they fully dedicate themselves to developing themselves comprehensively for the benefit of humanity?
You are an emergent property of a universe that made you possible
and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing.
Welcome back to another episode.
My friend, I am your host, Josh Trent.
Thank you for spending your time with me here on the podcast.
This is where every week I'm bringing you access to global experts in all things wellness,
behavior change, and new technologies.
On this podcast, you'll learn from exceptional people
who are dedicating their lives to being a positive force for our physical and emotional wellness.
My intention with the show is that together we'll discover the connections
between our emotions and healthy habits to live our best life and enjoy the process.

What's up, my friends? So excited you're here
because we're about to have our hearts and minds expanded.
From our guest on today's show, Daniel Schmockdenberger.
Daniel is a systems designer, strategist, evolutionary philosopher,
and the co-founder of the Neurohacker Collective.
He leads a team of scientists, technologists, academics, and creatives
that are empowering individuals with new tools for optimized well-being.
Actually, discovered Daniel's work and the Neurohacker Collective Organization
through what seem like almost weekly conversations
and hearing testimonials from colleagues and friends
that have been using qualia, which we'll talk about on today's show.
It's this advanced cognitive enhancer that was allowing my friends
to be more present and get 10x more done in their lives.
So about two months ago, I decided to do a little N equals 1 experiment
in this channel of mental performance and cognition, which you'll hear about.
Now, we've had a handful of conversations about
new tropics and cognitive enhancement from experts on wellness force,
but today on the podcast, what you're going to get is so much deeper
than just how to use new tools to succeed in life,
but the understanding of the what and the how
to meet and overcome the sometimes overwhelming distractions
and attention drains from people and things.
I feel so fortunate to have been able to visit Daniel and the team
at headquarters in Encinitas because he has been studying
health and neurology for over 25 years, which led to qualia.
Now, early in life, Daniel was told there was no cure
for his diagnosed neurological and autoimmune illness
from either allopathic or complementary medicine.
But through advanced studies and applications in physiology
and pathology, he healed himself.
This led him to become a student of mind-body medicine
and an academic dean of a mind-body medicine college.
Once healed and highly educated, Daniel began working with larger teams
to solve global issues through what he calls an omnipositive
and omniconciderate system to found the Critical Path Institute
and the Emergence Project, a multi-organization think tank
dedicated to improving our global civilization.
I think you're going to love this episode as much as I did
because we're talking about the things that really matter
in our personal wellness and in our collective world.
You're going to want to go through this episode at least twice.
Head on over to wellnessforce.com forward slash qualia.
That's Q-U-A-L-I-A.
For everything we talk about on this episode, including my N-Equals 1 experiment
where you can try that out for yourself, which I feel so proud about
and which was a labor of love with a message I can really stand behind.
You're going to get so much value and growth in the next 60 minutes.
So let's jump in to this mind-expanding and emotionally engaging
in-depth conversation with one of the brightest and visionary minds in the world,
Daniel Schmockdenberger.
Daniel, thank you so much for coming on the show
and for inviting me to your second home.
It's your work, so you're here probably a lot.
Thanks for coming on.
Thanks for having me.
Today, we're going to talk about things way beyond just qualia,
way beyond neurotropics and neurohacking.
But what I'm really digging for is something about you
that maybe people haven't heard before.
You know, something that shows a little bit about your personality from your youth.
I know, actually, there was a space you came from in Iowa.
You were homeschooled and it was from the works of Buckminster Fuller
and David Bohm that you had learned from.
But how did that shape you?
You know, you're this young kid.
You're in an environment in Iowa.
There's meditation going on.
How did you pull from that?
And what did that mean to what you do now?
Well, I would say one of the big, unique, fortunate things of upbringing for me
was I was mostly homeschooled.
And I happened to be in one meditation community
but was in a number of different alternative communities
that focused on personal development, activism, different forms and fields of science, permaculture, right?
My parents were interested in evolutionary topics.
And so we got to live in proximity to different cool thinkers and evolutionary topics.
But the benefit of the homeschooling was my parents were wanting to do an experiment,
an educational experiment, which was before unschooling was a thing.
The idea was let's give them no-fix curriculum at all.
And expose them to as many things as possible.
See what their interests are and facilitate that.
And so this was my education growing up.
So I never had a fixed amount of spelling or handwriting or, you know, social studies.
So my spelling still depends on spell checker completely.
My handwriting depends upon the fact that I only use computers because I, you know, I never developed those things.
But I did get to dive into the sciences very deeply, very early in a way that was untraditional.
That is a way that would be the case for any kid if they were facilitated to follow what they were really interested in.
And so my early upbringing was all of the sciences, all of the different philosophic traditions and all areas of activism.
But one of the other really neat things was because I didn't learn them in the context of subjects, right?
This is social science, this is biology, this is physics.
I didn't even think of them in isolated ways.
So I'd be cross-applying principles from thermodynamics to astrophysics to cell biology
to looking at what is true about how reality works across all of these because I didn't think of them in segmented ways.
And I didn't think of them in terms of discrete laws of a domain.
What age were you when you started to be fascinated about systems and about how things work?
I mean, is there a time where you remember, like, I know when I was a kid, I took apart a telephone.
And my curiosity, I have this insatiable curiosity.
And I always wondered how things work, so I wasn't satisfied unless I took it apart and put it back together.
Did you feel like that in your life?
I mean, how would you describe your curiosity?
The same as yours and the same as any other kid's.
I maybe just had more facilitation.
So what happens with kids usually is they want to take apart the telephone.
They want to make lasers.
They want to do all kinds of interesting things, boys in particular, those ones.
But all genders, whatever they're interested in is going to be very deep.
But also things that are more esoteric.
Like, I've never met a little kid who at two, three, four years old doesn't ask questions like, why is this sky blue?
And we give them nonsense answers.
But to actually understand how the atmosphere works and how diffraction works and how light works
and how that intersects with the way the rods and the cones in our eye work
and what the subjective experience of blue compared to the actual objective experience of light scattering,
it's actually one of the deepest, most profound things to answer that well
that exposes them to everything from the hard problem of neuroscience to atmosphere sciences
and where they're going to learn about climate change and stellar formation in physics.
They ask, why is fire hot?
It's the same kind of thing, right?
Like, well, we can talk about what the photon releasing is
and how photons are exchanging energy in the hand,
but then why am I subjectively experiencing it as hot?
And so what happens is we just don't know, so we don't answer their questions well
and we instead steer them to things that we do know that are really not interesting,
like how to spell something or what the capital of something that is...
Then we turn them off to schooling.
We turn them off to learning, turn them off to their innate fascination of existing.
So when we look at the whole issue of the kind of welfare model dynamic
where we think if people are not capitalistically motivated, they'll just watch TV all the time,
kids are so intrinsically motivated to learn everything they can
and to build stuff and to create and to like want to go to work with mom or dad
and figure out how to do stuff, what happens is when we don't facilitate their interests
and then we actively force them to be interested in shit that's just not interesting to them
because it has more to do with memorization and getting it right
than actually understanding mechanics or dynamics in interesting ways,
we break their innate intrinsic interest in life and make them deferring to extrinsic authority
and then they just want to get away from that, which ends up looking like
play chill out as some form of, you know, escape from broken interest in life.
So the future of education has the ability to have polymath be the new normal,
you know, comprehensively developed multimodal genius as the new normal
because that's actually innate to every child of Riley facility.
Wow, and the way that I hear you explain things, this is something that I think is indulgence to you.
I mean, do you feel like your intelligence has blossomed from that environment?
How did you get through these stages of learning without going to this traditional schooling
and then maybe tell us a little bit about how you found this cure for your auto-degenerative disease that you had?
What was that like? Combine those two things for us.
So first part, one of the things that I was struck by early is I was studying,
I was very fortunate to come across the work of Buckminster Fuller early in childhood
and when you see as an older man, he's got 49 honorary doctorates
and everything from architecture to mathematics to engineering to most of fundamental sciences
and did novel work in those areas, like how does someone do novel work in mathematics
when people have done so much brilliant work specializing in that
and do novel game-changing work in architecture and language
and it breaks our normal idea of how specialization and human capacity works
but we see that being true in DaVinci and in Jefferson
and all the people that we think of as these kind of renaissance people
that are kind of comprehensively developed and it's easy for us to think that
they are just somehow genetically different
but one of the things that Buckminster Fuller as an older person would always stay in
like the beginning of his talks was that he became aware early in childhood
that he had slightly below average intelligence by the normal metrics of intelligence
that the other kids in school got spelling faster than him, got math faster than him
but some things happened, some specific experiences where he became interested
in figuring out what could a person of normal intelligence do with their life
if they fully dedicate themselves to developing themselves comprehensively for the benefit of humanity
obviously there were some unique things that happened for him to have an insight like that early on
but you see then all that he developed as someone who he would say, he was utterly convinced
that he had no endogenous capacities that were beyond normal but a development process
one of the things that's so interesting for me then was all the people who developed themselves
to the kind of highest degrees of comprehensive development said things very similar
and so it's clear to me that and then we dove very deeply into all of the evolutionary biology of the topics
and educational theory that the highest stages of human development that we're used to seeing
that seems so many standard deviations beyond normal can be the new baseline
What was the stage where you went through where you realized A that you had something that was neurodegenerative
I think a lot of people deal with illness, I know I had a lot of health issues when I was in my 20s and in my 30s
and was there a point where you realized A, I have something that I'm not exactly sure how to fix
and then what did that road look like for you to heal?
So I was in undergraduate, I was 18, I was rock climbing, weightlifting, healthy
and then had symptoms start kicking on very rapidly that were kind of neuromuscular joint type things
did not have a background in bio or health at that point was studying math and physics and other topics
and so I just started studying seeing all of the doctors and integrative doctors and various kind of modalities I could
and ended up figuring out a handful of underlying phenomena from inflammatory conditions
and the underlying causes in terms of toxicity and pathogenicity and things that were more causing it for myself
and ended up reversing it fairly quickly
What was the time period where it reversed?
Three months
Wow, three months
and the initial diagnosis was rheumatic autoimmune disorder that doesn't have a cure
so that was very neat and then I was free of symptom pathology for many years until 30-something
and again very rapidly had an onset of something and it was probably the same underlying susceptibilities
that hadn't been fully addressed previously, they got re-triggered by some new phenomena
and then it was a much more aggressive onset with more complexity involved
and that required me doing a much deeper dive into modeling it
Now, this was important so we look at something like MS or rheumatoid arthritis or ALS
or any kind of complex disease or psychiatric issues
but say we're looking at a rheumatic condition
we will see correlation between that rheumatic condition, statistically significant correlation
in things like a particular kind of toxin exposure
whether it's a heavy metal or whether it's an organophosphate or something like that
but we don't see one for one, it's not everyone who has it has had that exposure
or everyone who's had that exposure has that disease
but we see statistically meaningful correlation
we'll see statistically meaningful correlation with a bunch of different forms of subclinical infections
of Lyme's disease, of exposure to mold biotoxins, of gastrointestinal pathogens
but this ends up being very hard, the traditional medical model is looking for one disease
primarily having one pathway that is primarily causing it
and then it's going to have one chemical that addresses that pathway
but for our current medical approach it's good for acute cause issues
so this is why it's so great for emergency medicine
because the cause is actually pretty acute, it's pretty clear and you can address it
but where you have chronic diseases that developed over some period of time
and often times were multifactorial, they don't have one cause
they have multiple different causes, it's not even the same multiple set for different people
and there was delayed causation in terms of when the first thing happened
and you have some underlying pathophysiology happening before symptomology occurs
it's actually really tricky to figure out how that works
and you don't treat a cluster of symptoms called a disease
you actually have to see what is going on specific pathway-wise for that person
and be able to address that which is the future of personalized medicine
I feel like you were really supporting all the systems underneath
so that they're all happening in synergy
what did you do specifically and then how did the different nutropics
and the other supplementations that you were taking
I mean how did that work for you?
The reason that I got into nutropics
obviously as someone who's interested in learning
I was interested in intelligence and interested in everything that could optimize that
everything from meditation and technology assisted meditation like neurofeedback
to specific kinds of brain training to better forms of learning
epistemology for how to learn
but also biological enhancement of the hardware that learning operates on
so I had worked with nutropics and cognitive chemistry
but not as deeply or sophisticatedly because there wasn't a need
and often times an evolutionary need ends up driving
but when those illnesses first kicked on
in addition to having a lot of neuromuscular symptomology
there was cognitive symptomology
Was it massive brain fog that you were going through or what was it?
Yeah, so decreased cognitive capability
how many hours per day I had that were cognitively viable
and peak potency of cognitive capability
and for me for the things I was interested in
that was much more debilitating than physical debility
because at that time you're doing high-level thinking
so you had to be cognitively capable
it wasn't an option
and all the things that I really care about affecting require solving hard problems
and so my focus was alright well if I'm going to work on figuring out
these kind of underlying disease structures
so that I can get well to get back to my focus on the future of macroeconomics
and governance and infrastructure
and kind of large scale environmental and humanitarian things
I'm going to need a lot of cognitive bandwidth to figure these medical issues out
so first I'm going to focus on how to increase my cognitive bandwidth
so I'm going to apply the limited amount that I have to up-regulate it
you know that was my leverage in
and so that was a very deep dive in cognitive chemistry
and that looked like everything in the nutropic space
the brain-neutrant space
both kind of neurochemistry and neuro-structure
conectomic neurobiology, smart drugs
and looking at what are all the pathways that are involved
in various aspects of cognition
so short-term memory, long-term memory, speed of memory, digit span, verbal fluency
focus, concentration, you know all of those
modeling out where this is being mediated by
different neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, glutamate, dopamine, etc
or what the different pathways
you literally mapped out everything that cascades into one another
and understood how all these systems work for cognition
well I most certainly did not map out how it actually works
because I was looking at, you know, let's say I looked at a few hundred pathways
in the interactions
but I've got something like 10 to the 45 actual elements of complexity involved
what I'm doing is still reductionistic, just less reductionistic
I'm not looking at single molecule solutions
and especially not single molecule that are just overriding
an endogenous regulatory pathway by providing the in-chain chemical
but looking at what is everything we know from the various disciplines
about how those endogenous regulatory systems work
and where breakdown in those systems can happen
and then how to be able to assess what's going on
and then support it in a customized fashion
so I started with cognitive chemistry to have the cognitive clarity
to continue to work with a deeper neurochemistry, right
because I knew that was not an adequate solution
it was a necessary partial solution
which ends up being directly relevant to why this company exists
and this company is something that's deeply impacted me
I had six weeks of trying the product
we're going to talk about qualia
and for people that don't know before I tell my story
what are new tropics?
I mean there's a buzz out there
the wellness industry is like one of the top seven trends
or ten trends right now
for people that want to optimize the way they show up in their life
but if somebody hasn't heard of new tropics
I mean what is a new tropic?
It is not precisely defined in a way that everyone uses it commonly
but for the most part we can define a new tropic as some chemical
that enhances some aspect of cognitive ability beyond normal baseline
without meaningful side effects
and so if we're dealing with someone's cognitive capability
having dropped below baseline
we're dealing with pathology of some kind
even if it's subclinical pathology, right
this is cognitive decline from a pathology that we've defined very clearly
brain fog is generally not a clearly defined pathology
but it is actually dysfunction
so if we are correcting the underlying dysfunction
to just come back to baseline
that's very meaningful
we would call that kind of medicine
in the psychoneuro pharmacology
in the cognitive chemistry space
and it's not medicine that's well understood or well defined
but that wouldn't be no tropics per se
even though a lot of people use no tropics for that space
no tropics are really looking at optimization beyond baseline
how can I take some capacity and enhance it
now then you have smart drugs
so people who use Adderall not for prescription purposes
for an actual diagnosed dysfunction
but are using it for enhancement
and it will enhance something
whether it's Adderall that they're using
or Ritalin or Madaffin or Wellbutrin
or just lots of Red Bull
Red Bull is a smart drug
you could think of it that way, right
most of the time when we think smart drug
pharmaceuticals
some pharmaceutical that's usually for narcolepsy
or ADD
or some other kind of
actual cognitive decline disorder
like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's
people use Levodopa, right
as Parkinson's med for increasing dopamine
different things like that
so we usually think of some kind of
Pharma med
that is being used for an off-label purpose
for enhancing some aspect of cognitive function
and that does work
but usually
it works at the cost of
both long-term dependency
long-term side effects
and usually even fairly narrow up-regulation
with some real-time down-regulation
so when people are taking dopamine
for instance they're seeking to increase
dopamine production
but they're not looking at how
natural dopamine production
and dopamine regulation works
and so we don't want dopamine
relatively fixed from outside stimulus
we want dopamine to be able to be adaptive
to external stimulus as is appropriate
and adaptive to all of the other chemicals
that we're focusing quite complex relationships with
with serotonin, with GABA, with the other catecholamines
and we also want to look at the whole chain
of how dopamine is produced
to say if that chain
is damaged somewhere
the person is not getting enough
tyrosine or phenylalanine
or they don't have enough of the vitamins
that are involved in converting it
B6 or C or etc.
and that can affect other things
so dopamine might be the most obvious
and it might be affecting thyroid function
so not only do we not want to
just go straight to the in-chain chemical
and make them not adaptive
but we don't want to lose
the opportunity to optimize the entire chain
for all of those purposes
and so smart drugs are
not notropics, though
people who are interested are often
interested in both
we're interested in the notropic space
and we specifically have an approach to notropics
that is a complex system
informed approach to notropics
is how do we optimize
some aspects of cognitive psychological function
sustainably
where we don't have
meaningful side effects in real-time
like how they're all increasing focus
but creating irritability or anxiety
that would be a long-term downside
the short-term downside would be being anxious
or irritable while you're on it
or having empathy go down
or having digit span go down
while focus goes up
we saw Adderall doing something like
multi-billion dollar sales
off-label, right?
Off-label purposes for people doing
their tech startup or midterms for finals
with all the consequences associated
and we saw this exponential curve
and not just on that but on a lot of smart drugs
and on a 15 billion dollars
energy drink
market
it's clear that people have
radically increased demands
on their cognitive ability
and now to notifications
calendars being chocked full
I look at my brother's life, I love my brother
he has three kids and he has a full-time job
and he's doing all these things
and I look at him at the end of the day
and he's drinking coffee and I'm like there's gotta be a better way
because he is a mirror of the consciousness level
and of the aptitude that's out there right now
about people not really knowing what they can do
to let some steam off and to refocus their attention
so I had an experience that I want to share
and it was six weeks, your company was nice enough
to give me a great supply
it was incredible, I took a black label product
which is not on the market yet
but what happened is that I woke up in the morning
I did my meditation, I went through my normal process
and then I'm at CES
eight podcast interviews in one day
and going on stage to moderate a panel
and an after party
and at the end of the day I was still thinking like wow
I could actually connect with more people
and never in my life have I been able to be so focused
in the same way that I'm feeling you right now
where I'm fully present
I'm looking at someone's eyes
there's no response in me where I need to look away
or check my phone or not be here
and that's something that's unique
so beyond just the physical energy that I was feeling
I mean what is that product
tell us about qualia
tell us what I was using to be able to have that incredible day
so the first thing that we looked at was
you know as we were saying
we see this exponential rise
in products that people are taking
to enhance some aspect
of productive capability
or focus or energy or clarity
even if it is down-regulating other things that matter
even if it's causing dependence
because the demand is so high
the need is so high
so as you're mentioning with your brother and so many people
there are more things causing distraction
and competing for focus
while an increased demand for productivity
and the net result of those together
is very stressful, debilitating etc
so
most people know if they take caffeine
they can have increase in certain kinds of focus
but if they take it above a certain level
they're going to get then
downsides, anxiety, jitters
and if they actually pay attention
and say they use quantified mind
or Cambridge online cognitive assessment
or tools like that, quantified self-tools
they'll see that some metrics
of cognitive capability increase
and other ones actually decrease
in real time
so we've seen times where people have a lot more energy
but they're actually tasks switching so fast
that their follow-through is poor or things like that
so the first thing we did
was we said alright so people who are buying
off-label, out-of-all
or smart drinks or whatever it is
what are they actually really looking for
and what they're looking for most of the time
is not just
increased arithmetic processing
or increased verbal fluency or increased digit span
but they're looking for
creative productive flow states
where their cognitive capacities
and their creative capacities are fully online
and they have the right emotional state that goes along with that
so cognitively
there's a whole set of functions
short-term memory and long-term memory
and speed of memory
and digit span and verbal fluency
and task switching
and depth of focus
and attention span
all these classic cognitive metrics
but it's the product of those together
none of them on their own
and we actually really want to look at how do we lift all those together
along with more
internal drive
and internal agency
resilience to disruptive
external phenomena
creating almost a virtual buffer
around distraction
and things that want to pull you out of that state
whether it be flow state or just focused attention
there's 42 compounds
and they all work together in synergy
and if we have time at the end of the show we'll talk about how synergy
and the emergence process work
but the synergy of 42 ingredients
I've taken four brands of Neutropics
actually in the past two years
and what I loved the most
was that I could go all day long
but still not feel that
crash and I think people can relate to this
if they've had too much coffee in a day
that feeling of being jittery towards the end of the day
it didn't occur
how did you design that, how do these chemicals work together
they're not really chemicals right, they're more things that are
essential for us that are body needs
there's some brain vitamins in there
tell us about those
we started by modeling what we were trying to enhance
and as you were mentioning it was actually a lot of things
that are not necessarily obvious at first
but increased presence isn't necessarily
what people think of when they're going for a Neutropic
and they think they want increased focus
because often times increased focus will lead
to irritability if someone tries to distract them
so how do we have
this is a common Adderall thing, it's like if I'm just coding
it's cool but if someone distracts me I'm irritable
and I actually have a hard time task switching
how do we have more focus and more fluid task switching
and more presence wherever we are
well enough perspective
to then decide where we want to move our attention back to
that's a lot of complex functions together
so we started by
doing the cognitive and psychological modeling
of what we were actually seeking to enhance
the whole set of functions
and experiences and then how those relate to each other
once we had that modeled and that's
again that's novel right we didn't start with
here's a disease state
and here's the one thing that we're going to try and adjust
in that disease state or even here's an optimization goal
and here's the one thing we started with a synergistic goal
then we said
let's look at since we're not
modifying it via a meditation practice
which is totally valid or a psychotherapeutic practice
CBT or something like that
we're modifying it via modifying the underlying
What is CBT for people that might not know?
Cognitive behavioral therapy, particular kind of
effective psychotherapy for certain things
we're very technology agnostic by the way
we work with biochemistry
we work with neurotechnology so
transcranial stimulation
of various kinds, transcranial lasers
magnetic deep stem, electric stem, ACDC etc
Neurofeedback as well?
Neurofeedback, gut brain access work
genomics and genetic expression work
as well as psychological modalities
from mindfulness meditative modalities
to underlying shifting of meaning
trauma, somatic therapies
we're interested in anything that actually works on
some dynamics then being able to know
which things are going to be most meaningful for
an individual person and their goals
we'll get back to that but for this generalized purpose
what we were looking for is
once we understood what
psychological and cognitive functions
were seeking to optimize we wanted to see what
physiology mediates those
and so this is looking at everything from
the cell science and the neuro
chemistry, neuroendocrinology, biophysics
what's known about
all the things that have
causal relationships to short
term memory or to emotional resilience
so we look at all the pathways where some studies
have happened so we started with a structured
review meta-analysis of all the appropriate
spaces to say okay
acetylcholine processing affects
these things, glutamate processing affects these
things, these ion channels are involved in
right? So then we
end up having all these underlying
physiologic pathways and then
we model how those pathways
the entire pathway and the regulatory process
of those pathways work and how the pathways interact
with each other to create these complex
feedback mechanisms which is why we're
taking a complex systems approach
to
neuroscience and psychoneuropharmacology
once we modeled that out we said
alright we want to actually enhance not just
the level of some chemical, right?
acetylcholine but we want to enhance the regulatory
capacity of this whole system
so that when someone gets off it
they don't have dependence because they've become
we've just created a big exogenous stimuli
and now they're dependent on it but our exogenous
stimuli was actually working through their endogenous
their internal regulatory pathway to robust
the resilience of that regulatory pathway
so when they get off it the effects can be lasting
so then we looked at
how does the entire regulatory pathway work
and what can we do to be able to increase the
capacity of that system? I'm almost hearing from you
this was an inventory of everything that
works to make our cognition fire
now would you say that Neutropics decreased
the time from one synapse to the other that the message
gets through or is this more making it
a folding of the safety
of the axon and the neuron what is it actually
doing with the Neutropic in there between that
space between the dendrite and everything what's
happening there? Different things
so say you just look at
acetylcholine, right?
that one neurotransmitter for a moment
you can use something like Cooperzyne A which is
a very common Neutropic
which is what we call an acetylcholine
esterase inhibitor which was in the four hour
body, right? Didn't Tim Ferriss write
about that quite a bit? Probably
it's a common Neutropic
it's a plant derived Neutropic there are other
things that are also acetylcholine esterase inhibitors
both pharmaceutical and plant based
and what that's doing is there's an enzyme
in the synapse so you're talking about between
the axon and the dendrite right in the synaptic left
there's an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine
so you don't have excessive amounts of it
but it can also break it down too fast so you then
end up having deficient amounts. Would that cause brain fog
if it's too fast in the breakdown? It can
right but it's important brain fog
doesn't have one cause has lots of causes
it can be from neuroinflammation it can
be from deficiency or excess of lots
of different neurotransmitters so
but that could be one of them so
you can actually inhibit that
enzyme so the same amount
of acetylcholine that is coming out of the axon
can actually get across the synapse more
effectively. That's one thing you could do
if you're asking what's happening chemically
so an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor would be one
way to modulate the acetylcholine pathway
but once it gets across the synapse
it's going to be actually getting
uptaken in the postsynaptic neuron
in various receptors and so
we could modulate one of those receptors so we can
use things like racitams, paracetam
anoracetam etc to
up-regulate say the acetylcholine
uptake on the NMDA complex
that's another thing that we could do
is in combination or separately
we could actually provide more
choline donors or acetyl donors
for the body to make more acetylcholine
we could provide the
the catalysts like vitamin B5
and other things that help
take choline and acetylate it
so there's a lot of things that we can do
to affect the acetylcholine pathway
and that's just one pathway then.
There's two stages. Why taking
the first stage without food and then
waiting and then food with the second
stage. I had to play around with a bit to
find my perfect dose to where I could just be present
but then not feel like I was too much energized.
Tell us about that
why you break it up into two. I've never done that before.
Okay so qualia currently
has two bottles it's a program
that someone would take
just for clarity when we were
initially modeling what are all of the
chemicals that we know something meaningful
about that could modify any of those underlying pathways
we created a database of about 500 chemicals
and
looked at what the primary pathways
they affect, secondary pathways etc
and then we did a whole bunch of
customized chemistry
for this kind of cognitive enhancement goal
where we were working with
integrative
doctors running very deep
blood chemistry on people, clinical chemistry, brain scans
genomics etc
and then really working to optimize in very
unique ways. Once we saw
that we could get the kinds of effects we wanted
to get really profound up regulation across all things
they were interested in without any of the
kinds of down regulation we wanted to avoid
that we could assess
then we wanted to see what portion of that could we
do in a non customized fashion
so that we could bring it at scale because obviously
doing it that kind of customization at scale
is very difficult and there's some things that we
couldn't work with because they're so specific
to one set of genes that what would
be beneficial for someone is too harmful to
other people but we wanted to see which dynamics
can we work with effectively
across most of the population
so then that looked like a
bunch of internal product development, trials
iterations. We're using 23andMe
test as well? That was one of the things
some people
were giving us 23andMe
data, some people were giving us Illumina data
some people were going much deeper into
also looking at what's actually expressing
but we're also of course
just doing the analysis of
all of the journal articles
in various spaces and doing
structured synthesis
so the 42 is one
iteration. It's one iteration
that ended up being the right one for us
to come to market with first but it's going to change
soon. The reason it was two different things
two different products specifically some of the
ingredients absorb very well without food
since these are pills that people are swallowing
we could have things that were
injections I am or IV or intranasal
but there's safety and regulatory reasons.
It'd be hard to sell needles as well yeah
and
we don't have any moral
issue with that if it's actually safe and effective
we're just simply looking at what the
safest way for things to go
to the most number of people for the most enhancement can happen
and so since we're
having to do GI absorption
then some things really absorb
much better without food where they get to have
maximum surface area contact other things
really need food for absorption and to avoid
nausea and so in
the particular stack of chemicals we were working
with we ended up separating it for that purpose.
One of the things you have on your site that's fascinating
is your quote we believe fully optimized
human beings lead to a better world
people being productive and creative in whatever
that is theirs to do but in many ways
our modern world works against us
how do you feel like Neurohacker tell us
about Neurohacker and what are you doing to address
that to address the onslaught
of these weapons of mass distraction as
Gay and Katie Hendricks call it.
Regarding the quote that you mentioned from our website NY
Neurohacker exists is
obviously we're working on
individual human optimization how can
we optimize our mind brain
body system for
increased quality of experience
and increased capability and we're
interested in both increasing our quality of
experience means less
subjective suffering
more subjective happiness quality of
life right that's important because
human experience is intrinsically meaningful
and increasing human capability and
positive predisposition to
solve problems and create things of meaning
ends up affecting the experience of lots
of other people and non people
sentient things right and so far
focus is increasing the quality
of sentient experience across
everything then optimizing
humans ends up being key to that whole process
because most of the problems in the world that we
really care to change whether we're talking about
economic inequality or war or crime
or species extinction those are
problems that are being caused by human action
and human action is motivated by our
worldview it's motivated by
economic systems that predispose
certain actions it's motivated by lots of things
but one of the things that ends up motivating it
is our own biology
and so when we
realize that
empathy runs on certain neural networks it can be
biochemically up or down regulated
complex thinking requires certain kinds of
hardware right
neurophysiologic hardware interactions to occur
everyone who's had
their hormones very out of place or who's been sick
or very under slept knows that you can go
into biochemical states
that make certain emotions or certain cognitive
capabilities almost inaccessible
and that make other ones almost unavoidable
yeah and so while addressing
human physiology is not sufficient
for optimizing human
experience and capability it is necessary
it's a large piece and and how do you
feel like neurohacker as a company
what is your ethos with
solving this on a gradual basis because
these are massive issues that we're facing
I mean it's not like overnight things are going
to change but what are some of the enrollment
conversations that we can have with
people that we care about that not only
can use products like quality on new tropics but
they can get behind this mindset of
having increased empathy and
compassion for people we're built to be in a tribe
Jason Silva talks about this in brain games
how there is circuitry in the brain
that actually wired us to care for other
people in other tribes because that's how we would survive
that's built into our structure our A's
our C's our T's our G's
when you talk about how do we share the value
system now you're talking about
affecting people's software
right actually affecting
belief structures value structures
understanding structures which also predispose
experience and behavior so if we think about
people's worldview and their memetics
as kind of human software and that can be
affected through education through psychotherapy
through media right through what you're doing
media is affecting human
software directly and then we think of human
hardware as human physiology
which not just medicine
addressing dysfunction but we can think of
kind of biooptimization addressing
optimized predisposition
then we can also think about the hardware and the
software of the collective we're infrastructure
where how we meet our physical needs
in relationship with the physical planet so
transportation, agriculture, water, energy
production, materials, waste
are the hardware of the collective
and our social systems economics
governance, law, language how we
have collective agreement fields for how we do
decision making
in
beyond individual decisions is the software of the collective
the hardware and the software
of the individual and the collective
represent a
taxonomy
that is necessary and sufficient for understanding
human experience and human behavior
and so not neural
hacker but our
the think tank that gave rise to neural hacker is focused
on all of those quadrants and what has to
happen within a particular time period
to move us off of the current self-terminating path
that we're on as a species
and into a really viable path that is not only
not self-terminating but that
absolutes the unnecessary causes
of human induced suffering
and optimizes quality of life potential
now and ongoing for all life
and neural hacker is addressing one part of that
a big part of our emotional health
comes from how we feel in our body
and how satiated we are throughout the day
I mean it's hard to treat other people well
and think good thoughts if you're walking around
hangry one of the best ways to cure satiety
and satiation is to
add in powdered collagen to your drinks
your waters and into your foods
I use perfect supplements collagen
it's sourced from 100% grass fed cows
that means there's no hormones
pesticides or synthetics because
these are healthy cows that eat grass
while the sick cows eat corn
so beyond these healing powers of collagen
for digestion and joint health it also has
20 grams of protein and two scoops which
helps to curb appetite and increase that satiety
one of the cool things about this collagen
is that there's individual packets you can mix in
water and you know what it tastes like
water I mean all of a sudden my glass
has 10 grams 20 grams of protein
and all the health benefits of having this
non-gmo pasture raised collagen
in my bloodstream so don't walk around
hangry pick up your grass fed collagen
feel better in your emotional body and your
physical body every day it's part of the
wellness force radio bundle and it's heavily
discounted just for you click
over to perfect supplements dot com slash
the wellness force to save 10% off
the already discounted package and get more
wellness in the process
the elevation of consciousness through
biological optimization so if we're taking
care of ourselves I mean there's an adage
out there you can't fill up someone else's cup
if yours is empty if you're on a plane you have to
put your mask on first how do we do
both how do we become either
physically financially or just ahead
how do we get ahead in life and take care of
ourselves while also
I believe there's a term that you have
to be considerate to other people
how do how do we do this and how does
supplementation and nutrition and products
like qualia plug into that to being
omni considerate
think about this
if I ask you who you are
you'll tell me something
but if I say wait
who are you without plants
and you think about it and you think well who would
you be without oxygen and atmosphere you wouldn't exist
who would you be without the plants that produce
the oxygen atmosphere you wouldn't exist
it's actually the emergent property
of a biosphere that made you possible
that was mediated by plants
and they were mediated by insects and microbes
and a whole bunch of things right
and so you can define yourself
without thinking about the atmosphere
and plants but it's a misnomer it's a wrong idea
because you actually don't exist
without all of them
you are fundamentally interdependent
with the whole rest of the biosphere
not just biosphere but the whole universe who are you without gravity
it's a nonsense question
right who are you without electromagnetism
it's a nonsense question so you are
an emergent property of a universe
that made you possible
and you're still fundamentally interconnected with
and interdependent with
the whole thing so
if you think of Earth as actually
you zoom out and you look at it from the outside
space shuttle picture and you see that it's this
tiny tiny little bitty organic
spaceship
traveling through this vast cosmos that's
very inhospitable place
and you realize that on this
tiny little organic fragile
spaceship together
everything in there is interconnected
profoundly inexorably interconnected
and the idea that there's this place called
away where we can throw our trash
and these people called others that we can
bomb and it's beneficial to get their resources
whatever the engenders
their enmity back whatever the trash goes
is affecting the air the water that
everyone is
engaged with
we have a level of
technology that gives us
global influence in everything that we do
when we're talking here and the
headphones that we're talking on have plastics
and metals and
silicates etc that came from almost every continent
that had people and supply chains around
the whole world that were involved that took resources from the Earth
in ways that were
fundamentally unrenewable cause
massive problems
extinction level problems for many species
and then turns it into trash on the other side
we're doing these seemingly benign behaviors
like buying stuff that is actually
affecting this little spaceship that we
live on in ways that make itself terminating
very quickly we have a level
of population that we never had
it's been an exponential rise
since the industrial revolution
and a level of impact per capita within
that population that again
is exponential that cannot
continue in this way
but we also have the technological capability
to make fundamental changes where we don't
have an exponential growth society
where we don't have an economic system
that requires year over year exponential growth
on a finite planet which how the fuck would that make any
sense to do an exponential growth economy
forever or a linear materials economy that turns
nature into trash on a finite planet
and what's interesting is if you look at nature
everything has a life cycle
everything comes up and everything goes down
so there's 2500 year old bristle cone
pines I think that are on the Earth
but at some point they'll perish
there's no such thing in nature as
continual unlimited growth
it doesn't exist
so how do we address this here
I'm not saying that capitalism is wrong
or that socialism is wrong or right or any of that
what I'm trying to address is
the way we're conscious in our life
and the way that we take care of our biology
through supplementation through nutrition and exercise
how does that key in to the neuro hacker
mindset so we joke sometimes
that you can take qualia
as a performance
optimizing
technology
to go do
whatever
meaningless thing you might have been doing
climbing a corporate ladder for a company that is
mostly net harmful to life in the planet
and to your own existence
and we really hope you don't
but there are so many people who are actually
wanting to create very meaningful pieces of art
and science and humanistic connection
and are actually at the limits
of their emotional resilience facing
the world or at the limits of their ability to
muster their energy and focus to do the
difficult but meaningful things that are there to do
those are the people we most want to affect
and then the people who are
currently not engaged in what would be most
meaningful for them we want to help
empower them to switch
I think there's someone listening and they're probably
feeling oh my gosh he's so right
I am doing something that I know on some level
is probably hurting other people
or it's probably not in my best interest
what does that look like for someone to change
what are the practices
or what are the mindsets that they can instill
to first just be aware of the fact that
what they're doing is not in line with who they are
and then secondly what's the first few action steps
they might take it's a deep process
and we could have a future
time if your listeners were interested
dedicated to things like what does the future
of the world look like in terms of the future
of economics beyond
the current sensation of capitalism
the future of governance beyond the current
sensation of representative democracy
the materials economy the future of medicine
we could get into that we could also talk about
what it looks like transitionly at a macro level
for society and what it can look like transitioning
for individuals one thing I will say
just as a
as a partial offering towards this question
is
when people ask intrinsic motive
questions so they ask questions like
if all my financial needs
were already met in perpetuity
what would I do they start to move
in the right direction of what would be
innately meaningful to them
when they ask if I could
actually
direct the Gates Foundation funds
what would I do with it so they think about if I had a lot
of resources what would be most meaningful for me to do
so I'm not looking at
gaining like winning in a competitive
system I'm looking at
if I've already done that now what's actually
interesting to do this is
these are clarifying questions that are important
when they ask what problems in the world bother
than the most
those are things that are theirs to actually do something about
what touches them the most
those are the things that are theirs to
actually help protect and proliferate
I feel like there's so many phases of technology
I just got back from CES
that are nudging people in the right direction
of conscious living of being more aware
of how they're feeling in their body and what they're doing
with their mind and their space
and there was a previous video we'll link in the
show notes and it was from The Hive
and it was a profound talk it was an hour and a half
I think of just some of the most intelligent minds
going over some of the most interesting topics
and one of the things you talked about
was the Internet of Things
measure the entire natural and built world
commons in real time to allocate
resources tell us about
what the commons are and then how that Internet
of Things might actually allow us
to solve some of these big issues
in the world so why do we still
burn coal for energy anywhere
as opposed to renewable
energy sources like solar and wind
and etc well we
have said for quite some time
that solar is just not quite cost effective yet
well
this one that's not true anymore in terms of
having rich grid parity but even like why
would that be true well
we could build a coal plant
for less initial
dollars and
get coal moving into it and generate more
watts per dollar a little bit more watts per
dollar than a solar plant until recently
but in the
process of doing so the coal was
releasing a huge amount of mercury
into the atmosphere and water
so much so that the large fish species
have mercury levels that are
well beyond any previous safe levels
that then again are put in
neurotoxins and you know
biotoxins of all kinds
and putting
zinc oxide nitrous oxide sulfates
into the atmosphere that are doing mountain top removal
mining to get the coal that are damaging the ecosystem
in so many ways and
damaging human health directly right
well what's the cost of that if we actually
had to fix it if we counted for it if we looked
at what is all of the harm that comes
to humans from those environmental toxins
what is the total cost
of the medical bills of that and how do you
even count the cost of lost life and cancer
and children and etc
and then you said well
let's say someone can burn coal but they can't
leave the commons right which is
that which affects everybody
the natural world commons is
a metaphor for everyone is a common
world right that which is common
to all of us so the natural commons is the natural
world the built world commons
is the built infrastructure that we
all participate in
but let's particularly focus on the natural world
commons for a moment so
with the coal example
most of the cost right the actual
negative the cost of burning coal
the company doesn't have to pay for
it's externalized
to the commons in the form of
damaging ecosystems, extincting species
externalizing
medical bills to future generations
so everybody else pays for it
now their profit margin goes up
because they
move the cost somewhere else
that's called externalization
well if we said we can
burn coal but you can't leave the commons
net worse so the same amount of CO2
has to be in the atmosphere afterwards so whatever it takes
to scrub the CO2 out of the atmosphere
scrub the mercury out
mine it in a way that is regenerative
the whole ecosystem you have to use the technologies
to do that well the cost
to do that would make coal something like
four orders of magnitude more expensive
and solar would have reached grid parity the moment
it was invented and so
it's a nonsense
economic system that is actually
an extinctionary economic system
that not only allows but incentivizes
externalization of harm to the commons
that is what led to coal
making sense over soil right
and so many other things
like that similar we can
we can look at that
say we look at any
species extinction issue
that's been a result of destroying habitat
or poaching or whatever a whale
swimming in the ocean
is worth nothing on anyone's
balance sheet economically
it's part of the natural world commons
we can think of it that way it has its own balance
sheet right it is a part
of nature's balance sheet we just don't measure
those balance sheets and we don't care about them
in any way that we have metrics associated with
but if there is a fishing boat
that can do whaling that whales
a million dollars in whale meat
in Japan or somewhere right where that's
a part of the commodities trade so that means
that there's a million dollars of incentive to kill the whale
and none to leave it where it is
which is why we have been extincting species
at the radical rate that we have
cutting down all growth forests over fishing the oceans
is because everything's worth something to us
commoditized and dead and not otherwise
the commons the balance sheet of the commons
we don't measure and so we just
steal from it right we externalize costs there
and we take its assets and the more
we can take the assets of the commons
and externalize our costs there the better we're doing
in capitalism what would it look like
for technology to measure this inventory
for the commons so that everyone can win
how do we how do we use tech to make a win-win
when we look at the commons and inventorying
all that so the key thing that has to
happen then in the future of macroeconomics
is that we have to make sure that
what we're incentivizing people
and companies and countries right
what we're incentivizing agents to do
is omnipositive so we're not
giving anyone incentive meaning they
get ahead economically
by doing something that is fundamentally
harming other agents or harming the commons
otherwise we're continuing to cause
the problems at the deepest level by
incentivizing them based on what our accounting
systems right based on our value systems
and so what we need
is to incentivize things
in relationship to how omnipositive they are
which means you have to measure everything
affected not just a few of the things
but measure everything affected internalize
all of those positives and negatives
into the value equation
and then incentivize things accordingly
so to the degree that we make
incentive
of any agent
more close to perfectly aligned with the
well-being of other agents in the commons
is the degree to which the economic system becomes
a source for solutions to everything
rather than a source for problems to everything
the internet of things is growing exponentially
I follow the work of Peter DeMondis
and the XPRIZE
how do you see a neurohacker growing into someone
that can be not just at that level
of XPRIZE but also like how are we going to make
the tricorder how are we going to solve these big problems
with that what do you feel
about the future what are you excited about
for the future of neurohackers?
Neurohacker's goals specifically
are comprehensive
human optimization
and so this
includes assessment
includes
therapeutics affective technology
and includes the interpretive
platforms that can do customization
personalization and so
the way to address brain fog
or anxiety or MS
for different people is different because they have
different underlying causal mechanisms going on
so we're interested in the assessment
diagnostic system so right now neurohackers
not doing medicine it's doing
direct to consumer optimization
we're doing fundamental research that is
related to being able to advance medicine
whether that happens in this company or an associated company
but how to basically
synthesize all the diagnostics
that exist
where we don't just look at individual
biometrics in relationship to a fixed
reference range but we look at the resilience
of those biometrics when stressed so we're looking
at the homeostatic resilience of the system
not just current homeostasis
and we get to look at each of the biometrics
in relationship to each other to understand
complex intercausal patterns
and so we're looking at
how we interpret and synthesize all
diagnostics developing new systems of
diagnostics that provide higher fidelity
more meaningful data more affordably more
ubiquitously more frequently
the right in AI interpretive platforms
for being able to make appropriate
sense of that and then the ability to vet
all the affective technologies
to not just this is effective for this disease
or symptomology but for these pathways where
we can look at which pathways are involved
for individual people
and how they're weighted
to then be able to have really personalized
biooptimization and then beyond
biooptimization you can also personalize
people's psychotherapeutics because
the kind of psychotherapy that's necessary
for anxiety if it came on from
an acute incident of trauma
in adulthood versus
if it was something that was there since childhood
there are different kinds of psychotherapeutic processes
just like there's different kinds of
processes for similar symptomologies
so how do we customize everything that is
meaningful to optimizing human experience
and capability how do we
vet it for what's actually effective
understand what it's effective for
synthesize it personalize it and do
that progressively better
at scale this is the dream
dashboard I think everyone has been
looking for where we can get all of our
wellness effects data our blood testing data
our 23andme we can get our ubiome
our gut microbiome on there we can get everything
for activity tracking having a dashboard
we can just check in with ourselves as
a mirror of mindfulness and figure out
how can I do one percent better today
I think sometimes people get caught up in
the tracking and the tracking becomes like
what device am I going to get or what system am I going to use
or what supplement should I take and all these different things
and they get lost because the intention
behind all of it to just be this
biologically optimized human that's the
intention that people need to be following
you know people are listening and watching like don't get caught up in
the device quality is an incredible tool
it's not the golden ticket that's
going to heal your life however it will
support you and all those systems you were talking
about so you can make those good decisions
and you might find your golden ticket who knows
so in leaving our show today this has been
so much fun I want to ask you seven
questions and they're really fast so people
get to know you okay the first question
is what fascinates you the most I mean
we already know that you have a high level of intelligence
when it comes to biological systems
but what about the brain fascinates you the
most as it regards to neuroplasticity
the way that the brain can shift and mold
and change what lights you up when you think about
neuroplasticity so interestingly
our team just did
a structured review
of all the literature on
neurogenesis
so adult neurogenesis specifically development
of new neurons
and that
there's a lot that's known about specific neurotrophins
NGF, BDNF, GDNF
that support the development of new glial
cells, new neurons etc there are
things regarding
the development of new neural
stem cells and the differentiation of the stem
cells so we did
a literature review of everything known in the
space and then started looking at what
the relationship between all the mechanisms
that regulate neurogenesis are
and the evolutionary biology of why
humans have as much neurogenic capacity
as we have we're also doing structured
review of everything on
the
how to remove senescent neurons
so neural autophagy
what is a senescent neuron? Old neurons that are
no longer functioning as well they're not
serving us anymore and neural protection
and new synaptic development
neurodevelopment and synaptic genesis as well
as synaptic cleaving so all of these
things are neural remodeling right brain
remodeling so how does
how do we get rid of old
brain cells that are not functioning well and causing
dysfunction develop new brain cells develop
new connections between them develop new
algorithms on them
and so this is when we see
the kind of learning that can
happen in early children that is not
available in adults where adults
learn a language and they keep an accent
and children can learn multiple languages not have an accent
because the kind of
neural restructuring neural plasticity
that's available we are
very interested in being able
to develop technologies to help
advance the field of what's possible
for ongoing
adult neural restructuring and this is
for anti-aging specifically in
the brain side and not
just in terms of longevity
and just neural health but
also ongoing
increased cognitive capacity
that is fascinating we're definitely going to
have to have another conversation about the brain
just one hour straight about the brain
now when you look back on your journey has there
been one point where you realize wow
I learned one of the biggest
lessons about my own personal wellness and it
could have been at any stage in your life was
there one or was there many where you thought
you know what this really affected my wellness
and I know how to take better steps next time
so many rather than
speak to one because
so many things in terms of how to take better
responsibility for my relationships and almost
every time that I ever thought there was a
difficulty in a relationship that was someone else and
learned how either it was actually
me or the degree to which it was someone
else I set up that dynamic or elicited or
didn't create enough discernment take
responsibility there and in physical health and
emotional health and in finance and
you know if you want to look at something meta
across all those it would be
really profound empowered
self-responsibility
but not just responsibility
for my own
well-being integrity and quality of life but also
responsible for the way I impact the whole
what would you say to somebody who's
experiencing anxiety I dealt with anxiety
a lot in my 20s
to the point where I would not go out
for days
someone's feeling like that they're listening
what are some things they can do in addition to
to taking a smart
or having a healthy regimen of exercise
what else is something that people can do as a
first or second step when they're going through
kind of paralyzing anxiety
the first thing I would say is
I feel you
I've been there
I know how
scary and crippling that can be
one of the things that is trickiest about
anxiety about anything it can be
a relationship ending
or money or
getting on stage or whatever
and then if that anxiety ever gets
to a high enough point that it gets scary to us
then we start
any source of anxiety
like normal stuff that
happens we become hypersensitized
to our own sensations of anxiety then we
become anxious about it and then we get in these feedback loops
and so then we become scared of
going to situations it will be scared of
then we notice a little bit of fear and go
oh shit is that thing going to happen again right
and so panic attacks are where that just goes to zenith
and then we can get
afraid well it's never going to end I'm going to be stuck in this forever
which becomes the ultimate fear and then depression
kicks in
first thing I would say is
I've worked with a lot of people
in
panic attack disorder and generalizing anxiety disorder
and seeing people shift from
decades of these situations
through different mechanisms different modalities
but it is addressable
that's the first thing I would say is it is addressable
you need to find the right solutions
they are not one right best solution for different people
some people
have gut disorders and you can feel that you've got
gut disorders and you address the gut disorder
and the gut brain access optimizing makes
a tremendous difference
there are other people where just addressing
the meditation side of it
will make enough shift
that they have the energy to start addressing other things
other people there were
those cognitive loops
that are going on where they are afraid of their own symptom of fear
cognitive behavioral therapy
will actually address those cognitive loops
quite quickly so there is different modalities
that can be effective
try them like take responsibility
for working at it
and if some are not working
then don't make a generalized
assessment that nothing will work or nothing works for you
or your anxiety is particularly different
or worse it's not just keep working at it
what if someone just wants to increase emotional intelligence
I mean what's made a difference for you
from emotional intelligence
how do we grow that
besides just making it a point to connect
like here we are we're connecting today
and I made it a focus that was my intention
before we sat down to connect
but for somebody that's not in the regular practice of connecting
or being present
what does that look like in the first one or two
or a handful of steps for them to be more emotionally present
one practice I'll share
there are many important ones
but one simple extremely powerful one
is practice looking at the world
through other people's eyes
really deeply
so if you are
upset with a
partner or a friend or a family member
step out of being you completely
step out of your background
your history or perspective
and really try and be them
and say with their history
with the things that they value
with the ways they've been hurt with the etc
and without knowing what your actual intentions were
how you came across to them
what is it like
why are they feeling what they feel
why are they asking for that
are they upset are they
and you know you've got it
if you grok exactly
why they are feeling the way they are
and you're like wow I would totally be there too
if you're like no they're still in their position
I would such and such differently you haven't got it
because you're not being them
you're being you in their physical position
without actually getting their inner experience
a lot of the work that you do is
kind of serious in nature I mean you're solving some big problems here
at Neurohacker but what do you do for fun
and what's something in your life that just
cracks you up I mean what's something that makes you laugh
my wife
makes me laugh
consistently it is one of the
great fortunes of my life
so I'm very fortunate in that way
I think everyone should
pay attention to who they surround themselves with
and have people that uplift them
in various ways and also work
to uplift everyone around you so that
you know people who are uplifting are engendered
to want to do that so that's one thing
can you share one thing that she might do
that really cracks you up the most one of the reasons
that we are together
is very
very balancing for me she's a
extremely embodied playful
person and so
waking me up in the morning she has different characters
and she's just basically talking in different accents
playing and entertaining me
most of the time
the wellness force community do to support you
to get in this real conversation
like they've been involved in today with us
around doing things that matter to them
on a fundamental and on a moral level
but also taking care of their body
what does that look like for them and how can we support
Neurohacker three things that come to mind
first is
go to
Neurohacker.com
check it out read about it see if you are interested
if
the product that we currently have
is interesting for you try it give us feedback
if it is positive for you
share it with people that's awesome it is a first
product we have many more products
this year that are coming out and then a lot of things
that are going to take more years and a lot of research
and development
to be able to generate but our goal is ultimately
developing everything
that is
most leveraged and meaningful for
mind-brain optimization it's a huge task
we need a lot of support in it and actually
engaging with the current offerings is one of the things
that helps us to grow so I would say check it out
if it's useful to you awesome
if it is not a right fit for you product-wise
but you still are interested in what
we're doing and just kind of follow
the information awesome so that's one way
another way is
since our goals are ultimately
you know we there's
one meta imperative
that we all share which is how do we optimize
the quality of life for all life right
we all share elements of that
so up-regulate
how you do your part of that and that
helps synergistically with everything
that we care about and that we're doing
third thing I would say is
if you are specifically interested
in the future of human capacity
human wellness
psychiatry psychology
biology and the extended
future of civilization projects that we're working on
and you have
resources that you'd like to add to that
whether it's scientific capacities
or specific business organizational
skills or resources of some kind
contact us
my last question for you is really profound
because you have such a depth
in your life you've come from
a place where you're meditating as a kid
and you've created so much and what you're doing with neurohack
or I so connect with
but with all that said I mean what is wellness
to you how would you define wellness in your life
as we were mentioning earlier
our direct personal
experience is intrinsically
valuable independent of anything
that it affects
right the universe
is experiencing itself
through our experience of it
and so wellness is the depth
and
the choice and the profundity and the beauty of our
experience that's part of it
and what we do
that affects the experience of everyone else
everything else
is also fundamentally part of wellness
of the whole that we are inextricably interconnected
with
so optimized human wellness is both
depth of experience
and depth of meaningful contribution
capacity and orientation
for meaningful contribution
that was definitely the most unique answer I've ever heard
thank you so much for coming on the show

so thank you so much for coming on the show I really appreciate it
thanks for having me this was fun
and thanks for coming in for what you do for educating
and supporting and empowering your community
you made it to the end of the episode
and that is a great thing because I'm going to share with you personally
how much this interview and qualia
have impacted me so far
in 2017 I also want to give you
a few key takeaways from the show
if you're listening on your phone just tap the show artwork
and you'll be able to go right to
wellnessforce.com forward slash qualia
that is where we're going to have all the links
and downloads and the directions for your n equals one
experiment with qualia in the show notes page
if you just want to begin today
you can go directly to neurohacker.com
that is N-E-U-R-O-H-A-C-K-E-R

enter code WF10
and start the process
it's no surprise that all human problems
including stress and overwhelm and anxiety
or disease are universal
even San Diego, San Antonio, Delaware
or even France
I think it's safe to say that our current industrialized
society does not come without a bombardment
of notifications, tasks
and calendar appointments
I think you can relate when I say that in 2016 especially
I found myself becoming more of a slave
to my phone than a master
I even started to notice it with my friends
where they'd be looking down at their phone as I was speaking to them
and I know you know how that feels
because it sucks when someone's
not fully present so beyond the cognitive
effects I talked about on the show
after taking qualia now for almost
three months I can share with you that
I just feel more present
in the moment and that is something that
can't always be quantified it can only be
felt so if what we talked about on the show
today inspired you to give it a shot
in your own N-E-U-R-O-H-A-C experiment
head over to the show notes page
and give qualia a month test drive
to see how your mind and body and emotional bandwidth
will improve when you're done shoot me an
email or even during the process
message me josh at wellnessforce.com
let me know how the journey is unfolding
be sure to use your discount code
WF10 that's WF10
to save you a nice chunk of money
on the qualia as well
so the top two takeaways
from today's show the first one that hit me the most
was from Daniel where he mentioned
a fully optimized human being will lead to a
better world yes it's true
if you're walking around stressed or with brain fog
or overwhelm it's gonna be more difficult
to treat other people as you want them to treat you
so by seeking your own optimization
and empowering your own wellness
you're actually giving gifts to the people around you
and next was curiosity
I mentioned on the show how I've been
insatiably curious for most of my life
specifically with this podcast
I think my curiosity drives all the questions
where I dig so staying connected
to that curiosity that fundamental spark
in all of us from when you were a kid
to this very moment has been
such a force of wellness in life
so do not lose that curiosity spark
the next time you're feeling curious about something
dive in this is your sign
so now there's one thing left to do
when you turn off the episode and step into life
and that is to go out and create an amazing day
for you and the people you care about
so until I see you again real soon
I'm wishing you love and wellness
