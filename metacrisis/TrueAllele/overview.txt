Checking TrueAllele/Bayesian Belief Update.txt
1. **Positive Test Interpretation**: For a positive test result with a disease prevalence of 0.1%, there's a 99% chance the result is a true positive and a 5% chance it's a false positive.

2. **Bayes' Theorem Application**: Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our beliefs about the presence of the disease given a positive test result. This updating is done by multiplying the likelihood (probability of the observed test result given the disease or no disease) with the prior probability of having the disease.

3. **Odds Formulation**: Bayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of odds, which is useful for understanding the impact of new data on our pre-existing beliefs or priors.

4. **Likelihood Ratio**: The likelihood ratio (LR) compares the probability of observing the test result under two different hypotheses: the disease presence and the absence of the disease. In this case, the LR is 20, indicating that the data (a positive test result) are 20 times more likely if the person has the disease than if they do not.

5. **Prior Odds**: Before observing the test result, we had odds of 1 in a thousand that a randomly selected individual had the disease.

6. **Posterior Odds**: After observing the positive test result and considering the LR, the updated odds are 1 in 50 (or 2%) that the individual has the disease, given the prior odds of 1 in a thousand and the LR of 20.

7. **Data Focus**: The focus is on the observed data—a positive test result—and all inferences must be based on this outcome. A negative test result is irrelevant for updating our beliefs since it was not what we observed.

In summary, even with a highly sensitive test (99% true positive rate), the prior probability of having the disease significantly influences the posterior probability after observing a positive test result. The likelihood ratio helps us understand how much the new data should change our beliefs, but it does not change the fact that we cannot be certain of the disease status with just one test result, especially when the prior probability is low.
