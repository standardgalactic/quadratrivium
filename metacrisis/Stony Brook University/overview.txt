1. **Bayesian Surprise and Novelty Seeking**: The concept of Bayesian surprise can be understood as the epistemic affordance or attractiveness of novel stimuli, like a lever that has not been pulled before in a game like "Yellow Submarine." This principle drives scientists to explore new hypotheses and conduct experiments that reveal information, similar to how animals might explore their environment for food or mates.

2. **Scientists as Perpetual Explorers**: Scientists continuously seek novel experiences (high surprise) to update their beliefs about the world, much like a brain acting as a scientist would. This is akin to an iterative process of belief updating based on new evidence.

3. **Evolution as a Scientist**: Evolution can be modeled using similar principles of Bayesian inference. The dynamics of population genetics are analogous to a Bayesian model selection process, where phenotypes (the physical manifestations of genes) are updated based on their fitness in the environment. This view aligns with concepts like universal Darwinism and sees natural selection as a form of Bayesian belief updating.

4. **Reproduction as Information Sampling**: Reproduction can be seen as a mechanism for sampling new genotypes, which is an information-seeking behavior at the level of evolution. However, the relationship between reproduction and epistemic affordance requires further exploration and detailed analysis.

5. **Evolutionary Dynamics as Learning**: The mathematical framework used to model evolutionary dynamics (like the Fokker-Planck equation) can be interpreted as a form of learning or inference, where the population density encodes the posterior beliefs about phenotypes given the environment's selective pressures.

6. **Natural Language Processing and Evolution**: The same mathematical structures used for tasks like structural learning in natural language processing (e.g., Bayesian model selection) can be applied to understand population dynamics in evolution, suggesting a unified approach to understanding information seeking across different scales and systems.
