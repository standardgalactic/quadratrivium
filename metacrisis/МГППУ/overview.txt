1. The question about what is innately inherited in humans that enables long-term structural learning is a significant one, highlighting the importance of hyperparameters and learnability.
   
2. Structural learning, or how to grow different hypotheses and explore new model spaces, is a major challenge in machine learning and statistics, involving the exploration of model space to find better models and then selecting among them based on expected free energy or adaptive fitness.

3. Evolution has likely found efficient ways for exploration of structure spaces, as seen in genetic algorithms, which may themselves be products of evolutionary pressure.

4. There is a vast array of AI systems, from neural networks to decision trees, but human intelligence seems to rely on learning much of what we know during life, indicating that the essence of intelligence might be simple and general.

5. The discussion suggests that a more basic, general approach to intelligence could underlie all specific models in machine learning, allowing for the development of a wide range of capabilities through interaction with the world and adaptation to environmental rules.

6. Professor Fiston's visit to Moscow was appreciated by the audience, who are grateful for his insights and clarity on understanding the human brain. His thoughts on learning, acquisition, and providing structures necessary for adaptation have been thought-provoking.

7. The audience expressed gratitude to both Professor Geoffrey Hinton and Professor Tali Fiston for their contributions to reducing ambiguity about how our brains work and for the engaging discussion.

 The discussion revolves around the concept of information geometry and its relation to biological systems, particularly in the context of stochastic differential equations and attractors. Jeremy England suggests that any set of such equations with an attractor, if left for a sufficiently long period, will exhibit complex behavior reminiscent of self-organizing random attractors in a non-equilibrium setting.

The idea is that systems with more constraints or longer equations require more complex models to survive and encode a larger volume of states. This necessity for complexity in both the system and the brain's interpretation of it (as described by a generative model) leads to the conclusion that biological attractors must be deeply structured, reflecting the long information paths the brain traverses as it moves through different belief states.

In neuroscience, this is related to theories that resolve uncertainty in decision-making. When an organism is uncertain about what action to take, it experiences negative affect, which can manifest as anxiety or stress. Conversely, when the organism's way forward is clear, it feels good, and this clarity could be linked to certainty about what to do, which is also associated with dopamine activity in the brain.

The discussion also touches on the importance of understanding these concepts not just for theoretical reasons but also for practical applications, such as therapy or interventions that aim to alleviate stress by reducing uncertainty and providing clear paths forward. Simon Lough points out a potential paper or literature in Russian that might provide further insights into this topic.

 In the discussion, the concept of generalized synchronization and its implications for communication, culture, and learning among multi-agents was explored. The idea proposed is that the most efficient way for two individuals to communicate would be if they become effectively the same person, sharing the same actions and intentions, which could be facilitated through attentional mechanisms or a shared language. This concept can be extended to a group of agents who must learn a shared generative model to communicate effectively, leading to cultural dynamics where teaching and learning occur as a skew product structure.

The discussion also referenced the phenomenon of feral children, individuals raised without human contact, to illustrate the importance of shared models and theories of mind in language development and social interaction. The absence of such interactions can lead to impoverished language skills and a lack of understanding of others as distinct entities with their own thoughts and intentions.

The conversation touched upon the work of Andrei Belevtsev, a neurologist who studies autism and its relation to theory of mind and communication. The discussion highlighted that the human mind, including our capacity for language and social interaction, has evolved over millions of years, and these abilities are deeply intertwined with our social nature as a species.

The conversation ended on a productive note, with thanks given for the insightful discussion following the lecture.
