 Alan Watts, a philosopher and writer, discusses the paradigm shift that he believes humanity is on the verge of experiencing. This shift would move us away from the Cartesian paradigm, which has dominated Western thought since the 17th century. René Descartes' distinction between res cogitans (thinking substance, or mind) and res extensa (extended substance, or matter) has led to a view of the world where the mind is seen as a separate entity from the physical world. This dualistic perspective has underpinned the scientific method and our understanding of consciousness as merely a product of the brain.

However, Watts argues that recent scientific observations and phenomena that cannot be explained by this mechanistic view are increasing, signaling a crisis in our current understanding of reality. He suggests that we are at a tipping point where the old paradigm is becoming untenable and a new sense of consciousness as a more integral part of the universe is emerging.

Watts believes that this shift will involve a reevaluation of many aspects of our lives, including our relationship with nature and technology. He also posits that poetry can be a crucial tool in helping us transition through this change, as it encourages us to experience reality in new ways and to see the interconnectedness of all things.

In essence, Watts is saying that we are at a juncture where our understanding of consciousness, reality, and existence itself is being fundamentally challenged and reshaped, moving beyond the limitations of the Cartesian dualism. This shift promises a more holistic and integrated view of the universe, where mind and matter are not separate but deeply intertwined.
