In this lecture we will be seeing some of the identities of regular expressions.
So these identities of regular expressions are important when you solve some problems
related to regular expressions and also if you are giving some exams like gait these identities
are important because sometimes you get direct questions based on these identities.
All right so let's get started. So here the first one says that phi plus r equal to r.
Now what does this mean? So here phi is used to denote an empty set so that means if you do the
union of phi and r where r is any regular expression then you get back the regular expression r.
So plus is used to denote union. So the union of phi and any regular expression is the regular
expression itself. All right that was simple and straightforward so let's come to the second one.
So here it says phi concatenation r union r concatenation phi is equal to phi that means
if you concatenate an empty set phi with a regular expression and if you also concatenate
a regular expression with a empty set phi and you perform the union of them then what you get is
an empty set phi. All right so now let's come to the third one here it says epsilon r equal to r
epsilon equal to r. So in the last lecture we have used this symbol to denote epsilon but let's
know that this symbol and this symbol is also used to denote epsilon. So here it says that if you
perform the concatenation of epsilon and any regular expression r or the same thing if you
perform the concatenation of r and any epsilon symbol then what you get is r itself the regular
expression. All right let's see the fourth one the fourth one says epsilon closure equal to epsilon
so this is very simple if you have epsilon and if you perform the closure of that then what you
get is epsilon itself and this is important this says that the closure of phi is not phi but it is
epsilon so if you have phi and if you perform the closure of this phi then you get epsilon symbol
okay now let's come to the fifth one this is very simple union of two regular expression
is a regular expression r plus r equal to r that was very simple okay so now let's come to the sixth
one the sixth one says r star r star equal to r star so this means that if you perform the
concatenation of the closure of two regular expressions then you get the closure of that
regular expression as the result so we have two regular expressions similar ones r and r
and we take the closure of them and then we do the concatenation of them then what do we get
we get r star okay and let's see the seventh one this says that r r star equal to r star r
so this basically just means that you can write it in this way or this way concatenation of r and
its closure is equal to the closure of r concatenation r so that is what it means and let's come to the
eighth one this says that r star and the whole of its star equal to r star that means if you have the
closure of a regular expression and if you perform the closure of it again then what you get is
the closure of that regular expression itself okay now let's see the ninth one this is important
here it says epsilon plus r r star which is also equal to epsilon plus r star r equal to r star
now what does this mean here you see that we have r r star and here we have r star r so we
already proved in number seven that these two are the same so what does this r r star mean
so this r r star means this is the closure of r and if you concatenate it with r what you get is
r plus so I've already explained what is r plus in the previous lecture so r plus means the closure
excluding the epsilon symbol okay so here we get the r plus that means the closure excluding the
epsilon symbol now we are doing the union of the epsilon symbol with it that means you are
adding the epsilon symbol to that so if you add the epsilon symbol to r plus then what do we get
we get closure of r I hope that was clear to you because r plus was closure excluding epsilon
so if you just add epsilon to it you get the closure okay so now let's come to the tenth one
here it says that p concatenation q and the whole of its closure concatenation with p is equal to
p and then the whole concatenation of q and p its closure so this is something you just have to
remember it okay so now let's come to the next one here this also you have to just remember it
it says that p plus q whole closure is equal to p closure concatenation q closure and its whole
closure and it is also equal to p closure union q closure and its whole closure okay
and then the last one says p plus q concatenation r equal to p r plus q r so you can remember it
this way here you have union of p q and here we have concatenation of r so it is just like
multiplying it this r inside so here you get p and this r p r and this plus is retained over here
and then q and this r q r so this is the way you can remember it and also in the same way r
concatenation with p plus q that means p union q is equal to r p plus r q here also you can just
remember like you are multiplying it inside r and p r and p plus then r and q r q so this is
just the way to remember it so these were some of the important identities of regular expressions
that you have to remember so i hope this was clear to you thank you for watching and see you in the
next one
