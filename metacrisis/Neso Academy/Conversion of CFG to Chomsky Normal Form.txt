In the last lecture we have studied about Chomsky normal form and also I have discussed with you
the steps that we have to follow in order to convert a given context-free grammar to Chomsky
normal form. So if you have not watched the previous video I suggest that you watch it first
before you proceed with this one. So in this lecture we will be seeing with an example of how
to convert a CFG to Chomsky normal form. So here we have a CFG given it's a grammar whose production
is given by this where S gives ASA and also AB, A gives B and also S and V gives B and epsilon.
So here S is the start symbol and then the variables are A and B and then the terminal
symbols or non-variables are small a and small b. So we have to convert this to Chomsky normal form.
So let me just give you a quick recap of the steps that we have to follow. First of all if you see
that there is a start symbol S in the right hand side of any production then we have to create a
new start symbol S dash and then in the second step you have to remove all the null productions
and in the third step you have to remove all the unit productions and then in the fourth step you
have to check if there are any productions in which there are more than two variables in the
right hand side and if there are any you must convert it so that it will have only two variables
in the right hand side and also in the fifth step you have to check if there are any productions
in which the right hand side contains a terminal symbol and a non-terminal symbol. Then you have
to change it and convert it in such a way that it will contain either both variables or just a
single terminal symbol. So those are the steps that we need to follow. So let us directly get
into this problem and try to solve this. So let's go to step number one. So in step number one what
we have to do is we have to check if S is appearing in the right hand side of any productions so we
see that here S is appearing in the right hand side even here S is appearing in the right hand side
so in that case what we have to do is we add a new state S dash and we create a new production S dash
gives S. So our new production will look like this we have created a new state S dash and we have
created a production which says S dash gives S and then the remaining things will be the same.
So that is how we perform the first step. Now let's go to the second step. So in the second step
we have to check if there are any null productions and we have to remove the null productions.
So let us see what are the null productions that we have. Here we see that B gives epsilon this is a
null production and also A gives epsilon it is not directly there over here in this production but
I will show you how this comes as we proceed and if you don't know how to remove the null
productions I suggest that you watch the video in which we have discussed how to remove null
productions from a contextary grammar. Okay so we have two null productions here so let us first
remove B gives epsilon. So in order to remove B gives epsilon what you have to do is we have
to check this production and wherever you find that a B or a capital B is occurring you have
to remove that capital B and we have to add that as a new production. So let's see how we can do
this. So here we see that in this there is no B but in this one S gives ASA and AB. So from here
if we remove this B what will be the new production that we get from AB if we remove B the new
production that we will get is just A. So what I will do I will write this as it is and here S
gives ASA this one and AB also you have to write it as it is and then if you remove B from here
what you will get is just a single A. So that A we write here as a new production and then come to
this one A gives B and S. Now from this if you remove B what will happen you will get a production
which says A gives epsilon. So I will first write the things which was already there as it is A gives
BS and if I remove B I will get an epsilon here which is this one and then B gives B, B gives B
and we can remove the epsilon from here because this is what we were trying to remove the null
production that we were trying to remove. Okay now this we get this production now and we see that
we got another null production in this production that we have which is A gives epsilon so we have
to remove A gives epsilon. So in order to remove A gives epsilon you have to follow the same procedure
wherever you find A in the RHS you have to replace it and create new productions without that A.
So let's see S gives S there is no A here so we write it as it is and here we see that there are
S. S gives ASA there are two AS over here so what we do I will first write all these things as they
are ASA, A, B and A up to here it is same and now from this ASA if I remove the last A then
what do I get I will just get AS so I will I include the production AS and now instead of
removing this last if I remove this first what do I get I will get SA and that is a new production
that I will add and if I remove both the AS then what do I get I will just get a single S and that
also I have to add it here so I have added them all and then from here I can remove the epsilon
symbol A gives epsilon which was the null production that we were trying to remove so A gives BS
epsilon symbol is gone and B gives B is written as it is. Okay now we have finished removing the
null productions and the third step is to remove the unit productions so if you don't know how to
remove unit productions there is a lecture in which I have discussed how to remove unit productions
in detail so you can watch that if you don't know how to do it so let's see in this case what are the
unit productions that we have so unit productions are of this form when one variable gives just
another variable that is called a unit production so here we have S gives S, S gives S this is one
unit production then S dash gives S that is another unit productions then A gives B this is another
unit production and A gives S this is another unit production so we have to remove them so in order
to remove unit productions what we have to do let us see so in order to remove this S gives S we see
that this is the latest production that we have so S is giving this whole thing and also S and
what is the value of S it is again the same thing so you can just directly remove it without doing any
further steps so we just remove it directly and after we remove we get this S dash gives S is same
and S gives all these things as it is and this S over here is removed and then the rest of the
things are same so we are done with the first one now we have to remove S dash gives S so in order
to remove S dash gives S what we have to do is we have to replace this S with something so what
we will do we look at the latest production which we have which is this one and here we see that
S dash is giving S and then the value of this S is this one over here so instead of writing S dash
gives S I will replace this S with these whole variables which this S produces so I will write
S dash gives ASA AB AS and SA this one and then S remains the same this whole thing S and then
A and B also remains the same okay so we are done with this and now the third one we have to remove
is A gives B so in order to remove A gives B let us check the latest production that we have which
is this one and I want to remove A gives B so what can I replace B with so we see that B is giving
small b so I will replace A gives B with A gives small b so S dash and S are the same they will
be the same as they are and here A gives BS so instead of this B over here I will replace it
with small b so A gives small b and S and B gives B remains the same okay so we are done with this
one and now let's come to the last one which is A gives S A gives S so in order to remove this
we see that we have to replace this S with the value of S and what is the value of S S gives
this whole thing so I have to say that A will give B and instead of S I will put this whole thing so
S dash and S they remain the same no changes so here A gives B which was already there and
instead of S I will put the whole value of S this one and then B gives B remains the same
so by this we have removed all the unit productions from our given CFG okay so now we can go to the
next step so in the next step what we have to do is we have to find out the productions
that has more than two variables in RHS so if you remember the rules of Chomsky normal form
we are not allowed to have more than two variables in the RHS so this is the latest production that
we have and in from this latest production we see that S dash is giving ASA it is having
more than two variables it is having three variables so this is not allowed and S gives
ASA this is also not allowed and A is also giving ASA so these are the three productions
that violate the rules of Chomsky normal form so we have to remove them so in order to remove them
what we will do is instead of writing ASA I will just write A and this SA I will replace it with
another variable which I will call X and that X will give a new production which says X gives SA
so how I'll do this S dash gives A and instead of SA I will just write X and then the rest
of the things are the same and even in S instead of ASA I will write A and instead of SA I will
write X and the rest of the things remains the same and even in A I do the same thing instead
of ASA I just write A followed by X and then B remains the same and now I have to add a new
production X gives SA because all the SS were replaced by X so X gives SA is a new production
that we have so we are done with that and now let's go to the next step so in the next step
we have to change the productions S dash gives AB S gives AB and A gives AB and why is that
that is because these productions also violate the rule of Chomsky normal form because in Chomsky
normal form in the right hand side you are not allowed to have one terminal symbol and a variable
together so in order to remove this let's see what are the things we need to do so if you
want to see where are these you can see this S dash gives AB S gives AB A gives AB these are the
three things that I'm talking about so in order to remove this what we will do is this A over here
I will replace it with a variable this A is a terminal symbol so I will replace it with a
variable which I will call Y and I will add a production which says Y gives A so how will we
do this S dash gives AX it is the same thing and instead of AB this A will be replaced by Y so it
will be YB and then the rest of the things remains the same and even in S we do the same thing AB
is replaced by YB and even in A the same thing happens AB is replaced by YB and then B gives B
and X gives S A remains the same and we have to add a new production Y gives A because we have used
Y here and why did we use Y because we were replacing the small S with the Y so Y gives A
is a new production that we have to add so finally we get this production which is a required Chomsky
normal form for the given context-free grammar so if you check these productions they are following
all the rules of Chomsky normal form and thus we have successfully converted the given context-free
grammar to the Chomsky normal form so I hope this was helpful to you thank you for watching and see
you in the next one
