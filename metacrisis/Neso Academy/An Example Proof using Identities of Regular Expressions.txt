Till now we have completed the identities of regular expressions and we have also studied
Arden's theorem and in this lecture we will be trying to prove a regular expression that is
given here. So it says that prove that this is equal to this. So these are two regular expressions
and the first one is 1 plus 0 0 star 1 plus 1 plus 0 0 star 1 0 plus 1 0 star 1 star 0
plus 1 0 star 1 and we have to prove that this is equal to 0 star 1 0 plus 1 0 star 1 and the
whole star. Okay so how do we do this? We will first take the LHS so the LHS is equal to this
one so let me write this down 1 plus 0 0 star 1 plus 1 plus 0 0 star 1 0 plus 1 0 star 1 the whole
star and 0 plus 1 0 star 1. Okay so now if you see here you see that this term 1 plus 0 0 star 1
is repeated here 1 plus 0 0 star 1 so we see that here we have this term here also we have
this term so what I can do I can take this as a common so let me take this as common 1 plus
0 0 star 1 I take it as common so if I take it as common what do I get here once it is taken as
common this becomes epsilon and plus so this is taken out it's over here and these two terms are
remaining so let me write these two terms 0 plus 1 0 star 1 star and 0 plus 1 0 star 1.
Okay now if you look at this expression you see that these two terms are the same 0 plus 1 0 star 1
here also it is 0 plus 1 0 star 1 and over here we have a star now if you recall the identities
that we have studied we have already studied that epsilon plus r star r is equal to r star
right where r is any regular expressions so here if you consider this as r you see that
it is like r star r so this whole thing can be replaced by 0 plus 1 0 star 1 whole star
if we consider this as a r so we'll do that now so I'll take this down as it is 0 star 1
and this whole thing can be replaced by only this much star using this identity that we have already
learned so I can write 0 plus 1 0 star 1 whole star okay now we are left with these two expressions
now what I will do is here I will write epsilon into 1 plus 0 0 star 1 and this term let me just
write it as it is 0 plus 1 0 star 1 star now why did I do this I have this term I have just written
it down here and I have added an epsilon symbol this is another identity that we have studied
epsilon r is equal to r if you just have epsilon before r that is still equal to r we have studied
this identity before so I am applying it here I am just putting in epsilon before this expression
so even if I put an epsilon here it is still equal to this so I can write this as this one
okay now after I write this from this expression I am going to take out epsilon
and 0 0 star as common epsilon plus 0 0 star I am taking it as common epsilon plus
0 0 star I am taking this out and what will be left if I take this out from here epsilon is
already out and 0 0 star is already also out so the only thing that is left is 1 so I am left with
1 and this one let me just copy it down as it was 0 plus 1 0 star 1 star okay and now this one if you
look at this this again follows this identity epsilon plus r star r where r is 0 over here so
how can I write this instead of this I can just write this as 0 star because r is 0 over here and
we see we get r star here so we will get 0 star over here and this one is as it is and this term
also as it is 0 plus 1 0 star 1 star okay so now we are getting this and if you check it with the
rHS it is exactly the same 0 star 1 0 plus 1 0 star 1 star 0 star 1 0 plus 1 0 star 1 whole star so
this is equal to our rHS so this is how we prove this expressions and this is how you have to use
the identities in order to solve this kind of questions if you get I hope this was clear to
you thank you for watching and see you in the next one
