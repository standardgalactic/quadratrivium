Checking Virginia Tech Transportation Institute/Learning Active Inference Models of Perception and Control.txt
1. **Active Inference**: The active inference model integrates both estimation (belief updating) and decision-making (control). It emphasizes the epistemic value, which is the merit of exploring before exploiting in environments that are not fully known. This dual focus on belief updating and action selection is unique to active inference compared to other models in the literature.

2. **Epistemic Value**: The active inference framework highlights the importance of understanding the environment, which is reflected in the agent's actions aiming to induce specific distributions for better estimation of the environment's states.

3. **Neural Evidence**: There is neural evidence supporting the theories that underlie active inference, suggesting that our brains operate similarly to how this framework conceptualizes decision-making and belief updating.

4. **Scalability and Computational Considerations**: The current implementation of the model, which looks ahead eight units of time, could be a bottleneck when applied to more complex environments due to the computational demands of solving a Partially Observable Non-Deterministic Puzzle (PONDP).

5. **Heterogeneity and Generalizability**: The current model is region-specific, based on data from China. Future work aims to generalize the model by incorporating effectation maximization to account for heterogeneity across different regions or datasets.

6. **Next Webinar Announcement**: A reminder that registration is open for the next webinar titled "Real-time Risk Prediction at Signalized Intersections Using Grapheneal Networks," presented by researchers from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, scheduled for October 24th at 2:30 Eastern Time. Registration details have been shared and can be accessed through the provided link.

The webinar will be recorded and made available on YouTube after the event for those who could not attend live. Thank you to all participants for attending this webinar, and looking forward to seeing everyone in the next one.
