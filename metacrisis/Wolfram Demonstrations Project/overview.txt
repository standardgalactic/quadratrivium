Music is an art form and cultural activity that involves the creation of sounds and silences to express ideas, emotions, and stories through the medium of sound. It is one of the most universally appreciated and important forms of human expression, with a history that spans across different cultures and time periods. Music can be heard in virtually every known human society, from traditional folk and classical music to popular music genres such as rock, jazz, hip-hop, electronic, and many others.

The elements of music include melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, dynamics, and timbre. These elements are combined in various ways to create a piece of music that can be perceived through listening or performing. Music is not only enjoyed for its aesthetic qualities but also plays a significant role in religious rituals, social and cultural events, personal emotional expression, educational applications, and healing and therapeutic contexts.

The production of music involves the use of instruments, live performers, or technology such as computer programs and electronic devices to create and record compositions. Music is also a field of study within academia, with scholars examining its theory, history, and effects on human cognition and society. The impact of music on culture and human life is profound, influencing everything from the way we learn and memorize information to how societies come together and express their collective identity.
