1. **Problem Context**: A person has a positive test result for prostate cancer. We want to calculate the probability that they actually have prostate cancer given this result, considering the base rates of prostate cancer in the population and the test's characteristics.

2. **Base Rates**: The base rate (prevalence) of prostate cancer is 12%.

3. **Test Characteristics**: The test has a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 95%, meaning it correctly identifies 95% of people with cancer. However, no test is perfect, and this test also has a false positive rate of 5%. This means that in the general population without cancer, 5% of individuals will receive a false positive result.

4. **Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem**: We calculate the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has prostate cancer as follows:
   - P(Cancer | Positive Test) = (P(True Positive) * P(Cancer)) / P(Positive Test)
   - P(Cancer) is 12% or 0.12.
   - P(True Positive) is 95% of the 12%, which is 0.114 (since 5% will get a false negative, these are not included in the numerator).
   - P(Positive Test) is the sum of true positives and false positives: 0.114 + 0.06 (6% of those without cancer will receive a false positive, which is 88% of the total population times 6%).
   - Plugging these values into the formula gives us P(Cancer | Positive Test) = (0.114 * 0.12) / (0.114 + (0.88 * 0.06)).

5. **Result**: The probability that a person with a positive test result actually has prostate cancer is approximately 68.3%.

6. **Complementary Probability**: There's also about a 31.7% chance that the person with a positive test result does not have prostate cancer.

7. **Alternative Calculation Using Real Numbers**: We can illustrate this using a hypothetical population of 10,000 people:
   - If 1200 have prostate cancer and 8800 do not, then 95% of those with cancer will test positive (1140 true positives).
   - Conversely, 6% of those without cancer will also test positive (528 false positives).
   - The probability that a person with a positive test result has prostate cancer is the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive test results (1140 / (1140 + 528)).

8. **Conclusion**: This example demonstrates how Bayes' Theorem can be used to calculate the probability of an event given other evidence, and it highlights the importance of considering base rates when interpreting diagnostic tests.
