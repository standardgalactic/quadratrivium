Checking St John Grimbly - Asking Why/The Mathematics of Predictive Processing.txt
1. **Concept Overview**: The talk is about using free energy in the context of theoretical neuroscience to understand how neural networks can learn through deep reinforcement learning (RL). Free energy is a concept from statistical physics and information theory, which in this context, relates to predictive processing and active inference.

2. **Free Energy**: It is a measure of surprise or prediction error. In RL, the goal is to minimize free energy, which corresponds to maximizing expected values (least surprising outcomes) given the observations. This is done by approximating the posterior distribution with a function q and minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this approximation and the true posterior.

3. **Neural Network Encoding**: The parameters of the neural network encode the food size (v), the posterior standard deviation (sigma_p), and the prediction errors (epsilon_p, epsilon_u, u). These values are dynamic and can be updated based on the prediction errors.

4. **Prediction Error Dynamics**: The dynamics of prediction errors are governed by two equations derived from the math of the model, which can converge to the defined values of epsilon when epsilon tends to zero.

5. **Learning through Maximization of Expected Values**: Instead of directly maximizing the probability of u, we consider a joint distribution of u and phi (expected value of the food size) and maximize the log of this joint distribution. This simplifies the optimization problem.

6. **Implementation in Deep RL**: By minimizing free energy, a neural network can be trained to make predictions that are aligned with what is most expected or least surprising, which is analogous to learning in deep RL. The network tries to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and actual outcomes, thus improving its policy over time.

7. **Relevance to Modern Deep RL**: The concepts of free energy and predictive processing are highly relevant to modern approaches in deep RL where agents aim to minimize their own free energy, which is akin to minimizing the surprise they experience from their interactions with the environment.

In summary, the talk explains how free energy can be used as a guiding principle for learning in neural networks, particularly within the framework of deep reinforcement learning. By focusing on minimizing prediction errors (free energy), neural networks can effectively learn to make better predictions, which is at the heart of RL. The hope is that this understanding can lead to more robust and efficient RL algorithms.
