Processing Overview for TED
============================
Checking TED/Alison Gopnik： What do babies think？.txt
1. The video illustrates a child's approach to learning by conducting experiments, which involves formulating and testing hypotheses. This demonstrates that even young children are capable of engaging in scientific inquiry and learning processes.

2. Psychologists and philosophers once believed that babies and young children were barely conscious, if conscious at all. However, recent observations suggest that these young individuals may actually be more conscious than adults.

3. Adult consciousness is often likened to a spotlight, where attention narrows down to focus on one task or stimulus at a time, while inhibiting distractions. In contrast, children's consciousness resembles a lantern, allowing them to take in and learn from multiple sources of information simultaneously.

4. The brains of babies and young children are saturated with neurotransmitters that promote learning and plasticity, which is why they can absorb so much information from their environment without being overwhelmed by it.

5. To experience a taste of the baby state of consciousness as adults, one could imagine what it's like to be in love for the first time in a new city, especially with the help of stimulants like coffee that mimic the neurotransmitters present during early learning stages.

6. While adulthood brings practical skills like tying shoelaces and crossing streets independently, there is value in sometimes adopting a more childlike state of open-mindedness and curiosity to foster creativity, innovation, and learning. The video suggests that perhaps adults could benefit from thinking more like children at times.

Checking TED/Imaging at a trillion frames per second ｜ Ramesh Raskar.txt
 Dr. Edgerton was a pioneer in high-speed photography, capturing iconic images like a bullet piercing an apple. Today, technology has advanced to the point where we can capture images at one trillion frames per second, allowing us to observe phenomena like light in motion. This ultra-fast imaging technique, known as femto photography, can potentially enable new capabilities such as seeing around corners or viewing inside objects without destructive methods like X-rays.

In a demonstration of femto photography, a laser pointer was pulsed on and off in one trillionth of a second to create a packet of photons that shattered a bottle from the inside out when directed at it. This experiment showed how light behaves under such conditions and highlighted the potential of this technology for real-world applications.

Researchers have also developed a method using multiple bounces of light off surfaces to reconstruct 3D images of hidden objects, even behind walls. This technique has practical applications, such as improving vehicle safety by detecting obstacles around corners, locating survivors in hazardous environments, or developing new medical imaging tools that can see through tissues and blood.

The data collected from these experiments is not only useful for scientific research but also for creative purposes, like computational photography with time lapse and color coding. The researchers have made the details of their work publicly available to encourage further innovation and exploration in this field. They emphasize that the future of imaging lies beyond megapixels and into the realm of temporal dimensions.

In summary, femto photography represents a significant advancement in imaging technology with potential applications ranging from scientific research to practical solutions for safety and medical diagnostics. The researchers behind this innovation are inviting the community to build upon their work and push the boundaries of what's possible in ultra-fast visualization.

Checking TED/Lee Cronin： Making matter come alive.txt
1. **The Quest for Artificial Life**: Chemist Lee Cronin from the University of Glasgow is leading a project aimed at creating artificial life forms outside of biological systems. The goal is to understand the origin of life and potentially replicate it using non-carbon based chemistry, which could revolutionize our understanding of evolution and life itself.

2. **General Theory of Evolution**: Cronin suggests that if they can successfully create evolvable matter, it would support a general theory of evolution, not limited to biological entities, but applicable to any complex system that can compete, adapt, and replicate.

3. **Potential Implications**: The creation of such artificial life forms could lead to new technologies inspired by evolutionary principles. This could result in self-sustaining systems that are powered by the environment, for example, being exposed to sunlight, and could potentially symbiotically integrate with biological systems to solve complex problems.

4. **Defining Life**: Cronin posits that if matter can evolve, it is alive. This definition could redefine how we understand life and could imply that non-carbon based life forms are inevitable throughout the universe.

5. **Timeline and Prospects**: The project aims to achieve this within the next two years. Cronin believes with high confidence that non-carbon based life exists elsewhere in the universe and suggests that NASA should adjust its search criteria accordingly, looking for evolvable matter rather than specifically carbon-based signatures.

6. **Philosophical Considerations**: The success of such a project would raise profound philosophical questions about the nature of matter, consciousness, and our place in the universe as the most advanced form of "stuff."

Cronin's work is ambitious and if successful, it could fundamentally alter our understanding of life and evolution, both biologically and as a concept that governs the organization and complexity of matter in the universe.

Checking TED/Manu Prakash： A 50-cent microscope that folds like origami.txt
 The speaker is discussing the evolution of microscopy, particularly focusing on how it has impacted global health, especially in developing countries where diseases like malaria are prevalent. They highlight the challenges of diagnosing these diseases due to the lack of sophisticated equipment and trained personnel. To address this issue, the speaker introduced the concept of "fold scopes" or "paper microscopes," which are low-cost, disposable, and highly portable diagnostic tools made from origami techniques and paper.

These fold scopes are not just simple devices; they incorporate advanced engineering principles to create lenses through self-assembly and surface tension within the paper itself. They are durable, waterproof, and can be used for projection microscopy, allowing users to project images onto a screen for better visibility. The speaker demonstrates the robustness of these microscopes by dropping one from a third-floor balcony to show their durability.

The fold scope design is scalable and cost-effective, with each unit manufactured for as little as 50 cents worth of parts. The next step for the project is large-scale field trials to test their effectiveness in real-world conditions, focusing on diseases like malaria, Chagas disease, and gonorrhea.

The speaker also touches upon the importance of science education and how providing such tools to children can empower them to contribute to global health efforts. The ultimate goal is to make these microscopes widely available and potentially even printable, ensuring that anyone, anywhere can have access to vital diagnostic tools for combating diseases caused by the "monster soup" of pathogens.

In summary, the speaker has presented a novel solution to a significant global health challenge through the innovation of fold scopes, which are affordable, durable, and effective microscopes made from paper and origami techniques, with the aim of improving disease diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited settings.

Checking TED/The astounding athletic power of quadcopters ｜ Raffaello D'Andrea.txt
1. **Machine Athleticism**: The presentation introduces the concept of machine athleticism, where machines are capable of performing complex and dynamic maneuvers autonomously, similar to human athletes. This is demonstrated by quads (quadrotor helicopters) that can play tennis, hit a moving ball, and work cooperatively to perform tasks like launching an object to a specific target.

2. **Technology**: The quads use real-time sensor data and sophisticated algorithms to calculate trajectories, plan movements, and adapt to changes in the environment. They re-plan their strategies 50 times per second to ensure precise execution of tasks.

3. **Human Interaction**: The presentation shows how humans can interact with these machines using gesture sensors, allowing for a more intuitive and natural way of controlling them. This interaction can be customized by changing the physical laws affecting the quads.

4. **Purpose of Machine Athleticism**: The purpose of developing such technology is not just to demonstrate capability but also to explore how it can be used to improve the human condition. It raises questions about the future role of machine athletes in society, emphasizing that the choice of how this technology is used lies with humans.

5. **Team Introduction**: The presentation concludes by introducing the members of the Fly Machine Research Team who are responsible for these advancements. They are Federico Aguilero, Dario Brascianini, Marcus Hen, Sergei Lupaschen, Mark Muller, and Robin Ritz.

6. **Social Implications**: The presentation ends with a call to consider the social implications of such technology, urging society to use machine athleticism for positive outcomes. It highlights that the future impact of these machines will depend on human choices and societal decisions.

Checking TED/Why you think you're right -- even if you're wrong ｜ Julia Galef.txt
1. The story of Captain Alfred Dreyfus and Charles Picard illustrates the concept of "soldier mindset" versus "scout mindset." While Dreyfus was wrongfully accused of espionage due to his being Jewish, Picard initially upheld biases against Dreyfus because of his prejudices.

2. However, Picard later became a hero in the effort to exonerate Dreyfus, demonstrating that one can overcome their own biases and prejudices to seek the truth. This ability to transcend personal biases is what characterizes "scout mindset."

3. "Scout mindset" is rooted in emotions such as curiosity, a sense of intrigue when encountering new information or contradictions, and valuing the process of testing one's beliefs without tying self-worth to being right or wrong.

4. This mindset is not about intelligence but about how one feels. Scouts are more likely to feel it's virtuous to question their own beliefs and do not view changing their mind as a sign of weakness.

5. Research suggests that these traits predict good judgment and are not highly correlated with IQ. Instead, they are about cultivating a desire for understanding and learning rather than defending established positions or beliefs.

6. The speaker advocates for fostering "scout mindset" to improve individual and societal judgment, emphasizing the importance of changing how we feel about being wrong or encountering new information that contradicts our beliefs.

7. The speaker concludes by asking the audience what they yearn for: to defend their beliefs or to see the world as clearly as possible. This choice encapsulates the difference between "soldier mindset" and "scout mindset."
