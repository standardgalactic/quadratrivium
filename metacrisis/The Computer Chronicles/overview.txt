Checking The Computer Chronicles/The Computer Chronicles - Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) (1986).txt
 This week's Computer Chronicles covers a range of topics in the world of computing. Here's a summary:

1. IBM has announced upgrades for its RT Model 15 with improved networking capabilities, more memory, and additional storage. The company is also planning to reduce the price of the RTPC and increase its sales force by 5,000 people.

2. Apple has enabled Macintosh computers to network over regular phone lines with a new hardware and software solution that can speed up communications by a factor of 18.

3. Lotus is showcasing two new products at the Info86 show in New York: HAL, an AI-based program for simplifying interactions with Lotus 123, and OneSource, a CD-ROM containing 20 years' worth of financial data that can communicate with Lotus 123.

4. Education Systems Technology has stated that computers can reverse the trend of smaller classroom sizes by enabling teachers to handle larger classes with more individual attention.

5. Paul Schindler reviews tornado notes, a memory-resonant note-taker and finder for PCs that offers a desktop environment, search capabilities, and integration with other software tools. It costs $50 from MicroLogic.

6. Gamalink has introduced a product that allows users to send documents directly from a PC to a fax machine via an add-on board, which costs approximately $1,000.

7. The Overseas Security Advisory Council has launched a bulletin board focused on international terrorism as a resource for American business travelers.

8. A blind businessman from Indiana has developed Rapsheet, a talking spreadsheet program designed for visually impaired users. It's available for free to other sightless individuals.

9. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh are making strides in synthesizing protein molecules that could lead to molecular computers capable of repairing cells and potentially replacing defective neurons in the human brain.

The program is sponsored by Leading Edge, which provides IBM-compatible systems with various software packages, including a spreadsheet and word processing program with spelling correction, and a Hayes-compatible 1200-baud modem. Additional support comes from McGraw-Hill, publisher of Byte magazine, which covers global developments in computer technology, hardware, software, and programming languages.
