Welcome to the Cybertruck unveil.
Yeah!
Ah!
We created an exoskeleton.
Come on!
Come on!
Oh!
Nice.
Now hit the Cybertruck.
Come on!
Oh!
Yeah.
What else can we do with this truck?
Let's shoot it.
That's a 9mm bullet shot at the door.
So it's ultra-hard, cold rolled stainless steel alloy that we've developed.
We're going to be using the same alloy in the Starship rocket and in the Cybertruck.
Let's show the glass demo.
First, this is regular glass.
This is like normal glass, car glass.
We want to show you what happens with normal car glass.
Now we'll show you Tesla on the glass.
Yeah.
Drop it.
Yeah.
It's still down there.
Frans, could you try to break this glass, please?
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah.
Sure?
Yeah.
Oh my fucking god.
Well, maybe that was a little too hard.
Should we try on the door?
Try?
Yeah.
It didn't go through.
That's a plus side.
Let's try the right one.
Try that one, really?
Sure.
It didn't go through.
All right.
Not bad.
The room for improvement.
In addition, the car has an adaptive air suspension.
The rear is 100 cubic feet.
Six and a half foot length, bed length.
Up to 3,500 pounds of payload.
So let's see, on-road performance.
Oh!
In terms of off-road performance,
it's going to have the best
angle of approach angle,
best clearance heights,
best departure angle.
For people that really go on off-road,
this is going to be great.
You could basically do the Vaja rally in this thing.
We're going to have three ranges.
So obviously, we'll have access to all the superchargers,
be capable of more than 250 kilowatts.
We'll reveal the actual number later.
And it has on-board outlets for 110 and 220 volts.
And as a little plus,
because it's got an air suspension,
we can tap off the air suspension
so you have a pneumatic source.
Do you have an...
Yeah.
An on-board air compressor.
Of course, it will come with autopilot standard.
Yeah.
And then it's going to...
That's the price without any incentives.
That's just like the price without any incentives.
Yeah.
So you can order now if you would like.
All right. Thank you.
Oh, wait.
We have, uh...
What happened?
We made an... We also made an ATV, so...
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Um, so the adaptive air suspension,
you can drop real low.
And you go high on the other side.
We call this load mode.
So you've got load mode, you've got a bolt-in ramp.
So you can take an ATV or dirt bike,
whatever you want,
and load it on the back.
Oh!
Yes.
Oh!
And it's...
It's currently plugged in and charging.
All right.
Thank you.
Oh, I should say also,
we're going to be offering rides in this all night.
Don't mind the glass.
