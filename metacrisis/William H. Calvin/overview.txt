============================
Checking William H. Calvin/1. The Climate Fix Needs to be Quick： Lessons from Extreme Weather Surges of the Early 21st Century.txt
1. **Global Warming vs. Global Overheating**: The term "global warming" refers to the average surface temperature of the Earth, which includes both land and sea surface temperatures. William Calvin prefers "global overheating" to emphasize the escalation of the issue.

2. **Surface Temperature Record**: Since 1977, global surface temperatures have been rising, with a notable divergence between land and sea surface temperatures after about 1984. Land temperatures warmed almost three times faster than sea surface temperatures.

3. **Land vs. Sea Temperatures**: Before 1984, both land and sea surface temperatures were closely correlated. After this point, they diverged significantly, with land temperatures continuing to rise rapidly.

4. **Carbon Dioxide Levels**: The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has continued to increase throughout the period, including during a 10-year hiatus when global temperatures did not rise.

5. **Extreme Weather Events**: The five types of extreme weather events experienced significant surges during the 10-year hiatus, starting within this period, even though global temperatures did not increase.

6. **Possible Explanations for Hiatus**: During the 10-year hiatus, the added energy from increased carbon dioxide may have been absorbed by other processes or systems within the Earth's climate, such as an expansion of the jet stream's length and kinetic energy. This could suggest a phase change in the climate system, similar to ice melting into water.

7. **Educational Aspect**: William Calvin suggests that the topic of phase change during climate transitions would make an excellent thesis subject for further exploration within climate science.

8. **Further Information**: The full presentations on this topic by William Calvin can be found on YouTube via links provided at williamcalvin.com/2021, and he invites any questions about the subject matter.

Checking William H. Calvin/2. Jet Stream Augments Extreme Weather Surges： The Need for the Mindset in Emergency Medicine..txt
1. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the thermohaline circulation are two major ocean currents that play a crucial role in Earth's climate by transporting heat from the tropics to the higher latitudes.
   
2. There is concern among scientists about the potential for both the AMOC and the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to shut down simultaneously, which could have significant and potentially catastrophic impacts on global climate patterns.

3. The AMOC has experienced two past failures, during the last glacial maximum and 125,000 years ago, each lasting tens of thousands of years. These events are associated with a cold blob of water in the North Atlantic, which could be a warning sign for what might happen if the AMOC were to fail again.

4. Climate scientists often avoid discussing aspects of climate change that are not fully understood due to past experiences with misrepresentation by lobbyists.

5. There are 16 identified tipping points in the Earth's climate system, six of which involve ice and another six related to changes in winds and ocean currents, which could lead to rapid and potentially irreversible environmental changes.

6. If several of these tipping points were triggered, it could result in a drastic reduction in human population, leading to a significant downsizing of civilization as we know it.

7. The recovery from such a scenario might take thousands of years, with the potential for wars, genocides, and a decline into less cooperative and more fragmented societies.

8. While reducing emissions is important, it may be too little, too late to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Therefore, efforts to mitigate climate change should be complemented by other environmental and economic initiatives that do not rely solely on decarbonization.

9. It is essential to recognize the limitations of current climate solutions and to focus on practical, multifaceted approaches to stabilize Earth's systems before irreversible changes occur.

Checking William H. Calvin/3.  MIT Bathtub Simulator for Emissions and CO2 Removal. Why emissions reduction is insufficient..txt
1. **Surges in Extreme Weather**: Climate change has led to an increase in extreme weather events, which are exacerbated by the positioning of the jet streams. These surges can cause significant damage and are a clear indication of the climate crisis we face.

2. **Mindset Problems in Responding to Climate Change**: The current approach to addressing climate change is insufficient, often due to mindset issues that mirror challenges seen in medical education. There's a need for a more urgent and comprehensive response akin to the sense of urgency in emergency medicine.

3. **Inadequacy of Current Climate Solutions**: Most proposed solutions for climate change, such as reforestation and energy efficiency, are not sufficient on their own to significantly mitigate the effects of climate change by 2040. We need to invent more effective methods of CO2 removal, particularly ocean-based methods, which were omitted in some models like the MIT bathtub simulator.

4. **Political Action**: Climate action needs to be prioritized by policymakers. Despite public opinion that favors other priorities, legislators must be convinced that climate change mitigation should take precedence over other concerns.

5. **Climate's Manhattan Project**: To address the climate emergency effectively, we need a massive and rapid effort similar to the Manhattan Project for nuclear weapons. This would involve scaling up CO2 removal technologies and focusing on solutions that can cool the planet and prevent extreme weather events from escalating beyond control.

6. **Call to Action**: The speaker encourages viewers to engage with politics and advocate for climate action as a top priority, emphasizing that time is of the essence in addressing this global emergency.

The presentation ends with an invitation to watch the other talks in the series on YouTube via the provided link, and a reminder that while sea level rise is already baked into our future, there is still hope for climate cooling by 2040 if we act decisively and inventively. The speaker concludes by offering to answer any questions from the audience.

Checking William H. Calvin/4. Kickstarting Climate's Manhattan Project.txt
1. **Urgency of Action**: We must act swiftly to address the escalating issue of climate change, as inaction could lead to a worsening situation that becomes increasingly difficult to manage. The analogy is drawn from medical practice, where rapid intervention can be crucial for patient recovery.

2. **Design and Deployment Timeline**: The proposed solution involves a three-phase approach: securing funding and assembling experts within a year, developing prototypes for field testing in the following year, and ramping up production to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere by 2030, with the aim of achieving a cooling effect by 2040.

3. **Governance Structure**: A governance structure is suggested, potentially led by three state governors from different regions (e.g., Washington, Oregon, and California) to ensure political accountability. This non-profit initiative would also involve a finance committee made up of tech billionaires and a general manager with a track record of rapid design and deployment.

4. **International Cooperation vs. Technocratic Approach**: While international cooperation is ideal, the project could start with national governments or through technocratic means in countries where decision-making is more streamlined, eventually evolving into an internationally governed effort.

5. **Continental Shelf Project as a Starting Point**: Early projects could be deployed on the continental shelf in colder waters, where the conditions are favorable for CO2 removal technologies. This would allow for practical testing and refinement of the technology before wider deployment.

6. **Expert Participation**: By 2030, experts from various nations could participate in governing the project, ensuring a wide range of perspectives and knowledge in decision-making processes.

7. **Call to Action**: The presentation concludes with a call to action for governments, experts, and citizens to take immediate steps towards addressing climate change, drawing parallels between the urgency required in this situation and the rapid decision-making necessary in critical medical interventions.

8. **Additional Resources**: The audience is directed to additional talks in the series for more detailed information, available on William Calvin's website and YouTube channel.

In summary, the presentation outlines an ambitious timeline for addressing the excess CO2 in the atmosphere through a combination of swift action, expert governance, and rapid technological development, with a call for immediate engagement from all stakeholders involved.

Checking William H. Calvin/CLIMATE DENIAL ： Humanity's Fatal Flaw？.txt
1. **Climate Denial Motivations**: The topic of climate denial is complex, and while some may assume deniers are uninformed or stupid, the reality often involves economic interests, avoidance of difficult truths, and the influence of money to spread misinformation. It's a strategic response to a problem that is both scientifically and economically challenging.

2. **Scientists' Responsibility**: Scientists have a responsibility to communicate frankly, even when data is incomplete. They often adhere to traditions of neutrality and caution, which can sometimes lead to withholding information that might be critical for informed decision-making.

3. **The Role of Money**: The denial of climate change is heavily influenced by economic interests. There is significant investment in maintaining the status quo, and this can manifest as paid obfuscation and deliberate misinformation campaigns.

4. **Avoidance and Reframing**: Many people avoid dealing with the implications of climate change due to its daunting nature. The problem is often reframed in terms of emissions rather than CO2 accumulation, which can obscure the urgency of the situation.

5. **Taboo Topics**: Discussions around geoengineering have become taboo, and this may be due to different interests beyond those who are currently engaged in the climate debate.

6. **Fatal Flaws**: Aristotle's concept of a fatal flaw as an injury committed in ignorance with disastrous consequences is relevant here. The fatal flaw in humanity's response to climate change may be our reluctance to confront the economic and social implications head-on due to fear of exclusion or being at odds with prevailing ideologies.

7. **Next Steps**: In the next discussion, the speaker will cover what to do about climate change and the urgency of action. The emphasis will be on the need for immediate and decisive action to address the issue effectively.

Checking William H. Calvin/Carbon sequestration must be big and quick.txt
 William Calvin's talk outlines an emergency solution to address the immediate impacts of climate change by actively removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere using large-scale ocean fertilization. The key points from his presentation are as follows:

1. **Immediate Action Required**: Climate models suggest that we've reached a point where urgent action is necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, which are already manifesting as abrupt shifts.

2. **Ocean Fertilization as a Solution**: Calvin proposes using iron-based ocean fertilization to stimulate phytoplankton blooms in specific areas of the ocean, particularly the North Atlantic, where the overturning circulation is weakening due to global warming.

3. **The Three Rs**: The approach involves not just fertilizing to enhance natural carbon sinks (Relieve), but also reversing some of the changes that have already occurred and restoring ecosystems that have been damaged or altered.

4. **Potential Side Effects**: There is a risk that this intervention could affect the North Atlantic's overturning circulation. However, Calvin suggests a method to potentially stabilize or even enhance this critical climate system by strategically pumping up deep water to create stronger whirlpools, which would help the surface waters to sink and thus remove more CO2 from the atmosphere.

5. **Urgency Over Caution**: Given that we've already squandered 50 years since the discovery of climate problems, Calvin argues for a more aggressive approach akin to medical intervention (like dialysis in the case of kidney failure). The situation is dire, and we may no longer have the luxury of proceeding with caution as seen in other areas of technology, such as genetically modified crops.

6. **Historical Context**: Some changes, like those to ice sheets or ecosystems, may be irreversible once they begin. Therefore, it's crucial to act now to prevent further damage.

7. **Political Leadership**: Calvin calls for leadership that prioritizes the public interest and acts today with the foresight of how we would want our actions to be viewed in hindsight.

8. **End Note**: The talk concludes by emphasizing the urgency of taking immediate action to address climate change, using ocean fertilization as a prime example of what needs to be done, and suggesting that the political will we need should be as strong and decisive as it would have been 300 or 400 years ago.

William Calvin is a neuroscientist with an interest in environmental issues, particularly how they intersect with climate science. His presentation is a call to action, advocating for bold and immediate measures to counteract the effects of climate change. The full text, slides, and an audio version of the talk can be found on his website, WilliamCalvin.org.

Checking William H. Calvin/Charging an EV every night in an apartment-building parking space.txt
1. **Charging vs. Refueling**: Charging an electric vehicle (EV) is different from refueling a gasoline vehicle. With EVs, you should try to keep the battery between 20% and 80% charged for optimal battery health and range. Avoid letting your EV's battery drain completely or top it off completely unless necessary.

2. **Battery Range**: The range of an EV depends on various factors, including temperature, terrain, driving habits, and the condition of the battery. It's generally recommended to plan for a longer charge time than you actually need, especially if you're in a hurry, because charging slows down significantly when the battery is nearly full.

3. **Charging Stations**: Regularly use Level 2 chargers at home or work to top up your EV overnight. For long trips, plan ahead and use fast-charging stations along highways to recharge efficiently.

4. **Costs**: Charging an EV is often cheaper than refueling a gasoline vehicle. The cost of electricity for charging is typically lower, and there are fewer maintenance costs associated with EVs due to the lack of engine oil changes, transmission fluids, mufflers, catalytic converters, and other components found in conventional vehicles.

5. **Vehicle Design**: Teslas and many other dual-motor EVs are designed with a low center of gravity, which makes them more stable and less prone to tipping over compared to traditional gasoline vehicles. Their design also includes artificial intelligence that helps recover from skids and squatters.

6. **Environmental Impact**: EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions, making them a cleaner alternative to gasoline vehicles. This contributes to reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

7. **Maintenance and Repairs**: EVs generally require less routine maintenance and have fewer items that can break down compared to conventional vehicles. There are no oil changes, transmission fluids, drive shafts, mufflers, or catalytic converters to worry about.

8. **Legal Considerations**: EV owners typically pay an annual fee to compensate for the lack of tax paid on gasoline, known as a "road usage charge." This varies by location.

9. **Safety and Efficiency**: The design of EVs, with their lower center of gravity and independent control of each wheel, can contribute to better handling and safety. Additionally, the regenerative braking system in EVs allows for energy recovery during braking, further enhancing efficiency.

In summary, while there are some considerations to keep in mind when charging an EV compared to refueling a gasoline vehicle, EVs offer numerous advantages in terms of cost, maintenance, environmental impact, and safety.

Checking William H. Calvin/Extreme Weather has caused a Climate Emergency (brief).txt
 William Calvin, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington's Medical School with a strong background in physics and 40 years of experience in climate science, has observed a significant pattern in extreme weather events occurring between 2002 and 2010. These events were not isolated instances but rather recurring surges that have persisted, distinguishing them from broader climate shifts. Calvin emphasizes that the mindset of detecting emergent problems before they become full-blown crises, which is a focus in medical education, is crucial and has been lacking in climate debates.

Calvin points out that we may face a series of global economic crises triggered by extreme weather events long before the global average surface temperature reaches the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He argues that the climate emergency, as he terms it, is not just a future possibility but a current reality, akin to watching a slow-motion train wreck unfold.

However, Calvin remains optimistic, noting that while sea level rise will continue for centuries regardless of our actions, there is still time to mitigate the effects of climate change. Specifically, reducing the current 50% excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could significantly cool things down and lessen the occurrence of extreme weather events. To achieve this, existing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies would need to be improved by an order of magnitude. Calvin suggests that a global effort akin to a "Manhattan Project" for climate could kickstart such advancements. His four-part series aims to convey the urgency of the situation and propose potential solutions to address this climate emergency effectively.

Checking William H. Calvin/Great Apes： The Baseline for Human Evolution (1st of 5).txt
1. **Bipedalism and Brain Size**: The transition to full bipedalism in early hominins occurred between 6 and 3.3 million years ago. During this time, there was no significant change in brain size but rather an improvement in walking efficiency.

2. **Upright Posture vs. Bipedal Gait**: Upright posture evolved around 30 million years ago, while bipedal gait developed later. Human walking is a controlled fall forwards, which is unique and different from other bipedal animals.

3. **Woodland Ecology and Adaptation**: As Africa became drier and forested areas broke up into smaller pieces, the woodland fringe expanded, providing new habitats for early hominins. Our ancestors adapted to these environments, which were a mix of trees and grass, and began to specialize in both tree and grass resources.

4. **Next Time on Human Evolution**: The discussion will continue with the expansion out of Africa by early Homo species, including Homo erectus and eventually Homo sapiens. This period saw our ancestors spreading across the globe and adapting to diverse environments.

5. **Further Reading**: For those interested in learning more, Franz DeWall's books are highly recommended as they cover a wide range of topics related to human evolution and behavior.

6. **Conclusion**: The lecture emphasized the importance of understanding how bipedalism and ecological changes shaped human evolution, leading to the lifestyle that ultimately gave rise to modern humans.

Checking William H. Calvin/How to Treat Global Fever： An Intelligence Test for Our Times.txt
1. **Climate Change and Evolution**: Dr. E.O. Wilson, an entomologist, and Dr. James Lovelock, a environmental scientist, have observed that species diversity tends to increase after major climate changes, which suggests that significant climate shifts can lead to rapid evolutionary changes, as seen in the fossil record.

2. **Political Response**: There is a concern whether politicians will act on the scientific consensus regarding climate change. Dr. Calvin acknowledges that scientists cannot directly influence political decisions but must rely on leaders to take action. He emphasizes the ethical dimension of climate change, particularly how it affects those in the developing world who are most vulnerable.

3. **Renewable Energy**: Dr. Calvin did not specifically mention solar, wind, or landfill gas as solutions for energy generation but acknowledged their potential. Landfill gas, which consists of methane and CO2, can be captured and used to generate power. Europe is working on systems to prevent such gases from being released into the atmosphere.

4. **Ocean Acidification**: Dr. Calvin highlighted that ocean scientists are just beginning to address the issue of ocean acidification resulting from increased CO2 in the atmosphere, which has significant implications for marine life and ecosystems.

5. **Arctic Shale and Tar Sands**: The Arctic shale and tar sands like those in Alberta can be utilized in ways that are even more detrimental to the environment than conventional coal use due to higher emissions of CO2.

6. **Optimism**: Dr. Calvin concluded his talk with a note of optimism, suggesting that there is still hope and time to address the climate crisis if concerted action is taken globally. He believes that the combination of public awareness, technological innovation, and political will can lead to positive outcomes.

7. **Education and Awareness**: The final point emphasized the importance of educating the public and policymakers about the urgency of climate change and the need for immediate action to mitigate its effects.

The lecture underscored the interconnectedness of environmental issues, the importance of scientific understanding, and the necessity for collaborative efforts to address global challenges such as climate change.

Checking William H. Calvin/NASA Green Lecture： Global Fever.txt
1. **Urgency for Climate Action**: The presenter emphasizes the urgency to reduce carbon emissions significantly within the next 10 years to avoid catastrophic climate change, specifically to prevent a global temperature increase beyond three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

2. **Current Emissions and Targets**: We are currently emitting about 9 gigatons of carbon per year. The goal is to reach net negative emissions, meaning we must remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit.

3. **Alternative Solutions for Carbon Reduction**:
   - Afforestation (planting more trees) is mentioned but is not a long-term solution due to limitations in space and water resources.
   - Ocean management, such as using iron piling or artificial photosynthesis, could potentially sink CO2. However, the ocean's carbon chemistry is less understood than the atmosphere's.
   - Artificial photosynthesis involves burning biomass to capture CO2 and store it long-term. This can be done through coal plant technology but with biomass as the fuel source.
   - Sealing biomass in landfills for 100 years is another method of carbon sequestration.

4. **Wave-Driven Pump Technology**: The presenter describes a wave-driven pump that can both bring deep water to the surface and sink surface waters using flexible tubes with flapper valves and weight rings, capitalizing on natural ocean waves.

5. **The Importance of Immediate Action**: The need for immediate progress in reducing carbon emissions is critical to avoid being in a precarious position later on when less maneuvering room could lead to worse outcomes, similar to a pilot who might not have enough speed to recover from a stall during takeoff.

6. **Climate Models**: The presenter notes that if greenhouse gas emissions peak and begin to decline by 2016 to 2020, there is a chance to keep global temperatures below two degrees Celsius. However, if significant action isn't taken until 2040, there's a high risk of temperatures increasing by three degrees or more.

In summary, the presenter is advocating for immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous climate change, leveraging various technologies and methods to achieve net negative carbon emissions. The window of opportunity to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius is narrowing, and every year counts in making progress towards this goal.

Checking William H. Calvin/Nuclear power plant control room during simulated emergency shutdown.txt
 It appears you are describing a situation in a nuclear power plant where there has been an incident involving drywall pressure that triggered a reactor scram (an emergency shutdown of the reactor). Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Reactor Scram**: The reactor has already been brought to less than 1% of full power due to a safety system activation, likely caused by an abnormal condition detected in the plant.

2. **Pressure Issues**: There is increased pressure within the reactor vessel and the drywall (which could be referring to containment structures or walls within the reactor building) is currently experiencing a pressure of 45 pounds. The wetwall pressure is at about 23 pounds, indicating a gradual increase from the initial condition.

3. **Temperature Monitoring**: The temperature at the point where the drywall touches is at 210 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within safe operational limits for such environments.

4. **Cooling Systems**: All cooling systems are operational and currently moving approximately 50,000 gallons per minute of water into the reactor vessel to ensure the reactor remains cool and stable as it shuts down.

5. **Reactor Vessel Pressure**: The pressure in the reactor vessel is at 52 pounds, which needs to be monitored and managed carefully to maintain safety and stability within the plant.

In summary, the situation has been recognized, and the necessary emergency procedures have been initiated. The plant's systems are working to manage both the pressure and temperature to ensure the reactor remains safe and stable following the scram event. Emergency response protocols would be in effect to monitor the situation closely and to take further actions as needed to maintain safety and prevent any escalation of the incident.

Checking William H. Calvin/Our Kind of Language： Mindreading writ large (4th of 5).txt
1. **Language Complexity and Cheating Detection**: The mental bookkeeping needed to detect cheaters in reciprocal exchanges is similar to the requirements for understanding complex language structures, particularly the use of verbs like "give" or "bring" that necessitate three nouns to form a complete sentence.

2. **Emergence of Long Sentences**: In pre-language stages, humans could understand individual words and simple sentences, but the leap to understanding complex grammar required vocal mimicry and exposure to longer sentences, which could be facilitated by adult conversations or gossip, especially in settings that require attention to detail like toolmaking.

3. **Role of Early Mimicry**: While vocal mimicry is not unique to humans and can be observed in some bird species, great apes, our close relatives, do not perform it well. However, early humans may have begun to master this skill as they evolved socially.

4. **Language Transmission**: For language to become widespread within a group, there must be individuals who already understand and use complex sentence structures. These individuals set the standard for others to learn from, which can involve inventing or learning conventions like case marking (e.g., using "he" for an actor and "him" for an object of the action).

5. **Learning and Development**: Children learn syntax and grammar by listening to longer sentences, and their earlier experiences with language shape their ability to use it more effectively as adults. This learning process is influenced by soft wiring in the brain that can be honed through practice.

6. **Rewards of Complex Thought**: The development of higher intellectual functions, including creativity, complex problem-solving, planning, and understanding polyphonic music, appears to be closely linked to the ability to process and produce complex language. These advanced cognitive abilities are rewarding and enriching for humans.

7. **Next Lecture**: In the following lecture, the focus will be on creativity, planning, and higher intellectual functions, exploring how these capabilities evolved and were facilitated by the development of complex language structures.

8. **Further Reading**: The lecturer suggests looking into three of his books for more in-depth information on the topics discussed.

Checking William H. Calvin/Our Kind of Looking Ahead： Higher Intellectual Functions (5th of 5).txt
1. **Ethical Decision-Making**: Professor Jared Diamond discusses the importance of ethical decision-making, which relies heavily on human-unique abilities like imagination and empathy. These abilities have only been part of human behavior for a small fraction of our existence as Homo sapiens (around 1% of the time since our species appeared).

2. **Human Societies as Beta Test**: Society is like a program that's still in beta testing, with imperfections and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hot buttons and political marketing experts. These manipulate our emotions and bypass rational thinking.

3. **Existential Crises**: There are two major existential crises facing humanity:
   - Autocratic governments that restrict freedom, abandon the 99%, and ignore pressing issues like climate change for the sake of profits.
   - A potential large-scale population crash due to societal instability, which could lead to a significant decline in human numbers, making it difficult for the remaining elite to recover their positions.

4. **Historical Context**: Throughout history, civilizations have collapsed 22 times, as detailed by Jared Diamond in his work. The current global society is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on just-in-time delivery systems and a lack of significant food reserves.

5. **Up from the Apes**: In future lectures, Professor Diamond plans to delve deeper into the origins and social aspects of humanity, as well as our potential futures, based on the framework he presented in his book "Up from the Apes."

6. **Final Thoughts**: Human beings are unique in their capacity to understand their origins, their nature, and even some aspects of their destiny. As a species, we have the power to shape our future, but we must first address the current challenges we face.

7. **Quote by Dan Dunlop**: The lecture concludes with a reminder from author and biologist Richard Dawkins' collaborator, Dan Dunlop, that humans are doers who have the unique ability to understand our place in the universe. We are at a crossroads where our decisions and actions will determine our path forward.

Checking William H. Calvin/Putting the CO2 Genie Back in the Bottle.txt
1. **The Issue**: The current level of CO2 in the atmosphere is unsustainable and could double by 2030 due to natural releases from permafrost melting, among other factors. This would exacerbate climate change and its effects significantly.

2. **The Urgency**: Given the rapid pace of environmental changes and the potential for more unexpected shifts in the climate system, there is a strong argument for immediate action to mitigate the impact of CO2 buildup. The comparison is made to a four-alarm fire that requires immediate attention.

3. **Historical Precedent**: History shows that when faced with a critical situation, such as World War II, societies have been able to rapidly mobilize resources and change behavior to address the challenge at hand.

4. **The Goal**: The proposed solution is a large-scale project aimed at removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it safely. This would require setting an easily understood goal, like having all CO2 removed by 2030, and a clear timeframe.

5. **Intellectual and Industrial Capability**: The speaker believes that with intellectual and industrial capabilities, we have the means to undertake such a project and should not settle for just clean air, clean energy, and other sustainability measures, as these are insufficient to address the current crisis.

6. **Current State of Affairs**: Daily activities, like airplane flights, show that we are still operating under "business as usual" conditions, despite the knowledge of the climate crisis.

7. **Action Recommendation**: The speaker advocates for immediate and decisive action to begin work on large-scale CO2 removal technologies, using the analogy that public interest demands doing today what intelligent and well-meaning people would wish had been done a few years in the future.

8. **Technological Potential**: The speaker points out that with the right political will and focus, projects that might otherwise take decades to develop could be accelerated to just a couple of years.

9. **Q&A Invitation**: The speaker concludes by inviting questions from the audience and emphasizing the importance of immediate action to address climate change through large-scale CO2 removal efforts.

Checking William H. Calvin/Rethinking Climate  Opening a Second Front in the Climate War (CALVIN).txt
1. **Climate Misconceptions**: Emissions reduction alone (the "first front") is not sufficient to address the current state of climate change. While reducing emissions is still crucial for long-term sustainability and other goals, it is too little, too late for the accumulated CO2 already in the atmosphere.

2. **Urgency of Climate Action**: The focus should shift to immediate and large-scale interventions (the "second front") that can mitigate the effects of climate change more directly and quickly. These interventions are akin to Manhattan projects, requiring significant design, prototyping, and field testing.

3. **Climate Emergency**: We are at a critical point where inaction or slow action could lead to disaster, with the potential for resource wars, increased extreme weather events, and societal collapse. The urgency is such that we may not have the luxury of a second chance if these interventions fail the first time.

4. **Possible Interventions**: These include measures like creating shade to reflect sunlight away from the Earth, large-scale CO2 removal technologies, and building resilience against climate impacts. The goal is to stabilize the situation before it spirals out of control.

5. **Strategic Approach**: The approach to tackling the climate crisis needs to be strategic, focusing on immediate and substantial actions that can work effectively the first time around. This involves recognizing the gravity of the situation and acting accordingly.

6. **William H. Calvin's Perspective**: As a professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the president of the CO2 Foundation, William H. Calvin emphasizes the need for big and quick interventions to address the immediate threats posed by climate change, such as extreme weather events and global droughts. His work has been instrumental in raising awareness about the potential for abrupt climate shifts, including the role of Gulf stream failures.

Checking William H. Calvin/The 2nd Opinion： What to Do About Climate.txt
1. **The Problem with Climate Change**: The current focus on reducing emissions and controlling CO2 levels is insufficient. The real risk is the potential for a sudden climate crash that could trigger catastrophic crop failures, leading to global food shortages, political instability, and potentially worse scenarios like war and genocide.

2. **A Proposed Solution**: The speaker suggests a large-scale intervention to stimulate plankton growth in the oceans as a means to draw down excess CO2 from the atmosphere. This would involve using wave-powered pumps to create artificial plankton blooms, which could then be harvested by fishermen. Preliminary calculations indicate that approximately 1% of the world's ocean surface, an area roughly the size of the Caribbean, would be needed for this purpose.

3. **Economic Feasibility**: The cost of implementing this solution is estimated at $1 billion over 20 years, which is a small fraction of what was spent on financial bailouts or what Americans spend on dog food in a single month. The speaker argues that the economic means to address climate change are available if there is the political will to act.

4. **Political Will and Urgency**: The speaker expresses concern over the current political climate, questioning whether humanity has the collective wisdom and political willpower to avoid a self-destructive trajectory. He compares the situation to terminal kidney patients before the widespread availability of dialysis, suggesting that without swift action, civilization could fall into a downward spiral.

5. **Call to Action**: The speaker emphasizes that there are ways to mitigate climate change effectively and calls for a renewed effort to mobilize politically and economically to implement solutions like the one proposed. The message is one of urgency and hope, highlighting that while the situation is serious, it is not hopeless if we act decisively.

Checking William H. Calvin/The Early Career of Charles F. Stevens (1934-2022).txt
 Charles Sherrington, a pioneering neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate, influenced many fields with his work on the nervous system, including the understanding of neuronal communication. His student Irwin Mayer further developed Sherrington's techniques, leading to the invention of the patch clamp method, which revolutionized the field of electrophysiology.

The speaker, reflecting on their own journey that intersected with Sherrington's legacy, describes how they ventured into climate science after recognizing the importance of environmental factors in brain evolution, particularly during the ice ages when human brain size tripled rapidly. This led to a deep dive into atmospheric science and oceanography to understand the drivers behind such rapid evolutionary changes.

The speaker emphasizes the urgency of addressing climate instability, which has shifted from gradual change to sudden surges in extreme weather events. They draw parallels between the medical profession's approach to preventing collapse and the need for a similar mindset in addressing climate change, given the lead time required for effective interventions.

In a personal note, the speaker recounts Charles Sherrington's unexpected passing during the night, highlighting the importance of absorbing the wisdom of mentors like him. The speaker hopes that the community continues to learn from such pioneers and apply their insights to overcome current challenges, including those posed by a rapidly changing climate.

The speech serves as a tribute to Charles Sherrington's legacy and a call to action for addressing the urgent issue of climate instability, drawing on the principles of science and critical thinking that Sherrington embodied throughout his career.

Checking William H. Calvin/The Evolution of Human Minds.txt
1. **Historical Efficiency**: Our brains have evolved to be highly efficient for survival, but our ability to plan effectively for future generations has not faced the same selective pressures and thus may be limited by biases like status quo bias and a tendency to avoid making decisions when faced with too many choices.

2. **Rationality Limitations**: Our rational decision-making is often hindered by biases, such as valuing current possessions more than potential future gains, which makes it challenging to prioritize long-term investments like addressing climate change over immediate benefits.

3. **Climate Change Urgency**: The rate of carbon emissions into the atmosphere has been increasing and needs to be drastically reduced by 2020 to avoid catastrophic climate change effects. If we manage to reduce emissions, we can start removing CO2 from the air and potentially reverse some of the damage caused by climate change.

4. **Technological Solutions**: To address the carbon emission issue, a combination of technologies must be implemented quickly:
   - Transitioning to plug-in hybrid vehicles to reduce gasoline and petrol use.
   - Expanding nuclear and geothermal energy production to replace coal.
   - Rapidly scaling up wind and solar energy to contribute to emission reduction.
   - Developing infrastructure for long-distance transmission of electricity, such as high-capacity power lines, to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuels.

5. **Global Cooperation**: The challenge requires global cooperation and immediate action. If we can stop the growth of emissions by 2020, it might be possible to reverse their trend by 2040, thereby saving a significant portion of Earth's biodiversity and preventing the worst effects of climate change on civilization.

In essence, the speaker is emphasizing that our cognitive biases can hinder our ability to plan effectively for long-term challenges like climate change, which requires immediate and concerted action on a global scale. The consequences of inaction could be dire, not only for the environment but also for human civilization as we know it.

1. **Grazer-Specific Evolutionary Theory**: The theory proposes that the rapid evolution of traits in African grazers like wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles, such as larger brains in some species, is driven by a feedback loop involving selective opportunity and hitchhiking effects. This process can occur much faster than typical Darwinian selection because it amplifies beneficial mutations to fixation in the population quickly.

2. **Selective Opportunity**: The unpredictable nature of the environment, with periodic droughts and overabundance of food (boom-and-bust cycles), creates a selective opportunity for traits that help individuals survive these conditions. These conditions are particularly intense in the African rift valley, where many grazers and early humans evolved.

3. **Hitchhiking Effects**: Any trait that is beneficial in the context of these selection opportunities (like gathering in shaded areas) can be enhanced due to its association with survival. This hitchhiking effect means that alleles for such traits are more likely to reach fixation in the population.

4. **Implications Beyond Grazer Evolution**: The theory suggests that the feedback loop mechanism could also explain other rapid evolutionary changes, such as the emergence of eusocial behavior (like cooperative childcare) in a few mammalian species and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans.

5. **Next Topics**: The lecturer will explore the origins and characteristics of human language and consciousness in the upcoming lectures, highlighting how these traits may have evolved through similar rapid feedback loop processes.

In summary, the theory presented suggests that rapid evolutionary changes can occur when beneficial mutations are quickly driven to fixation due to intense selective pressures, creating opportunities for the hitchhiking of advantageous traits. This has implications across various aspects of evolution and could provide insights into the development of complex traits in humans, such as language and consciousness.

1. **Climate Change and Deforestation**: James Lovelock discusses the potential for a large-scale deforestation event, particularly in the Amazon or Borneo rainforests, which could significantly exacerbate climate change. A fire of this magnitude would release approximately 40 parts per million of additional CO2 into the atmosphere, and the absence of trees and leaves to absorb some of it would double the rate at which our atmosphere becomes saturated with CO2. This could lead to a mass extinction event similar to those caused by meteor impacts.

2. **The Impact of El Niño**: Lovelock mentions that we cannot predict when such an El Niño event might occur, but the last significant event was in 1999, and historically, they have occurred roughly every 10 to 15 years, with a longer gap between them.

3. **Urgency for Action**: Lovelock emphasizes the need for immediate action to mitigate climate change, noting that we already have long-term solutions for energy production, such as nuclear and deep geothermal power plants. He suggests that converting passenger vehicles to plug-in hybrids and focusing on renewable energy sources are crucial steps that can be taken in the near term (by 2020).

4. **Global Effort**: The challenge of climate change is global, and Lovelock points out that developing countries, which may wish to modernize using coal and oil, need assistance in transitioning to cleaner energy sources like nuclear and deep geothermal power plants. These options are viable because they don't require extensive training and can be managed locally.

5. **Historical Precedent for Rapid Change**: Lovelock references the United States' response to World War II as an example of how quickly a country can adapt and change its industrial output from civilian to military applications when there is a clear and present danger. He suggests that we should approach the climate crisis with a similar sense of urgency.

6. **Quotable Wisdom**: Lovelock concludes with a quote from a 19th-century statesman, Edmund Burke, who said that the public interest requires doing today what intelligent and well-meaning people would wish had been done five or ten years ago. This underscores the importance of taking immediate action to address climate change.

In summary, Lovelock warns of the potential for a catastrophic deforestation event that could significantly worsen climate change, he urges immediate and decisive global action to transition to sustainable energy sources, and he points to historical examples of rapid change as evidence that we have the capacity to address this crisis with urgency and determination.

1. **Lifestyle Leading to Humans**: The lecture begins by discussing the lifestyle of our early human ancestors, focusing on their diet as consumers of meat from large herbivores that were initially hunted and killed by lions. It highlights the importance of sharp-edged tools or flakes for butchering animals.

2. **Ecological Landscape**: The lecture shifts to describe the ecological settings conducive to human evolution, particularly the savannah ecosystems found in regions like the Serengeti-Saimara eco-system. This environment is characterized by a mosaic of gallery forests, woodlands, grasslands, and brush, which are shaped by factors such as water availability, soil thickness, and fire frequency.

3. **Forest Fragmentation**: Around 6 to 2 million years ago, African forests began to fragment, leading to an expansion of woodland habitats that were more suitable for our hominid ancestors. These ancestors adapted to exploit the resources available in these environments, which supported larger populations.

4. **Adaptation and Survival**: The lecture emphasizes that this ecological setup facilitated rapid evolution due to the compounding of interest, with environmental changes such as wildfires and climate shifts causing transformations in habitats, leading to population booms among grass-eating herbivores and their predators, including early humans.

5. **Future Topics**: The lecture teases future topics that will delve into the feedback loops responsible for human populations' boom and bust cycles, as well as the aspects of human language, creativity, and foresight that have enabled us to innovate and adapt to new environments and challenges.

In summary, the lecture provides an overview of how the ecological setting of savannah landscapes, with their diverse habitats, played a crucial role in the evolution of human ancestors by promoting conditions for rapid adaptation and population growth. The focus is on the interplay between environmental factors, prey availability, and predator-prey dynamics, which set the stage for the emergence of Homo sapiens.
