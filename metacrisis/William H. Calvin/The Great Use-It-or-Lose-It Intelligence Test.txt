It's a great pleasure of mine to be able to welcome our distinguished guests, our CGIAR
partners, members and center and challenge program directors and staff, all of the friends
of the CGIAR, to the 23rd Sir John Crawford Memorial Lecture.
I have the great pleasure to introduce this year's Crawford lecturer, Professor William
Calvin. A theoretical neurobiologist, Professor Calvin is an affiliate professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle. He's the author
of numerous books about brains and evolution. Speaking from this background, I believe that
Professor Calvin will give us a fresh, fresh perspective on tonight, on many of the items
that we have been discussing this week, but help us think beyond the typical point of
view. It's now my great pleasure to welcome Professor Calvin to the podium to deliver his
lecture entitled, The Great Use It or Lose It, Intelligence Test. Professor Calvin.
Thank you. I thank the organizers for being so kind as to invite me and I'm particularly
honored, of course, to be able to speak in this magnificent hall. For those of you who
have not had a chance to survey all the paintings, I recommend you do so. That's Mount Rainier
in Seattle, just to show you one of the endangered volcanoes. We can see four or five of them
from Good Hilltop in Seattle. Later this century, the prediction is they will have lost all
their ice. That will be a more serious problem in South America, where that ice goes to provide
the water supply for our cities in the Andes. So I'm going to spend a bit of time, first
of all, introducing, I'm going to spend a little bit of time introducing human evolution
to you, the evolution of intelligence is surprisingly more recent than we had thought. And then
I'm going to take upon myself the topic of trying to explain to you what's happening with
climate these days. We started out on the path up from the apes about seven million years
ago when our ancestors became upright, but their brain size really didn't change for
about four, five million years. We became essentially bipedal upright apes living in
woodlands. About 2,500 years ago is when the ice ages began. It's also when our brains began
to get a bit bigger and a lot of stone tool making appears. But it's quite a lot longer
before we get to Homo sapiens, our species. People that look like us, have big brains
like us been around for about 200,000 years, but they didn't act like us. In the archeological
record, you don't see things that really look like. They thought like us until about 50,000
years ago. So things like the cave art, here's perspective even at 35,000 years ago. And there's
no doubt we're dealing with a creative intelligence at this point. This happened in the middle
of the last ice age. This is temperature that's being graphed for you here. And the previous
warm period about 125,000 years ago is over there on the left. And our warm period is
over on the right. And you can see that our warm periods in its agriculture again has been
remarkably stable compared to what preceded it. Those rapid flips take about 5 or 10
years to make the transition. Remarkably fast. So we became behavior heavily modern. This
creative explosion occurred in the midst of real chaos in terms of whatever climate you
were born into was likely to change in your or your grandchildren's lifetime into another
state. We flipped from a warm and wet climate down into a cool, dry, windy, dusty climate.
And after a few centuries, we're right back up again. Once things settled down a little
bit into warm and wet, it took about 2,000 years before agriculture really got going.
And what makes it possible to settle down, really keep roaming around, is having domesticated
enough species to make a basic diet. That happened in China with rice, millet, pigs,
and soapworms by about 9,500 years ago. And in the Levant, it was an entirely different
to a set of domesticated species about the same time. At that time, the Sahara was in
the so-called pluvial stage. Sahara had grass all over it. It had grazing animals. There
were elephants. There were lots of lions. And there were lots of humans hunting. It's
in this period that we see agriculture also developing, typically in the better places.
And by about 6,000 to 5,000 years ago, the Sahara was changing to the desert that we
now know. And there's a particularly big step around 5,200 years ago. Now that may be
familiar to you as 3,200 BCE, and that's basically the ancient kingdoms in Egypt. It's about
the same time the Tigus or Freydes. The river civilizations that had to do a lot of irrigation,
they needed a lot of organization to do the irrigation along the river. This meant a lot
of taxes, tax accountants, and that's basically where writing was invented. All right. It
took what we got with that, besides taxes and writing, is we got cities, specialized
occupations. We got armies at this point. Science is an organized endeavor, has only
been around for about the last 500 years. So the last 1% of the up from the apes time.
And climate science has been around for only about 50 years, really. And it's basically
ever since the oceanographers figured out that the oceans weren't going to take up all the
CO2 that we were putting in the atmosphere, and that we were indeed going to be in trouble.
So I'm a medical school professor, and we sort of look at the tension between uncertainty
and risk somewhat differently. We try to train physicians to always remember that there's
a clock running. The patient may deteriorate rapidly. You can't spend too much time trying
to make sure you're right of the diagnosis before you begin to act. We have a aphorism
that says the doc who waits till dead certain of diagnosis before beginning treatment is
likely to wind up with a dead patient. And it's that perspective of risk and doing things
to avoid risk that I'd like to concentrate on tonight. I'm going to do it by telling you
in the first half some of the history of the subject, and particularly we've already had
50 years of climate change. Then that will lead me into some more familiar terrain about
the way we produce our extra CO2 and what could be done quite differently. And then
I'm going to concentrate at the end upon the, what I'm calling the tortoise and the
hare analogy. The IPCC reports that talk about having gradually reduce our emissions and
things of that sort in order to hold it down to a two or three degree temperature rise,
that those things can be preempted by sudden things that may happen in the meantime. I'm
going to show you some sudden things that have already happened that we've just recognized.
The first thing I'm going to tell you about is how much light gets reflected back out
in space before it can heat things up. That's to say bright surfaces like clouds or ice
or snow, deserts, reflect back of 50 to 90 percent sometimes of the incoming light and
bounce it right back out. This is what agriculture sometimes changes. This is Tiger Shafredi's
valley. It shows how bright things are and that smudge in the middle are green leaves.
This is mostly from irrigation, but that changes the amount of heat absorbed by the earth.
In other words, when you change a bright desert into a green area, you're also warming the
earth by doing it. Agricultural herding practices make a difference too. This is the border between
Egypt and Israel in the Sinai Desert. The very first pictures back from space and satellites
remarked upon this feature because no other national boundaries are usually visible from
outer space, but this one is. It's a difference between whether there are goats around or
not. On the Israeli side, they prohibit grazing in a nature preserve and as you see in the
upper right corner, there's patches of vegetation that get going in mounds and their root systems
are stabilized soil there. That's what the goats hooves tend to break apart. When winds
come along and pick up the sands, you get a lot of burial of things, the active dune systems
pictured on the left. Here's a lesson basically about how much light gets reflected back and
how quickly, basically overnight, it can change. Fresh snow, sort of powder snow that
steers love, reflects about 90% of light back into space. 10% goes in to heat things. After
the surface is melted, just for one afternoon, the next day it's going to reflect back only
70%. Now that represents a tripling of the amount of heat absorbed by the earth. And
the same thing happens when you darken the surface with dust blowing in or soot. The
picture here is a maple leaf laying on top of the snow that has dug itself in quite a
ways because it absorbs the heat very nicely and melts the snow underneath. This is a picture
of the top of the world looking down on the North Pole. And you can see the U.S. and Canada
over on the left. You can see the expanse of Siberia. And you can see Europe very well.
The ice in the middle is floating ice. The North Pole is right under that E in winter.
The ice in Greenland right below it is about three kilometers thick. Floating ice is about
three meters thick. Basically, if you add more snow on top of it, you just melt some
off the bottom. And it never gets much thicker than that. If you dug a basement up there
for a house, you'd find a swimming pool. Now, ocean waters absorb most of the sunlight
that hits them. So when ice melts back, there is about a nine-fold increase in the heat
being absorbed. And that's one of the reasons that ice can melt back very quickly. This
is another source of atmospheric heating. This is a fascinating little movie that I
made up of the NASA's Terra satellite that has an instrument on it that can pick up
such things as fires and chlorophyll. And this just shows you the annual round of agricultural
fires. It really shows you where agriculture is, at least the kind that makes use of this
planting time. The problem with this is that it's much more soot in the atmosphere around
the year than ever existed back in the days of mirror forest fires. There's just nothing
like this that happened before agriculture. Now I'm going to talk a little bit about what's
been happening in the last 50 years. We've been seeing more extreme weather. This picture
shows you three typhoons at once in the water south of Japan. This happened last year. It's
not a composite picture. All three of those were there on the same day. And we're also
seeing such things as heat waves, 35,000 excess deaths in Europe during a few week period
in 2003. One of the reasons you get higher winds with global warming is that the land
warms up more than the oceans do. The oceans don't run out of water for evaporative cooling
and the land surface does. And so the greater temperature contrast means much higher winds
connecting them too. As wind speed goes up, so do damages. You might think that if the
wind speed were to go up 20% from say 50 miles an hour to 60, that the damage that the insurance
company has to pay would go up 20%. But no, it goes up 500%. That is what we call a nonlinear
response. And the world is full of them. We've seen some fairly spectacular things with
high winds in the United States. This is about 20 highway trucks like this were blown over
one night on a major interstate highway. And I use it here to emphasize that it's the widening
of the extremes more than the changes in the average that tend to do the damage. Wider
extremes gets closer to thresholds where things flip and trucks flipping over is a good example.
This happened in a Seattle suburb where Bill Gates lives, a few blocks down the street
from this, and it's a large garbage truck that blew over on a nice red Mercedes convertible.
And you're familiar in agriculture with a flip threshold that has to do with losing a
second crop if the rains or the blades fish at land in the springtime. Those are the kinds
of examples that cause a lot of human problems. Now one of the earliest examples that we've
seen was to, could you still hear me? Can you still hear me? One of the earliest things
the models did was to predict that we were going to get less rain at say Mediterranean
latitudes, that we were going to get more rain up at the higher latitudes, say in northern
Europe. That certainly proved to be the case. But somewhere in between you would think there's
the spot where the rain doesn't change. And that may be true that the average rain doesn't
change. But the predictions of the climate models are that you'll have more extreme weather
to create that same unchanged average. I'd say there will be more floods and more droughts
mixed into that average. Now we call this more extreme weather, and we call this more
climate and it applies in many places. It certainly makes obsolete such notions as the
hundred year floods. Insurance companies like to rely upon for setting their premiums. There
have been more major floods every decade since 1950. This is from the IPCC report, and what
shows you in the Americas is the 1950s, the 60s, 70s, the 80s, and the 90s. With the number
of major floods climbing every decade, this is not peculiar to the Americas. It's true
elsewhere. You can see Asia has gone up spectacularly in terms of major floods. So is Africa, so
is Europe. So this is not just trouble that is moving around. Moving in lock step like
this is evidence of real climate change. Sometimes the climate change also takes a jump. And you
see that particularly for drought. If you are plotting here the drought as a, how much
of the land surface is in drought at any one time. Back in the 1970s, it used to be 15%.
Then in the mid 1980s, it took a jump. It went up to 25% and stayed there. Something
you only recognize in retrospect when you realize the variations are occurring around
the country. There have even been jumps up to 35%. So this is the kind of thing that the
models are saying will happen, but as we look back at the record, we've seen that they've
already been happening. So the models have been very good, but by and large they have
understated the problems. Most of the climate models we have made were quantitatively pretty
good, qualitatively pretty good, but things were worse than they predicted. So climate
does jump from one state to another judging from drought. You can also see it in most
of the areas around the world that have a Mediterranean climate. Now let me tell you
what a Mediterranean climate is in case you don't know and I'll tell you the reason why.
With it hotter around the equator, there's a lot of hot, moist air that rises. So mostly
it falls back into the ocean's rain, but the air that goes up has to come back down someplace
and it tends to come down in a band at a bit higher latitudes that surround this whole
area collectively as known as the tropics, but it's obviously that it's dry up further
from the equator about 20 to 30, sometimes 35 degrees. The Mediterranean zones of the
world are where you basically don't have rainfall in the summertime, but you do have rainfall
during the winter time. Basically what happens is that during the winter time, this is where
the westerly winds begin and low pressure systems manage to sneak in and deliver moisture
during the winter. What seems to be happening now is the tropics are widening. It's a few
hundred kilometers already by now and what this does is it expands of the whole picture
and now the dry zones where there's not much winter rain that manages to get in is beginning
to cover North Africa. It's certainly covering southern Australia as you see. It's causing
problems up in California. It's also causing problems down in Chile. These are about training
requirements are on the west side of continents because the westerly winds are bringing in
the moisture. Here's Western Australia from a satellite view of false color. All the brown
stuff is parched as vegetation during the dry season. Perse water reservoirs have been
having a great deal of trouble. In 1975, their average intake each year, which is about
from the streams, from the runoff of the area, fell by half and it stayed there. In 1997,
it dropped down to one third. That goes along with what I'm showing you at least in the
mid-80s, you could see it in the worldwide tolls, major things have been happening already.
So again, we're talking here about climate can jump from one state to another. There are
some things like those gradually increasing floods through five decades that look gradual,
but there's other parts that tell you things are happening in jumps. Here is Southern California's
Mediterranean climate and these are the fires that occurred a month ago. Red dots are fires
and this picture shows you the aftermath. It's false color, the reds are recently burned
areas. So there's very substantial areas from summer fires up here and all along through
here shows you the enormous amount of land which was burned in these fires. Again, this
is not the one I showed you before, which was floods. This is major wildfires since 1950
and again decade by decade in the Americas it has soared. In Europe it's gone way up,
in Asia it's way up, in Australia in the east it's gone way up and in Africa it's gone
way up. Some of this of course is nicely correlated with temperature. This is just the western
U.S. record for spring and summer temperatures. The black line is the temperature and the
red bars are the number of major forest fires that year and you see there's a very nice
correlation. If you're having a particularly hot year, the fires are way up because the
land becomes parched much more readily. Now we tend to assume in our reasoning about
carbon inputs in the atmosphere that in agriculture what is cut down and lost as CO2 to the atmosphere
through fire or decomposition will be replaced later in the year by new growth that will
take out an equivalent amount of carbon from the air. It's not really equivalent because
there's a lot of loss from muddy waters for irrigation and the like that are included
in that. But if a forest burns or dead wood decomposes it may take a century to recapture
that carbon from the air. So it's not like agriculture at all and if we're having to
live on the time scale of the century any major forest fire like this is sure lost to
us in the sense of coping with our carbon problem. There's an additional peculiarity
and that is if the Amazon burns it will not grow back at all. There's a peculiarity in
the hydrological cycle for the Amazon that says it will revert to savanna. So in the
future we'll talk about getting into hot water by which I mean oceans initially. This
shows the oceans around the world are warming. The six lines are from six major ocean basins
of the world while sort of normalize to a common level. And it shows you that there's
since 1975 or 30 years there's been a nice upwards trend with a gap in the middle here
of a few years and that's the Mount Pinatubo eruption you know this thing. Injected sulfates
well up into the stratosphere and they attract enough moisture to them that they become very
shiny. This produces a haze and that reflects sunlight back in the space. This is a way of
cooling the earth and there's a lot of discussions going on about geoengineering of whether we
could help survive heat waves for example by some man made injections of sulfate into
the stratosphere. But that sort of approach to our heating problem will not solve the
other CO2 problem and it's beginning to get serious. The other thing that the CO2 does
because about half of it so far the excess has been taken up by the oceans that causes
them to become more acidic. Which in turn becomes more corrosive to the shells of the zooplankton
and the coral. The projection is that first of all it's already fallen over the last century
about one tenth of the pH unit or rhythm scale. And the models suggest two to three tenths
more per century. That's well into the range where if the coral reef isn't dead already
it will be dead and reabsorbed into the ocean. So they will be sort of crumbling like sugar
cubes in the iced tea and going into solution. Here's a reminder that hurricanes, typhoons,
tropical cyclones is the scientific name, thrive on hotter surfaces. But the hot water
by itself causes a great deal of damage to the coral reefs. And from the 2005 hurricane
season in the Gulf of Mexico there's a real disaster with the coral. The whole path coming
in to the Gulf of Mexico got sufficiently hot for enough days during this to kill off
a great deal of the coral in these regions that are colored red-orange. It's been verified
for example by the divers in the Virgin Islands National Park and they reported that even
down to a 70 meter depth there were now dead coral reefs. The other thing of course that
heats up is the air and particularly at the high latitudes. The reddish colors in this
represent several degrees Celsius of warming, about three degrees Fahrenheit. And each point
is evaluated against its temperature from about 40 years ago. And so these are all regions
that just in 2001 to 2006 have been warming up. And so these are all regions that just
I think heard what will happen to the polar bears in this circumstance. It will be a great
population crash. But this is what's been happening to the pack ice that they thrive
on. This again is looking down the top of the world, the black dot is the north pole.
And this is floating ice, several meters or more thick. And this shows you the amount
that's left in September at the end of the season where it shrinks. So this is the minimum
averaged over about 30 years. This is what happened this year. If any of you can see
the little green line going up there, that's two years ago. So I'd point out here there's
no sea level rise from this because it's floating already and just like ice cubes in the glass
it's not going to change the level. However, much of the ice that we have to worry about
is perched on top of land where it can be, in the case of Greenland, about three kilometers
thick, as opposed to the three meters perhaps for sea ice. And it's the question of that
Greenland ice or ant-West Antarctic ice melting that are the big concerns. Because they have
two ways of raising sea level. One is dripping water in and the other is just sliding off
of the land into the ocean. And these are the areas around the edges of Greenland that
had been warming up particularly in the summer of 2005 compared to previous years. And this
is the biggest of the outlet glaciers from Greenland. This is at Yakup Sabin at about 69
degrees north on the left side. That ice stream is eight kilometers wide and it advances at
about 30 to 40 meters each day, which is twice as fast as a decade ago. So let's talk about
sea level rise now. We have records that show what happened the last time about half of Greenland
melted. It's happened 125,000 years ago in the last warm period in the ice age. And sea
level then rose at least six meters more than our present level. Because Greenland and the
other high northern latitudes were particularly hot in summertime at that point. And the sea
level rise is not only from the Greenland itself, but as the sea level rose down in Antarctic
it probably let loose some of its ice. The important thing to remember here is that this
melting takes about three degrees in Greenland to do this. But you get three degrees in Greenland
from a 1.6 degree global warming. The northern latitudes like the middle of continents you
have to multiply by about two to find out the local temperature compared to the global
mean. Well, here's what happens with a six meter rise in sea level. Here is the Florida
Peninsula sticking out into the Gulf of Mexico. And the red all around shows you the six foot,
six meter elevation line. The white dots that you see are people. It shows you the population
density. You can see Orlando there in the middle and even it has a new waterfront in the suburbs.
But most of the people live around the edge of Florida and that's at least 15 million
climate refugees. This shows you the part of the east coast of the U.S. Down at the bottom
you'll notice there's 150 kilometer incursion. You'll notice the Chesapeake Bay doubles and
triples in width. Boston up at the top gets covered to the extent that MIT is underwater
but Harvard is higher up on the hill and Harvard will remain as a little peninsula sticking
out to the new Boston Bay. That's how serious the problem is in protecting this. The shoreline
of the Gulf and the east coast of the United States are about 12,000 miles, say 19 kilometers.
That's an awful lot of territory to see all around. I don't think it will happen. If it
does, the cement required to do it will make global warming ever so much worse because
making cement turns out to release an enormous amount of CO2. Well, here's the Washington
DC. Nice aerial photograph from Google, of course. And it shows you the White House up
here, Pennsylvania Avenue, Capitol Hill down here. All your favorite art galleries and
museums along the mall. And if they don't start paying attention, this will remind them.
That's what a six meter sea level rise will back up to Potomac River enough to do. Now
I would say never fear here. The World Bank will be above it all. Unfortunately, the World
Bank will have a task like nothing else. This is what a six meter sea level rise in red
goes to the River Daltas of Asia. Bangladesh alone, about half of the land will be inundated.
Half of their population is about 70 million people. They're climate refugees and the
question is where are they going to move to? The same problem occurs all the way around
each major river delta. All the lowland areas. The last estimate I saw for the Yangtze was
about 93 million people displaced. These are going to be major problems. And that kind
of movement of people, particularly once across national borders, is not usually greeted in
a very friendly fashion. I think that climate refugees on the scale will cause probably
a lot of Jon Soutts. It's certainly been the history of humans. And I think that we
have to remember that this isn't going to be a gradual controlled dissent. That we are
likely to have very substantial chaos in the world. And the kind of chaos that will keep
people from investing money at any interest rate. And national governments that really
don't have the resources to cope with solving the climate problem anymore.
This shows you the Maldives. One of the countries that will disappear long before six meters.
The average elevation of the Maldives is 1.5. That's their capital city, Mali. A number
of island nations that are in this position. Now I come to the more traditional part where
I'm going to talk about CO2, where it comes from, the methane rise, and the whole notion
of CO2 equivalence that will allow us to look at the big picture a bit better.
This is the Keeling curve, named after Charles David Keeling. We died recently at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. And this shows you how the CO2 has been arriving
since measurement started in 1958. Measurements are made atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii, away from
industrial sources. So this is measuring trade winds coming along at the top of the peak
in order to sample the CO2. And you can see that the slope of the rise down here at the
bottom is about one-third what it is currently. So we've been putting out more and more, basically
since 1990 to 2005, the amount of emissions have gone up 35%. It's even worse than the
so-called business as usual scenarios that we use in climate models. That's how fast
we've been perturbing the situation. We have an additional source of CO2 measurement, and
that is we can measure CO2 from far into the past because they're preserved in ice bubbles
in Antarctica. You drill a big core down and you get it up, you can slice it up, and you
can put a slice, which has numerous air bubbles in it, in a chamber, pump out the air, and
then melt the ice and sample the atmospheric composition from half a million years ago,
which is what's shown here, a lovely exhibit at the Scripts of Oceanography at CSD. What
it shows you are the ice age variations in CO2. You get up to where that dotted line
is at the beginning of a warm period in the ice age. But we've never gone above that
peak at about 300 until now. We're now at about 380. We've really doubled the range. We're
so far outside of the normal range that anyone who goes around saying that what's happening
is just natural cycles of nature. We can't interfere with that. It really needs to be
reminded that there really is data on the subject. This is just a repeat on the top
of what you just saw, but you now see that the methane, which can be measured at the
same time, has been going up and down. Methane is the second largest greenhouse gas that
we have to worry about. The bottom trace is the temperature in Antarctica. You can get
all these out of the ice core. Over on the right, I've just spread out the scale for
the last 150 years. You can see that the temperature has been going up, but it hasn't
gone up anything like the greenhouse gases have. There have been some things that have
been preventing that. Part of that is all the muck in the atmosphere that reflects things
back out in space. Basically, particularly in the 1950 to 1975 era, when it sort of looked
like temperature wasn't rising, the rise was being massed by the exceptional smog that
we had. I certainly remember what that was like before the catalytic converter was invented.
I'd point out that methane's half-life in the atmosphere is about six years. As to say
if you go around to the natural gas pipelines and you tighten up on their leaks, which I
hope they're doing, because they leak about one to four percent of their total, if you
fix that, you get a pretty fast fix within a decade or so if you have that long to wait.
Carbon in the atmosphere doesn't come down for centuries. As I say, the half-time is
more like 200 years, and at least a fourth of it is left in 1,000 years from now. So
now, however, because we can treat methane, it's 23 times more potent than CO2 as a heat
trapper. We can take its concentration, multiply by 23, add it to CO2, and get the CO2 equivalent
as if the whole warming was done by CO2 instead. But we can do the same thing for the nitrous
oxide from fertilizers. We can do it with some of the albedo changes and other things
like cutting down trees. We can serve equate them all to one another in this CO2 equivalent
fashion, and that's where this pie chart comes from. What this shows you is that agricultural
kinds of things are this one-third on the right, lumping in land use changes because
most of them, in fact, are clearing land for agriculture. That's basically about one-third
of the problem. The rest of it comes from heating and lighting buildings, the transport
sectors, only 14 percent as it turns out. Electricity for all sorts of purposes is 24
percent, industrial uses, the fossil fuels, 14, and so on. I'm going to take here some
examples of how to change that that we already know about, where we don't have to engage
in much hand waving. I'm just going to show you a couple of examples of reforming at least
passenger car aspect. I remember very well when I was in Hungary before the Berlin Wall
fell, and it was an amazing collection of cars I had never seen before. I remember going
back about 1996, and a single one of those cars was left on the road. That's how fast
a whole transportation can turn over, and that's about what we thought to see if we
take seriously getting off of petroleum for doing our commuting. This is a hydrogen fuel
assault car that Honda is making in production quantities this next year. If you have a hydrogen
filling station around, you might be able to get one. They're mostly going to be sold
to fleets that do have one. There's another way, basically using electricity to produce
the hydrogen, and if the electricity is clean, so is the commuting. You can do the same thing
actually using compressed air. You can use electricity to compress air, and you can run
it through an engine whose pistons are driven by the compressed air being released, and
India will be producing about 6,000 of these next year to use as taxicabs. I should point
out that there is a particularly nice benefit from these. You think of engines as running
hot. This is an engine that will run cold from that expanding compressed air, and that
means the passengers will get free air conditioning. I can imagine this becoming very popular, and
it doesn't require the kinds of high-tech fuel cells and batteries that many countries
might not be able to import readily. Of course, there's the issue of using batteries on board
cars, either as plug-in hybrids or as all electric vehicles, and basically recharge them overnight.
Now if we start running short of electricity to use to do this, I have some candidates
for where I might get it from. This happens to be the Americas to show you what the street
lights are at night, seen from outer space. Incredible amount of electricity being wasted
to do this. Putting demand motion detectors on those street lights would save quite a lot
of electricity that could in turn be used for these either electric or compressed air
or hydrogen alternatives. So there's a number of things that are in the works, and there
are major sources like this to tap in conservation. Now, let me talk about the power sector for
a minute, because alternative ways of generating electricity are of particular concern, because
so much of it is now done with coal, which is twice as bad a greenhouse gas producer
as an equivalent kilowatt hour produced from natural gas, with oil somewhere in between.
So changing the mix of how we get our electricity is a big topic of discussion. I just want
to show you a little history. This shows you the years 1971, over on the left, and mid-part
of this decade, over on the right, and that just shows you how things changed over the
years. The U.S. is producing 140 percent more electricity over a 32-year period. Currently,
we're getting 68 percent of our electricity from fossil fuels, the gas, oil, and coal
added together. Here's a different way of doing it. France tried out, and France began
getting most of its growth, which amounts to 260 percent over the period. They got primarily
from nuclear. They're now in a situation, because they have 13 percent from hydro, that
91 percent of their electricity is clean, and only 9 percent is dirty. Looking around
the world, you'll see various figures on this. Even France's neighbors provide an interesting
58 percent fossil fuel in Germany, only 1 percent in Switzerland, and only 1 percent
in the U.K. It's 75 percent fossil fuel, and India and China are a bit above that. You
see an enormous variation around the world, and one of our responses has to be to learn
some lessons from those who have done it particularly well in the past. Here's a particularly instructive
example from the United States. This is the per capita use of electricity each year. The
average person in the U.S. was consuming about 4,000 kilowatt hours, and now it's up to about
three times that, but California in the 70s held it flat, quite remarkably, through a whole
series of things that they did. I'm not going to try to list them here, but I point out,
as they do, that they'd also save the consumers about $1,000 per family annually. There are
good lessons that we can learn from areas in the world that have done it differently.
I'd like to go out to the magnitude of the problem. We need several gigawatts. A gigawatt
is 1,000 megawatts, but it's the size of a nuclear plant. It's the size of a big coal
plant. A gigawatt is sort of my standard human. Due to band alone in China has got them constructing
in terms of that magnitude each week. The United States plans about that amount each
month. Of course, we only have one fourth of the world people as China does, but as we
began to use electricity from automobiles, we're going to need even more. Of course, we're
going to need a lot more to replace the fossil fuels. We really have to think big about how
we're going to tackle electricity production. As fond as people are of solar and wind, I
like to point out that they don't scale up very well. First of all, no one's built a
gigawatt of them maybe once, but certainly not very often, and certainly not on the scale
of once a week. They don't scale up for the following reason. They fluctuate. The cloud
comes along and the solar output drops down. A wind surge comes along and spins the wind
turbines faster and you can get a surge in the power lines. Our electrical grids are
unstable. That's why we have blackouts. It's only the skill of the operators in predicting
the load and tuning the generation that actually keeps them from collapsing much more regularly.
If you add a lot of stuff that naturally fluctuates, you're going to have a lot of blackouts unless
you invent some new control system to control the electrical grids and basically rebuild
them. I don't think we have time for that to happen. This shows you for the U.S. that
happens, all uses of electricity, 86% fossil fuel. This is including transportation now.
There's oil in this, 40% of which two thirds is imported, coal 23%, natural gas 23% of
the only clean ones are nuclear at 8% and there's a 6% which comes from that part on
top, about 3% biomass burning. That's corn stocks, sawdust and so forth. Hydroelectric
about the same amount. Geothermal is only a third of a percent of our total, but there's
a lot of room for expansion there. There's no room really for expansion in hydro in many
places, but basically to just get a nuclear sized slice that low 8% of what you need 10
of them to wipe out fossil fuel use, just to get one nuclear slice would take a 133
fold increase in solar, 66% increase in wind. These are really big. If you're going to
build a nuclear plant, it shows you the magnitude of the problem we face. Now you can add nuclear.
It's going to be possible in the U.S. to put up a new plant within about three years construction
time if you use a standard plan. And certainly the experience of the rest of the world, which
has been building nuclear, we haven't since 1978, but one's going to start in Texas next
year. The other thing on the horizon I'd like to mention, because almost no one's heard
of it, but it's starting up next year. Mostly you think of geothermal as being a hot springs
area thing. If you don't have a hot springs, why talk about it? But there's a new version
coming out that's thanks to the oil company's deep drilling techniques and their ways of
stimulating oil fields to get further production. Basically you drill down, avoiding water, you
drill down until you get into a hot rock that's about the temperature of a baking oven, about
several hundred degrees or so. And then you drill a second well down and you pump water
down one well and steam flashes up the other well and runs an old fashioned steam turbine.
This little steam turbine operation just sort of sets there, there's no trucks coming in
and out, there's no pollution, it's a small footprint. It's a pretty nice way of generating
electricity and it's suitable for developing countries in the sense that it just depends
on how deep you have to drill and how many of them you have to drill in order to get
a good, clean electricity. Now let's come back to agriculture. As I say this is almost
a third, the agriculture itself is fourteen percent and that's equal to the problem of
transportation. In agriculture it comes from actually tilling the soil which of course speeds
decomposition of the soil which puts CO2 in the air, includes the fertilizer effects and
various others such as the muddy runoffs that in most river deltas goes straight to CO2.
But notice this eighteen percent land use. Now some of that city is expanding in suburbs
and so forth but around the world the great impact is one of cutting down forests such
as slash and burn techniques and forestry and removing leaves would otherwise do photosynthesis
and remove some CO2. So that's the pie that we have to tackle and there are obvious ways
that we can tackle it. I just want to point out to this audience that agriculture is going
to have quite a role in this. There's a lot I think of low hanging fruit in terms of plowing,
irrigation practices that can be changed but innovation in the agricultural area may prove
to be every bit as important as innovation in producing electric power in getting the
situation better in hand. This leads me to the issue of actually taking CO2 out of circulation.
All the discussion that you've heard of is changing only the amount put in every year.
It's currently growing, about thirty five percent I talked about and the first goal is to keep
it from growing every year just as constant amount each year. Some people have the nerve
to call the stabilization, which it certainly isn't. So reducing emissions is not going to
be enough. We're actually going to have to take out some of the carbon that we've put
into the air. There's some ways of doing that. Here's a list, I'll just show you a couple.
You can plant more trees and there are lots of good reasons for planting trees besides
serving to take carbon out of the air but they're not a very liable way of keeping carbon out
of the air. If you have a climate forecast that says it's going to be hotter, drier, windier,
it's going to be a lot more forest fire and all your sequestered carbon will go back into
circulation in a few days. So it's not reliable. Here's the other major source besides green
leaves and that's micro algae in the surface fires of the ocean called phytoplankton. They
already do about half of the world's photosynthesis, although most of it's for their own use because
they too have a metabolism that requires them to take in oxygen and put out CO2. One of
the side benefits of it is called the biological pump. Some of the zooplankton create calcium
carbonate shells and that means when they die and the shell sinks down into the ocean
depths that's actually taking carbon that would otherwise interact with the atmosphere
down into deep storage. There are micro snails like this very pretty one and they too have
shells that sink to the depths. There are vacuum cleaners of the ocean like the salps
that go along filtering out plankton of all sorts. They produce fecal pellets that are
dense enough to fall down to the depths before disintegrating. And of course there's whale
sized devices that also exist for doing this called whales. They filter plankton of all
sorts. So taking atmospheric carbon, algae circulation for at least hundreds of years
may become the name of the game. You can imagine simply taking organic matter, algae circulation
before it decomposes and seal it. There's a recent paper that shows that while most
river deltas of the world the mug, the organic material goes out there and then a matter of
years it's all decomposed and CO2 in the atmosphere. But in the monsoon runoff from the Himalaya
that comes down through India and Bangladesh, out into the Bay of Bengal, this turns out
to be an exception. Only about 30% of it actually winds up in the atmosphere. The rust gets
sealed where the ocean can interact with it. Basically because it comes out in these three
big pulses every year with the monsoons, a lot of it gets laid down and it doesn't decompose
very fast, which means the end of season runoff basically caps it. So only the top four centimeters
or so is left to interact with the ocean. So these are ways of taking carbon out of circulation
and I suspect agriculture is going to have a considerable role in inventing new ways to
do this. Now let's talk about speed. The IPCC reports, while they mention sudden things
can happen, are mostly about producing detailed scenarios for how quickly, how slowly things
can happen. As to say they talk about the slow study getting worse of things and what we
have to do in the way of emissions to make them not go so fast. And they make you think
in terms of this time scale of half a century or more to the result. And they keep you from
thinking about the 10-year window that we have to cope with. These slow study scenarios
that the IPCC produced do show you that there's a 10-year window for effective action in the
next 10 years. This is from Science Magazine just last week and it just shows you a sketch
of temperature and emissions scenarios. Basically this dashed line here is the pessimistic scenario
business as usual. The dotted line shows you a scenario that we'll get. So you stabilize
by the end of 2200 at about 2.5 degrees above present. And all the numbers, all the labels
on the right show you what the other parts of the IPCC reports say will be the effects
of the change. So again I point out that these are for slow study changes. They assume nothing
sudden happens at such a back. You know like droughts going from 15 to 25 percent. Things
that have already happened. For example, well let's show you some markers here for, we're
already 7 tenths up into the game. And 2 and 3 degree warmings are what are most often
talked about. And all of these results are for these no jump scenarios. Now they assume
that at 2.5 degrees that there will be this major loss of Amazon rainforest. Now I'm just
about to show you what happened in 1999 or almost happened at temperatures of today.
Basically 2 degrees causes the loss of all those mountain glaciers I can see from Seattle
and all the ones that South Americans rely upon for water supply and that's true in many
places in the world. 3 degrees has such disruption of ecosystems and such loss of things that
we expect and such high losses from floods and wind storms and such that it's a result
of enormous numbers of climate refugees. Considerable genocides, considerable amount of warfare when
one country decides to take over the resources of its neighbor while of course pushing the
people out into a third country and so forth. That's the kind of future we've got to avoid
and we're not talking about avoiding it, only postponing it. For example, we reach 2 degrees
in mid-century under the pessimistic scenario. And under the optimistic scenario we reach
about 12 years later in this particular sketch. So clearly we need to talk about scenarios
that go beyond this. Let me show you where the 10 years comes from. This is a carbon
emission per year gigatons. We're at about 8 gigatons a year now and the top of the
black line there is the business as usual scenario and it results in a warming of about 6 degrees
by the end of the century which will be quite catastrophic. This shows you a scenario of
bringing emissions down after they have topped out at about 1940. That results by the end
of the century in about a 3 degree warming. That's the one I said was definitely in to
big climate refugee territory. If we turn emissions around as to say takes a growth
out of emissions, you're still releasing a lot every year, by about 2016 or 2020, we
hold it down to about 2 degrees under the slow study, nothing sudden framework. So I
propose that we really need to talk about some scenarios that cure the problem and not
just prolong the agony. That is to say we need something that will actually take the
CO2 out of the air and outline some ways of doing that and hold the temperature back down
to at least present levels, if not further. That will reverse a lot of the extreme weather.
It will not entirely stop Greenland melting, that will probably continue, though that's
for right. It will not bring back the species that have gone extinct in the meantime, but
it does have the prospect for returning us to some someone's of where we are now. The
people that have been studying ancient climate changes, like the one I showed in the second
slide, have an aphorism. Climate is like a drunk, left alone, it sets, but force it to
move and it staggers, it lurches. And I think we saw some of that in the mid 80s with drought.
The tortoise and the hare, if you remember from the fable, has this race between the
tortoise and the hare, but the hare gets so far out in front that it lays down and takes
a nap and the tortoise goes past it and wins the race. Now, unfortunately, winning the
race in our analogy is sort of arriving at the drop off for a fast ascension to hell.
This is, you've got to think, I mean, both the hare and the tortoise need a reverse
gear when you get down to it. But the point is, is that the IPCC scenarios treat climate
as if it moved like a tortoise and they assume the hare will take a conveniently long nap.
And I submit that's not a safe assumption that there's plenty of evidence we've just
seen. Here's that global drought popping up. Here's that change in the first runoff, dropping
down to a half and a third. And now I'm going to show you what's probably the worst case
of all and it represents something that almost happened in 1999. 9798, as you remember, is
the big El Nino. This shows the little red dots are the familiar faces of the tortoise
fires that are spotted by satellite. And these are mostly agricultural fires and some of
them are slash and burn fires. The colors represent the state of the forest at the end
of that El Nino, December 98. The green ones are what enough still to be called rain forests.
They're not likely to catch fire. But the brown and tan areas, the tan, all the central
area is very flammable forest. And the olive green color there is flammable forest. You
can also see that there's lots of fires that are in these highly flammable areas. So I
submit to that El Nino had lasted longer than one year if it had lasted two years. We could
have been in very, very serious trouble and the calculations had been done about how serious.
This just shows you the El Nino history. This is the temperature in the central Pacific,
which is basically the way you measure them. In El Nino, the central Pacific warms up more
than a half a degree before you call it El Nino and falls more than half a degree before
you call it El Nino. Well, so the big ones are, here's one at two degrees and here's
about two and a quarter and two and a half degrees. But they all are over in one year.
Now there are plenty of El Ninos that last two years like this one in the 80s here. So
all you've really got to imagine is that, as over on the right, we get a double duration
of this big El Nino for it to push us into an interesting catastrophe. This shows you
the hypothetical big burn. Down at the bottom is just the way things are rising in the keeling
curve now. So it's going up about two parts per million every year. Now if you should
burn off sizable parts of the Amazon and Borneo rainforests, you would dump about 40 parts
per million into the atmosphere over a few years, both from the fire and then the decay
of the dead wood. And that would increase our excess CO2 by about 40% in a very short
order. It's a good way of running a lot of your efforts. On top of that, you're missing
all the leaves and the trees that burn down. And so now the CO2 from the same inputs goes
up 50% faster because there aren't the methods of taking it out of the air and the quantities
that existed before. So you certainly have a situation where climate would take a jump
large proportions. You might ask, when might this happen? And of course nobody knows because
nobody understands the El Nino schedule. We certainly don't understand the schedule for
big ones. We don't understand what makes double duration. We don't understand any of those
things. We just know that there is about 10 years between the first two, 15 between the
second, and then we've gone 10 years without one. So I would count 1999 as a near miss.
The other important thing to realize is that a big burn causes a mass extinction event
just like meteors and such from space. The estimates are that about half of all Amazon species
will go extinct. Here's three of my favorite Amazon species. Here's two of my favorite
Borneo species, the orangutan and the psiamine. You've got to figure that we had a near miss
causing the first anthropogenic mass extinction event. So we need a reverse gear for both
the tortoise and the hare. We don't just need palliation of, yeah, this sort of going about
it the way we currently are. So now let me finish and say something about the need and
the ability to turn on a dime. There are some good reasons for optimism. I think we already
have longer term power solutions. We don't have to wave our hands about what might be
invented in the future, but probably will be to improve the situation. We could in fact
do a lot of the near term 2020 if we act quickly. And here are three things in combination
which I can imagine a lot of us to do that. The plug in hybrids and the other ways of
using the electrical grid for commuting would mean a major overhaul of the passenger vehicle
fleet, sort of like I saw in Hungary. If we start building a lot of gigawatt sized power
plants that are clean, nuclear and the deep geothermal would be my favorites. And finally
we're going to have to do something to help all those countries have their own coal and
oil and who will want to modernize using them. And I think we'll need to do something like
not provide them with nuclear plants, although 31 countries already have them, but by drilling
deep geothermal wells for them and leaving them for them to run because it's basically
an old fashioned steam plant. It's not a matter of having to have expatriates come in and
run it for you. So something like this has the possibility for getting at the problem
worldwide, which we must do. It's not just a question of big countries doing something.
We've got to tackle it widely. Now finally we can indeed turn on a dime and many countries
have done it before. For the US audiences I use this example. President Roosevelt in 1940
used the metaphor of four alarm fire up the street, referring to Europe, that needed to
be extinguished immediately, whatever the cost. And indeed from a standing start in
like 1941, the automobile makers converted in a matter of months, not years, more than
1,000 automobile plants to do something entirely different like build airplanes, tanks, Ford
turned out a bomber every 63 minutes. Basically we have turned on a dime in the past and we
should realize that viewing this much as we would view the eve of a great war is the
kind of way that we're going to start looking at it. It summarized very nicely by a Burke
statesman of a few centuries ago who said, the public interest requires doing today those
things that men of intelligence goodwill would wish five or ten years hence had been done.
And he's got the right time for him too. Thank you.
