There are important lessons to be learned from the five extreme weather surges between 2002 and 2010.
They have stuck around. That's what distinguishes weather from climate shifts.
Most of these talks may be new to you, as they involve a different way of looking at
the climate problem. I am William Calvin, a professor emeritus at the University of
Washington's Medical School. Thanks to a good physics background, I have been closely following
climate science for 40 years. We teach med students how to detect emergent problems before they
become drop everything else emergencies. That's a mindset missing from the climate debates.
There is a good chance of a series of global economic crashes, triggered by further surges
in extreme weather. This could happen long before global average surface temperature reaches 1.5
degrees Celsius of overheating. Such is the 2015 Paris climate agreement's notion of when we get
into big trouble. This series will, I hope, convey my sense of how much sooner big trouble could arrive
or already has. As my series title says, extreme weather has created a climate emergency.
Note the past tense. Since about 2003, it has been like watching a slow motion train wreck in
progress. But there is nothing hopeless about our situation. While sea level rise will continue for
centuries, no matter what we do, we could achieve a lot by removing the 50 percent
excess of carbon dioxide from the air overhead that would cool us off and reduce the extreme
weather surges. But existing CO2 cleanup proposals will need an order of magnitude
improvement if we are to accomplish that before the consequences of extreme weather destroy our
civilization. Climate's Manhattan Project, and how to kickstart it, is the topic of the last
half-hour talk in this four-part series.
