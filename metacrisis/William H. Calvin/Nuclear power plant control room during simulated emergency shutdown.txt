Drywall pressure has caused a reactor scram. Notice level, power. There's pressure and power. Reactor power is already less than 1%.
There's pressure. Cool level is going up. My drywall pressure is at 45 pounds now.
For seconds into this, my wetwall pressure is at about 23 pounds. Drywall touches at 210 degrees.
All those pumps are running. Reactor vessel pressure is 52 pounds. I've got almost 50,000 gallons per minute of water going into the reactor vessel right now.
