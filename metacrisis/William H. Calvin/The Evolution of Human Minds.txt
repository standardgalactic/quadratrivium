Good morning to you. This is William Calvin speaking from Seattle. Unfortunately, I had much
rather be in Gothenburg. I'm going to talk about the evolution of human minds, and this
all too typical evolution and devolution of Homo sapiens is actually really useful at this point.
We shared a common ancestor with the chimpanzees and the bonobos about seven million years ago,
and after that our ancestors were bipedal woodland apes. Say apes because brain size really hasn't
changed. It's just that they've become a bit more upright and they're living in woodlands rather
than in forest. Woodland is a habitat which has grasslands mixing in with trees. It's the ideal
transition to making a living on the savannah because there's still a tree to sleep in at night.
However, by 1.8 million years ago, Homo erectus had evolved and was distinctly out on the savannah,
that is to say away from familiar refuges. Our species, Homo sapiens, evolved by about 200,000
years ago. Big brain and all, they look pretty much like us except maybe for the chin,
and the puzzle is that it took another 150,000 years before we became the creative
Homo sapiens sapiens that we are today. That is to say many aspects of higher intellectual function
look like they came in only after about three quarters of the span of Homo sapiens so far.
Now to give the artist's due, I'll have to show you the depiction of the last century of progress.
No, let us talk about some of the data that does exist, and that is about brain size. It's not
about intellect, but brain size you could measure from the cranial capacity. Now chimpanzee, it's
about 400 milliliters, and for the first four million years or so, from say six or seven million
up to about three, two and a half, we have brain size that's only slightly larger than
chimpanzees and with no obvious trend in size. There is then a group of Homo erectus skulls
that do show a trend with time. That is to say in the course of a million, a million and a half years,
Homo erectus doubles its brain size. Then there's the period of the last three quarters of a million
years where brain size increases much more steeply. These are the Homo species such as
Roodleofensis and the like, and of course here on the very right end we have Homo sapiens.
Now what else was going on at the time? I'll show a note down here on the bottom.
I've depicted the ice ages gradually setting in by about 2.7 million years ago,
but only becoming the 100,000 year cycle in the last three quarters of a million years, roughly.
We also have a record of hominid tool making, and I've depicted it like this in steps rather
than a gradient, because that's what the archaeologists are now telling us it was like.
So I'm going to lead you into this by showing you what I think came before. There's a lot of
hominid tool use just as there is in chimpanzees, but the transition into making tools according to
some pattern only starts at about 2.7 million years ago, at least for things that are preserved.
They could have been making more elaborate carvings of sticks or something of that sort
earlier, and we would know about it. So this is a cartoon. It's a nice summary there. Now I've
taught you everything I know about splitting rocks. These are indeed, though they're not drawn very well,
are something of a stand-in for splitting open cobbles, that is to say good hand-sized stones,
typically rounded, and you can pound two of them into one another and knock off half of the stone
in the process and get a fairly sharp edge around the side and also have a nice rounded portion to
hold on to. That is the sort of thing that sat in about 2.7 million years ago and did not change
for a million years. The way that you fall into making these, I think, is you can take such a
stone, particularly if you're frustrated at your attempts, and you can simply throw it against a
hard rock outcrop, such as the one these cheetahs are inhabiting. Out on most of the savannah,
this is Sarah Getting, rocks are not always at hand, but there are rocky outcrops like this
every few kilometers you might be able to see one.
And simply throwing a stone against this gives you a split rock. It simply shatters and you
search around the fragments to see if you can find a suitable sharp edge. It's a very easy way in,
but it's very wasteful of rock, and taking two cobbles and purposely pounding them together
is an improvement in technique and certainly in raw material conservation.
So let's come back now and look at what we can say about how many toolmaking.
There's this jump up to making them in a pattern, but it really doesn't change for over a million
years. It also continues after that. It's not as if the next stage replaces it,
but what you start seeing at jump number two here is you start seeing toolmaking to a distinct
pattern. The Ashulean hand axe depicted here is usually the icon to stand in for this so-called
Ashulean toolkit. As you see here, we've got some notion of symmetry. These things are flattened.
You can throw them much like a Frisbee. Finally, at the last half million years,
there is compound toolmaking. So you make one shape and from it you make something else.
And then there's this final period of the last 50,000 years when what you say is a burst of
creativity in toolmaking. So what you can conclude from this is that while brain size is going up
in each of these million-year periods, the toolmaking is not. Or if it is,
it's not preserved and copied by others and carried on. It's made and lost.
So it's hard to conclude that brain size has been driven, as Darwin thought initially,
by a study improvement in toolmaking. At least for this first two million years of
of bigger brain hominid evolution.
This conservatism in toolmaking also gives us another conclusion.
It brains, bigger brains, are around for some reason. They may very well
give you an increased cleverness, but it rather looks as if this cleverness does not
gradually feed back to improve the tools. That's the other conclusion out of this graph
that really makes you wonder about whether our original notions of what human brain evolution,
if they're really right on or far off.
Now there are some other choices for what might have been driving brain size.
My own favorite is that the brain needed to be reorganized spatially and that it was simply
easier to do it in a slightly bigger brain on the same principle as if you're going to
reorder all the furniture in your house. It's helpful to have an empty room to store things in
while you're doing the rearranging. That's a some surge space is always useful and in any given
generation there's a variety of brain sizes and perhaps the ones with the bigger brains
found that during their development it was easier to do some of the reorganization.
Certainly the temporal lobe has been reorganized over what we see at least in monkeys
to give a greater representation for language. That might have been one of the organizing
principles. The second thing that we do much much better than the great apes is sharing
and that involves a lot of keeping track of different people and whether they ever pay back
something that you share with them. The third thing is throwing and throwing accuracy for hunting.
All these are rather demanding things on the brain. There are all things that the great apes
don't do very much and that we do quite a lot. Furthermore these three are all likely important
for living off of large grazing animals which once you move out of the woodlands of the Sphana
you more or less have to do. Now growth curves in evolution are really few and far between.
This Moore's law kind of redoubling of the capacity the speed or the capacity of memory chips
so forth every several years has been going on for quite a while. That's a lovely growth curve
but you don't find very many things in evolution that are like this. I mean it's all very well to
invent say a carrying bag which would have been a big step up in a hunter-gatherer lifestyle
but you can't keep reinventing it for extra credit. There are a few things that do no matter how much
you've got Moore is better. For example words if you have a hundred words 200 is always an
improvement. If you're sharing with two people sharing with four people is usually an improvement
and so on to eight and sixteen and so forth. Furthermore accurate throwing however accurate
you are however far a distance you can stay from your target Moore is always better. You can eat
meat more days of the month. So let's go back to the woodland here and you can see that there have
been some large grazing animals here both the bones and by the fine cropping of this grass
but there's aridigitrated trees and brush here but this woodland also attracts other animals
for example the traditional predators of the large grazing animals they like the shade they like the
animals that come in warily of course to visit. However by about 1.8 billion years according to
some of the stable carbonized taupe evidence a homo erectus was eating a lot of grass
and presumably it wasn't via baking bread it was probably indirectly via eating meat of grazing
animals. This shows you a typical Serengeti scene of grazing herds of zebra and wildebeest
at a savanna waterhole and in the background you see the only tree there is a lot of meat on the
hoof but there aren't very many trees for refuge and if you're going to live out in this area and
make a living you've got to have the social adaptability to mount a guard at night there are
various implications of this for the accomplishment of our homo erectus ancestors. Planning behaviors
for it certainly for planning a throw it's very important in a hunting situation to do it right
as say missing the animal the first time is really worse than not throwing it all because dinner
runs away and secondly when you try tomorrow they're going to keep their distance so these two
things mean that there's a big premium once you start in this lifestyle using throwing as a means
of laying your hands on large grazing animals there's a big premium upon getting better and better.
Now for most novel actions detail plans really are not needed for example
mostly fumble and find sufficeness as they just take it slow and you don't have to make a big
elaborate plan at the beginning you can just find your way into a good plan you can keep trying over
and over until you succeed although that doesn't work for as they say the animals tend to run away
from you when dinner vanishes for example if you blindly pick up a cup of coffee and it turns out
to be empty you can usually sense this before the coffee cup hits your nose this works because the
movement itself is slow enough so that there's a feedback loop from your arm sensing the weight of
back into your spinal cord and then commands coming back out to the motor to the muscles
changing their attention and therefore the trajectory of the coffee cup.
Now this takes time it takes about one eighth of a second for the forearm movement
and if you're going to do a movement that takes only one eighth of a second that means there's no
time for feedback to correct the movement the movement is truly ballistic. Now this is the
point at which you need a detailed plan that is to say throwing a dart only takes one eighth of a
second the feedback loop is too slow to fix things if you sort of catch your cuff on your arm the
sweat of your arm for example and it impedes your movement it's just too late to fix it.
So all of the ballistic movements throwing hammering clubbing kicking spinning are all
ones that we call them ballistic because once you start doing them everything is on automatic
thereafter. For accurate throwing you really have a substantial time you have a window of
opportunity and it narrows dramatically so for accurate throwing if you happen to release too
early it will go too far if you release too late it's likely to fall short so this is why I'm
calling sort of the launch window or window of opportunity and if you double the distance to
the target same size target it now is about eight times as difficult as say the launch window
shrinks by a factor of eight a factor of four is due to the solid angle shrinking and a factor of
two in addition is because to throw twice as far you typically have to throw twice as fast
so for something like this you have to plan every little detail of the muscle activation sequence
in advance as you get set to throw now for set pieces like free throws find you you get in
practice you practice this over and over and you start getting the groove and you do it exactly
the same each time that's what you should do with the dark throw the basketball free throw
but these are set pieces that is to say the physical setting never changes
and you could hunt like that in an ambush situation where you wait for the animal to
walk through the the target zone and then you could launch at them
uh frogs who throw their tongues at flies are basically doing this
but for hunting most target distances are novel so the neural circuitry for planning that one
eighth of a second action sequence in excruciatingly fine detail was likely improved over several
million years and you're really forced to get better even within a single generation you're
forced to get better uh herds will move away from you if you get too close this approach
distance depends on their experience with being spooked by predation or attempts uh
many animals certainly as homorectis moved into asia and encountered herds that had never seen
bipedal uh animals before and since all of their instincts were to avoid four-footed animals
uh very likely the hunters could have walked up close enough to club them over the head
however this doesn't last very long thus the hunter is forced to get better it's sort of the
red queen principle from owls and wonderland or you have to look elsewhere for a knife
heard that permits getting close and you keep running out of this
so with this setting now let us come back to toolmaking and it's complexity as i said there's
this early stage where it's basically split cobbles there's the second node in your period of
bilaterally symmetric notions of shape uh with a lot of edging applied there's this third stage
of stage toolmaking and that's what i'm going to address now uh this is what this is a piece of
obsidian that's been broken in half and this is the technique for shaving off these single-edged
razor blades uh basically it doesn't have to be totally flat the idea is to get a right angle
edge like this that you can in fact put the pusher stick on top of and shave off a blade
blades start occurring in africa about 280 000 years ago
this is compound toolmaking and it added dust
now this last fourth stage at 50 000 years ago uh differs from this in many many ways
uh let me show you a little bit about setting for it because the climate during this period
was flipping back and forth very frequently this shows you the last ice age only and it's in this
period between 60 and 50 000 years ago somewhere in here uh that we're definitely becoming
behaviorally modern even though having been atomically modern since 200 000 years ago this is
also the period of the second out of africa at this time of homo sapiens behaviorally modern
homo sapiens uh spreads out of africa once again spreads promptly to australia uh into asia and
then eventually around the world at the right here you see our modern warm period of the
ice ages and this is the period that agriculture developed in so what we have here is a flip
between a warm and wet climate like today's and the cool dry windy dusty climate of the ice ages
and the flips can occur very rapidly this means five or ten years some of these up strokes the
down strokes may come down gradually and then plunge uh it's these very abrupt periods that
produce unusual opportunities and challenges to all the terrestrial animals that experience
including us certainly the animals that we were praying upon
uh climate flips like this probably only speed up evolution due to other drivers uh
the the real virtue here is that instead of just sort of study pressure it's much more like pumping
so here are some of the things that the archaeologists would list
as being in the transition between anatomically modern humans and behaviorally modern again
anatomically modern comes in here in about 200 000 years and you then start seeing a few things
like mortuary practices of shellfish being exploited some hints of long-distance trading that
develop much better later they're starting to some fishing for the first time at least the
kind of fishing that leaves traces bone tools barbs mining now we start getting into this
interesting area of certainly images once you start seeing images painted on cave walls
you're definitely into behaviorally modern
this is an area that's argued about a bit more for example beads for necklaces are some of the
earliest uh this evidence goes back to almost 90 000 years now in north africa and in the very south
of africa furthermore this is staying called in size patterns so i'll show you an example
of it here we go this is a piece of red ochre sort of blocked out and on one of the surfaces a whole
series of striations have been cut uh the black and white photograph has shows you an inked in
example of where all the grooves are and it's no understandable pattern
whatever it is there's nothing like it earlier
so what we have is no trace for real intellect
any real creativity until we get down towards 50 000 years ago
and tomically modern but somehow this mines big bang or creative explosion takes a much longer time
from this you can say their brains may be necessary we don't know for creativity
but they are not sufficient to get the modern behaviors simply because of this 150 000 year
there's likely something else going on here as well
here's one of the things that really impresses the archaeologists again because you don't see it
earlier a bone must have been the most common raw material at any homeorectis campsite because
they were butchering animals all the time yet they didn't make tools out of that bone until
the last 90 000 years roughly these are examples from about 25 000 years ago in France
you can see all manner of barbs holes that have been drilled and such
you even see very fine tools this for example is a sewing needle in fact it's embedded in some
paleolithic cloth from about 26 000 years ago these are very fine tools created with little points
like this and what these were used for it appears is they could have been used for creating this
this hole here as a drill though a flaking technique is is an alternative way of doing it
but nonetheless you need a very sharp point to do that
but it's pretty clear that one of the uses they were making for these fine little points
is to decorate they started decorating their fishing spirits
they would start decorating non-useful things portable art art you can carry around with you
it's thought to be the earliest of the art and here you can see I mean there's where the
bamless eye is right there you can you can see this kind of art going back a bit further than
you can the cave art on the walls here's another example of portable art and this now is made out
of limestone much harder problem all right here's wall art
37 35 000 years ago at the chauvet caves in france circle on the right
is where these come from this is almost as early as homo sapiens was actually inhabiting the area
and it seems certainly to me as if it's likely that this is an art technique brought with them
either brought out of asia uh because coming in through poland was one of the routes into europe
or coming around the eastern end of the baller train and up uh through the the Balkans
in the next slide
you also start to see storytelling i mean for example this is an abduction scene with brothers
coming to the rescue etc uh there's some tally marks up at the top uh we don't know what these are
from this particular this is a replica of of art seen on the wall of the cave in the Tanzania
so to summarize some of this uh it's been about 50 years since anthropologists started
emphasizing the delay from anatomically modern homo sapiens until you start getting into this
period of behaviorally modern homo sapiens sapiens if you like uh the intellectual delay was
initially thought to be about 15 000 years but as the dating has gotten better it's now
clear that that lasted 150 000 years so what caused this big step up and what it takes so long
now i'm going to go through some candidates for you and perhaps my favorite candidate would be
mimicry that's to say the ability to look at somebody doing something and then do it yourself
without a lot of trial and error uh mimicry is certainly seen in animals much simpler
birds for example bird-sized brain is sufficient for mimicry uh orangutans do a fair amount of
mimicry though on a slow timescale they may watch for several hours and then when you're not looking
they may try lighting stove themselves and and cooking something
but nonetheless in our closest relatives the gorillas the chimps the bonobos uh there's very
little mimicry being seen uh frost wall noted a a limp that an adult male had from an injury
was copied by some young chimps and they even persisted doing it for a month or so after the
the adult male stopped doing it uh tomasola had an experiment with young chimps failing to mimic
that is to say he trained a couple of young chimps off in the lab to make a gesture such as
touching their head in order to receive a food reward and then put the young chimps back in
their play group of a dozen or so young chimps and the experiments would come around to the
vents with their holster full of goodies and the two trained chimps would make the gesture
and get rewarded and the other chimps would not did never never caught on to this they
didn't observe they didn't copy you can see some copying if you train a high-ranking female
chimp on using a probed dislodge of food reward from a a box then other chimps would copy the
technique so to some extent it requires prestige in order to get caught in humans however we mimic
so easily and so unconsciously that it's it's really impressive uh that is to say there's this
literature on things called mirroring echoing matching and what this means is that if you're
saying and talking to someone you will tend to synchronize your breathing with them you will
tend to mimic their postures and their method of speech and go to this even with strangers not just
with friends waitresses can use this technique to establish rapport with their customers and indeed
they can get bigger tips this way so the i'm going to list here the candidates that have been
proposed for this transition into homo sapiens sapiens uh mimicry uh is my favorite uh creativity
in general is often proposed uh perhaps the most frequent proposal is that it represents a transition
into using uh symbolic stuff language more specifically uh it's been proposed that it's
really uh much an improvement in the rational abilities in other words more logic uh recent
proposal is more working memory uh another one is planning abilities and finally of course there is
our kind of consciousness uh that there are some big step up some blossoming and this took
place i tend to treat consciousness as something of an umbrella term for all the others uh that
but um i would actually agree with with all of these candidates i think they're all
on the right track i would just add the word structured to all of them for example not just
simple mimicry but mimicry of a sequence of events uh the kind of creativity that allows you to get
set offline before acting and then carry it out without any false moves not just symbols
uh but long sentences needing syntax uh chains of logic the kind of working memory uh that is
structured that will enable you to do contingent plans for example and finally the kind of
consciousness that i have in mind is really goes beyond awareness to imagination and an
imagination that produces high quality results with syntax syntax is what allows you to go beyond
the two word sentence and produce sentences of almost any length uh furthermore you can nest
sentences inside of one another you can say i think i saw him leave to go home which has four
verbs you might notice though the hierarchical functions in general are indeed the structure
things nested syntax contingent plans games that have arbitrary rules which of course is
very much like logic uh in in logic your arbitrary rules are quality judgments that you have to
reach a threshold of good fit before it becomes logic music that goes beyond rhythm and melody
to use multiple voices uh as in the art of the fugue for example or even part singing
coherence finding as when we discover hidden patterns amidst seeming chaos i mean we'll work
hard on a jigsaw puzzle at crossword puzzles for exactly a series of such eureka moments
complex thought as an figurative speech narrative frameworks parables that map one story on to
another story indeed these are all examples of structured thought they all separate humans
from the great apes uh just try to imagine us without this to see what life might have been like
more than a hundred thousand years ago let me back up here but without structuring plus offline
quality improvements you can't create novel sentences of any length or complexity and you
likely cannot think such thoughts either now let me go through some of the things that require
keeping track of a lot of relationships as in in our hunt for things that might have been the
antecedents of our kind of structured thought interestingly enough sharing is one of now the
great apes have some sharing it's mostly what you'd call tolerated scrounging for example in
gorillas you see here the the general principle that they hang on to their branch and allow a
favored relative or friend to also nibble at some leaves but they're not going to share this out
like a cocktail hostess and offer people food uh indeed tolerates scrounging often isn't tolerated
here's uh sexual grandson trying to get uh grandfather to share and it doesn't work
now lost at sharing is pretty much standard in us uh apes are reluctant and so again we have
something with a long growth curve just like throwing accuracy and range or like vocabulary
acquisition more is always better sharing however has the cheater problem at every step up we have
to have some method to combat the freeloaders or the the free riders
and that requires keeping track of people and their relationships we need an effect to keep
rough track of who goes what to whom by tagging the memory with whether the person is a actor a
recipient by tagging objects whether they're suitable or valuable and once this mental capacity
because of the natural selection going on for
sharing in an environment where there's a lot of meat to be shared
once that mental capacity evolves we can likely use exactly such case marking circuits to gossip
about who did what to whom so the basic theory here due to very derrick beckerton is who owes
what to whom makes a transition into who did what to whom
so the outbreak of of structured stuff like this probably goes something like this
you've got some adults or older children that slowly manage to consistently speak long sentences
and there are some conventions used to identify whether a noun is an actor or an acted upon
in english we don't have very much of this but of course many other languages do and in english
our personal pronouns still retain them an actor is he if the same person acted upon is called him
now small children are going to hear the structured stuff and they figure out
the syntax and are even better as adults because earlier soft wiring of the brain works better
so this transition from words and short sentences into being able to do who did what to whom
now sets you up to do long sentences more complex thoughts contingent plans games and logic music
beyond melody coherence find creativity now is earlier soft wiring better but
tonight changes that during development can tweak things this is sort of the inheritable
aspect and in general what you see in gene culture interaction is that behavioral innovation
leads and then gene changes in the aftermath may improve the payoff for later generations
so language and intellect gets augmented even more over and over but the initial drivers in
this case are things like sharing of vocabulary and throwing accuracy they all have long growth
curves they're all extremely handy for regularly eating large grazing animals
we need structuring for all the higher intellectual functions
but i think that the regular exercise may be something as mundane as gossip
the problem comes now in we need creativity for novel situations and so we need some way
as we get set to bootstrap up the quality to improve it so it's not what it initially might be
is just a juxtaposition of some things that are floating around in your head and no more connected
than your nighttime dreams to shape that up into something that really hangs together well
and can be acted upon that's the kind of transition that i expect to see going on at 50 000 years ago
that's the transition from short-sentence language to this long-sentence much more creative high
quality language and the transition is by the explosive nature of it really is because young
children get exposed to structured language whether it's sign or spoken in their early
formulative years and they now software their brain wanted to be very much more efficient adults
now i'd like to close by saying a little bit about planning uh it certainly seems to have played
in terms of planning for throwing planning for sharing planning for long-distance trade it's
played a considerable role in the past in making us what we are but the kind of foresight
has perhaps not come under the same kind of selection pressure uh Edmund Burke the Irish
English statesman of several centuries ago uh said the public interest requires doing today
those things that none of intelligence and goodwill would wish five or ten years since
had been done and there are certainly indications that what abilities we have in this regard are
rather limited uh for example our rationality is clearly limited by what's called status quo bias
and in behavioral economics there's a tendency to keep doing what you've always done and that's
often stronger than the rational arguments for changing course uh people have a tendency when
faced with too many choices to decide not to decide and this in our political discourse is often
known as blowing smoke as to say saying lots of things to confuse people to put off a decision
to be able to continue a profitable uh scheme for much longer uh there are many of us this fact this
has been going on in climate um global warming story for the last uh 20 or 30 years i think has
been influenced strongly by this uh furthermore people endow their possessions or paychecks with
an ordinately high value simply because they possess them i mean people feel the pain of
a loss more acutely than the joy of a gain one reason why future gains are hard to balance
with the loss of present-day spending money and again in climate change this is a big
problem because we've to invest for the future certainly without a surefire payoff
is is hard to sell given that so many people revert to this pre-rational uh decision
in particular for climate as i have a new book coming out called global fever uh this is one of
the illustrations from it but this is the rate of carbon emissions into the atmosphere the amount
of new co2 being added each year and it's been growing as you see in the left part of the graph
and from the present year onwards if we don't change how we do business it will grow
as in the upper right called business as usual uh we have to turn this around if we turn it
around before 2020 we could probably avoid the three-degree fever the sort of thing that really
causes of climate climate refugees and genocides if we manage to turn this around so that we get
into this territory of that sinking let us say we take more co2 out of the air than we put in
then we can begin to remove the accumulated carbon uh and that's the point that we have to
achieve before we're going to start reversing anything about climate we have to start getting
into this removal territory we have to do that fast enough uh there are three technologies in
combination i'll just mention very quickly uh that uh look like they could solve this 2020
part of the problem that is to say if you get rid of a lot of the gasoline and petrol use
with plug-in hybrid vehicles you could start retiring some super tankers if you start building
enough nuclear or geothermal power plants you could retire many coal drains and of course wind
and solar if you can ramp them up fast enough could do part of this job but this requires many
gigawatts of capacity and most wind and solar is still being measured in megawatts
finally you have to do something to get electricity to come countries that are apt to
generate using their own coal or oil as say you have to try to head off what the developing
countries are doing by for example uh taking electricity generated by nuclear plants in
perhaps spain and piping it all across north africa with with dc power transmission lines
that don't lose so much power by heating you have to do things like this worldwide
and emission growth growth can stop by 2020 and you might be able to turn it around into
that sinking by 2040 that seems an exercise to show you the now crucial crucial importance
that higher intellectual function is now coming under natural selection in a big way
that is to say we either solve this problem or we lose a great deal of our civilization
we lose half or more of all species uh this is a do it and do it quickly
situation the likes of which we've never had to deal with before thank you
