just imagine that you have a gun that's firing bullets or pellets at a screen that has two slits,
two openings, those double slits, and your intuition tells you that those pellets that
get through the left opening will land in a band aligned with it on the left and those that get
through the right will land in a band aligned with it on the right. That makes sense. And that's
what happens with bullets. With bullets. Okay. Let's now run that experiment with one change.
We're simply going to dial down the size of the bullets, making them smaller,
as small as little particles like electrons. When you fire the electrons at the barrier with the
two slits, you don't just get two bands, you get more bands. And that simple change going from
our expectation of two bands to, in this case, five bands, that represents the single greatest
upheaval in our understanding of reality that the species has ever encountered.
