Processing Overview for Thomas Ouldridge
============================
Checking Thomas Ouldridge/Physics of Emergent Behaviour IIIï¼š from origin of life to multicellularity, 2nd July 2021 (part 1).txt
1. Udo had provided strong results regarding the efficiency limits of small systems, such as a molecular motor, but acknowledged that understanding how thermodynamic uncertainty relations scale with system size is still an area of exploration. He emphasized that while we understand efficiency in macroscopic systems like engines, we expect to gain similar insights about smaller systems, like cells and multicellular organisms, with further research.

2. Jeremy described a dynamical system model with nodes and networks that can fluctuate based on energy inputs from the surrounding heat bath. He highlighted that the system's response to these fluctuations is influenced by dissipation, and efficiency cannot be 100% if the process happens in finite time.

3. Nigel proposed adding new nodes to the system when a local energy fluctuation exceeds a certain threshold, allowing the network to grow over time. He also suggested exploring systems where the input is dependent on the system's behavior, resembling a computational or programmed environment interaction. This could potentially lead to emergent properties and self-editing behaviors, similar to niche construction, which will be discussed further in the next session.

4. The discussion touched upon the importance of understanding how thermodynamic principles apply at various scales, from individual molecules to complex biological systems, and the potential for computational models to explore these relationships.

5. The session concluded with gratitude to the speakers and audience for their engaging contributions, and a reminder that the discussions would continue on the following day with a focus on the emergence of order.
