like our competitors in our office,
something that doesn't need much interaction
because they are doing their processes alone,
not to mention social interaction,
there is something that I see with that or not,
the body.
So here we see in metaphor,
I think it's something very specific
and it leaves out many aspects of the human being,
so I think the same,
I think that if it has been a useful metaphor
and well in a certain way it continues to be,
it is a quite limiting metaphor
in terms of that there are fundamental questions
that are very difficult to think about
if we think of the brain as a computer,
for example, questions like
what is being an agent,
what does it mean that in my world
I am capable of doing things,
of appreciating things,
a computer works with programs,
a computer works with a user,
but although
what is the user,
who is the user, who is the one who handles us,
somehow to think that we are
something like a computer implies
that we are not thinking
where is that center
of free albedrío,
of decisions,
it creates a little problem
which is a problem perhaps a little artificial
because it is related to that metaphor.
Other metaphors perhaps
help us, for example,
metaphors based on what is an organism,
help us to think about those questions,
I do not say to solve them,
but at least start to ask other things.
So in biology we see an alternative
which is to focus on the concept of the organism,
for example.
And the organism also takes us
to the role of the body,
totally, that's right.
But before establishing this alternative,
we also have to highlight that
computationalism, the metaphor of the computer
is not completely incorrect either,
if we can reason,
if we can be more mathematical,
the problem is that we cannot generalize
this capacity to everything,
what it means, right?
Of course.
It is as if this metaphor has emerged
taking the most complex capacities
of the human mind as if they were the most general ones.
The capacity of logical reasoning,
the capacity of a complex language,
the capacity to reason in situations
that involve difficult decisions,
those are real capacities that we have,
but it is correct to say
that all our mental life is based
on these quite particular capacities
and quite differentiated,
or perhaps the other way around,
that these capacities have evolved
based on cognitive capacities
a little more corporized,
a little more that they have to do with
our capacity to understand
in the world, to be able to move,
to be in a social interaction situation,
all that.
If it seems, you can think a little
that the body has a part that is to understand
the body as biological,
but also the body as to be in the world,
to be able to reach a time appointment,
to be able to go to the kitchen
and prepare a dish,
those are cognitive capacities too,
I don't know what you think.
Yes, actions, actions,
actions are not just physical movements,
but they have goals, conditions
of success or failure.
So the normality
enters the most basic levels
of the living beings,
and we are almost,
we are almost at the other extreme,
the classic metaphor of the computer
takes us to the highest levels
of cognition,
and now we are talking about organism,
well, organisms already exist
3.5 billion years ago,
so we are on the other side.
Exactly.
They are like the two extremes
of an evolution of life
and of the mind, of cognitive capacities,
and not only cognitive,
but of relationship with the world,
the ability to change the world.
But it is true, the metaphor of the computer
is not completely incorrect,
and although we could say
that it implies
the use of certain capacities
quite complex,
such as deductions, calculations, etc.,
it is not considered that
these are things that one does consciously,
but that the brain
is in charge of doing that computational work.
But in a sense, it is as if
we need a scientist
within our brain
who is in charge of doing all those calculations,
and who is a scientist,
and for the simplest tasks,
to be able to mobilize,
to be able to develop
a skill, what was corporal,
that are actions
that have their complexity
and that we share with the animal kingdom.
The animals are intelligent,
and that notion of the computer
somewhat limits us in that sense.
But the question, I don't know if it seems to you
to say, well,
what is an alternative,
we could think about it.
So we have the starting point,
we started with the idea of organism,
but in an organism that
is not a mechanism again,
just a mechanism like other physical objects,
like a cup or a table,
but where we already have
the principle of normativity,
of methods, purposes, actions.
So that also leads us
to the subjective part
of the human being,
of the complexity
of our experiential world.
A practical question.
We know that humans
have their conscience, their reflectivity.
And now we have a metaphor
that says that maybe the cognition
started with life.
For you, the consciousness
or something similar
also starts with life.
It is a very interesting and very difficult question
to answer because
it is difficult for us to understand a little
what consciousness is
in a generalized way,
removing from our own experience
how you are alive
and how you are human.
Imagine, I don't know if you have ever tried
to imagine that you are an animal
or that you are a bird
or an insect,
and what your world would be like.
And there are people who have made it,
I mean, I have written books,
like Jaco from Uxco,
who seeks to say that the world of an animal
is different from the world of another animal,
of another species,
that is a very interesting exercise
of imagination,
but somehow it is an exercise
that we do from our consciousness.
So we already have a problem
at the beginning of that question,
to say how can we imagine
the consciousness in other living beings.
If you ask, if you ask
for my opinion, my opinion is that
in some way the consciousness
arises with life,
but we would be wrong
because we think that
living beings are very simple,
they have a consciousness similar to ours.
They have a world.
They have a world
and they have an interiority.
They have their perspective in the world.
Imagine the experience you have
when you are sleeping,
but not dreaming.
It seems that you don't have any experience,
however, it is not that you are completely,
let's say, without any experience.
Because you are still not open to the world.
If there is a very strong noise, you wake up.
That is, that opening to the world
that is not a consciousness
that can be reflected on,
perhaps some beings are very simple,
they have that kind of consciousness.
You mentioned the word interiority.
It is not better to use another word
because it is a bit similar
to this idea of the computer,
where we have
this being broken,
doing cognition.
At the same time, you say
that a living being is a being in the world.
It is open to the world.
Well, it is true.
The question is that you have to say the two things.
Do not stay alone.
To say that there is an interiority
means that,
in some way,
being in the world means something
for that being,
for the animal, for the person,
for the insect,
even for a tree.
The presence in the world
has a meaning
in the sense that
some things are good,
some things are bad for life.
For bacteria, the sugar is good,
but some toxins are bad.
That sense is appreciated
by the living being.
And that is what I mean by interiority.
It does not mean...
It is a normativity.
The word normativity is a difficult word
because it has many exceptions.
But in this case,
it would mean
to distinguish between good and bad,
for example.
Sometimes I have the example
to illustrate the concept of normativity
that we imagine that
the moon falls
in the sun.
Was that a failure or not?
Of course.
It is only an event in the universe
without any sense.
That is very different
if your bacteria is eating
something that is bad for you.
Or if you fall in the sun.
Exactly.
It matters to you.
And in fact,
if we want to
find what is common
in the mind,
in all living beings,
from the most simple to the most complex,
it would be that.
Being alive matters to you.
Life matters to you.
It matters to be able to continue living.
It matters to be able to have
a form of life.
Not necessarily a form
that is extremely biological,
but also a social life.
And what matters to you
is that
precisely
it is a bit dissonant
with that idea of the computer.
The computer is a bit like the moon.
It does not matter at all.
What do you think?
It only matters to the user.
The computer itself
is running a program
to see the internet
or a text processor.
It does the same.
Specifically,
the Hollywood vision
of artificial autonomous agents.
For me,
I am very skeptical that
it is basically because
I have already touched
that a person
is better than a living organism
and is not a computer.
So,
sometimes I take a taxi
to get out of the UNAM
and they ask me,
I am in the science department
of the computer.
Do you think about the terminators
and they say, do not worry.
It will not happen.
I am in my department
and you have your robots.
Do you see it?
You will see that there is no reason
to worry.
We can take a message of tranquility.
We are not even close
to having the possibility
to have an autonomous agent
with the intelligence of an insect.
There are humanoid robots.
They exist, of course.
And they are very interesting.
But they are machines
and in general
they imitate human capacity
such as the ability
to move, the ability
to recognize an object.
But they are not close
to the flexibility
of human intelligence.
There is lack of creativity,
autonomy.
To dominate the world, there is lack of creativity.
And they do not have the machines.
In that sense.
But maybe,
lack of creativity of the machines.
The fact that they are machines
dominates our behavior
and our options
in some way.
And that also...
Let me give you an example of that.
In our department
they are changing the environment
so that the robot can work.
They are obscuring the windows
because they cannot see the video.
So, on the contrary,
we are adapting
to the robot
that we cannot build
that is sufficiently flexible.
That is the elimination
of what you are talking about.
Exactly.
Those scenarios are
fantasy scenarios
regarding the scientific reality
of what can be done in these days.
There is a reason
for which many scientists
tend to
huge the importance
of what they are doing.
Many times they say,
well, we are going to create a conscious robot.
And it seems that, well,
that was something incredible
but to the public.
And to the public,
and to the military.
The financial bodies
that are going to give them
money to continue investigating.
That is something that has always happened
since the creation of artificial intelligence.
It has always been
that limit of five years
in which it was going
to reach human intelligence.
Since the 1950s
in five years we are going to have human intelligence
in an artificial way.
And that is a limit
that moves with time.
It would never vary.
If you ask certain people now,
they will tell you the same thing.
In five years we have human intelligence.
Let me return to an ethical team
because it always asks me
why we are so interested
in creating these systems.
Why do we want a conscious robot
as a human being
that can do all the tasks?
Our planet has a problem
of overpopulation.
We have too many people.
Why do we want to produce machines
that can not replace people?
Why do you want a robot there?
You already have a person.
So for me
the problem is more about
the capacity of people
so that they can have more functions
perhaps through interfaces
of technology
instead of replacing people
with machines that are like humans.
To empower people
to have more flexible possibilities.
Well, I don't know
if it is possible
I think there is also
something deeper
deeper in the sense
deeper hidden
if you imagine
from the idea of Frankenstein
we have that power
that search of the human being
that is looking for himself
through an act of creativity
that creates
something that is similar
to oneself
and in that way
he finally manages to understand himself
but it always goes wrong.
There is always
a moral of history
that says
better do not do it
better stay in ignorance
because if you go this way
there is a somewhat
romantic gothic
science takes us to devastation
which is not exactly
incorrect but
perhaps it is an exaggeration
If we compare them as God
creating
there is a price to pay
if we behave like God
but look how interesting
because at the same time
the proof that we have
had success
is precisely that things go wrong
because an autonomous system
if we create an autonomous system
that behaves as we want
it is not an autonomous system
an autonomous system is one that is going to make us angry
or it is going to put us in danger
an autonomous system
looking for more autonomous machines
projects
because they really want
machines that are controlled
if there is a machine that says
and you do not want to kill anyone
totally useless
so that's why I say
the metaphor of the computer
we would have to rethink it
and it has consequences
not only scientists but in daily life
and ethical consequences too
now for example
I think that
of the capacities
that machines have
that approach certain human capacities
for example the learning
do you think it is something exclusive
of humans or living beings
or there is a sense
in which it can be said that a machine
can learn
it is an interesting and difficult question
and today we are listening
many news from California
from large companies
like Google
that are winning
in this Go
with mechanisms
of deep learning
and are achieving
things that
a few years ago
no one has thought
that this is possible
so is there a limit in this
I think yes because
this learning
is in a very well defined context
it is not like the open world
endless
in a way
and in this way
only
more machines can learn
something that can be formalized
that can be defined very well
and in this
aspect we are very different
from human beings
it is like a learning
in a machine needs a closed world
of possibilities
although it is
like the possibilities of chess
or Go that are almost innumerable
but they are closed
because a human being can learn
maybe play chess or something
but the same person can learn
something that has nothing to do
with the game he is playing
can learn
something about the situation
can learn
to communicate
in a different way
there is an opening
to the possibilities
that seem to have
no limitation
but it does not seem to have a limitation
in terms of a human being
that learns
and there is another point here
that touches on previous topics
is that it is the sense
so learning
yes but without sense
it is learning of patterns
of rules of logic
but it is not
a learning of
the sense of the thing
it is like a computer that wins
something does not matter
does not understand that he is playing
does not know that he is playing
it seems to me a very interesting talk
sometimes it is a privilege
to be able to sit for a few minutes
and discuss these topics
that sometimes happen to us
a little when we are talking about
a specific technical problem
we are talking about the context
and why does that problem matter to us
so that is why I have enjoyed it a lot
it has brought me
somehow to continue
indagating
there are many questions to answer
and if you want
what we have talked about is a beginning
a beginning to start thinking
of different problems that affect us all
problems like what is the mind
and what is life
after this talk
with the students
and it is that
do not feel like a robot
do not have the freedom
creativity to choose
their field of study
the questions are more important
than the disciplines
and I see an opportunity
to help society
create a new world
outside of the crisis
that we are seeing at this moment
but part of this challenge
we do not see us as
robots
and it is not necessary
to be afraid of the future
about autonomous robots
