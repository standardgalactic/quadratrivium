Checking Thinking illustrated/How does the Bayesian Bar relate to Bayes Theoremï¼Ÿ.txt
1. **The Problem**: We want to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of theism given fine-tuning.

2. **Understanding Bayes' Theorem**: The theorem is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E), where:
   - P(H|E) is the probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
   - P(E|H) is the probability of evidence E given that H is true.
   - P(H) is the probability of hypothesis H being true.
   - P(E) is the total probability of observing evidence E under all possible hypotheses.

3. **The Bayesian Bar Analogy**: We represent these probabilities as parts of a bar. In our example:
   - The whole bar represents all possible hypotheses.
   - A half of the bar represents the prior probability of theism (P(H)).
   - Three quarters of the remaining bar represents the likelihood of fine-tuning given theism (P(E|H)).

4. **Calculating P(E)**: To find P(E), we consider the evidence under all possible hypotheses. If we only consider theism and atheism, we calculate:
   - P(E|H) * P(H) for theism hypothesis (three quarters * a half = three-eighths).
   - P(E|~H) * P(~H) for the falsity of theism hypothesis (a quarter * a half = one-fourth).
   - Adding these two probabilities together (three-eighths + one-fourth = one-half) represents the total probability of observing fine-tuning.

5. **Final Calculation**: Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate P(H|E) as follows:
   - P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E) = (three quarters * a half) / (one half).
   - This simplifies to three quarters.

6. **Result**: The probability of theism given fine-tuning is three quarters or 0.75, as represented by three quarters of our Bayesian bar.

This video provides a visual and intuitive explanation of how to apply Bayes' theorem using a simple bar analogy, making it easier to understand complex probabilistic reasoning.

Checking Thinking illustrated/How to Think About Probability Visually - The Bayesian Bar.txt
1. The Bayesian bar is a visual tool to represent beliefs as probabilities before and after new evidence is considered.
2. It allows for the updating of beliefs in light of evidence through a process called Bayesian inference.
3. In the context of the problem of evil, the Bayesian bar helps us understand how the existence of evil can affect our belief in God (theism) or the absence of God (atheism).
4. Initially, we might assume that theism is equally likely as atheism, with 50% probability each, and not consider the presence or absence of evil.
5. When considering the existence of evil, we remove the portions of the bar that are inconsistent with evidence (theism without evil and atheism without evil).
6. For a person who initially thought both evil and no evil were equally likely (and thus thought God would not allow evil), the discovery of evil leads to a reduction in the probability of theism and an increase in the probability of atheism.
7. The final probabilities reflect the updated beliefs after considering the evidence of evil, with theism being less probable and atheism being more probable.
8. This visual representation helps us see that evidence (in this case, evil) can change our beliefs by raising or lowering the probability of different hypotheses (the existence of God or His absence).
9. The Bayesian bar is a useful tool for understanding how to update beliefs in a mathematically rigorous way, as it aligns with Bayes' Theorem, which will be discussed in future explanations.
