Checking TierZoo/How Ants and Bees Broke the Game.txt
 In this video, we explore the fascinating world of Hymenopteran insects in the context of a game-like scenario where these creatures are players with unique abilities. We discuss their social structures, food production capabilities, and the stability of their colonies due to their advanced cooperation mechanisms like food storage and agriculture, such as the Leafcutter Ant's cultivation of fungus.

The video also touches upon the less comfortable aspect of parasitoid wasps, which exhibit extreme behaviors like mind control and mummification of their hosts. These wasps are a testament to the diversity and complexity of the Hymenopteran player faction within this imagined game world.
