 In this episode of the Psychology Podcast, Dr. Scott Atran discusses the complex interplay between human conflicts, technological advancements, economic growth, and the strain these put on our planet's resources and ecosystems. He highlights how post-World War II global systems were designed to prevent another large-scale conflict but led to unintended consequences such as environmental degradation, the creation of planetary boundaries, and the proliferation of various catastrophic risk weapons (not just nuclear).

Dr. Atran emphasizes that we are now at a point where we need a new global system that addresses these issues. This system must incorporate anticipatory regulation, interconnectedness without fragility, and sustainable growth that doesn't exacerbate environmental problems or exploit natural resources beyond their capacity to replenish.

He also notes his absence on social media platforms like Twitter, but his ideas are disseminated through the Clements Center for National Security at the University of Texas at Austin's website (conciliationsproject.org), where his research papers can be accessed.

The conversation touches on a wide range of topics, from the psychological underpinnings of conflict and cooperation to the systemic risks we face as a civilization in the 21st century. Dr. Atran provides valuable insights into how we might navigate these challenges to build a more resilient and sustainable global society.
