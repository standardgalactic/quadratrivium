All right, everyone. Welcome to the Stowa. Our friend, Daniel Schmockdenberger is here.
He's going to do, we're having a session on the, something called the Health Index,
and I'll let Daniel explain that in a moment. Daniel and I were chatting on things for him
to do at the Stowa, and he posed this one and one on the pitfalls of kind of engaging in X-Risk,
which I think is next week or the week after, and I'm quite excited about that one as well.
So how today's going to work. We're here for 60 minutes, but we might go over to 75 minutes,
and Daniel's going to share his thoughts, and then we'll have a conversation at the Stowa.
So if you have any questions, throw them in the chat. I'll call you and mute yourself.
If you don't want to be on YouTube, just indicate that because this will be on YouTube.
So that being said, Daniel, welcome back to the Stowa, my friend.
Peter, it's good to be here with you. Thank you. It's good to see everybody.
Shall we just dive right in? Yeah, yeah. Do you want me to prompt you with a question or?
Either way, we can just dive right in. I just hand the Stowa to you when you're here,
so I'm happy to do whatever you like. Thanks, man.
Yeah, this is, there's a topic that I've been thinking about that I thought would be interesting
to share. This definitely was the environment I wanted to share because it's very much at the
intersection of personal development, relational development, and societal betterment.
And it's also a topic I haven't talked about publicly before, so it's just kind of
exploring a thought experiment together and seemed like a good place to do it.
And we're introducing it as if we were going to think of a better metric than GDP or whatever
the other proposed metrics are for the health of a society or civilization. It's a very deep
question, actually, to say what is a healthy civilization? There's environmental metrics,
there's happiness metrics, there's health metrics, there's progress metrics, there's educational
metrics, to really answer what is a healthy good civilization you have to answer, what is a meaningful
human life and what is meaningful human life in total and how is the civilization
actually fulfilling on that. So the metric of success and the existential values are very related.
And I think everybody knows that optimizing for something like GDP is not a very good
success metric because GDP goes up when there's war and military contracting goes up,
it goes up when addiction goes up and people spend more money on getting their supply.
When people are more sick and spend money on health care, GDP goes up. So there's a lot of
places where GDP can go up that are maybe good for the supply side and really bad for civilization
as a whole. And there are a lot of alternative indices where we maybe look at genie coefficients
and national happiness indices and all of them have some good consideration and then are also
missing some stuff. If I tried to make some way of optimizing for happiness,
are we defining happiness in a kind of Buddhist sense that is very disconnected from the nature
of desire and is more like contentment or happiness in more of a Western sense that has more to do
with kind of a creative passion. Those are very different. And what about optimizing for the
happiness of sadists? Or what about the short-term happiness that comes from addiction?
And so you can start to kind of think about when you're benefiting one value, what are other
values that can be harmed? And there's this important insight that almost everything that
values lives in a dialectical, almost everything that is worth valuing lives in a dialectical
relationship with what seems like a nearly opposing but it's really a complementary value.
And so there's some kind of balance as the beginning way of thinking about it,
but higher order synthesis is kind of a better way of thinking about it between the values.
Individualism by itself, run amok, looks like
social chaos and low coordination and coherence. Collectivism, run amok, looks like oppression.
Civilizations fail on both sides. And so of course we have these age-old political debates
about communism versus capitalism, libertarianism versus socialism, the political left and political
right that are taking values that obviously have to be in relationship with each other forever.
And instead of saying how do we best create a dialectical synthesis between individualism
and collectivism, we have it fight as if one of them could possibly win, which is nonsense.
And so when we're thinking about success metrics, we have to think about whatever
thing we value, what also has to be held in a dialectic relationship with that,
and that's on one axis, then there's lots of axes. I would say that for everybody who's kind of
thinking about how do we design a better future, if you do your own experiment, your own thought
experiment of what are some indices that I think might be good indices for a healthy civilization.
If we were going to optimize for anything, what would it be? Like do that as a thought experiment,
because it's a meaningful one. You kind of mine your own sense of what is the good life,
what is meaningful, what is a good civilization. Then you have to think about where would optimizing
for that metric actually create problems? What are the failure modes? Where is that thing,
even though it's valuable, not sufficient? And what might we have to add? And then you get to
start thinking about the interconnectivity of things. And there are, there's a lot of classic
dialectics. Individual collective is one. Immediate term and long term is another one.
Do we want to optimize for the rate of progress, even if it is through creative discontent where
everybody's miserable now, but there's lots of progress happening? Or do we want to optimize
for the state of the quality of life now, even if it maybe has very low progress?
Well, obviously there's a relationship between how do we have progress towards
dissatisfaction forever is not that interesting. A kind of content that creates stasis rather than
evolution is not that interesting. Is there a higher order synthesis where the fulfillment
with life leads us to want to add to it creatively? So oftentimes thinking about the relationship
between those things gives you a higher order insight. Oh, my progress doesn't have to come from
discontent. It can actually come from a sense of the fullness and beauty of life that I want to
add to. And now all of a sudden the progress metric and the near term metric don't seem
like they're opposed at all. One of the nice things about thinking of synthesis is you end up
realizing that things that seem dichotomous are sometimes actually better optimized together
than more synergistic. One metric I have proposed that is an interesting one to think about for
the health of a society and some other points is an inverse correlation with addiction in the
society. The more total types of behaviors people have addictive relationships with,
the more consequentiality those addictions have on their life, the more intensity, the further
the distribution, the earlier they start in life. The aggregate of all that would be a hard thing
to measure would be an inverse correlation to the health of a society because it's an inverse
correlation to the health of the individual, psychological, physical, relational health.
The person experiencing compulsion rather than choice in ways that harm themselves that they
wish they didn't. Obviously the movement into more sense of freedom and agency to make the
choices that are aligned with the life we want is correlated with quality of life. These are just
examples of indices that are maybe not ones you automatically think about or hear often but that
are kind of interesting. There's one in particular I wanted to construct today. We honestly could
have talked about it as just an interesting model not as a societal index and we could have talked
about it as a way of measuring the health of a relationship or the health of a community
or the psychological health of a person. It's kind of fractally true at these various levels.
I'll make a caveat and say I don't think any definable metric should be optimized.
I wrote a piece a little while ago maybe we can put in the link here when it goes onto
YouTube called The Dance of the Tao and the Ten Thousand Things and it's specifically about this
but the first verse of the Tao Te Ching where it says the Tao that is knowable is not the eternal
Tao. The knowledge that's knowable is not the eternal knowledge, the Tao that is speakable is
not the eternal Tao. The Tao that is optimizable is not the eternal Tao. Optimization means that I
can define it in terms of a fixed number of metrics and then I can run some weighted optimization
algorithm across those metrics. We can see just like GDP ends up being good for some
things but quite perverse for other things so then I can try to add some other metric to it.
We can see that any metric set if I optimize for it there's some things that are valuable that are
outside of that metric set that end up being harmed by how I optimize for those things and
there's kind of a girdles in completeness theorem here in the same way that there's a
kind of fundamental infinity to math. There's a kind of fundamental infinity to what is meaningful
where any finite definition of it ends up being less than it actually is and so I would almost say
a definition of wisdom. One interesting definition of wisdom is
the difference between what an AI running an optimization function on a fixed number of
desirable metrics comes up with as the right choice. The delta between that and what the
actual right choice is would be wisdom which means that it has to include that it includes
rationality and the consideration of all those metrics but it's not limited to it. The includes
and transcends the transcends that part which is able to factor something outside of the existing
metrics that's able to recognize it that's something like discernment and wisdom that
matters and if anything that's another way of saying well if we could optimize for something
we would optimize for that that's another metric at the level of civilization.
So the reason I bring this up is to say this this model I'm about to propose
I wouldn't optimize for because it's missing stuff so I'm not offering it as a complete thing I'm
offering it as an interesting enough thing that it's worth thinking about as
one of the central things and we can talk after we constructed about what it's missing.
Okay so without further ado on the model so people have heard here probably of mirror neurons this
kind of sympathetic effect where there's a pretty automatic reaction that happens for
most people where they feel some kind of sympathetic experience with other people something
they feel some element of what they would experience if they're experiencing this
a thing themselves watching someone else go through it so you can flinch if you see somebody
else getting hit you can start laughing if you see somebody else laughing so there is a coupling
between our emotional state and the emotional state of someone else in this case and so we can
feel happiness associated with their happiness we can feel pain associated with their pain.
I would say there's a whole bunch of questions about mirror neurons and rather than say
rather than really tie it to the neuroscience of mirror neurons that is still evolving and
is probably wrong whatever I'd say about it I'm going to use it as an analogy more than a mechanistic
description. It's probably the case that that process mediated by mirror neurons or whatever
evolved largely as to serve group selection that humans were a necessarily tribal species
group species where individual sapiens don't do well on the savannah they don't do well at all
right like they they they don't make it outside of being in a group so the cohesiveness of the
group is how they succeed in hunting and protecting themselves and all those things so
we over focus generally on individual selection what makes who's the alpha and what makes the
person individual and we do that because we've created a world today where we don't recognize
who the tribe is because everyone is fungible I can get everything that I need from this abstract
thing called the market and I can put something into the market to be able to get the dollars to
get what I need which was largely a way of abstracting relationships to make it seem like
we don't need each other but obviously our life depends upon other people we've just tried to
make it pretty distant this is also the why there's ubiquitous loneliness and mental illness
and a basis for so much addiction is because the addiction is trying to fill a void that
was largely because of being tribal people and so for a tribe to function well it's not
based on a huge amount of in-group rivalry it's based on a huge amount of in-group cooperation
in-group cooperation is facilitated by this mirror neuron kind of phenomena of if I'm hurting when
you're hurting then I'm not going to hurt you right which means that as a tribe I can trust you
more and we're going to get along you can trust me more we're going to get along better if I feel
good when you feel good then I'm more invested in helping you out you're more invested in helping
me out we get higher cooperation and higher cooperation ends up being pretty central to
the thing we think of as the unique advantage of sapiens right our language and our division of
labor and whatever are kind of higher orders of cooperation and so our emotional coupling with
each other helps that now we can see that people will have this with an in-group and have the
opposite of it with an out-group right so we feel pain when somebody in our in-group that we love
is feeling pain we call that compassion or empathy or sympathy or something like that but sometimes
we even feel joy when someone in the out-group out-group feels pain like in this is the form of
vengeance or a kind of joy and a sense of justice or rivalry or whatever it is and so we can see that
we can have mirror neuron type relationships right we can have positive coupling of our
emotions and other emotions and that facilitates anti-rival risk or cooperative behavior we can
also have decoupled or even anti-coupled emotional responses which leads to rival risk behavior
so if people are familiar with stuff that I talk about the movement from rival risk to
anti-rival risk dynamics being not just important but necessary under exponential
tack is one of the things I talk about a lot because rivalry leads to travel warfare and
conflict and things like that right conflict of various kinds obviously when we move from stone
tools to bronze age tools and then to iron age tools that conflict gets capable of killing more
people at bigger distances when it moves to an exponential tech mediated world you can't run
exponential conflict on a finite planet and keep running the planet the damage scope of the conflict
it's too large so anti rivalry or bust is pretty fundamental you don't get to run exponential
rivalry so thinking about this thing who should be the in-group who should be the out-group well
if everybody has access to exponential tech and any in-group uses force against them it drives an
arms race where they then figure out how to reverse engineer that tech make it stronger use it back
against you as long as we keep doing in-group out-group dynamics at any level left right in the
US US China whatever we are on a path towards self-induced extinction so we have to find a way
of having a coordinating basis that doesn't require an out-group as the thing we're creating an in-group
with respect to so if we didn't out-group could we have that tribal mirror neuron kind of thing
with everybody right could we actually have a positive coupling of our motions with everyone
so I want to construct the core of this thing is
we'll describe like four words or four things there's this axis a pain pleasure happiness
unhappiness axis inside of people and we were describing that it can be positively coupled
with somebody else so the so if you're feeling some kind of pain or negative emotion I'm feeling
something that's painful in response it means I give a shit right like I I have some investedness
or connection or skin in the game to your experience so we would call that sympathy or empathy or
compassion on the positive side if you're if you're doing well if you're succeeding if you're
progressing if things are going well for you in life and I feel happy for you that thing that we
think of as empathetic joy it's important to acknowledge that we don't have a word for that
in English like we make words for concepts that we use the idea of feeling joy at the joy of others
it's it's actually a core precept in Buddhism mudita is a Sanskrit term for empathetic joy
feeling delight at the delight of others it's considered of the the four virtues to cultivate
the kind of subtlest and highest of all the virtues and we don't have a word for it in English
because it's a phenomena that we don't even think about or focus on enough to make a word for it
the polyamory community had to make up a fake word and it's Kim Persian and so the term Kim
Persian they they held being the kind of the opposite of jealousy and specifically in a sharing
intimate partners which was the common opportunity to feel jealousy actually feeling happy for the
happiness of others even when it involved romance because it kind of got popularized there I think
the term came out in the 70s it has been extended or we can propose extending it because English
has no other word for Kim Persian not being unique to a romantic context but in general feeling
happiness at the happiness of others feeling joy at their success to lighten their delight so I'm
going to use Kim Persian that way and it's expanded definition so we have one axis that is the
compassion Kim Persian access and the compassion Kim Persian access as I my emotional state is
coupled with your emotional state I want to see you doing well I feel better when you're doing well
I don't want to see you doing poorly I feel something painful that doesn't have to mean
codependent that I'm totally fucked up if you're feeling poorly because that's not helpful and
then I can't help but I feel something that's resonant okay so the compassion Kim Persian access
that's if our emotional states are coupled if they're completely uncoupled there's no
relationship at all whether you're suffering or happy makes no difference to me my suffering
or happiness has nothing to do with yours that's maybe what we would think of as sociopathy just
a complete decoupling and so you can be totally suffering and I can be totally joyful if I happen
to be joyful about it in this case I don't want you to feel suffering I just don't care what you feel
right it's just a state of apathy of not giving a shit and as a result I don't want to hurt you
but I'm happy to hurt you if that gets me something I want but hurting you would be
not the terminal end in and of itself it would be a means to some other end that I care about
that's the uncoupled state and we can see that it is quite destructive we can also see that
unfortunately most people feel that way about most other people there's a lot of people in
the world suffering today and you don't give a shit about it because you don't know or they just
had the greatest success of their life and you don't give a shit about it so you notice that the
Buddhists because of this idea of mudita are cultivating compassion and compersion mudita
for all sentient beings in the universe how do I bind myself with the self of all sentient beings
and that is really thinking about them wow some kids are in sex slavery right now some animals
are in factory farms some you're like how do I think about the greater world how do I bind myself
to it and it's from there that devout the bodhisattva arises how do I become of greatest use to all
sentient beings not just myself because myself what is best for me and what's best for all
sentient beings is the same when I bind myself to all of them um in the same way that what's
best for me and what's best for the tribe evolutionarily is the same we just extend the
tribe to all sentient beings there's a Sanskrit saying the world is my family right it's that kind
of idea okay so now what about anti coupling reverse coupling my positive emotions are coupled to
your negative emotions my my negative emotions are coupled to your positive ones me having negative
emotions coupled to your positive ones is what we would think of as jealousy or envy or negative
comparison or any of those types of things like if you're doing well ah fuck that guy man you know
like I'm actually feeling jealousy or I'm feeling envy I feel something negative at your success
or at your happiness we think of this as quite normal in our society because we have conditioned
it based on a society where second place is the first loser and um everything is based on
competition on the same finite metrics and uh from the time of you know little kids were
conditioning them to rally for a sports team where we're super happy when these guys win
and give no shits at all in fact feel feel happy about the other guys losing and we could just
as easily be rooting for the other team we're training ourselves to be able to couple to a
tribe an anti couple to another tribe emotionally which is really good for supporting warfare um
and but it's important to understand that this
jealousy envy thing is of course natural to humans but it's not inexorable to humans meaning
it's not something that we're just stuck with no matter what it there's a natural proclivity to be
able to condition that but it gets conditioned and it's also possible to have cultures that
condition something very else very different so when you look at the maswa people indigenous group
in china near lulu lake if you look at the canela people in the amazon you see people that have
pretty much no jealousy almost no jealousy show up in their culture and when it does happen it's
a tiny phenomena that someone just kind of recognizes and corrects for would be shameful
for it to be anything else but they have a whole culture that's conditioning a different
set of things now you'll notice these cultures don't have private ownership of property like
lots of tribal cultures don't they're all sharing everything well that means that they don't have
a primary concept of mine related to private property what does jealousy mean if i don't have
mine as a foundational concept right if there's a ours as a foundational concept we we are all
sharing our resources as a tribe and sharing access to things but you see that we condition mine
into little kids the reason it's a it's almost like one of the first words many little kids say
because they were watching their parents and everybody on tv say it because of a mindset
that was so oriented around possession and possessiveness and advancing through getting
more things so we think of it as natural because it's been ubiquitously conditioned
here's where i would offer a christina murty's famous quote that it is not a good measure of
mental health to be well adjusted to a profoundly insane society so most of us are pretty comfortable
with the idea that the people who were feeling like who are celebrating and rejoicing at the
lynching of slaves as a form of entertainment like they were fucked up they're psychologically
fucked up people but they were everybody in a culture at a time they didn't think of themselves
as psychologically fucked up so we're like is it possible for a whole culture to have a shared
psychopathology and not realize it yeah totally and what about the great joy that happened in
human sacrifice in many ancient cultures and the idea that some good great liberating thing
happened with that human sacrifice what about the vast burning of witches which were moms which were
women being burned like tortured but there is a a righteous glee in that process okay so we're
pretty comfortable with the idea or Nazism which is like there are plenty of people who are alive
today who remember that we're comfortable with the idea that it's possible for an entire culture to
be insane like have a completely batshit crazy set of ideas about things and where there's something
like a mental illness across the whole population and not just insane but criminally insane right
the burning of witches the lynching as a fun form of entertainment the throwing of christians to lions
as a good sunday activity for the family that like that's a criminal insanity but it's also
just called culture and so it's important to understand we will inculturate insanity where
it seems normal i would claim that ubiquitous jealousy of the type that we have in our culture
is a is a type of low-grade subclinical ubiquitous psychopathology and specifically it's important
understand that it is the inverse coupling of my emotional state with other peoples
binding us to a rival-risk relationship with each other now the other side of this axis of
reverse coupling right the jealousy envy one is i feel some pain some pinch some negativity at
their joy their win their success the other side is i feel some joy at their pain this is sadism
uh the german term schaudenfreude is you know feel experiencing joy at the misery of others
sadism particularly is experiencing joy at the misery of others particularly when you have
something to do with it but we can i think most people are comfortable with the idea that of all
of the emotional dispositions humans can inhabit sadism is uh the the one that is most problematic
right it's the one that is most kind of bound to what we might think of as evil you mean the person
well they just didn't know they were causing harm no they did well they felt that they had
to cause harm no causing the harm was a terminal end of itself they weren't doing it for some other
reason they just enjoy it i don't know a better way to define evil than that right like that's
this pre-fucked up so it's important to understand that sadism is the other side of the same axis
as jealousy there's the same axis right the the reverse coupling of my emotional state and yours
so i would say that this whole axis which we can define as the rivalry axis right i see i have
an inverse emotional relationship because i see you as fundamentally an enemy fundamentally
another a bad guy or whatever so i feel good at you getting hurt you losing you doing less well
etc i feel bad at you getting ahead in any way and when you can see that in a tribal warfare
conflict maybe there was an evolutionary purpose for this if there really was scarce food and we
had tribal war over it and i see that you actually got some more weapons and some more pigs and whatever
i feel scared and i feel bad because it was actually maybe going to go bad for us um
and so we understand why people do in-group identification and out grouping and out grouping
makes it to where i can call somebody a Jew and then be happy gassing children in the millions right
because they're a Jew and they're so other and we make them bad or i can call them a terrorist or
i can call them a racist or whatever right and um if you if you look in current culture at how the
left and right use out grouping terms on each other even just Republican or Democrat is an
out grouping term that has so much negative connotation to the other side but conspiracy
theorist anti-vaxxer flat earth or whatever um commie socialist anti-patriot uh that should just
have to stop right that that tribal dynamic multiplied by exponential tech is a self-terminating
thing but you'll notice that there's a kind of righteous joy that people feel on both sides
when they feel like they're winning and the other side is losing and they're sticking it to the other
side right and but the joy feels righteous it actually feels moral and but so did the people
burning the witches in the name of Jesus right and somehow in their mind they got that in the name of
Christianity and the following of Christ and the guy who said let he who has no sins amongst you cast
the first stone and emphasize forgiveness we're going to torture these people to death somehow
they twisted the shit in their mind to have that make sense where it actually felt moral and righteous
study juror if you haven't studied juror before in terms of conflict theory and scapegoating
one particular form of out grouping is uh scapegoating in particular we have to transcend that
juridian thing so what I would say is you've got this compassion compersion axis
and you've got this sadism jealousy axis and
I would say that feeling joy at the joy of others is a fundamentally healthier kind of joy to
optimize for than just personal joy because personal joy might be sadism and it might be
sociopathic right it might mean that my joy is totally decoupled from yours it might mean that
my joy is actually at your expense if it's on the compersive side it means my desire to feel more
joy requires helping other people and if their desire to feel more joy requires helping other
people now there's this anti-rival risk symbiotic cooperative development so compersion is a subset
of joy or happiness that is one that has the highest synergy and internalization of externalities
and health that's associated but I wouldn't want compersion without compassion because I wouldn't
want someone who were just spiritual bypassing happiness junkies who were just only like oh
I'm happy at your happiness you're sad I need to move away from you and find someone else who's happy
I want people who can be with feeling compassionate the pain of others and move by it and go help
right if if compersion is the only thing I want to feel I don't want to be Mother Teresa I don't
want to go be with homeless people or sick people or whatever but if I'm if I'm moved by this axis
right if someone's hurting I don't want to not be hurting I don't want to not like I when I'm
feeling pain at the pain of the world I don't feel bad about the pain I'm feeling I feel like I
would be mentally ill if I wasn't feeling it so even though there is some pain at seeing the pain
of the world there's no inner conflict around it so there's peace in it right deeper than happiness
is wholeness and the sense that like if someone I really love dies I don't want to be feeling ecstatic
in that moment like something's wrong with me like I want to be feeling a certain grief and there's
a beauty in the grief because there was someone who was so fucking beautiful that I got to know
at all right so there is a happiness there is a beauty there's a gratitude and there's a loss
and there's reality and when I'm feeling that it feels right it feels like the only thing
that I should feel there's no inner conflict so so we want happiness but not as the only emotion
we want all all of the emotions when they're appropriate right they all have a appropriate
function so here's my index that I would offer how do we measure compersion well it's very hard
so I'm offering this as a thought experiment how do we measure compassion very hard how do we
measure sadism and jealousy so let's not deal with how we measure them for a moment let's just say we
could the in a society the total amount of activity on the compassion compersion axis
divided by the total amount of activity on the sadism jealousy axis would be the index of the
health of the society the more of this one and the less of this one right a ratio of the total
amount of human activity and human emotion on this axis versus this axis emotionally coupled versus
emotionally anti-coupled and given that we want to not be doing the in grouping out grouping thing
because we have global effects and we can't just kind of be peaceful with our own in group we have
we depend upon people in six continents because of our complex supply chains to make the stuff
this really has to become rather than just an in group metric a civilization wide metric
I would say though if you look at your own relationships
and you look at this metric it's a pretty good measurement of the health of your relationships
if you were to look at a community of people the degree to which the people are in kind of
jealous envy competition with each other not so not so good the degree the degree to which
they can't be with the pain of each other each other not so good so obviously to be with the
pain of each other has to have not just a positive wiring which is the compassion but has to have
enough strength and emotional resilience that I can be with the emotion right so we can see
that to fulfill on these emotions requires a bunch of other things to be in place
to not be jealous of somebody else requires enough inner fulfillment that I'm not so desperate
that I feel like I need the thing they have right and so you can see that to be able to
fulfill on these there's other foundational stuff like strength and wholeness of being
I the first book I ever read that got me started thinking about these things really clearly was
when I was a teenager a book called the way to love by Anthony de mello I don't know if I've
recommended that one here before I love Anthony de mello so much he's a Jesuit priest but he lived
in India and like tendu philosophy liked all the religious philosophies I think him continuing
to be a Jesuit was just like a respect and appreciation for a tradition he came from
but it's a small little book of meditations and they're they're basically all about how to
cultivate a kind of wholeness that creates more of an unconditional happiness that allows you to
be more virtuous because if my happiness is unconditioned if my happiness is very conditional
and my sense of peace is very conditional then I have to be trying to rearrange the conditions
of the world and trying to rearrange your behavior and everything else to fit meeting that hungry ghost
inside of me if I find a certain fulfillment in my relationship with life with breath with the trees
then what's in it for me stops being the primary driver and I can actually be attentive to other
things so rather than happiness being the goal of life I would say kind of an unconditional type of
happiness or an unconditional type of peace is the beginning of life that is really worth living
where you aren't being run by what the buddhas call the hungry ghost realm of what's in it for
me as the primary driver and that's when you can start paying attention to how interesting other
people's experiences and how much is going on in the world and not just how what does everything
mean for me which is a fucking dreadful narcissistic hall of mirrors and so the work to develop that
wholeness as the basis of being able to see the world and be with it and live while you're here
is fundamental so I recommend the Demalo book
and yeah that's the thing that's the metric I wanted to propose the compassion
compersion divided by the jealousy sadism ratio and now of course why does that metric fail
I could have people that really care and really give a shit and are so bad at rationality that
they keep making the objectively wrong choice so if I was to amend this metric with something the
first thing I would amend it with is I would multiply this metric by the rational and empirical
quality of choice making but see then the rational choice would be a tool of utilitarian
awareness in service to what was being defined by this metric right which would be my desire for
the happiness of all beings would then be the thing I was using rationality to optimize
the other thing is of course if if I have this for an in group and not now group I can still
be sadist to the outgroup and run arms races the outgroup has when I say we have to have no
outgroups that has to include other species and so if we want to extend this further have the
mirror neuron thing not just be limited to sapiens but all sentient beings so if we say
this thing the compassion compersion axis is what we want to be on as much as we can and
as little on this other axis and empower that with good rationality and empiricism of what's
really working and extend it to all sentient beings I think that's a pretty solid metric for
us to optimize for and that's it as the thing I thought might be interesting and I wanted to share
and oh one other thing okay so that sounds nice now this is a new thing that we can pretend
is true for us when it's not true and create a shadow around okay so I'm going to pretend to
be compassionate even though I'm actually feeling some shout and Freud when somebody else is hurting
because I was told this was a good virtue and people like good virtue so I'm going to pretend
to be this way because really I'm just trying to get other people to like me because I'm still
basically in the empty what's in it for me place and other people liking me because they think I'm
a virtuous person is what's motivating my behavior all right as long as you have the empty hungry
ghost realm what's in it for me thing running you you can't run do virtue you just can't you can only
run the simulation of it so what does it take to overcome that this is this is why I like that
de Mello book so much it's why I like the Buddhist practices and ultimately do I really even hold
the fucking virtue do I hold the value where really I'm developing it because I care about it but
whether anybody else ever knows about it or not like I care about it my own sense of inner integrity
and respect of myself matters or am I happy to virtue signal this thing because really what's
driving me is the childhood insecurity and feeling of I'm not enough and nothing's enough
and I need to compensate by having other people love me and like me and praise me and whatever so
I will do virtue just like I might do money or or sexiness or humor or whatever it is as a
compensation method for being able to get some kind of something from other people in the world so
so there's a question of like okay so we just defined a virtue worth holding but now how does
one congruently develop the virtue versus just jump straight to the performative behavior of the virtue
you think about it enough to think about how fucking miserable a life any other way is that
you become so disgusted with your own behavior of that type that you have to stop it and you become
so inspired and heartened and motivated by the beauty of the other thing that you're inspired
to work at it and and you have an internal congruency between what you actually believe
and what you're willing to train yourself and base your life on and then you know
that the other thing is still conditioned in you and pretending it's not there doesn't help
so okay I feel jealousy well sometimes when I it's time to work out I feel lazy
I don't have to pretend that I never feel lazy I don't have to super shame myself for it
but I also don't not work out right like it's okay so I'm feeling lazy that's okay I accept
that that feeling is arising and I'm going to go get some caffeine and I'm going to go to the gym
and it's like I can notice it and I can still choose a higher path rather than choose to
that path right because as you have low energy you don't choose to do the things that generate
more energy and there's a downward cycle so if instead you choose to do the thing that takes
energy but generates energy there's an upward cycle and this is kind of like the essence of
being able to notice something and then make a higher choice maybe maybe I'm feeling some satism
maybe I'm feeling like an actual kind of someone piss me off so much I'm like have a
vengeance sense if I pretend that I don't and I try to stuff that away it'll come out when I get
upset enough right and I'll blow up and I'll be a not safe person or it'll eke out in subtle ways
where I'll subtly undermine people um so I have to look at all that shit so I'm a big fan of therapy
by the way good therapy I'm not I'm not a big fan of types of therapy that aren't effective but
I've done something like a thousand therapy sessions in my life uh started young kind of
did it intensely fisher hoffman work gestalt work young Ian work ret primal screen rebirthing
whatever name all the things because um in the same way of doing a lot of meditation a lot of
study it's like meditation works on a level of self different types of meditations do different
things but maybe I'm developing my ability to concentrate to quiet the mind that doesn't mean
that the thoughts that when they do arise in the mind are healthier that's in the domain of
psychology of how do I work through where the thought patterns arise from and what the patterns of
thought are um and neither of those give me the benefit of studying where I'm learning new skills
so these are different dimensions of the self that are all worth working on because you not just
are happier but you are also more capable of showing up more meaningfully so if anybody has
a stigma around therapy where it's like that's for fucked up people let that go it's you invest
in what you care about and if you care about having the clearest psyche you can so you can be the most
whole vessel for service to the world and invest in it um and you can do it on your own you can
read de mello get the principles and then get a process like Byron Katie's the work and kind of
work on on your own that's great um there's lots of processes like that but haven't helped with it
also like okay hey I have a lot of jealousy that's a thing that's in there because it's not the thing
I respect I want to work to shift it but I'm not going to have the I'm going to have the type of
shame around it that says I don't want to indulge it but I'm not going to have the type of shame
that makes me pretend it isn't there so I can't work on it because I ultimately recognize I didn't
program it in myself right had I been raised in a Buddhist culture I would be different um so I
don't really have any shame in the fact that it was programmed but I also have have a value system
that it doesn't align with and so I don't want to let it stay in me so I want to work to shift it
but in order to work to shift it I have to be honest about it be willing to look at it and
do the work on it right so there's a kind of shame that empowers us there's a kind that doesn't
right there's a kind that says oh I actually value something else in the and I want to be
more aligned with my own values so it empowers the agency to work on something there's another
kind that just makes you feel defeated and then you usually do more of the negative thing because
it's a coping strategy for pain and pain comes when you're defeated so uh so there's a there's a way
of contemplating your values where you're like yeah I don't live in the fullest relationship of my
values I could because I've come to these values through my own reflection on things but I was
programmed in a different way I was encultured and conditioned in a different way and I I don't
need to feel ashamed about what me as a little infant was conditioned in what me as a little
kid was conditioned in but I also don't want to keep it being that I don't want to keep being the
result of my birth and my unconscious early time once I reflect on my values I want to work to
bring myself into more conscious alignment with it and so so I do feel a certain healthy kind of
pride when I notice that I'm making progress that my behavior and my experience is more aligned
with my values and there's a healthy kind of shame I feel when it's not which is basically just saying
no I actually value my own values and I know that I'm actually not doing the very
best that I could with this so I'm going to work on it
about virtue development for its sake because you actually think about it versus virtue signaling
the thing about virtue signaling that's such a bitch is that it destroys other people's
belief in the reality of virtue because when people see a virtue signaled enough times and
it's not real they stop believing it anywhere then they just kind of go nihilist and then often
kind of sociopathic as a result of the nihilism I so much more appreciate when someone's really
coming from what's in it for me like I appreciate it being explicit right like like Cardi B,
Jeffrey Epstein, whatever style like I'm fucking in this for me I'm like awesome at least we know
what we're getting like and some people will be fine with that and they'll go along with it
so I want to see relationships where so another metric we could add is that it's not just the
state of compassion, compersion, relative to jealousy, empathy, it's also an evolutionary
metric that this relative to this is increasing right this is increasing and this is decreasing
and in order for that to happen there's the healthy kind of authentic communication about it that
allows us to understand the dynamics and help each other all right I think that's it curious if
there are any questions on that and so much goodness that was just presented that comparison
thing is it blowing my mind still yeah we have a lot of questions in the chat we might not get to
all of them but yeah let's take an elliot first I'll let you add a question yeah thank you really
appreciate this and so trying to find the question itself I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on
the difference between having this social health index and developing incentive structures or
systems which encourage the movement towards an optimized society that expresses these values
uh in actuality incentives are why people virtue signal an incentive is intrinsically an
extrinsic motivation so if I'm incentivized to do x what it means is something other than x
that I want is given to me for doing x right some y that I want a gold star a dollar a piece of
recognition a trophy and so what it means is I really want y but I'll do x because somebody
else gives me y I can't develop virtue that way I can develop a behavior but I can't develop an
internal congruency this is one of the things that's so tricky is how do you help develop what people
actually feel and want not just their performance or their behavior and I can't use reward and
punishment to condition someone's interior states and their reality so you cannot cause people
to feel a thing I mean you can make it more likely you can nurture it and this is different
like good parenting is there's no algorithm for it right sometimes the kid is expressing the
jealousy thing and you just listen to find out what's going on and find out where the kind of
feeling of emptiness is and work with it sometimes you teach him a lesson sometimes you
share where you feel jealous right sometimes you and what is the right thing to do
Marshall Rosenberg said something I really loved he said when it came to parenting he said
stop just asking what behavior you want your kids to do and start thinking more about what do I
want their y to be for doing it and if I want their y to be that I'm afraid of getting punished if
I don't and that I need my parents conditional love and approval so I will do it to get the
conditional love and approval okay then keep using those methods but if you want their y to be that
they intrinsically care about certain things and that they have values that are meaningful to them
that they're willing to invest in and sacrifice for and whatever how do you nurture that it's a
deeper question right so when you you said incentives or structures so I was picking on the
incentive part to say one of the things I I'm looking for as another health index of society is
the ratio of intrinsic motivation that moves people to extrinsic motivation is another health
metric the the higher percentage of human behavior that is motivated by extrinsic motives is the more
people are going against themselves or having to kind of go against themselves because of some
external structures that are force force functioning them to do that or where there's
internal conflict in them Einstein didn't do what he did because people were paying him for it and
Mozart didn't do what he did because people were paying him for it and Jane Goodall didn't and
the things that we find most beautiful in people is an intrinsic arising now the labor force
forever has been a situation where civilization has needed most people to do shitty jobs for
lots of hours to make civilization work so how do we get people to do that well if the jobs need
the people then either the state has to force the people and we would think of that as totalitarianism
or we have this liberal democracy idea that will let the market force them
by creating a symmetry where the jobs need the people so let's make it where the people need
the jobs and so we think of that decentralized system of incentive as a good thing because it gets
all the stuff done and seems a little bit more free robotic automation is about to overturn that
whole thing robotic and AI automation and either it's going to create a world where those robots
are owned by a few people all the wealth is concentrated and it's a way more fucked world
in terms of wealth and equality with a massive useless class or we realize that by
ending the idea that we need a lot of extrinsic motivation
because there's a bunch of shitty jobs that the humans have to do that we can procedurally
that the easiest jobs to automate are the ones that are the most wrote which are the ones that
humans enjoy the least and the things that humans enjoy more the are the harder ones to
automate because they involve more creative process more intelligence etc so how do we move
to an economy that is more based on people having common wealth access to the things that they need
so rather than what do I need to get the whole idea also that you if you don't have an extrinsic
motive system like capitalism and you get a fucked up welfare state it's just gibberish
that's only once you've ruined people put Einstein on welfare put Mozart on welfare put
Jane Goodall on welfare put Jimmy Carter on welfare awesome what the fuck are they doing
those are not ruined people those are people who are connected to the meaningfulness of their life
well when kids are chilled when they're kids and they're asking why why why what is that what is
that what is that and they're curious about everything and we don't answer any of their
questions well and we don't facilitate their interest in life and then we try to force them
to be interested in shit that they aren't interested in we break their interest in life
and then they just want a hypernormal stimuli and so then you have to extrinsically motivate them to
do shit because from the beginning you've been extrinsically motivating them to do the shit and
not following their intrinsic motive well and then we do social science on a people who've been
ubiquitously conditioned that way and call it human nature it's not human nature it's ubiquitous
social conditioning and so this is my rant against incentive of course temporarily while
everybody our incentive junkies because we've ruined everybody in this way we have to make
better systems of incentive that are less perverse but we also have to be working on moving from
incentive to an entire culture that is focused on facilitating the intrinsic motivation of everyone
now when people have as their emotional state this compassion compersion axis their intrinsic
motivation will also involve benefiting everyone right in whatever way whether it's through their
art or their nurturance or their craftsmanship or their science or their whatever it is
so then the question how do we nurture and condition the growth of that and other people
that's a great question how do we condition it in new children is a very good question
how do we condition adults who've already been really affected i started by saying this is why
i like psychotherapy right is because you have to change your psyche you have to be able to notice
what are the patterns in the psyche you have to be able to look at where they arose from and you
have to be able to consciously start working at shifting some of recognizing that consciously you
value certain things that are not how you are programmed to be so how do you take those unconscious
programs make them conscious and work to be able to shift them to have more alignment and congruence
in general the question how do we as individuals and how do we as parents and how do we as educators
and how do we as people wanting to steward communities and civilizations condition the
growth of virtue of any kind and people condition real inner growth rather than just external behavior
is a centrally good question one that we could take another stowa for and one that
i know some things and it's maybe the topic i wish i knew better answers to
than i do more than anything else
thank you so many follow-ups but a lot of other folks waiting so thank you so much goodness here
khalil you had a question that got a lot of uh plus ones you could unmute yourself oh hi thanks
thanks daniel that was amazing and thanks peter for having this event this is somewhat of a
personal question um so uh answer your liberty uh so my brief survey of people um suggest that the
ones who feel higher connected to a higher power uh don't have the existential fear that precludes
the ability to love you can say that the cup run up over um is this connection to a transcendent
power necessary for radical transformation today and do you have it do you have a connection to a
transcendent power to a transcendent reality yes transcendence to any particular reality as i can
define it and um i'm not going to call it power there are problems with that word
and
so again if you are interested read that document i wrote called the dance of the tau in the 10
thousand things i think one of the ways that we fuck up the most is by trying to take the
transcendent and bring it back into the non-transcendent that which transcends
conceptuality and then we try to conceptualize it so we can have certainty about it um so
i i don't know if this is historically true i have heard this narrative and i like it whether
it's true or not so i'll give the example here the story here was that early jews
said that it was had a recognition that the reality that we think of as god that they could
think of as the transcendent the absolute was important to not have a word to describe it
because the moment you had a word it wasn't every other word it wasn't uh there there was
something more associated than other things less associated and that that would actually
mess us up conceptually so that when they were talking and they wanted to reference
that they would reference it with a few moments of silence they would actually say
instead of coming to god and saying god or higher power whatever they would just close
their eyes and take a few moments of silence and try to in feeling access a sense of the transcendent
that is trans conceptual and trans linguistic whether this is true or not i fucking love this
story i love the idea of communicating that way and that words there's a symbol grounding
there's a symbol to represent a ground but the idea of that which is transcendent isn't a ground
it is that which is beyond any particular ground right so i don't want a symbol for it
but that doesn't mean that there isn't a relationship with it it means that it's trans symbolic
right and that the idea was that when they converted that spoken pattern into writing
just leaving a space sometimes it was hard to tell how big the space was and was it really a
space between the words or not and so they needed a placeholder so what did they put as a placeholder
to be unspeakable and that the uh so they picked the letters in the Hebrew alphabet that were the
most impossible to pronounce in relationship with each other that jhwh was an unpronounceable set
of letters and so they weren't to represent a name they were to represent the unspeakable
the ineffable and so that when you were reading and you saw jhwh you just held silence it was a
placeholder for that and that when that was translated later the vowel diacritics of either
latin or greek or the other languages came in and that's how we got Jehovah or Yahweh from
it as a name which kind of violated the whole purpose of the thing like i said i have not verified
if that's historically true but it is metaphorically a true meaningful set of ideas
Einstein said it's a optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate things
and that in reality there is a one thing or oneness that we call universe
well it seems like they're separate things seems like i'm separate than you and separate from this
tree over here and kind of but if i if i remove if i think about me without thinking about the
planet if i removed the planet what would i be well i wouldn't exist at all
if i removed the sun what would i be i wouldn't exist at all if i remove the center of the galaxy
i wouldn't exist at all if i removed the electromagnetic field or the higgs boson
i wouldn't exist at all so i completely depend on heaps of things that i don't include in my
definition of self which means that my definition of self is just badly defined and my definition
of everything else is badly defined so when you really get this you realize there are not separate
things there are boundaries that have some distinction of one interconnected reality
where none of it would exist without all of it so that all of it there is a there's a relationship
with that that is possible but it's trans semantic and it's trans belief it's beyond a specific
proposition to say this proposition is true or not true because belief has to be defined in terms
of a propositional logic which is defined in terms of semiotics this is deeper than that
so the dow that is speakable is not the eternal dow but there is a relationship one can have
with it it's ineffable so if someone has a relationship with that ultimate reality that
which we'd reference with silence that if we were going to call it something we would call it life
with a capital l or reality with a capital r whatever it is then i see everything else as an
as a unique expression of that one reality a unique facet of that one reality and because
it's a part of the ultimate reality it's sacred and because it's a unique part it's completely
irreplaceably sacred so then when i'm perceiving what am i perceiving i'm perceiving
the whole of reality beyond anything i can conceptualize that that is the basis of what
makes everything i love and value possible expressed in a form and in a unique form and the
person in front of me is a form that has never been in universe and will never be again like this
and i have a moment to interact with a completely unique possibility of experience
i think when someone really gets this and you'll see in in de mello's book this deep kind of like
the relationship with the transcendent isn't i believe in a god which is just
i made up an imaginary friend in my head to comfort myself
and because i believe in that god i can torture people in his name
i can be more interested in the god in my head than the real humans in front of me or the trees
or the life in front of me so it's very possible to have a very pathological relationship to a
transcendent function i want a transcendence and an eminence together right that that which
transcends every form is also eminently expressing through every form so then all life is sacred
so then harming life is sin and the highest thing i could want a relationship with the
transcendent is available through every possibility every moment every possibility when
jebron said it was in meditation upon the dew drop that i discovered the mysteries of the ocean
so now the hungry ghost realm is gone when like
say you do mushrooms and you go outside and you look at some trees anyone who's done
mushrooms and got to look at trees has had this experience and i'm not talking like
10 grams of mushrooms where the tree is dissolving and you know whatever i'm talking like a gram of
mushrooms you're out there and you have this experience that the tree is so beautiful that you
can't you you can't imagine having enough time in your whole life to really appreciate it like it
would be worth your whole life to just appreciate the beauty of it and you're wondering how the
fuck did i miss this tree it's in my front yard i've walked by it a million times and i've never
really seen it but if someone asked you to describe it it's you'd say the same thing
still like the leaves are green and the bark is brown and the except why is it so much more
beautiful even though optically it hasn't changed because a hundred percent of your attention is
with it because one of the things the mushrooms are doing is kind of retarding the other cortical
functions that have you lost and yeah but i need to be doing something else in a laundry
list and narrative and other thoughts and so when all of your attention is kind of in the
sensory process you're able to really see the tree but this is also the just kind of mystical
eminent experience that st francis and everybody talks about of seeing the overwhelming beauty
of reality and the numinous expressed through form right so i go outside and i look at the trees
and i watch the way all the leaves are moving and on all the trees and in relationship to the
way the clouds are moving and i'm just i'm just awed by it right like it's just exquisitely beautiful
and i'm like man i could have been born on a planet where vision wasn't a thing
or where i only got to see in black and white as opposed to all this color
or or not born at all just no experience and the depth of this experience just the amazingness
of experience at all of something rather than nothing at all of the beauty that's here is
is so fucking epic is so infinitely precious compared to nothing i would choose to incarnate
if i got the choice to this life and all the difficulties of this life just to experience this
just to get to have this experience of color and motion with this tree in the sky
and i've had this experience so many times where i am i'm listening to music i'm watching a tree
i'm making love i'm whatever it is and i'm like fuck experience is so incredible
that i would incarnate my whole life for this moment
and when you take that seriously and contemplate it you're like man i've had so many moments
that are worth a whole life already i've had thousands of lifetimes worth of incarnating for
and i'm still run by what's in it for me did i not pay attention
like and when i when i kind of get that then there's like a the rest of like having any more
amazing experiences just gravy and the fact that they keep happening is amazing and they're also
available any moment i actually pay attention right it was in meditation upon the dew drop that
i discovered the mysteries of the ocean and there's always a dew drop in every moment right
there's always a expression of reality i can pay enough attention to
the way rilke in letters to a young poet to the in the first letter talked about
in if you can find no inspiration in reality even go to your memories right that even just
in the memory of the experience there's enough to be to find exaltation moved by
so this is the answer to the hungry ghost realm
and it is a transcendent but it's a transcendent and eminent right it's both the the transcendence
into that which is beyond all achievement and form and then the embodiment of it how do we
move higher into spirit and then spirit express through form spirit what does that mean transcendent
you get the idea right and do i think that is necessary yes do i think it requires
something like believing in a god i usually think that gets in the way because you have converted
the transcendent to a semiotic proposition to believe in or not believe in that was a mistake
that was that was an impulse towards the thing and then actually having the reality of that which
is beyond definition trying to get captured by the definition part having the comfort with
infinite unknowability get turned into trying to have certainty about a thing
awesome thank you uh clio uh definitely compelled to do shrooms now after the session
do you have one more uh uh time for one more question daniel sure cool uh margaret uh you're
up next well thanks peter thank you daniel this is um resonating to say the least um so my question
is about energy dynamics um and i'm wondering how you view the energy dynamics of people
escaping the gravity well of anger and jealousy on that um anger jealousy compassion compulsion
access um because there's in the short term a seductive incentive around anger and the
gross availability of energy that becomes available when you're dwelling in that place um i really like
the way michael jordan talks about in the last dance of how you like would generate these
conflict scenarios in order to fuel his playing it's like a really nice example of how we do that
so i'm wondering how might we invite individuals to direct their energy towards
moving in the direction of compulsion and compassion knowing that it's a pretty high activation cost
i think when you take the examples michael jordan is a good one and you look at the
mohammed ali mike tyson connor mcgregor kind of energy i'm the greatest i'm gonna beat the
shit out of them whatever it is we realized that it it's effective to um up regulate certain types
of capacities what you notice is that what each of those people are doing is mostly embodied animal
behaviors right there we're talking about sports in a body and that it's very important because
what we're talking about is a very primitive set of emotions the fight energy out of fight flight
freeze the fight energy is the up regulation of certain kind of neuroendocrinology that activates
fast twitch muscle fibers and activates glycolysis and stuff right so if i'm literally talking about
hitting and running that thing works but that same sympathetic nervous system activation
and adrenalization decreases prefrontal cortical activity decreases the capacity for most
rationality design empathy so you don't see einstein doing the connor mcgregor energy
because it wouldn't work it would actually make him suck at the thing he was doing
um and so it's important to get that that thing works for activating a evolutionary fight process
in a body to increase muscle activity and now there's a lot of other emotions that go along
with those hormones but they aren't those emotions don't actually make you better at other functions
and very much in the way that a high person high on pot is blown away at how good their ideas are
and their ideas totally suck because their high brain is interpreting them and the sober
people around them are like man those are those are not good ideas um in the same way the person
who's high on the endocrinology of anger might think that the way they're thinking about strategy
to solve social problems is good because they feel activated but it's not good it's bad strategy
and it's why it usually produces really shitty results and much better results happen from people
who can do much clearer minded thinking which is why when it comes to activism and social strategy
where people are upset and they're traumatized i want a space for trauma healing
and then i want a space for strategy and they're not the same thing
and the trauma energy ends up making shitty strategy that ends up being self-destructive
even to the goals and the long term though it seems fulfilling in the short term
and that thing of like yeah but like you know when you're really angry you want to say the thing
before you calm down there's a party that's like i should calm down and not say the thing right now
but there's a party that's like yeah but i don't want to be calm i always let myself become i want to
say the fucking thing and and then you say it then you regret it and you're like why did i say the
thing why didn't i calm down there there's an autopoetic energy any energy that we get into it's
almost like that uh peter would call it a daemon right that daemon or that
neurological process wants to keep living it wants to act it has a momentum to it
this is why there's a question of do we have a witness and do we have a set of
higher order values because all of those different
momentums in us want to keep acting and they're not all worth letting keep acting right
so uh addiction is a very good example
if i'm coming down off heroin i don't give a shit about anything other than getting another hit
i don't want sunsets i don't want a friend i don't want to hold hands i don't want to
learn some new thing i don't want to help homeless people i want a fucking hit because
nothing else is going to make me not feel terrible because i have so conditioned myself to that
particular hypernormal stimuli that nothing else will do and if i do the short term thing that
makes me feel better i'm probably going to die on the thing right because that short term thing
that makes me feel better also increases the addiction and i now keep needing the heroin
relative to anything else and my and the thing about addiction is it gives you a spike
and then it gives you a crash the crash makes you need a spike again and as you keep doing
the crashes and spikes your baseline erodes that's essential to the addictive process on any addiction
whereas with healthy process if i work out or i eat some healthy food i don't get anywhere
near as big a spike instantly as i do from the chocolate cake or the heroin or the gambling
or the whatever it is in fact it might even be kind of not that fun in the moment but then i have
increased health endurance capacity whatever as i keep doing it and so my baseline increases over
time and i actually start to get a reward circuit associated with noticing progress and so i'll get
a reward but it's a different nature of reward it doesn't have the same nature of crashes and it has a
a difference in the change of baseline so this is the two marshmallow experiment right
the kids that didn't do well at the two marshmallow experiment didn't do well at the most of the rest
of life and so there's a question of do we have the ability to do impulse control over short-term
shit and be more focused on long-term advantage all environmental harm is short-term focus at
long-term expense almost all war is it seems in the short-term best interest while not recognizing
that we're driving arms races that make worse wars that will kill way more people worse in the future
we get so focused on how do i make this political win because my side has to win this four years
not realizing that the next four years will will swing harder the opposite way they'll utilize
whatever tools of propaganda we developed and make better versions and then they'll undo whatever we
did for these four years and we're stuck in the fucking cycle and the thing we're doing for the
short-term win is driving enmity of the other group and increasing their capacities so getting out of
the short-term reactivity process to be able to say what is a long-term goal worth having and how
do i actually become in better service of it is necessary for anything worthwhile
so then the question how do i become a two marshmallow kid if i'm a one marshmallow kid
meditation where you don't scratch your nose when it itches it's a great example right where you
sit up straight and when you want to move you don't for 15 minutes until the bell goes your body's
going to stay straight and when you want to itch your nose you don't itch it and you hold the mantra
and your mind wanders and when it wanders you bring it back to the mantra and wanders you bring
it back to the mantra what are you doing you're developing increased agency over your own self
and increased impulse control to not have to itch the thing to not have to move you take cold showers
and even though you don't want to get in the cold fucking shower you do it anyways and then you
consciously relax your shoulders when they want to tense up and you take those impulsive processes
and develop more agency over them you work out when you don't feel like working out and you develop
positive reward circuits on it more than anything hang out with other people that are two marshmallow
people rather than hang out with other people that are one marshmallow people because as social
creatures the people who are around condition us the fastest and until you have conditioned yourself
to be two marshmallow you can't help other people be so you might as well be around people that can
help you until you stabilize it then you can help other people but there is a place and this is where
I said the healthy shame comes in this where I said like I get you know when I read the
de mello I got so disgusted with myself thinking about like
he had these inquiries into what is love it's like when I say I love somebody what I mostly mean
is I like the way that I feel when they behave specific ways and if they don't behave those
specific ways I'm willing to punish them I'm willing to hurt them into behaving those ways
through fear and guilt and shame and emotional manipulation of various kinds and we call that
I love you well it's actually fucking disgusting it's not love it's like some weird cannibalism
or addiction and thinking about it that clearly is very helpful to me to be like actually I would
rather be with no one than do that like I'm so disgusted at myself for that I would just rather
be with no one I would actually the samurai thing I'd rather kill myself if I can't get past that I
don't need to keep doing this thing I can get I can fucking get past that like I know that I can
get past that thing and do better but it's gonna take some work but I'm willing to work at it so
there's a place also where I think about enough I can't behave that way and respect myself I must
actually be able to respect myself to feel a integrity of myself so I'm willing to just step
away from the job the relationship whatever it is and work on myself enough to come into alignment
with my own self and that's what I would call like a depth of congruency where one starts taking the
meaningfulness of their life seriously I don't know if that helped those are all
useful ways to transition from being a one-martial kid to a two-martial kid I guess I'm more curious
about less on the individual level because I think that once like you said once you recognize
that within yourself there is this intrinsic motivation to be doing that work that practice
constantly that's like a lifelong thing I guess I'm more curious about how do we aside from
literal embodiment of being a two-martial kid and developing that in oneself how do we invite others
to develop those same internal intrinsic motivations knowing that the activation energy to get to
two-marshmallow the two-marshmallow state is quite high and that there is you know when you sit down
in meditation and you don't want to don't move to itch your nose you know you fail a few thousand
times before you actually sit there and don't itch so more like how do we support that place of
fumbling before you see the ramp up of actually getting a effect from your actions
yeah yeah so you're go ahead I just throw on a second question there too is
in terms of distinction between short term and long term I'm curious if you have any temporal
scale of what you're thinking of isn't long term how long term depends upon the actual kind of causal
cycles associated with the dynamic if I am thinking of cutting down a forest how long
will it take for that forest to regrow the complexity of it if I'm thinking about kind of
mowing down a hemp field it'll regrow in a year if it's an all growth forest it'll take a thousand
years so um so the time scales involve thinking about what is affected and how is it affected and
so that's obviously there's a various range of time scale it's different for um for different
activity what about what about for a healthy civilization what depends on a civilization
has choices like do we cut down trees or not versus do we cut down hemp fields or not like a I I had
I have to be thinking so the the seven generations is a nice idea because it has us go far enough
ahead that we think more creatively than we're kind of habitually likely to do typically we're
mostly going to think about ourselves and maybe our kids life because of the thing we're we're
automatically connected to so seven generations or a thousand year timeline is a good timeline to
think about obviously you'll be able to think a lot more granularly about a hundred year timeline
and you'll be able to think more granularly about a 10 year timeline so there's a whole scope of
timelines to think about ultimately how do we support the thriving of all life and perpetuity
right perpetuity is as as far as I can sense it as far as I can sense it as best I can sense
what is aligned with the thriving of life is the time scale where I kind of start
and then back up from there now the question you asked about not how do I become more aligned
which is what I thought you were asking but how do I support other people in that is more
aligned with Elliot's question of
how do we effectively support the development of values virtue psychology psychological development
mindfulness etc in other people and particularly at scale if that's the question I would say
it's funny
my my sense is that
Buddha and Krishna Murthy and everybody of that type struggled with this question more than just
about anything else like man how how do we help more people get this thing it's kind of a hard
thing to do and you can see that none of them succeeded as much as they might have liked
but also didn't succeed none and so we can see is it possible to create like a Buddhist culture
where based on how the children are growing up it's a lot of things it's the educational system
but it's the way the parents are it's the way that not just the parents but the other people in
town and the even what the kids are being exposed to in terms of media that all of that is a part
of it it's the they're learning Tong Len from the time they're little
so one of the things I do is when I think of any particular virtue I try to look at the culture
that developed it the best as a positive deviant and see how did they do it and then try to see
because they weren't doing it in one or two people it wasn't kind of a
spontaneous thing it was a oh that culture actually did a pretty good job like Jews did a
good job of a high level of academic education across the whole population
Buddhists and Jainists did a pretty good job of non-violence across the whole population
so then I try and see like well what did they do culturally that brought that about
and which set of those things could be synthesized to make a culture
you know and Anthony Demelo wrote some books and gave a lot of talks and lectures and worked
with people and I think that helped makes made a church that worked with people you know every
sunday and all week long I think the idea of like well can I make a blockchain type system that makes
a better system of incentives so that even if it's still extrinsic motive I'm at least not
extrinsically motivating people to the most pathological behavior and thus kind of conditioning
sociopathy and then that's a good that's a good way of uh thinking about it
can we move out of a two-party system that forces the primary event in media to be
a rivalry and narrative warfare driving camps against each other that is conditioning almost
the worst thing in people using their deepest kinds of fears and emotional hijacks could we
make a system that did something better than that so there's like system level answers
we look at facebook and if it's optimizing for time on site and people spend more time on site
when they're limbically hijacked because consciously they don't want to spend that much
time on site and they spend more time on site when their bias is being confirmed because
they're going to spend less time in their biases when they're hitting cognitive dissonance then of
course a piece of technology that is using all the internet's information and AI optimization to
double down on people's bias tribal identity and limbic hijacking is kind of the way Tristan Harris
talks about uh collective downgrading right that's kind of a collective downgrading using exponential
tech could we use the same exponential tech in a collective upgrading that was actually
doing like personalized education factoring all that personalized data for people to present
education in the most compelling ways unique to them that they would find most interesting
including even things like media literacy and mindfulness stuff that made them more
sovereign even to that system so I think the answer there's like what can I do to help my
friends and family there's what can I do at a community level there's what can I do if I'm an
artist a technologist someone who runs social institutions lots of different things
I don't know if that helps better that was that did help better and I will stop asking
follow-up questions because I can see Peter glaring at me so thank you Daniel yep thank you Margaret
um so we passed up on our uh so perhaps it's best to close here um Daniel uh perhaps you're
coming in next week I think or the week after on existential risk um any kind of closing thoughts
on today's session and maybe setting up that one I didn't um I didn't get to read the comments as
they were coming in because I can't do both things well so I stayed focused I uh I'd be very curious
to see questions and thoughts I'll see if before the window closes I can read some of them I because
I'm curious how this model resonates with people um resonates very deeply with me and then I'm curious
how it resonates with other people and uh and if it does I'd be very curious how the Stowa community
as a community of practice might actually answer the question that both Elliot and Margaret were
kind of asking of how do we support others how do we support each other to say is there a is there a
community of practice that we could have that helped in this particular way I could even imagine
something like taking the uh DeMello's book doing a book club with it and then having some kind of
small group or dyadic practices to be able to share reflections and insights and something along
those lines yeah I definitely definitely feel called to have a session after this with the Stowa
community to kind of like sense make and then discuss and perhaps a community of practice can
emerge I really love the model that you presented and so many freaking threads and thoughts are
coming up for me and I imagine a lot others in the room as well and I will save the chat and um
your way so you have a chance to read it at your leisure um so I'll make some closing announcements
in a moment but Daniel thank you so much for coming to the Stowa my friend that was a great
session thanks for having me thanks everybody for being here uh and as mentioned Daniel's coming
back on June 9th for Psychological Pitfalls Engaging with X-Rist and Civilization Redesign
it's another patreon event at 6 p.m eastern time uh Dave Snowden is coming back again to doing a
session called HR Bullshit on July 15th at 12 p.m eastern time that should be really fun and uh a
big event at Noam Chomsky and Contra Points the future of the left they're gonna have a conversation
on June 28th at 6 p.m eastern time another patreon stowa event so you can check that out the stowa.ca
Daniel everyone thank you so much for coming to Stowa today
