All right, everyone. Welcome to the Stowa. Our friend Daniel Schmockenberger has returned.
He was here last week with a really awesome session on the health index and today the session
is called the psychological pitfalls of engaging with X risks and civilizational redesign.
I'm super jazzed about this one and I imagine a lot of people at the Stowa are as well.
If you recall a couple months ago, we had a symposium at the Stowa on the Metacrisis.
A lot of people came in and talked about X risks, suffering risks, and effective altruism,
they talked about burnout from engaging with this type of stuff. We had someone talk about
embodiment and X risks. Michael Smith came in. I imagine a lot of people have a lot of cool thoughts
about this and so how things are going to work. I'm going to take in Daniel in a moment. Daniel
will share his thoughts on the topic at hand and then we'll pivot to Q&A. If you have any question
anytime during today's session, just put your question in the chat and I'll call on you. You
can ask your question to Daniel. If you do not want to be on YouTube, just indicate that
and I'll read your question on your behalf. I'll take in Daniel now. Feel free to share
your thoughts, my friend, and welcome back to the Stowa. All right. Good to see you, Peter. Good
to see everybody. It's fun seeing everybody's face turn on as the music plays. This was a
topic Peter and I were discussing and there's nowhere else that I would really share it because
it's not even a well-formed set of thoughts. It's a handful of observations that present themselves
maybe as a useful topic for community inquiry and community dialogue. Obviously, the nature of
broadcast doesn't do dialogue all that well, so I'll be sharing the things that I think are at
least seeds for a conversation and then maybe something will happen in the space if it's interesting
to explore it further. Specifically, what motivated it is I've had lots of people reach out to me,
some from the Stowa community, others from just kind of watching podcasts in general,
talking about the existential risks, catastrophic risks that they have been paying attention to
or working on, and the mental illness that has come from them for working in the space
and the extreme difficult interpersonal issues that have come. I see this a lot. Also, people who
are working on it from a psychological disposition that is clearly going to be less than optimal,
if not quite problematic. There are things I've seen a lot and I thought it would be worth
talking about. This is for basically world-saving endeavors in general, anything kind of framed.
Ex-risk is a bit unique, like the possibility of homo sapiens gone or all hydrocarbon life
on earth gone or something like that, frames up world-saving in a very unique way, catastrophic
risk in general, even if not full existential risk, grid shuts down or massive climate change,
just disrupting all coastal cities or whatever. It's a unique kind of thing to focus on.
But even the topic of how do we make a fundamentally better soil and what does the future of a
high-tech civilization look like, the scale of these things is not really a human scale. These
are not things that evolutionary history would give us any scale for or even the history of local
civilizations. Getting things wrong because of scale, issues of grandeur, psychologically,
issues of overwhelm, having a hard time with your agency matching it. The scale and the
consequentiality and the unprecedentedness and all of those things create for a situation where
there would be a lot of reasons to not be attracted to want to pay attention to the space and those
who are attracted sometimes have things about them that are strange and then also engaging with it
has an interesting effect. I thought I would just mention a handful of things that I've experienced,
working in the space, people that I've worked with and things that I've noticed
came up for me as I worked in the space and to pay attention to.
By no means will we be doing anything like a comprehensive list. Take these almost more as
examples of the types of ways to think about how psychological dispositions relate to how one comes
to a space and then also the nature of being in a space, how that affects someone and then how
the ongoing kind of process of their psychology effects can do in the space.
But I'll probably cover the tiniest percentage of the total space of things worth looking at here.
Before we get into what happens working in X-Risk and civilization design and however one wants
to call it. I wanted to start by what are some of the strange psychological dispositions that can
attract one to the space that are not ideal that you can watch for and everybody, you know,
everyone can have shadow elements so you're in a place like the stove because you're interested
in looking at this. So I'm speaking to people here who I'm assuming are earnest in terms of having a
real motivation and earnest about wanting to look at their own proclivities and see how to
integrate, heal, upgrade themselves, compensate for things like that. There are obviously some people
who come to any space for reasons that are mostly just weaponized and I'm not speaking to them here
though I might be speaking to you of noticing them.
You can imagine why a topic like catastrophic risk or existential risk would be a very
interesting one for people who are interested in power of different kinds
more than their desire to really prevent it or serve life. I have a friend who helped set up a
lot of the X-Risk community who told me of some of the billionaire class that was donating early
on. One in particular very strategic said really it's just a recruitment strategy for him. He
donates to the space because you know super smart people are attracted to the space and then he can
recruit them into areas of exponential tech like in the in the for-profit section and so you can
see someone signaling their interest for a reason other than what it is. Someone wanting someone
running a kind of military contractor type organization wanting to see what are the best
distributed red team scenario planning people can do to then be able to actually win at the
arms race rather than try to prevent it or just any space that starts getting attention and having
some because of the attention power associated will always be a honeypot for people that are
seeking attention and power and want to signal and ladder climb. So that thing happens. I don't
assume that I'm just speaking to anyone who's doing that because there's usually some self
knowledge of that. I'm assuming I'm speaking to people who have what most of us have all the time
which is that there are different facets of self and I was just seeing this comment was saying my
connection was bad. No okay. There are different facets of self that have different motivations
for the same thing. It's very common someone will have a motivation to from a deep part of
themselves to genuinely serve and protect life. Motivation in the cognitive domain to want to
learn about interesting and important things. An interpersonal motivation to want to work with
good people on an important topic where you feel camaraderie. Some unresolved ego places that
want to feel seen and recognized for doing important work. Some unmet needs that need
compensated. You know it's like there's going to be a number of things coming together. So
what we're going to look at is some of the ones that can get in the way that are worth noticing.
And I think it's worth saying we you know like a conversation like this could be had about any
profession. There are psychological dispositions that attract someone to be a police officer
or a doctor or a politician or whatever. And then there are psychological effects of working in
that space. Obviously some of those are really important like how do you attract highly empathetic
and compassionate people to the role of a police officer? How do you keep them highly
empathetic in the presence of the thing that they're paying attention to and that they're
experiencing all the time? Like that's a real issue. What is the effect being a doctor of the
malpractice issues and liability issues that you have to deal with to not lose everything and have
your family lose everything? And simultaneously the fact that you're overworked radically and don't
have time and you're dealing with dead people all the time. And like so the types of psychological
professional hazards and weird attractors in the space are not unique to the space. I just haven't
worked as a police officer or a medical doctor. I don't know much to say about those.
Those are more established fields. So there is more kind of known in terms of professional
psychological insight and help for the established fields. And specifically I think
the Stowe community or at least some portion of the Stowe community is interested specifically
in these topics of how do we design a different future? And both from the positive side of how
do we participate in designing a better future but also from the negative side that it seems like
there are really shitty futures that have high probability. How do we prevent those and design
a better future? So insofar as people are paying attention to that and they're here rather than
in some other forum because they're both interested in that and interested in their own
personal development to be in better service to that and hopefully also relational development
so that they can work together. That's why it seemed relevant. So with all that preface.
So if you just think about what types of weird psychological dispositions that might be problematic
could attract someone to the space of looking at existential risk and catastrophic risk in the
first place you could probably just start to guess them if you haven't already even noticed them.
So there's a bunch of things that have to do with fear. Someone's fear of uncertainty and fear of
just bad shit happening can of course attract them but where there can also be distortion
because of that fear that has them weight everything through an anxiety lens and there's
this very interesting symbol grounding thing where it's like if you feel let's say that I have a
bunch of unresolved fears of the unknown because I had a traumatized childhood where at any moment
my parents could behave erratically and messed up ways and so I just had hypervigilance developed.
Well I now have an embodied sense of anxiety and hypervigilance not connected to anything
free-floating that I've just projected on and so things that look negative like they could go bad
feel true to me because they'll resonate with my existing feelings that have nothing to do with
observing reality but old stuff I haven't resolved if I see a different scenario where things look
possibly secure or good I won't feel true to me it won't land as true I'll be suspicious of it
because I don't have those feelings. So there's a place where there is a feeling of truth no matter
how logical someone wants to be because they can always say well that argument looks really logical
but I think we missed something where does that I think we missed something come from it's it
doesn't actually land as feeling true so I'm going to look at it again versus I hear it initially
as a hypothesis and I'm like that's the hypothesis I want to go study and see if I can verify because
it feels true so I think people underestimate no matter how logical they're being how much the
symbol grounding the embodied feeling ends up being a huge part of it so fear of the unknown
in general fear of uncertainty making me want to be a forecaster so I have more certainty about
the future and fear of negative things happening this is a huge one and fear of death specifically
and so then I can project my fear of my own death onto the fear of death of everybody and I'm going
to solve my own existential fear of death by solving the death of the world or civilization
I probably don't know that's happening right I probably think no I'm just being very rational
about the fact that AI risk is a very real thing and biotech risk and etc and that might also be
true because we're complex creatures with multiple parts operating but the
to be both a lot of what's driving and a lot of what creates distortion
this topic of that I just mentioned about like fear of my own death so let me solve civilization
not dying can also be like fear of chaos say in childhood family felt chaotic
and didn't feel like I could solve that so I'm going to solve chaos in the world
the projection of our own unmet needs that we actually feel low agency over and they're too
traumatic so we project them in the world and try to solve them's unbelievably common right
not in this space alone in all kinds of spaces and so this is why the Taoist saying if you want
to protect your feet from rocks better to get shoes and try to cover the world in leather
all of those things around why your own psychotherapeutic healing work is important is because
all of you your knowledge of science your knowledge of cognitive biases and logical
fallacies and your unresolved traumas and interpersonal issues and fears all of you
will come to bear and how you assess and how you act on the situation and so as much as you
want to develop your cognitive abilities and your knowledge of the technological stack and
your knowledge of how to do Bayesian forecasting and other types of good you know confidence margin
calibrating forecasting you also want to work on clarifying the grounding and the psychology of it
as much as possible another thing i've noticed is there's so many people who just really don't
think about catastrophes that much at all they're thinking about positive things or if there's negative
oh yeah i know climate change whatever it's a bummer but their mind doesn't keep gravitating
there their mind gravitates to what is near term or whatever there are some people whose mind
gravitates to real negative things and gravitates to it so much they can't not try to think about it
and figure it out and then if my mind gravitates towards those things so much that i don't just
think about climate change or species extinction or nuclear risk but all of them and try to think
about x-risk as a whole category there might be a disposition to focusing on the catastrophic that
is worth looking at in CBT cognitive behavioral therapy one of the main dispositions that messes
people up psychologically that they tell you to look at is what's called catastrophizing right and
in your own personal relationship he didn't call me back it means that he dumped me and he's gonna
not love me anymore whatever it's like you're just going worst case scenario with some tiny little
thing and it obviously leads to huge amounts of interpersonal stress and anxiety and i think
it was mark twain who made the quote i've suffered a great many terrible things in my life a few of
them actually happened and the idea that almost the great greatly terrible things that i suffered
was a shit i made up in my mind that still suffered from so the disposition to catastrophize
is it's quite possible if someone has that disposition they're smart and they got
some analytical skills or whatever they might actually be quite good at forecasting bad scenarios
and be a good risk analyst whether we're talking about for a military application or financial
risk analyst or x-risk analyst they might be better than most people at being able to think
through all the bad shit that could happen and then how to think through theory and solutions
for how to address it this is actually a good a good thing of like how a particular trauma can
actually have a gift in it and this is most of the time our traumas and our gifts are connected
right like whatever difficult stuff we went through often sensitizes us to issues that we
weren't sensitive to otherwise often in the process of of healing it we come up with some
skills that are useful for the world so this is very common but it's also true that if we don't
heal the trauma the lingering trauma messes up the gift we might have a really awesome gift but
it continues to have dysfunction and self-sabotage and whatever associated and so we want to take
the gifts from whatever bad conditioning or trauma we had and heal it enough that we're not still
suffering with the trauma but have the gift so let's say i have a disposition to catastrophize
as a result i can red team the shit out of your project i mean 700 different ways that it can fail
from nth order of that um that's quite helpful to think through so that i don't have to actually
fail from all of those things you know like being able to anticipate them put some probabilities on
them see how we would test that that's quite helpful the question then is let's say in order to achieve
any big thing like okay how do we create protection against weaponized drone attacks on
infrastructure i can't do that by myself and it's going to take a team to do this a hard damn thing
to do how are we going to harden the electrical grid against emps and kerrington events how are
we going to create a closed-loop materials economy that addresses planetary boundaries
there i have to work with a big team very well to do that now does that same catastrophizing
having me catastrophize my relationships where i can't trust anybody because i assume that everyone
else is either going to make the wrong decisions because they don't understand everything as well
as i do or they're actually badly motivated well seeing where people are badly motivated is a huge
part of doing ex risk well right being able to see the game theory and uh being able to see where
people cause problems by accident which is externalities unintended externalities so if i'm
really good at seeing the game theory and the externalities can i also not apply that when
that's the wrong tool i'm like amazing at swinging hammers but now it's time to cut shit and i'm
still swinging hammers um so the best tool is actually totally destructive when it's not time
to use that tool and if it is a tool that becomes a disposition right so if you want to do really
hard work of this type with lots of people you have to be able to develop very high trust
relationships and then there's a question of do you have capacity to do very high trust
relationships that and catastrophizing don't work together well also there's no solving
ex risk that is that means anything without being an optimist in some way like
there's a kind of pessimism i need to think through all the problems but there's a kind
of optimism i need to think that could be a constructive pursuit at all and that we could
actually solve them and that when i look at the overwhelming face of all the
shit that that i think about how to actually overcome it and it's almost like that there's
an optimism that is a choice that says i'm going to look for solutions period maybe i fail maybe
i die looking for it but i'm not going to move into the compromise i'm not going to ask are
there solutions or not it's a wrong fucking question it might get a bad answer to it i'm
going to say what would it take to solve this let me understand the design criteria enough what
would it take to solve it and then so i'm committed to find solutions and not get stuck but since i
want them to be good solutions that i can believe in as a naive optimist not a naive optimist right
a post i go from a naive optimist to a cynical pessimist to a post naive and post cynical optimist
right you have to get to the post cynical phase that's critical
um so i want my optimism to be a post cynical choice that i'm going to keep looking for adequate
solutions and ultimately that i trust in the bigness of the unknown possibility space that
there might be shit i just haven't thought of yet so i'm not going to come to the certainty
there are no solutions false certainty about negative stuff is one of the biggest problems
right the holy wars were all fought over people's certainty thing um nobody really
does great acts of atrocity in uncertainty so if you have to decide which side to air is that
i'm certain there are no solutions okay well then we just have to radically depopulate because
that's the only thing or or i'm certain today is going to take over okay so we have to figure out
how to upload our consciousness to the cloud so we're going to justify some really fucked up
experiments for a while or how to whatever it is so you can see how when somebody has a
a false certainty because they couldn't possibly know the whole possibility space of stuff that's
in the unknown and yet they preclude there could be no possibility there then they start looking
at bad possibilities in so there's this post cynical optimism that then uses cynical pessimism to
redeem the solutions to make them better right not to throw them out but to make them better
and so i'm going to come up with why they might not work so that i can come up with solutions
to solve that um so if somebody is in the naive place that doesn't recognize how fucking hard
these issues are and how much uh how much actual game theoretic nonsense is there even in the space
of people supposedly working on this and etc you're just going to fail and you'll move to this next
space soon if one is in the cynical place there are real upper bounds on the kind of trust creation
and the kind of design solutioning you can really do so there is a post cynical place one must begin
to be post cynical authentically you have to know that there are other people who are post cynical
because if you're cynical you think trust is impossible trust is something that naive people
do right you think the way mackey valley would talk about it and so you think oh whoever i trust
the most is who i get fucked the most by so whoever doesn't know who the sucker in the room is is the
sucker um there is a kind of trust that is post cynical where everybody knows game theory because
they're like whether it was this or not i'll use it as an example right we can see the way the
coffers all decided to die together to in service of this thing we can see the way the founding
fathers when they're writing the declaration of independence and signing their name no they're
all signing to be killed if the british catch them uh in terms of sedition which also means
they're signing to be killed if any of the other guys defect so what they're doing is saying i trust
you enough that i'm that i trust you under duress to not defect on this kind of thing
so um any decent rebel alliance uh or fellowship of the ring or whatever has to be post cynically
grounded in a way where there is a transcendent loyalty to the cause that we know each other share
which makes a transcendent loyalty to each other uh and so you can't catastrophize your relationships
right you can't bring trauma into those relationships and have that thing work
you obviously have to not be stupid you have to use really good discernment but good discernment
means not projecting old patterns it means clear of old patterns actual discernment
i might want to come into the space of ex-risk catastrophic risk or even just
i'm going to solve sdgs or whatever kind of world-saving proposition just purely for the ego
reason of it sounds like the dopest thing to do like what are you working on oh you you're working
on a local homeless shelter that's cute i'm i'm actually going to save the world uh you're solving
cancer i'm solving the ability for anyone to ever solve anything ever again because otherwise
it's not going to be able to happen right so if i just want to one-upmanship my way all the way to
the top i'm solving the world um and so you just have to check that shit right like
ego has a role in life we we have individuated senses of self it has a role
if one doesn't have transcendent experiences of connectedness to everything that are not mediated
through words and mediated through their name and mediated through being a human with a gender
and a language if you don't have a transcendent experience of that to that includes but transcends
the ego you need to work on that because you can't actually do the right kind of work only from the
ego place ultimately without this biosphere i'm nothing at all so if my but my ego doesn't
include the biosphere hey what's in it for me how do i get ahead whatever and yet i don't
fucking exist without all the stuff that i depend upon that isn't included in my little sense of
self which means i can harm things that i depend upon in service of this little myopic thing
and so one needs to have a sense of life the interconnectivity of all of it that's actually
embodied this is the purpose of any kind of mystical spiritual doesn't require weird beliefs
it's actually not about beliefs at all beliefs mess it up it's about experience experience of
consciousness not mediated through the semantic and a transcendent connectivity associated with
that you can have that without any beliefs you'll still come back to having an ego come out of that
most transcendent experience whether it's through meditation vision questing iowaska whatever and
then you'll still have an ego and so any model that shames the ego and says it's a bad thing we
need to get rid of just puts us at eternal conflict with ourself because it's a dimension
of ourself the ego is the mind is the emotions are so they all have an evolutionary purpose it's
just how do we tend to them and integrate them so a healthy ego doesn't fuck the hole for itself
right it it actually subordinates to higher self it's an important thing and then in so far as the
ego wants belonging and wants esteem and those types of things it wants it from things that are
actually aligned with its highest values and aligned with long-term interest rather than
short-term interest so it's not a hypernormal stimuli so if there's a part of me that wants
recognition i would it would be better to think about things like what will i feel best that i
had spent my life on on my deathbed and how do i want the people who are gathered when i'm dead
thinking about me people about who i was as a person and who i was to them and how i interacted
how i touched them and those types of things that's still ego motive it's just an ego motive
that because it is relational and because it has more duration ends up being less problematic than
just visualizing myself getting the Nobel prize or whatever the the um near term less holistic
consideration is so you can watch like a way you can tell this isn't happening so like let's say
i'm focused on ex-risk i want people to be nurses like there there are people who are going through
existential risk themselves this moment they're they're in the process of dying or about to die
or their kid is right and it's like it's it's everything that is sacred about the big picture
in a microcosm embodied now and i can't help that but that nurse can or that person who's doing
rescue work with dogs in the in the pound or the whatever it is like i want everyone bringing
that full depth of love to whatever is theirs to do so i can tell if i'm in a conversation with
someone do i listen to the thing they're into and get fascinated by it and get proud about it and get
wrapped and want to support it and not need to talk about my thing um do i talk about my thing in
a way that actually makes what they're doing possibly seem less important even to them if so
that's an asshole thing i got to fix um there's and then there's a million things like this it's
kind of if i have big control issues i might be very interested in designing the future because i
want to feel like i have control in the biggest possible thing i could want to have control in
i i want to feel like i can bend the world to my will or whatever it is it very much
a alexander the great napoleon conqueror kind of mentality i'm applied in this domain it's like
there's a lot to be very concerned about in those spaces um so these are a few things about
uh dispositions egoic dispositions trust dispositions fear dispositions the um
catastrophizing ones that might attract us to the space but might also mess up how we show up
there and so what we would do is say how do i inventory these and how do i work on them what
therapists can i work with what practices can i do and also who can i be in close relationship
with that i can trust where they can help check me on the ship and i ask for that and i can help
check them on stuff so can we because the definition of a blind spot is i can't see it
so there's going to be stuff in the way that i'm showing up where i think that i showed up pretty
well and they're like no you you totally seemed like an arrogant asshole or um no you seemed
really disconnected and way more interested in your own stuff than anyone else i'm like i didn't
know and so i need people that i trust to give me feedback and i need to want to hear it and i
need to make it really safe for them to give me that i won't always agree it might be some of their
trigger i should take it really seriously and err on the side of trying to agree and trying it on
we can get now into the topic of what happens working in the space of having all of your
attention on very abstract things very long-term things and all the particularly most negative
things but i guess i'll stop here and say are there any questions or thoughts at this point
on the attractors to the space topic
yeah that's a lot of good stuff here and we got tons of questions coming up
so let me just take a moment to feel into what is the best one to start off with
um yuli uh if you can uh be taken first
hi thank you um so which of my questions you're talking about the which organizations question
very last one uh whatever one feels alive for you um
uh okay i think the most alive one is actually so from a tiny bit of context i think there's
not a single thing you mentioned that doesn't apply to me so i work in the effect of altruism
space and i you know when i hear these predisposition predispositions i think about how
they're constantly showing up and it was very difficult for me personally to inventory them
properly and to see exactly how much work i should be doing and improving the various elements that
i'm noticing um because again i'm sort of like balancing a whole bunch of stuff so uh maybe the
question could start with like how do you recommend we effectively inventory and i know you touched
this in terms of like building high trust relationships for people to point out the blind
spots uh but if there's other easy access tools i think that would be really useful for me to hear
about yeah and any deeper part of the question might be something like you know there's basically
infinite personal growth on some level so any any thoughts you can talk about how to synergistically
navigate the balance between self-improvement and application of that which we have to offer
would be really appreciated yeah this awesome reflection so
how you inventory other than asking other people stuff you can do on your own take frameworks
take maslow's hierarchy of needs and in each of those say what stuff feels insecure or unmet for
me there and how does that show up in my disposition where do i have unmet stuff around belonging or
around a steam around feeling self-actualized around feeling secure and then just say where
does that actually affect my motivational complex that if that was addressed would be different
where does that become a hook of different kinds and so it's an example of a framework you can apply
you can apply uh of the seven deadly sins honestly and say okay so where is pride where is um
greed where is you know there's things like that coming in and just as a framework you can take
chakras and the chakra system as a metaphorical system for types of emotion thought and capacity is
a good system so um i can explain that one later it actually would take a while to explain all
them but if it's a familiar one for you uh so just take frameworks that look at the dimensions of a
person right the dimensions of a self and make do an inquiry around it that's one way another way
notice where your stress is and inquire into what's what the internal dispositions are that
create that stress not the external circumstances but so in a very much in a Byron Katie way if you
aren't familiar with that work CBT or whatever so get the book loving what is by Byron Katie
and uh watch a few of our videos so it's a simplified method of CBT but that's actually
quite good that looks at if you want a more erudite version start with Krishna Murthy's
writings on the topic but he doesn't give you a very practical thing he just shows you how much
what you're observing is the combination of observation and narrative the evaluation or
narrative continuously and it's happening so fast and subtly that you don't even realize
you're narritizing shit and you think that it's objective observation and which is why he said
the one of the highest stages of human intelligence is to observe with no evaluation which is really
fucking hard so you can take that and then be able to say okay because four different people might
be in a very similar circumstance in a very different emotional results one of them gets
angry one of them gets sad one feels scared one feels ashamed one feels excited one feels proud
based on the meaning making so the exploration of human meaning making narritizing events and
then our emotions responding to the meaning making is huge uh it's like probably the area the the
biggest lift you can get of any area to work on first has to do with noticing the patterns of
meaning making and shifting them realizing that you actually have a genetic process of it I think
Byron Katie's work is the work that kind of made that simplest pragmatically for people
so wherever you're feeling stressed about something you're having mistrust in relationships with
people you're feeling overly pessimistic you're feeling overly concerned about
all the things that exist in the unknown then you can just look at what are the core beliefs
underneath that because the stress I'm having with this person feels a lot like a hundred
situations I've had in the past like this right this concern about the unknown now in bio risk
is a lot like what it felt like when I was doing nuclear risk whatever the fuck else it was and so
it's like okay it's not really about the topic it's about the way I'm relating to the topic so
what is the underlying generative unconscious belief that is being the that is a generator
function of narrative here and it's it's something like I can't trust anybody or in order to be safe
I need to know what's going to happen in order to be safe I need control or whatever right like
these kinds of things so you just notice where is the stress and then you notice
what is the narrative that the video camera can't see because I it's me narrating the fucking what
the what the video camera sees the video camera is doing third person I'm doing a second person
thing on it right and then what is the generative belief that would have me narrate it that way
and narrate a thousand other videos in related ways then how do I work on that belief
that's another way
another way is you look at where you have had
the greatest failures and blockages in your work
including the ones that you blame on everybody else I'm not saying you do I'm saying one
and try the experiment of if I take a hundred percent responsibility for that failure
even if it was other people were such and such why did I not have better discernment about that
better structuring of it better whatever it was if I uh because otherwise what I'm saying
is I have learned nothing and I'm completely unempowered and like feeling scared about the
world or disappointed about it or resentful of them is all I got and so if I go through
something I want to say could I go through it again differently and better well I only
can if I learned something I could do differently so look at the areas where you've had the
most challenge at the least success the most disappointment and say if I take a hundred
percent responsibility for it what what are the patterns and how I showed up
that contributed to it going that way that if I did it differently differently maybe the people
would have behaved differently maybe I would have I would have behaved differently to them
maybe I would have picked different people maybe I would have whatever right
when you say there's an infinite amount of areas for personal growth starting with
wherever the failures are biggest taking responsibility that the failures have more
to do with your psychology than one thinks I think failures have a fuck ton to do with the
psychology of the person going in where the same skills and capacities they have with
a different psychological disposition could be applied much more effectively
and and starting with how do I work on the psychological dispositions that I can identify
as having a at least partial causal relationship to where I get stuck the most that's a very good
way to like focus on where you're going to get the most leverage out of the work
um and then
there's a thing around
having experiences where you really have a sense of I am not my current identity I'm more
of the transformative process because there's some continuity of self from when I was five
and 15 and 25 and now and I'm a totally different person I went from being a liberal to a conservative
to a trans political I went from being having views on this to this I changed my religion I
changed my what the fuck am I that is different than all these beliefs different than these skills
and capacities right now I'm super identified with this role in these capacities but I was
identified with other ship before I'd ever thought of any of this stuff and so if you realize in 10
years I might have totally different capacities hopefully do totally different dispositions
etc so more than my current state the process that is seeking to evolve that is seeking to
grow and become and that is also specifically seeking to take responsibility for failings
and areas of weakness and heal them means I'm not that area of weakness I am whatever kind
of deeper care and love is willing to integrate and shift that and I'm not my current skill set
I'm whatever deeper kind of value and love will develop new skills that are useful wherever it
is to be of greater service so if you take that on seriously then you are welcome criticism about
where you are currently because it's not actually criticizing the essence of you it's
criticizing a particular developmental state that you won't continue to be but you will only get
to transcend it if you see it and so then there's this place where it's like I can look compassionately
like oh wow I didn't realize I was doing that that makes perfect sense do you have any guidance on how
I might fix that I just asked Peter the other day for guidance on you know Peter and I were talking
and I said are there any ways that I've showed up in the stowa that suck that seem like they're not
that great or helpful and particularly
we there was there was a conversation where somebody said something to the effect of it
I mansplained something to them and I'm like did I do I do that and it was interesting because I'm
sometimes I get criticized for saying things that seem too obvious and people already know and
they're like come on give me some fucking credit but even more often I get criticized for using
terms and phrases people don't know and assuming they do know the shit and being like dude you
have to explain the stuff more I'm like I don't know how to calibrate and that means help here
so I asked Peter and he's like well if you're gonna explain some stuff that maybe people know
but you aren't sure if they know and it is still helpful to clarify because you want to make sure
you're on the same page just preface it every time and say this is shit you probably already
know but I just want to double check times I do that but after we had that talk I will do it more
now and so but I reached out and asked him right and and continued to kind of ask until
getting an insight on it so this is a real valuable thing is finding people who you are
asking to give you feedback it's kind of like a guy who doesn't want his partner to give him any
feedback on what she likes in bed because his fragile ego wants to already think he's a great
lover is actually going to be a shitty lover and a guy who's like actually seeking feedback will
become a much better lover and so it's there's this self-fulfilling prophecy either way if I
want to be seen as good I'll actually be worse if I want to be actually good I want to know where
I'm not right uh so there's this just like really seek the input and the last thing I think I can
say on this is um there was this video that I watched it was so beautiful I watched it a little
while ago a couple times I cried both times I think it was Leo Sillard as an old man like a 90
year old man being interviewed about the early quantum mechanics days and all of the founders
of modern physics and what it was like and um and there was an affection with which he was
speaking about von Neumann and Einstein it was just super touching and the guy asked him interviewer
said who was the smartest of all the people doing uh modern physics and he's like no question it was
johnnie von Neumann everybody knew it was johnnie von Neumann clock speed no no no comparison and none
of us were even tripping about it because it was there were no close seconds and he kind of went on
about how great he thought johnnie von neumann was then the interviewer said so does that mean that
his contributions were the deepest and then Sillard sat back and he said no that would be mr
einstein and he got teared up and he's like there was something other than clock speed
that einstein was doing that made his insights go profoundly deeper and even and he's like i
didn't know what he was doing at the time and i've started to get a sense of it and even johnnie knew
that and it this is all of einstein's quotes about intuition and creativity more than just
intellect and those types of things and that it's an optical delusion of consciousness to
believe there are separate things there is in reality one thing we call universe and like
there was a set of there was a a mystical but really a set of psychological dispositions
that took time right it took time of him wondering what it was like to be liked
in a very deep way trying to get a first person sense of what it was like to be a photon and
trying to get a sense of i want to know god's thoughts the rest is trivia he took a lot of time
in something that didn't seem all that useful in terms of chalkboard physics that also gave him
deeper insight so i would say the psychological work that you do if it brings you into greater
wholeness the ultimate nature of reality is that all of the reductionism is useful and false
it requires us trying to make models of reality that aren't reality that are useful but they aren't
actually it and all of the x-risk is actually driven in the way bone talked about by a fragmented
worldview that optimizes parts at the expense of other parts whether it's the rivalry of
china at the expense of the us or vice versa or this metric at the expense of this metric
driving externality there is a wholeness that has to become the psychological disposition
if we are to make it through the amount of tech power that we get and so any of the places that
have unwholeness in ourself are actually like the work there makes us a citizen of the future
and if we aren't a citizen of the future we can't help build it
i very very very much appreciate all that i'll quickly reflect that i'm like noticing a ton of
super useful things even in this moment right talking about the relationship between how i am
seeking more certainty how that's actually feeding into the narratives i'm playing out in terms of
like yeah i spent a bunch of time at a buddhist monastery and then i'm out here you know sort of
taking more action i'm like how do i even bridge that why do i flip flop between the two why aren't
they uh finding synthesis what is that how do i navigate that so there's a lot of beauty here
i also see there's a lot of really good stuff in the chat so i'm 29 okay so i was still in
what felt like flip-flopping between those things at 29 and it was somewhere in 30s and it felt like
they braided and the flip flop for me was um like three things there was the personal development
part which both looked like monastic impulses and and monastic ventures at different times
but also a lot of psychological work and though that was my primary focus at certain times
there was the study of how do i understand what's going on in the world and that was science,
philosophy, economics, whatever to know how to work on it and then there was
fuck i actually have to help stuff now there's really critical shit going on and so there was
an activist impulse and the activist impulse was also critical because if you don't get real
one if you can stay not helping there's something wrong if you stay fully in abstraction
and in the actual work you get so much grounding about what it takes to organize people
um i forget who it was i think it was von clauswitz some quote about uh you think you're a really
great general try organizing a beach trip of 100 people um and just see how hard it is to organize
people for a really basic fucking thing and so in trying to do like even small-scale 100-person
activism to help a forest you you learn a lot that is relevant to the most abstract scale
so those three and it drove me fucking crazy because i'm like this needs all my attention
and i always felt the stress of there's not enough time because just i can't do the right
activism if i don't understand these things but i also can't do it if i have the wrong
psychological dispositions and aren't coming for enough clarity and but i have to help the
stuff that's currently happening and with the stuff that's happening do i focus on the animals or
the environment or the poor kids or the and it was when i finally recognized that the the wholeness
of reality is the basis it is both my own connection to the wholeness it's my cognitive
respect for that wholeness that seeks to understand it as best i can knowing it'll always be
inadequate and it's that same impulse that has me want to serve life in all the different forms
and that those are actually not competing with each other for time they're in a virtuous cycle
that the development in each of those areas develops the other ones and when you hold it as
they're in a virtuous cycle it helps looking much very much forward to more of that practice
thank you daniel awesome thanks yuli and it's funny yuli and a bunch of people from yuli's from
toronto and a bunch of people from the effect of all truest movement they went to the the menacea
academy to stay there for a bit so perhaps you can come to the store yuli and we can talk
about the intersection of what you learned there um skyler brown you had a question on
embodiment uh that'd be a good follow-up
hi daniel hi good to see you it's so good to see you um yeah so the question arose earlier you
were talking about embodiment and um and it brought me to a question about intuition
and you and i have talked about this before and i wondered if you could offer some um from your
perspective the use of intuition or or right relationship to intuition and then pitfalls
and then it came up again when you were speaking about einstein it was such a beautiful i mean i
was very touched by that story um really touched by that story and it made me curious um in a way
what was einstein doing yeah that's my question and i think let me just add this little piece in
case it comes up um there's something about the non-linear ways of knowing that you know whether
it's intuition or dreams or whatever einstein was doing um i would love to just hear a little bit
about that i don't know peter if you've had ian mcgrill crest on to if he'd be great to have come on
master in his emissary and talk about the work he's done in deeper understanding of right hemisphere
left hemisphere the functions they have the relationship between them uh it's directly
related and and probably the best work on the topic i'm aware of can i just daniel let me just
say it's so funny because i just wrote down right brain um reggie ray some he talks about the somatic
eye and he's calling the somatic eye is a combination of the heart the nervous system
and right brain and i've read that book um but amazing your intuition was spot on right there
mm-hmm i
we could easily do um a whole stowa conversation around what is intuition
how does one develop it what is its relationship with rationality
is there a distinction between intuition and instinct where can they be trusted where can
they not like there's a whole lot here and i guess what i'll say briefly is that i think of
intuition mostly i'm not going to say a hundred percent i think of it mostly as a
epistemic capacity that can be developed um in the same way that i think of rationality as an
epistemic capacity that can be developed and everyone does rationality but they don't all do
it well because they didn't develop it they didn't learn to think about what are my axioms what is
the basis for those axioms what are my step my logical steps and is this something where induction
is appropriate where abduction is appropriate you know logical fallacies critical thinking
uh etc so when someone is training science and they're training math they're training formal
logic they're training rationality to work well and it takes a shit ton of training because
there's a lot of places where it can go wrong i think it is possible to train intuition but
it's a totally different set of trainings and i think just like most people's rationality has
them rationalize a bunch of nonsense um i think most people's intuition is very largely their
unresolved biases magicking themselves up and so it's a lot of like fear desire and preconditioning
saying i have a sense of that and the sense is just the projection of unresolved stuff and that
leads one to catastrophize if they had you know uh hypervigilance creating childhood and say my
intuition tells me something's bad here well your intuition is shit because you have a bunch of
unresolved stuff you're projecting on in every situation and so but does that mean you should
gaslight yourself and not listen to your intuition ever because that ends up being where you get into
trouble when you really had a sense of something well this is why you have to develop it right
one of the main ways you develop the intuition is by clearing the unresolved unmet needs that
create a desire and the unresolved traumas that create fears that make you not actually quiet
enough and that make you project past situations and unresolved stuff onto this that you can actually
connect to what's going on currently right like that's a huge part of it so i think the more
trauma healing that happens and the more meeting of needs so there's less unresolved need the
better ones intuition becomes um that's oversimplified what was happening with einstein i
i have a big pet peeve around anytime someone takes a phenomena and then tries to explain in
words that sound sciency what's probably happening neurologically or whatever where it's not actually
science we didn't actually do something to verify that as a theory it's a hypothesis and then it's
being presented with excessive certainty so i'm going to give you a hypothesis of what might
have been happening it might be mechanistically totally wrong um so let's say the the left brain
left hemisphere and this might not even relate to the left hemisphere all that much right might
relate to some other neural networks or other shit so i like i said mechanistically this might
be wrong so take this as a as a reasonable sounding model say that the left hemisphere
corresponding to rationality more orient itself in the nature of the neural networks to serial
process more than parallel process and so our conscious mind can think through things in the
kind of linear way so i have this data these are my axioms this is how i do logical transforms
these are my conclusions you can give me new input and i can come up with new conclusions right and
so it lends itself to that let's say the right brain has a different type of neural network
orientation that lends itself to parallel process more the parallel process can't be isn't a sequence
of thoughts that are happening simultaneously it's a pattern analysis process of okay i have a thing
here and i'm holding i'm holding it up and other than conscious process to all of my previous
experience to see where does a pattern arise and so then i get a aha kind of out of nowhere
because of a parallel processing type dynamic and so intuition often arises as a intuition
in aha out of nowhere that we could think of as a kind of pattern matching which is why people's
intuition tends to be better in spaces that they know more and there was a talk i watched where
the Dalai Lama and Eckhart Tolle were speaking about this and i thought it was quite good and
they were giving an example to the effect of neither of us when we go into the power of now or
kaivalya or whatever you want to call it come out with the equations Einstein would come out with
why is it because if we're just accessing the akashic records and it's all there we should be
able to ask the Dalai Lama what the cure for cancer is or the solution to the bad guys nuclear
codes or the solution to unified field theories we come out with it except that doesn't happen
the guy who goes in with physics comes out with physics the guy who goes in thinking about how
to solve this suffering of sentient beings comes out with better insights about that the person
who goes in as a very good athlete comes out more in the zone and does better athletics
Eckhart said something like i'm not going to kick the soccer ball well from the power of now or
out of the power of now or whatever but the really good soccer player if they access that
does a better job because what they're accessing is increased wholeness that is taking what's
already in them and processing it differently and so it's making more connections within the self
and i think that is i don't want to constrain it to say that's the only phenomena that there is no
non-local whatever kind of phenomena but i think that's the main way to think the best way to think
about most of it which is most of the ahas are recombining thoughts and insights and experience
i already had with new patterns and insights that i wasn't aware of that wouldn't come through just
linear process they come from a different kind of state they can do a different kind of parallel
process and then that insight i don't take automatically as a verified truth now that
enters into a left brain process it says how do we verify that and then i take the insights from
the left brain process put them into a state where i can see new patterns so so the einstein process
of work on the whiteboard until on the math until he got to a block and there was no more real
progress happening and then go puff his pipe look at the clouds and and have some meditative
process and then a hall would come go back to the whiteboard then he gets a diminishing return
go back there that's exactly this kind of flow between a serial and a parallel type process
between a analytic and a synthetic right analyzing looking at the parts how they fit together
synthesizing looking for deeper patterns that connect at all but those happen through different
modes of mind so we need to condition or modes of self need to condition those different modes
million more things we could say but hopefully that is something
thank you awesome thanks guy um daniel you're good for another 20 minutes
yeah um you mentioned briefly the risks not the psychological dispositions of coming to the space
but the what happens working in the space yeah i won't take long with it i'll just
highlight it and it's probably obvious see this is me applying what peter taught me last time
it's it's probably obvious to think about all right if i'm a police officer where i'm just
focused on areas of high criminal behavior i'm not seeing the whole of the human condition
with an equal distribution right and is that going to affect my psyche in certain ways and
how would i compensate for that well if i'm focused on let me forecast let me look at all the data of
everything that's getting worse let me can you look at all the data of everything that's getting
worse and let me forecast all the ways that humanity could destroy itself and blow itself up
and also let's look at all the ways that we aren't doing a good job of solving it what's the
psychological effect of that um especially when you see when you're trying to do forecasting and
you start to see things that look like timelines oh we only have x amount of time before a runaway
effect on climate change occurs and if or we only have x amount of time before autopoietic agi occurs
or whatever it is that can create a sense of urgency combined with maximum theoretical
consequentiality combined with a need for a and also low agency that can make someone crazy
can make them desperate make good things uh i have seen all of this
it can have someone in order to stay kind of and look at everything in a very detached way
and actually kind of disconnect their emotional self like oh yeah in this scenario it's actually
not really existential because only two billion people die and and maybe actually the two billion
people dying version is what makes us last long term because there's a population problem and
and so to not be destroyed by it become sociopathically disconnected well that's a problem
to not be sociopathically disconnected if i'm really sensitive how the fuck do i have
thinking about it right and not just be crushed
question of how do i develop sensitivity and strength resilience at the same time the strength
not not numbness but the capacity to feel that and hold a wholeness of self in the presence of it
and that is again psychological or spiritual whatever you want to call it work to do cognitive
it's all those dimensions um you're working with
looking at risks where the more people would know about the risks they could actually
possibly make it worse the topic of info hazard so you have to not share certain stuff
so you start getting into domains where you're thinking about why it's important to not be
honest all the time that's can start to have very weird it can also start to particularly
if you look at the distributions there are some people who just really like to feel like
they're on the inside of cloak and dagger shit like we know special stuff that's going on and
other people don't know and like there's some ego appeal to that um you can tell if someone
knows info that they really think is safe not to share they usually won't even say that
right but if they're like oh that's an info hazard there's some mystique that gets made
about them to even say that thing that's actually less good for classifying the information so you
know there's weird stuff that happens whenever you're working with the topic of things that are
important but with but where you're looking at the rational risk of not being honest and all I would
say is like aware of it and there must be some people inside of circles of trust you can be
honest way then you must also kind of just watch what is how is this affecting how I show up with
people and in relationships is is the justifying when not to be honest bleeding over into other
areas where it shouldn't bleed over um myopia is one of the biggest ones because
it's hard to keep in awareness the rest of the universe that I'm not paying attention to
when I'm paying such acute attention to one part so I will weight that those parts heavier than
they are so it's very easy to become certain that we're about to be destroyed it's already too late
because I'm not also looking at positive futures I'm not also looking at progress that makes things
possibly better I'm not looking at where surprises occur when people were like oh there's no way we
could beat the speed of sound or we could this or whatever it was or create lift and it happens
and so just the preponderance of data in my attention will affect how I feel
all I have to do is go to a youtube page that has curated videos of police violence
and particularly say police violence towards people of color and just scroll the page for
half an hour and I'm fucking an outraged and like horrified just because of the preponderance
of stuff coming in it feels like the most catastrophic thing in the world then I can go to
a page that is curated of police taking kittens out of trees and going into burning buildings to
help people and whatever and it's amazing how much I know this shit right and my emotions change
with just a preponderance of a particular kind of sensory input that's just a half hour of videos
and I know this stuff so what happens about like if I'm working in the space all the time
how do I also stay connected to positive futures positive possibilities beauty of life now where
I'm not trying to save the world I'm actually in service to the beauty of the world it's a very
different thing so there's a lot more things like this but you can just recognize how susceptible
we are as people to being over focused on some areas and not all of them to thinking about
risks that are so huge and that matter so much but that we can't actually take full agency for
how hard it is to emotionally care and not feel like you can solve it and the problems of both
getting just crushed or emotionally disconnecting and just being aware of these things and be like
okay so it's hard so that's something to work on so how do I work on it authentically
and I think that would set up Evan's uh Davis and Kotler's question um just to preface it Evan
and I have been talking a lot uh about the meta crisis and how kind of the stowa is uniquely
positioned um because we're at the intersection of like basically all three of the epidemics are at
play at the stowa not only we're talking about the existential risk and suffering risk but we're
talking about embodiment and doing all this kind of shadow work and stuff here um so yeah I'll let
Evan ask this question because it's related yeah thanks Peter and thanks Daniel for coming on today
this has been great so far um yeah just briefly uh Peter outlined the beginning of it quite nicely
but the stowa isn't quite a unique position um given those three modalities to be I think quite
impactful here and and it's been experiment experimenting with quite uh a lot of different
psychotechnologies as well as through developing its own sort of ecology of practice and various
psychotechnologies and so I'm wondering if there's anything that stands out to you in terms of how
the stowa could be best deployed to culture a ecology of practices or develop a sort of psychotechnology
toolkit in the space that would assist individuals who are working on express
very interesting question um I mean I think the first thing I can say is I like the idea of it
doing that I also agree that it's in a good position to do that uh
it would probably actually be worth doing a small design call to see for the people who
have good thoughts on that to come together and contribute I think that would be a valuable thing
so that the collective intelligence of the stowa community gets to help create the answer to that
um couple thoughts I would have to think about it longer but a couple thoughts I can
remind right away we did a talk here one time on this uh set of questions I wrote called dharma
inquiry um you can if you search the stowa youtube you'll see it and there's a link to the questions
and their questions designed to help someone feel into what they care about most what their
positions are what might be different if they felt more capacitated and towards like what does
look like for them I I think right path doesn't look like directly focusing
abstract topic x risk for almost anyone there's very few people where the right path is to focus on
the abstract topic of x risk for some people focusing on a specific x risk like cyber security
attacks on infrastructure like they that by itself needs tens of thousands of people focused on it
who have real skills and someone might be like I have the software skills I can focus on that thing
or nuclear or there there are biologists and they care about biologists right now so for most people
they're not they wouldn't be focused on the abstract category of x risk like that's mostly
people who are kind of philosophers who like to category theory and like abstractions of that
type combined with thinking about social system design and whatever and so some people should
and then there's also a lot of like before we started talking about x risk and catastrophic
risk we were talking about that there's extreme poverty in the world and there's still fucked
up wars and warlords and there's rampant torture in the world I was just talking to a woman who
runs one of the biggest organizations that works on on torture and she's like there the torture
today is mostly hidden but because of population it is way worse than it was in the dark ages like
the total global torture happening and so a lot of people's dharma should be working on those things
a lot of other people's dharma should be creating beautiful art and beautiful sci-fi and whatever
about a future that is desirable that could be as an attractor for where people can go a lot of
people's work should be developing psychotherapeutic capacities to help people who are working on these
topics so one thing is don't assume that the topic that seems like the most urgent one is the one
everyone should be focused on because that that is itself myopic right all the things need done
one way of talking about what do we need to do is a world where everyone is doing their
their dharma if everyone is doing what is actually theirs to do that maps to what needs
done is happening so one thing I would think about the story doing is not just assume that
people should be working in a particular space just because they're interested in it because
they might not have had support finding what is actually a better calling for them
and so then what is the right psychotherapeutic and cognitive and professional and relational
support for them in the domain they should actually be in that's one topic
and then in terms of things like for people who are working either in x-risk as an abstracted
category or domains of it or even torture issues like all of those have in common
facing issues that are too big for an individual person to take responsibility for hopefully
motivated by compassion and love and there's like crushing emotional effect of just staring
into it so it doesn't have to be x-risk it's just really trying to solve anything that's huge and
really matters where is there like can we create a space where people can process what is most
alive for them that is their overwhelm their existential angst their devastation their fear
of death whatever process it in a way that doesn't have them have to just pretend but also doesn't
have them get stuck and get support moving through it can we work on developing a group of practitioners
that are really good at some of those things in a group of practices that are really helpful
I think things like death work where people actually create peace around the topic of death
is pretty upstream from a lot of it actually Peter I have a friend named Anne Marie Keppel
who I think should come on and talk about that who does exceptionally good work in that space
I think getting something like Byron Katie's the work and there's a couple refinements on it
that you can make I would be happy to suggest the refinements and being able to have a tool
like that that becomes kind of a community well-known practice on how to be able to separate
what's objectively happening from the meaning making that's affecting how we're holding it
and do a better job working with our own meaning making I think I think you guys had Alanya Forzburg
on she had she developed a process she refined a process from the psychodrama tradition that she
calls the golden pole that is maybe the most sophisticated nuanced process I've ever seen
for giving people feedback about their blind spots in small groups in a way that they can
actually really hear it's given in a way that is both very direct and also very loving and
yeah I just think it's a really beautiful process to do that and where people could come together
either here or with their own groups of five people or six people that they're close to
and be able to have something like a every month we're doing this thing
there's something about feedback like that that also has continuity with the same people over time
because then you can see is someone actually taking the feedback taking responsibility and
changing it or not because if people give me feedback and I'm like oh yeah wonderful thank you
and the next month I'm still doing it next month I'm doing it next month I'm doing it I might just
be full of shit and not like taking it seriously and so it's helpful to be able to have continuity
in practice of that kind so yeah these are a couple initial ideas but my my bigger recommendation
is there are probably a lot of people I mean Skyler does great psychotherapeutic work with
people there are lots of people in this community that do get some design sessions together also
get people like the gentleman who was talking earlier from the EA and Extras communities
to share what they observed they'll go much deeper than what I just did and say like here's
what I experienced myself here's what I observed these are the problems so you get a map of what
would actually use support that is grounded in terms of what's happening in the space
it's a great response thank you fantastic awesome yeah I guess some people doing some
golden bowl here at the store last question perhaps Jeff D Jeff D has a really cool
blog called doomsday parenting and his question is related cool
hi Daniel um so I mean I think it seems to me that like if you're a parent um you're
you're in the ex-risk business um kind of automatically and a thoughtful one
and yet yeah well and yet I'm finding that it's it's it's difficult to get parents to to really
talk about this stuff or talk about it's touchy to talk about parenting at all
with other parents so um you know I was just wondering if you had any ideas around
you know how do you properly raise children without either lying to them you know by shielding
the worst realities from them which they kind of deserve or passing along unfair you know world
saving expectations because that's also unfair um or or am I or am I missing something is is there
some some way to surf in between those I'm not a parent I don't have the answer to this I have
a few thoughts but they're obviously not tested uh I might totally psychologically ruin my kids
I I think I wouldn't but who knows um so uh there's I don't know if you ever had
a woman named Miriam on who does uh parenting work with people you have I would ask her that
question I really love the way that she thinks about the process of being honest with kids and
also developmental appropriateness um Shelly Letko also would be really quite good she does
brilliant parenting work that addresses similar topics and specifically the method that her husband
developed is kind of like a more sophisticated version of the work in terms of a cognitive
behavioral shift process but the so she took it into parenting to say how do we raise kids
without dysfunctional beliefs in the first place but not just what do we think is a good belief but
how do we raise them to have awareness and agency in their own belief formation process
those would both be good interesting ones and given what you're doing Jeff probably good friends to
have um I I do think there's something about developmental appropriateness of
what is someone exposed to relative to the capacities and agency that their nervous system has at the time
uh a little kid who if their parents weren't there wouldn't survive they would definitely die without
their parents is not actually an autonomous being yet right it's not a agentic being it's a dependent
thing and so exposing them to big issues in the world when they can't even take care of themselves
probably just creates a kid that is mostly terrified and hyper vigilant forever rather than
uh prepares them properly at the same time having them be in a complete bubble and then see the world
where they have such a stark break is a challenging thing so there's a titration there's a developmental
to what level do I expose them and
I think Zach Stein would also have very good things to say about that from a kind of
neo-pegetian developmental psych perspective in terms of how do we expose things that up
regulate their capacity in a way that is relevant that is related to the up regulation capacity they
actually have uh something like if you're in the gym there's a kind of pain that's good and a kind
of pain that's bad the kind of pain that is muscle soreness is good the kind of pain that is like
joint injury is bad so it's is this is this a thing that I actually is a stress that I can
up regulate in response to or is this a stress that something is just going to get broken in
response to is a very deep question for everybody honestly but particularly for kids
so I would mostly defer this question further to the people that I think know it better than I did
thanks yeah I think there's something about the the the high end of that of that spectrum where it's
like the there's always been a question around how how do you explain to a child what the dangers
are in life this just seems like this particular set of dangers is is novel and I think this is where
the conversation hasn't been robust enough in parenting but I appreciate your thoughts and sources
I will say one thing on it is that I think what parents demonstrate is much more important than
what they overtly say and this is why being a parent is actually a forcing function for doing
your own developmental work if you don't want to pass your shit on to your kids and so a parent
that is engaged in challenges of the world the kid gets to see oh this like when you're walking
with them do you pick up the trash when you're walking with them how do you respond to the
homeless people and the people that look upset like do they get to see not you telling them
something but do they get to see an embodiment of compassion care responsibility you know those
ethics and then what is your work is it oh another fucking day at the job can't wait for the weekend
or is it someone who is on fire to do meaningful things and then if they see that you're addressing
real issues in the world with passion but you also feel empowered and what they're learning
is your emotional state of empowerment as opposed to either apathy or overwhelm or anger or frustration
they should also see you have emotions right they should see you sometimes feel
sad or frustrated but process it responsibly so they aren't learning to be sociopathic
they aren't learning to hide and then break and commit suicide they're learning that
to have healthy emotional processes and process them in functional ways that lead to being able to stay
connected to their values compassionate and empowered simultaneously and that dialectic
of what you could call feminine and masculine qualities if you want or whatever of of compassionate
sensitive caring attuned and strong resilient empowered that those are always coupled
and so I would say you can tell them that but mostly you have to demonstrate it and they will
get that by osmosis but in the demonstration of it
you know that's great and good job for not behavior for not being a parent
for for what for not being parents even though you're not a parent yeah
so um so we're close to the bottom of the hour and we have a fun event coming up soon
so daniel any closing thoughts you'd like to leave us with here at the stowa today
I hope this has been interesting and useful and I know probably every time somebody talks
you guys have a whole thought of what the stowa community could do to advance that topic and
there's probably a backlog that is bigger than the organizational capacity and people's time
to respond to all of it if it happens that those parenting topics increase I'll be happy I think
those are super important if it happens that the death topics get worked on I think that would be
great if it happens that the how do we help people not express in particular how do we help
everybody in here find their own dharma better and then how do we help them with the resources
relational cognitive professional psychological to do better in that dharma that would be an
amazing fucking thing right for a community to be able to help people both find their path and
walk their path better and I think this is already oriented that way but the idea of that is a kind
of like central design intention to keep developing and to create better collective
intelligence process where anybody who has good things to offer to that can and they can be harvested
somehow obviously that doesn't look like something that peter can synthesize all that shit and run
it himself that you know and especially on largely volunteer basis so I'm not sure where that goes
but whatever way it could go I would love to see that
beautiful yeah um I just feel excitement in my body this session a lot of lightness I can
I can tell in the chat in the room as well um so yeah I'll make some closing announcements in a
moment but Daniel thanks so much for coming to stowa today uh beautiful session and um yeah I'll
plug a few events that are related to um what was spoken about today uh scarlet brown is having
a session called coming home and skyler has done embodiment work with both daniel and I and many
others um so skyler perhaps if you can uh give us a preview of what that's about
oh on the spot um yeah we'll just uh we'll spend some time some time talking about
embodiment but my intention is always to bring us into a state of embodiment
um so we'll do some practice and maybe some breakout groups we'll see how long the session
is but definitely q&a and um yeah just um some techniques and practical ways to be more embodied
and that is uh um july 21st at 12 p.m eastern time we have a few other sessions on embodiment
you can check out the the website and we have an event coming up in a minute uh tassan fogelman
has a session called weird meta uh meta meaning love it loving kindness meditation it's a three
part series uh tassan could you plug that event if you're here yeah sure hi uh we'll be doing some
