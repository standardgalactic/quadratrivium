The Stoa is a digital campfire where we cohere in dialogue about what matters most at the
knife's edge of what's happening now.
All right, welcome everyone to the Stoa.
I'm Peter Limburg, the steward of the Stoa, and the Stoa is a place for us to cohere and
dialogue about what matters most at the knife's edge of this very moment.
And for those of you who may be new here to the Stoa or are watching for the first time,
what is the Stoa?
No one really knows.
Some people call it a communal podcast, a digital campfire, a wisdom gym, and it's probably
better not to know.
One thing we do have here is a SenseMaker in Residence series.
This is a four-part series over a month where a SenseMaker comes in and tries to make sense
of the world with us.
And today, for the month of October on Mondays, we are very lucky to have our friend, Daniel
Schmockenberger, visiting us.
And this series is called The Digital Porch.
And the idea here is we're coming in with no theme or agenda.
We're just going to sit on the Digital Porch with Daniel and ask him questions.
And this was Daniel's idea, because the original Stoa, the original name of the Stoa was the
Stoa pokeli, which meant the painted porch, which is where the Stoics got their name.
They just hung around with Zeno on the painted porch, philosophizing with each other.
So that's what we're going to do today.
And I will take Daniel in in a moment and we'll jump into the protocols as well.
If you were here the last time, Daniel, was here, we ended the session with a flowing
through anointing sessions.
So every Monday, one of our facilitators, Tyson Wagner, has Purpose's Freestyle Wrap
with SenseMaking.
And it's on a different link usually, but we just kept it on this link.
And for this month, Tyson is going to experiment with something different called Wrap Unbattles.
Wrap Battles, you know, use kind of wrap to tear people down.
But Wrap Unbattles is using kind of this, the same technique to bring people up.
So I'm going to take in Tyson in a moment to just just kind of introduce this.
Tyson, are you with us right now, if you're going to meet yourself?
Hey, yeah, I'm here.
Thanks, Peter.
Yeah, after party, following the digital porch, come hang out, kick it, we're going to battle
wrap Stoa style.
And the best part is, even if you've never rapped before, you can still play.
So look forward to seeing you there.
Cool.
Thanks, Tyson.
And so that's going to be on the same link after this session, which is about 75 to 90
minutes.
We'll take a bio break and then Tyson will be tagged in and then you can leave or stay
and watch and or whatever you like.
So in a moment, I'm going to take Daniel in and the protocols of today is if you have
a question anytime during the session, just write it in the chat box.
Have it like a cue or question beforehand.
I'll call on you, unmute yourself, ask you a question to Daniel.
If you want me to read on your behalf, because this will go on YouTube eventually, just
indicate that in the chat somehow, and then I'll read on your behalf.
I think that's everything.
So that being said, Daniel, welcome back.
Good to be here.
Thank you, Peter.
It's funny.
I'm seeing a few faces that I saw like an hour ago.
We just did a live Q&A with rebel wisdom.
So good to see some of you again jumping digital campfires.
Is there anything I'll start with the opening question, but there's anything you want to
kind of set the frame for this series or for today?
I think something that happened in the last stowa session when it opened to questions
someone was describing anxiety attacks and I was sharing things that have been useful
for me around that and various personal topics is that's really fun.
It's actually really fun to get to address philosophy and practices that could be useful
at a cultural and civilizational scale in the context of just what's actually alive
for people in real questions, real dialogue, rather than just in the theory place and with
specific topics.
So most of the time on a podcast, it is to share some topical body of content.
And so the idea of making a space to have no topic and just address what's alive for
people sounded fun and worthwhile, unlike it would probably end up surfacing conversations
that don't happen elsewhere.
So I'm looking forward to seeing what happens.
Awesome.
And I sent a Google doc for taking notes.
I didn't know who's going to take notes with someone jumping in and taking a lead on that,
which is awesome.
And so the idea here is we're going to have each session will take notes so we can have
a body of knowledge that we can work with.
So the first question I have and someone basically asked it to in the chats, maybe if you feel
up for it to describe the Concelion's project, again, because I know you introduced it publicly
at Rebel Wisdom recently in their War of Sensemaking and you and I have been chatting
about it for a last little while.
And someone had a question related to the Stoa.
How can a place, a digital campfire like the Stoa help with this project?
So maybe like a one-on-one of the project and how can we help with it?
I think I won't explain the Concelion's project from scratch since there are a couple of videos
that do that and someone can just check it out and I don't want to take a bunch of time
covering that since I think many people have heard it.
But the Concelion's project overall is seeking to facilitate a development and culture where
people have increasing value around both their own better sensemaking of the world and their
ability to sense make other people's perspective, experience and sensemaking and communicate
effectively so that we might be better able to do coordinated problem solving for the
big problems that we care about that we're not doing a very good job with currently.
And making sense of what's really going on with climate change and environmental issues
and whatever is hard by itself like the complexity of those is tricky.
But then to also make sense of how that's connected to geopolitical issues and market
issues and other things based where one strategy that benefits a part of it could harm something
else and different subpopulations are focused on different parts of the overall landscape
that they care about more that requires pretty deep sensemaking of not just complex issues
but how lots of complex issues are interconnected and how lots of other people are making sense
of it valuing it how they're going to respond to get a sense of how do we actually move
forward together.
And if everything that we do elicits a counter response that is trying to counter the things
that we do, and there's a kind of arms race of escalation of effective counter responses,
the coordination cost is too high to really solve any of our major problems and we are
actually driving arms race in conflict in the process.
So a cultural value around both better and more holistic and integrated sensemaking and
better communication so we can coordinate particularly with people that see things differently
than we do because we have to because we inhabit the planet we just because we disagree with
them and call them stupid doesn't mean they stop existing and stop doing stuff.
That's kind of the cultural set of values and stoicism as like one of the schools of
Greek philosophy had a lot to do with how do we increase our self awareness and our
emotional resilience so that we are not as easily hijacked by group think and narrative
warfare and emotional reactivity that we can actually reflect on our values and our sensemaking
and make good choices from that place.
And so if you take that as one of the you know one of those schools that was co-occurring
with more of the kind of Aristotelian Pythagorean type schools of can we can we get logic better
can we get science and empirical observation better and with the kind of Socratic dialogue
type school can we have better quality conversation and understand each other better if I can
understand myself understand others understand base reality communicate effectively across
those the whole population can do that we have a much better chance of engaging in something
like collective problem solving or governance.
So Consolence Project has certain things that we're going to do directly in terms of types
of education and content that we put out to try to help make sense of current world events
and teach people how to do that.
But it's also seeking to facilitate the cultural movement towards these goals writ large which
means every project that is trying to make better digital tools for helping people search
data sets and make sense of things or better news projects or better public education projects
or better trauma processing projects.
We want to be able to help kind of recognize all of those as part of a shared movement to
upgrade culture and to facilitate those together.
So I think the stowa has the ability to be a place where practice can occur somebody can
learn an epistemic tool and then say okay well what does this actually look like how
do I generate a landscape of all of the narratives on a particular topic how do we steelman those
are we doing a good job with it how do we then move from steelmaning a narrative to
trying to actually empirically verify and falsify individual proposition.
So all of the aspects of epistemics and conversation that one is learning they need a place to
practice awesome.
So we're having tons of questions and they're all going to probably come at you from different
angles so.
Rob you're up next.
Okay it's a long one bear with me in my industry there's a pattern common in many industries
where the key decision makers have a great deal of capital and influence while the employees
and contractors seem to have a lot more understanding of the systemic needs and pressures that we
face and we end up losing the game of influence those of us who feel more informed even though
we have the relevant info and plenty of will and I think that matches the pattern that
I see across many industries.
So the question is for those who are low in the hierarchical stack what can we do to be
more effective in making systemic change when the owners of capital have other ends.
Yeah that's a great pretty perennial social organization question.
There's a lot of different answers right unions historically have been an answer let's be able
to get those people into some unionized force that has cemetery with capital ownership.
So forming a union in the private sector is one answer forming a public sector where
we say let's make a government of foreign by the people that actually has a monopoly
of force even bigger than the top of the private sector capital ownership that can enforce
rule of law that's another answer but of course capital will end up capturing the regulatory
body if the people are not fully educated informed and engaged in actively being the
regulatory body and most nobody here probably is engaged in government all that often as
a citizen so it's not of foreign by the people governance it is a permanent political class
largely captured by an economic class and people that have other shit to do and then
complain about bad government but are consenting to be governed by rulers by not being actively
engaged in their own self determination.
So there's a lot of different kinds of answers right so politics would be one answer unionizing
would be another answer.
Getting better at the game of power inside of the private sector is another answer.
So figure out how to ladder climb more effectively so that you can influence things by being
in the C-suite or in the board or do a better job at capital accumulation so that you can
influence things as a shareholder or whatever.
What I would say is true across all of those another would be create public education to
change consumer demand right so that the customers are actually demanding something different
so supply has to create something different because there's a change in demand.
So those are all classic answers right but what I would say that they all have in common
and other ones that we could give is that in addition to the intelligence one might
have about the topic there is a strategic intelligence that also has to be there.
The strategic intelligence is doing like what we're doing right now what are the different
ways to be able to influence what are ways that I could do what are ways that I could
move into increasing influence that wouldn't corrupt the thing that we're doing.
And in this given situation of the various pathways which ones actually make most sense
and are most actualizable by the people asking it.
And so what I would say is if you want to be more influential because you believe that
you have sense making there should be more coupled to choice making then you actually
have to increase the kind of intelligence not just sense making intelligence but the
kind of intelligence of how influence itself works.
Could you expand on that last point just a bit more
when I say how influence works you could say how power works which is also synonymous
with how strategy works right which is what I'm saying by a strategic intelligence so
okay if the if there's a game of power meaning that rooted in things like private property
ownership is a my ability as a person or a family or a corporation or a nation to advance
my balance sheet independent of or even at the expense of others or the commons and there
is all kinds of evolutionary advantage to get more capital accumulation and have that
capital in service of generating more capital and there's scarcity of resource and as a
result of scarcity of resource driving value there's a basis to artificially manufacture
more scarcity if I happen to be doing well at that right as you as you understand those
types of dynamics the underlying conflict theory then you say okay those who get those
who figure out how say we started a market T equals zero everyone has the exact same
amount of resource and position people won't be equally good at the thing right some people
partly because of luck but partly because of orientation and aptitude and capacity will
start to get more resources in the system and as soon as they have more resources they have more
capacity to generate more resources they can employ more people they can do more to affect the
mindsets of other people through media they can influence government through lobbying more they
can apply they can contract private intelligence they can make sure their kids get the best
education whatever right so if someone gets more resource they both have the incentive and capacity
to protect that asymmetry of resource and grow it so then you end up getting a power law distribution
and wealth and that ends up being an inexorable thing power law distribution so then you say okay
well if I'm not at the top of the power law distribution what do I do if I want to influence
this we'll either have to figure out how to get up there that's a certain kind of strategic
insight how does that work what what what are the ways to actually do that or I have to say
so there's a power law distribution and economic wealth what are the other things that could affect
that well if I'm down here I don't have symmetry of power up here so I don't have real influence
but if I got all of us together so that's say all of us as workers which is a union or all of us as
consumers which could create an influence on supply side so can I do consumer education
or all of us forming a government that could then bind this with rule of law
or can I build a technology that increases my power through leverage right so these are
basically strategic insights around how do I how does the game of power work and in the presence
of that being the thing that is determining what happens largely if I have a sense that there are
better things that could happen how do I also develop the capabilities to see what the pathways to
have in the influence are now how one studies that so that I mean you can study military theory
which is a very good thing to study you can study game theory and study coordination theory
and study psychology you can study the biographies of self-made successful people
you can study types of asymmetric technology
for the most part anyone who gets good at the game of power also gets captured by it
and so in a way those who seem like they have the most freedom and agency are also
the most bound to keep doing the kinds of things that they have to do to maintain that position
so like it's you can critique a world leader you can critique Putin all you want it for
different things but you're like in the presence of the pressures that NATO and the US were giving
and the economic interests to be able to take as much of the wealth out of the USSR as possible
and whatever could he have really done something all that difference right in the presence of
ubiquitous game theory you either get good enough to protect your people and do your thing or you
don't and you end up losing to someone else who's doing that and so you can see that the people who
seem like they have the most power are also the most obligated to behave in certain ways given that position
and for the most part those who are pursuing power are doing it because of psychological
dispositions to pursue power and then that's getting conditioned in the process
and so then if there are people who are psychologically not disposed to try to get
power and they're more disposed to care about the whole but they have no ability to influence
anything and those who influence it have given up really caring for the whole and or become
completely bound by the nature of the system that's that thing drives extinction right that
separation of virtue wisdom goodness and power those things have to be re-coupled and
and that means that anyone who has been pursuing virtue and wisdom and goodness well who feels
like they have some insights into how to make better systems also has to learn
and how to increasingly gain the capacity to be effective in the current world system
without becoming captured by it or in service to it.
Anjan, you had a question that would be good to take on that.
Hey Daniel, it's a related question. How can you actually get better at games of power
while still remaining game be committed? I'm thinking that power corrupts where you get caught
up in the game or or just when I pay this mortgage off or I'll just do this for two more years etc etc
I mean being kind-hearted you're also often at a disadvantage versus those who don't give a shit.
Trying to see who is speaking is there a video on?
It's not coming to the first page. He had his video off maybe that's why.
Okay, I heard most of it.
Can you put video on and just say one more part of it so I can connect to who you are?
Anjan, are you there still?
I don't have video right now.
Okay. How do you study the game of power without getting captured by it is the question?
How do you get effective at it without getting captured by it?
Yep.
Partly.
You have to know what is actually sacred to you that you actually have loyalty and devotion to
beyond utilitarian success in the game of power.
So you know what choices you don't take and what you're actually taking and servicing.
And to the extent that someone actually has a real
embodied knowing of what is sacred to them that is worth more than their own personal
advancement or life and their life is in service to that to the extent that that's embodied and real
and congruent is the extent to which they can be safe vessels for power.
Then there's continuous blind spot monitoring and noticing, okay, where is
some unfulfilled childhood recognition need actually coming up and affecting what I think is
the most useful thing to do in service to what I care about that is really just recognition or
actual competitive ego dynamics or made signaling or whatever it is.
So there's the need for like, there has to be an extremely high value on what you actually value
and a value on integrity and impeccability to motivate you to have enough self-inquiry to
be looking at and adjusting those things. Oftentimes, like it was easier when someone
believed in a all seeing punishing and rewarding God because then there's a motive to be impeccable
because not one jot, not one tittle shall go unjudged before the day of judgment, right? And so
but if I don't believe in a judging God then why not get away with this thing that I could get away
with if I'm the only one who knows? And so then there's a question of do I actually
have a sense of what is meaningful beyond just what is that personally advantageous
that is deep enough that I have a basis for self-respect that requires integrity that makes
me require integrity of myself. The deeper that process is the more someone can be a safe vessel
for power and then trusted people around you that can check you. Most people who get into
positions of power get surrounded by yes men who all want something from them and as a result continue
to say the things that double down on the bias that brought the person there. If you are earnest in
your desire to wield influence for actual collective good then you should know that there are blind
spots in yourself you can't see and there is collective intelligence that exceeds your own
intelligence about what is right and so you should be actively seeking that collective
intelligence about the situation and actively seeking it about your own self. Now that doesn't
you have to be very careful of who do you trust who they are as people and they're knowing of
you enough that you're really seeking to share enough with them that they can give you that
reflection but that's important. To ask the compliment Daniel how does how does one not be
handicapped by having a game of commitment in playing games of power. The example that comes to
mind is Elon Musk just firing somebody turning around and not even thinking about it twice but
somebody with a kinder heart something like that being much harder. You can do the hard thing if
it's the right thing right. If kinder heart makes you so sensitive to that person that you
aren't going to make a choice that would be better for lots of people in the whole then the kindness
is actually myopic. If you on the other side rationalize this is the right choice for the whole
and so you don't feel any empathy for that person and you don't take any considerations around it
then you also become dead and then there's a dangerousness in that. So I want to care about
the experience of that person and if I have to let them go I want to feel that but I also don't
want my feeling that to make me myopic and not make the choice that is in service of the greater
burden. I have a follow-up that you can swat away and it has to do with your personal relationship
with power especially when you're gaining the increase of influence and your voice is getting
heard. Is there any moments in your life where you felt like you were in a wrong relationship
with power and what did you do to correct that and maybe what kind of ecology of practices or
relationships you have in order to keep you in the right relationship with power?
I grew up nearly maximally blind to power dynamics
and that was partly because of being homeschooled with no kids around like even just the nature of
school, schoolyard stuff and clicks and bowling and whatever I just I didn't get
and because of the great fortune of having like reading a lot and as a kid but having
being exposed to good things so I was reading the works of a lot of the great philosophers
that those were actually the people I was being exposed to and that's how I thought people were.
It was very strange because there was this kind of cognitive dissonance that I didn't learn until
later where because then I got involved in activism and I saw factory farms and I just
instantly wanted to kill all the people that would do anything like a factory farm. I saw the
the Yulin dog meat festival and I just wanted to remove that part of the world.
I knew or study how creative we've gotten with torture methods
so I knew that there was gruesome abuse of power in the world but I was on the outside of it
looking at it and the few people that I was relating with were also on the outside of
it looking at it so then I had this kind of default that whenever I was talking to someone
I assumed they weren't part of it and hadn't been conditioned by it because we were only ever talking
about solving world problems because that was the only thing I liked talking about and because
they were interested in that I assumed that we were kind of looking at this thing together
so I ended up trusting people I shouldn't have trusted and then having projects be harmed as a
result of that because I was seeing the highest in people and wanting to be redemptive all of the
time and creating an environment where the only the highest values in the world were being talked
about because the nature of the conversation and then I also had people assuming I was playing games
of power who were more power literate because they couldn't believe that I was as educated as I was
about say sciences and I was as stupid as I was about the game of power and I just I just had a
very uneven development that way and so then they would say you're just naivete signaling right now
assuming that I actually knew the game of power and I was signaling being naivete to it as a
method of playing the game of power effectively and I was just like what the fuck are you talking
about I don't know it was very it was disheartening and frustrating and so then I'm like okay I have
to understand this so then it was finally time to read Machiavelli and Robert Green and all like that
and and even then there was still an outside-ness where I'm like okay so I understand those dynamics
but anybody who I'm talking to about those dynamics is and so it's been a progressive process for me
I also had this thing where it made so much sense and I'm so grateful for it and yet it also
seems so naivete and silly to me now when I when I was a kid and for kind of most of my growing up
I never asked what do I want to do with my life I asked what does the world need and what should
humanity do from kind of this omniscient perspective right and that was very useful because I I thought
I couldn't figure out what I should do if I don't have a sense of what humanity needs like I'm
embedded in this thing I'm a part of it so I need to figure that out first but that meant that I
wasn't thinking in terms of my own agency of what I could affect so I was I had was thinking
about the sense-making of what would make it better decoupled from the how do we get there
that was both extremely useful and extremely naive and so then had to get into the okay so
the enactment problem we can't just do this and that perfect world system comes about even
if we get some people to agree how do we deal with the fact that the other people who don't agree to
the non-nuclear proliferation agreement who build all the nukes end up then running the world how
do we deal with those types of issues and then there was like a begrudging acceptance of
that the path from if you will game a to game b requires capacity in both
it is neither game a nor is it game b game a for game a's sake is to win at the game of power
for the purpose of the game of power game b to be played in full requires that being the game or
the context and it's not yet so the how do we move from where we are to there requires being able to
not be beat by game a right which means understanding it well actually not seeking to serve its aims
but seeking to change the nature of the game itself and so that that's a little part of
kind of my history with it and then
finding people who I think understand topics better than I do and seeking their input and
particularly finding people who understand topics better than I do who disagree with each other
and trying to understand their perspectives more and also where they agree and where they
disagree and why across topics this has always been something super important to me and very
helpful and then also I think I used to err in the side of seeking people's feedback for my own
growth too much because it was because I knew that anybody's feedback about me has some value
even if it's largely their own trigger there's still the question of why didn't I have the
attunement to know that would be triggering to them how could I have communicated more effectively
to them right there's going to be signal in it even if what they're saying is not objectively true
and that's assuming that they're communicating in good faith which I came to recognize is not
a fair thing to assume all the time and it takes a lot of time because there's a lot of people
and it's not all equally valuable so then starting to say okay I'm going to be more selective in the
people who not who agree with me but who I respect both their good faith and earnestness and their
perspective and be seeking their input yeah that's an awesome heuristic I'm going to sneak
in a follow-up question so something that we're looking forward to doing at the store eventually
to develop courses and one that you know I think is as neat as having a power literacy course and
as I mentioned to you Robert Green the laws of power is coming to the store soon or he's agreed
to come on at least and you mentioned like studying game theory the great great people who've
achieved power is there any one single source that you know of that's the most bang for your buck
when it comes to understanding power probably Robert Green okay I mean what he did in the 33
strategies of war and the 48 laws was take a lot of the classics of military theory or political
theory and break them into fairly simple principles and then stories that illustrate the principles
and doing it across cultures and doing it in a popular way where you don't have to
really understand what this particular period in Prussian history was about to get the cultural
context of why they were writing that way or whatever as far as an intro I think those are
probably the best intros the thing I've noticed about them is most of the people who I have seen
read them the 48 laws in particular
get damaged by them
because it you know there isn't something like a game a game b context there there isn't something
like the problem of rival risk games driving arms races causing eventual self-termination it's just
looking at history of what won and let's understand the thing that wins and even in the introduction
there's this concept of the only thing that wins is the game of power and so if you have any ethics
or virtue at all you better get good at the game of power because otherwise you won't be affected
which is not all that different than something I just said but there's this subtle thing where
it can actually someone can interpret that in a way that rationalizes sociopathy
and utilitarianism in general can make you rationalize sociopathy hey I'm doing this for this
good reason so I don't feel bad about the thing that I'm harming one of the problems with utilitarianism
is my modeling of the future to say if I don't do this this will happen usually is more I'm assuming
more certainty than is actually warranted and it's on the basis of that false excessive certainty
that I rationalize the harm that I cause if we don't do this thing then China will do this thing
well there's like 20 steps of unknown stuff in there but assuming that thing to be certain
and true then I do a one step certain harm causing now and this is tricky this is where
virtue ethics are needed to kind of offset utilitarian ethics you have to be doing both
you have to be thinking about the process and the results and the recursion between them
there was a question that was bubbling up in me wanting to inquire about
your thoughts on power relating to evil but maybe I'll put that on pause and throw another
question too and maybe you can decide which one resonates more up in the chat someone was mentioning
about what was it again sexual selection how that question was sort of dodged on the Eric
Weinstein's uh podcast your appearance the the person who said it was evaded I haven't listened
to that one and then the previous stowa session you said you might address it at a different
stowa appearance which is related to power sexual selection dynamics um so I'll throw that out for
you the question um so the question is uh do you uh so I'll read what the person said Daniel
evaded answering question on sexual selection on both erics and previous stowa sessions how
does sexual selection impact game a game b
so
so I can give you my sense of what a game b answer is which is very different than what the
most ethical game a answers are meaning the different axiom sets are going to have us answer
that differently
so from an evolutionary bio perspective
evolution is the result of mutation survival and mating right some mutations end up being more
successful at surviving and mating they go through and then you get recombinatory dynamics in the
mating of the ones that were able to survive and mate and that that process and so there's
obviously a strong impulse to survive and a strong impulse to mate and a strong impulse to mate with
whatever else looks like is also evolutionarily maximal mating opportunity um and so a lot of
people take conflict theory down to this level and say um either the malthusian thing on survival
humans reproduce geometrically resources reproduce arithmetically eventually there will be more
people than there are resources than scarcity of resource for survival of drives inexorable
competition over over the not everyone can attain the same stuff um that's kind of a survival
selection answer and it's it's wrong by the way though uh it makes all the sense in the world
why malthus said it at the time but when he said to humans reproduce geometrically
that was before the inflection curves and population had really started to happen the
population were going down without exogenous pressures and we can see in the nordic countries
and in japan and in wealthier places that population curves have stabilized and even went down
without exogenous pressures and it was also before us getting the ability to create a closed
loop material economy and recycle stuff and upcycle stuff so we don't end up needing more
resource that is only reproducing arithmetically forever we can um upcycle it so that that insight
needs amended and then when it comes to mate selection it's a similar thing like if i assume
monogamy is the social construct construct and specifically for mating and that everyone has
a biological imperative to move their own genes forward more than caring about somebody else's
genes or society as a whole or whatever else then there'll be a place at which you and i both want
the same mate we both can't have her it's it's a fundamental she's a rival risk good in that way
and i either beat you or you beat me to be able to have that mating opportunity um
now of course uh not all societies have been rigorously monogamous we can look at polyandrous
or polygamous or promiscuous societies and see that there were different ways of relating to this
all of which still had some conflict theory and game theory there was different ways of solving it
one of the things that one of the arguments as to why monogamy was more selected for and
there's many arguments here and i think it's a deep topic but one of the positive arguments
Brett makes Brett Wensie is it was a way to ensure that all the men got to mate and so they had
to when they were young kind of posture do whatever peacocking they needed to land a mate
but then once they had it you had some social convention where all the guys got to have a
sexual and procreated opportunity and then they weren't going to have more and as a result if
i knew you weren't going to going to try to mate with my wife then we could coordinate together
where if i didn't know that you weren't going to try that then i have to always stay in competition
with you and if there's a bunch of men who aren't getting their mating needs met they'll just break
the civilization because it's not meeting their needs so how do we make it to where all the men
have their base need met and then stop competing with each other because they kind of got the thing
they need now of course that is an idealized version that pretends that adultery wasn't ubiquitous
and you know etc but
my game b answer is
that the sexual impulse i mean and this is true even in monogamy in monogamy there is the
recognition that you will have sexual impulse towards people other than the person you're married
to that you're going to witness and not act on right so there is this recognition that you don't
act on every impulse and that there are some choices that lead to a healthy life in a healthy
society and there are other impulses that don't that you have the capacity to have some volitional
override on i would say that we can just extend that but it's that same kind of principle and of
course in polyamory there's a similar extension i can witness my jealousy impulse and not be controlled
by it in the same way i can witness my promiscuity impulse and not be controlled by it can i gain
increasing sovereignty over my being hijacked by sexual desire and being hijacked by rival risk
desire or any of those things can i gain the ability to witness all of them and not be automatically
controlled so that my virtues and values can actually be the basis of my choice making
and i would say whether we're in a monogamous a polyamorous a mixed whatever kind of set of
social constructs the basis of it is that is that and and i think here's the core argument
and this is why i actually there's a limit to evolutionary psychology that
i end up being unhappy with the answers it generates all the time is we have capacities
that were not evolutionarily selected for directly but are the acceptations of what was selected for
right so nature selected for the capacity for recursive abstraction because it led to tool
building and coordination for hunting but now that recursive abstraction gives us the ability
to do things that were not part of our evolutionary selective environment but we have the capacity
so it's not default that they will be deployed that way but it's possible for us to deploy them
that way and if we if we look in the rest of nature other than humans on this biosphere
we are we are really not like anything else in the amount of impact that we're able to have
on all of the ecosystems that we're in and the nature and the speed the speed coupling in particular
so mostly we don't compare ourselves to viruses or mycelium we compare ourselves to apex predators
and i think people here have heard me talk about this before apex predator theory is not a good
model for humans because orcas can't leave the ocean and go hunt on land and polar bears can't
go hunt in the savannah we were able to become the apex predator in every environment so rather
than hunt to a certain level and then have our population checked they also didn't start factory
farms they also didn't do species extinction at scale because and i mean i've used this example
so many times but an orca is going to catch one seal or one fish at a time and it's going to
miss a lot of times and then you look at a drift net a mile long drift net that pulls up a hundred
thousand fish at once and you're like that's not apex predator right like that dwarfs an orcas
impact on fish populations so much that it's incomparable so if we keep modeling ourselves
as apex predators and needing to up regulate our apexness relative to the other people so we have
to deploy our exponential technologies of domination and whatever to compete with each other we do
destroy we we both drive arms races where the direct conflict is bigger than the playing field
can handle and where the externality is bigger than the playing field can handle so the thing
i would say is that our choice making capacities because of abstraction and technology are
evolutionarily unprecedented no other animals can impact the world in the way we can as a result
of that our evolutionary or our choice making basis has to also be evolutionarily unprecedented
and it can be and so our capacity to witness evolutionary impulses in ourselves and neither
automatically be controlled by them nor shame them just witness them understand them and then
have a choice making basis that is more the result of reflection abstraction values consideration
is key to that question
so if you figured to swat this one away and i'm being playfully no nosy today
but when it comes to the monogamy poly kind of distinction how do you relate to that what was
your sort of pathway and your choice i have been happily monogamous i've been happily polyamorous
i've been happily celibate it was important for me to explore be with nobody be with one person be
with more than one person so that i had first person experience of it i had knowledge of it
and that it was actually a choice because if i couldn't do some of them then it wasn't really a
choice it was a default if my jealousy was so intense that um my partner being with someone
else would really freak me out making me lose my shit then and then when i say i'm choosing
monogamy because of this that and the other value that's really the rational backfill
to i just can't handle something else um or similarly if i couldn't choose monogamy because
i'm super afraid of being trapped and afraid of commitments and can't control lust processes
whatever then i say i'm choosing the other one and it's a default so it was important to me to have
experience and
that i can navigate i could navigate different models right i could navigate different cultural
models but who am i as a being and showing up to relationships with other people is deeper than
models and does my okayness come from a specific model does it come from the agreement that this
person will never behave in these ways and if they do i'm totally fucked up or that i definitely
you know get the opportunity to behave with these people in these ways or does it come from a deeper
place than that and so i can't like at this point
i can't really imagine being bothered by who someone chose to have sex with like that just
not going to bother me i also can't imagine feeling like i need to have sex with somebody in particular
um and so those are just not things that control me
and that means that there is not a obligation to a particular model of i need to get my needs met
i think coming to relationships from the point of view and this is kind of like common
in
us california um personal development language of like needs meeting i think it
it can actually go in a pretty bad direction which is hey i have these needs we're in relationship
i need you to meet my needs is actually just psychobabble for codependency and because i need
my needs means i can't be not fucked up unless i control your behavior
i need you to behave a particular way for me to be okay no you don't you were fine before
you ever met that person if that person died you'd grieve and something else would occur
if that person was doing that thing that you really hate but you just moved your attention
to something else and got distracted you'd be fine it's the but as soon as i say i need this
person to do that thing i'm conditionalizing my happiness and then i'm making that true for
myself now of course i might have boundaries of i know the kinds of things i'm interested in and
if someone doesn't want to do the kinds of things i'm interested in it just doesn't make sense for
us to do this thing together like i'm i'm interested in relationships where we're honest and if
someone else is not interested in honesty or not capable of it i'm just not going to choose to do
a deep relationship with them but i'm not saying i need you to be honest with me no i don't i can
just interact with you differently so i think the coming to a relationship from a place of
sovereignty and wholeness not from a place of seeking to get your needs met in it is a critical
part of navigating monogamy serial monogamy polyamory any of those well
um so people are cheering me on to keep asking you questions so i'll just ask one more um in
let's say you said you're happily monogamous happy uh happily poly happily celibate what virtues
did you learn uh with each of those what virtues emerged yeah it's a great question i think there
are times where i think there are things that can be learned in celibacy
differently i won't say they're the only way to learn it but they can be learned differently
than through other life experiences i think
they're all of the kind of tantric practices of notice sexual energy arise and see if you can
learn how to move it see if you can learn how to direct that in a different way and
directed into creativity into other things there's really interesting stuff one has to
do when they don't just go to immediate release of a very strong evolutionary energy there's also
something around when you meditate and your nose itches and you don't scratch it you just
witness it which says i am not controlled by every biologic impulse that arises i don't have to
scratch it like i'll be fine if it just itches and i watch it there's something around
if i can watch a very strong sexual impulse and not have to scratch the itch i become more
trustworthy including more trustworthy to myself um there's also a place of being able to
have a lot more attention with yourself that can make you both more reflective and more
um noticing and integrating shadow elements and all kinds of things like that when you
don't put a huge amount of your attention on other people and when you aren't seeking to get
fulfillment from other people right away but seeking to notice your where unfulfillment arises
inside of you and inquire more into it and work with that there's a lot of wholeness and sovereignty
that can be developed away and specifically if someone is coming from codependence sometimes
that phase is necessary it's actually necessary before getting to interdependence to go through
a phase of deep independence that involves even things like sexual sovereignty um monogamy
uh in forests one of his landry is one of his books there's a line that i think is just
beautifully expressed that the line is a for every freedom multiple new limits arise and for
every limit multiple new freedoms arise and this is the recognition that freedom and limitation are
words that can't be defined without each other or a synonym of them they're codefining concepts
but they're also codefining realities and so the idea the desire for just more freedom is
fundamentally a kind of immaturity as opposed to that every freedom has limitations that come
with it costs and investments that come with it and i have to embrace them together and so
i'm actually not choosing more freedom in an absolute sense i'm choosing the freedoms that
are more meaningful to me um so monogamy is a very nice structure to be able to give up some things
give up some freedoms and feel good about it and not indulge feeling resentful or lacking or bad
about it as an as a choice not because i have to because of something that i am choosing because
of a freedom i want so maybe i want to be able to go to places of depth and commitment psychologically
sexually emotionally with her where i have to create a safe enough container for that for that
to be possible that's a freedom there's a freedom that we can explore certain things in that container
that might not be possible outside of it and there are certain limitations i'm fully willing to embrace
for that um in open relationship there's this idea hey that's common of rather than try to get all
of your needs met from one person which makes you kind of resent them and manipulate them to be
someone they aren't you try to force your husband to dance and he sucks at dancing but he's good
at other things but you're disappointed in him because he's not that thing and you like it or
whatever how about just get different needs met from different people and love each person for
who they are it sounds like a nice idea and there's some niceness to it but there is in a monogamous
dynamic of course to some degree we just get different social needs met from different people
that we don't have to be having sex with it's called friends and community and family that you
can have intellectual and relational experiences with but there's also a place of being like hey
i want to grow with you where the things that are really meaningful to you i want to grow into and
develop to some capacity even if i wasn't interested in it on my own in that topic or that thing because
i'm interested in you and i'm interested in the connection we have and there's really um yeah
there's something very beautiful about that and around saying where we could diversify our attention
and other relationships we want to keep deepening it and let's see how deep can we go into the
depths of knowing each other and knowing ourselves through the way we know each other so there's
these are all things that monogamy can do very beautifully and there's more
and open relationship and each of these also have a shadow right there is coming to celibacy
because of just shame around sex and bodies or because of just sucking interpersonally and not
wanting to keep feeling rejected or you know other things like that just being wounded in a
relationship and just retreating into the wound there's pathological versions of monogamy that
are really about control and jealousy and insecurity and trying to get your security met through a very
secure structure or whatever there's pathological open relationship that more has to do with
immaturities around more freedom and a fear of commitment intimacy whatever
i think some of the things that can be learned in open relationship well is different people bring
out different aspects of us and the more intimate a relationship is which doesn't have to be sexual
but obviously that brings a whole depth of intimacy we've we might find that there are
like it's a common thing i hear people in open relationship who are doing it
thoughtfully say is wow i went places in my experience with you that i've never went with
anyone else but that's true for everyone they're with because there's just the universe is a big
place experience is a big place and that the different chemistries of those people coming
together make different kinds of like unlock different things the way they trigger each other
the way they facilitate each other the way they use each other so that's one thing the other thing
is the ability to be very connected to someone really not ambivalent about them and also not
try to control them is a very deep process it says i love you i want to be connected i'm not
ambivalent about you and i ultimately want for you all the things you want for yourself that are
good for you and even if some of that takes you away from me i want that more than i want to try
to control something that is not what you most want that's a very deep and profound and beautiful
process of moving more into something that i think deserves to be called love than control and insecurity
also getting to work past rivalry and getting to have a sense of like okay i'm doing this prayer
about my desire for the well-being of all mankind and holding all humanity as brothers but really
if you fuck with my woman i'm going to hit you in the face i'm just holding you as a rival
and my prayers don't really mean anything right like so then there's a question of like what does it
mean to say i want for everybody and i want to embrace people as brothers and i want to have
non-rival risk dynamics like there's a very deep way and like the the more intimate the thing that's
being shared is the more depth of intimacy in that relationship and the more overcoming
rivalry and kind of interactions have to occur so i think all of those structures can be explored
in a mature way valuably i think they can all be described in a mature way for actual shadow
reasons in a kind of pre-transfallacy and that's what i see more often than not
i think open relationship is harder just fundamentally harder than monogamy because
monogamy if you notice in our when i say our culture i'm giving a stat about the us but i
i think much of the modern developed world is similar when you look at the divorce rate
and the infidelity rate and the people who are neither divorced nor in infidelity but who are
together sexlessly or miserably it's pretty fucking high across those three right and you
look at how many long-term marriages are there that are really fulfilling and beautiful and say
okay people suck at that just with one person
and it's because relationship is actually a hard thing it's i have to like pay attention to my
triggers and my feelings and my wants and my worldview and my desires and somebody else's at
the same time and neither compromise what i really need for what they want which will just make me
resentful nor push for what i want in a way that will end up making them resentful i have to actually
i have to be able to hold more than myself but including myself simultaneously right and i would
say everything that's hard in politics this is a microcosm of and then of course a family with
kids now we got to do that for more people we got to be able to be tuned into and aware of this whole
field of interacting people um i would say that most people can't even deal with their own needs
and feelings and wants and desires and thoughts without driving themselves crazy most of the
time let alone trying to do two people at once so uh multiple relationships are taking
what most people are already barely only succeeding at and trying to say now let's do multiple of those
at once plus it's a second order equation because of the interaction of all of those so um i i have
not seen people do really well at open relationship who didn't do really well at monogamy
i've seen people who claim they do and under the hood it's actually pretty fucked up
but doing well at monogamy involves like being able to be really committed to someone and problem
solve and work through difficult things and an open relationship is actually being really committed
to more than one person and being really committed to someone and the other people that they're with
right as part of an ecosystem that's just if someone chooses to do that they're also going
to choose to invest a lot of development effort in it
yeah that was super awesome um so i'm going to stop hogging you and then pass it the question
to someone else uh just want to be sensitive to the time uh we're past the hour mark uh are you
okay to go to uh 20 more minutes uh sure yeah okay um hannah you had a question
okay so originally i was going to ask about um systemic trauma and your strategy surrounding that
but what is more likely right now is you know there are some people like us at the stowa
who are interested in developing sovereignty and there are some people for whom that is not
a concern and we work with these people and we're friends with these people and we're in
relationships with these people so what what are your strategies for continuing to develop
sovereignty in relationship to and in connection to this ecology people who are not doing that
so there's a few ways to answer this
so one way is you think about when someone uh is transplanting a small tree they plant
a tree in a place they put tree stakes around it because it hasn't yet established its root base
maybe they put a fence around it to protect it from deer or whatever it is
once it establishes its root base you might be able to you know tie things to it and use it as a
stabilizer but to begin with it needs stabilized in people's personal development it's that way
for most people where there is a desire to be able to be stable in a particular set of capacities
or virtues or values to be able to help other people with it but there's also the honest
developmental recognition of when that's not true yet and doing that will just pull the little tree
over and that the developmentally right thing is to be around people further ahead than you
in that particular line of development until it becomes stabilized enough that you can
not be thrown off going into places that are further off and you can actually help
that's something i think it's an important consideration so the i'll say a little bit
more about this because i think it's more important than most people acknowledge the
the jewish saying proximity is destiny that who you are around is going to end up determining the
course of your life more than any other single thing is and it's true because as social primates
we're influenced by what we take in on tv and by our own thinking and by our disciplines but we're
more and and the physical environment we're in but we're more influenced by the people we're around
than pretty much anything else and so being cognizant of that and that's why there's aphorisms
like um keep the company of the wise and keep the company of saints and whatever in every culture
that has some wisdom to be like that's an important thing and then of course who are all the people
seeking the company of the wise who aren't there there's obviously a developmental recognition
that people get to a place where that can be more of an offering so i would not try to help people
ground in something you are not grounded in that's the first thing
the next thing is when you're talking about your own desire to increase sovereignty and then
that other people don't have that desire as much maintaining your own sovereignty with
respect to the where they are if you get if you get bent out of shape because they're not something
else um that's the place for your practice not for trying to change them um your ability to
see them where they are at accept them accept your where you're at right and have some piece
around that is going to be important and then after those two i would say learning how to be
more effective at influence is actually important sometimes that's paying attention to who you
actually can influence and sometimes it's paying attention to what effective influence strategies
are but the foundation of effective influence strategies with regard to things like virtue
development always start with your own embodiment and practice
any follow-up Hannah
no i'm good thank you all right um jason you had a question
hey yeah um so can you hear me great um so most of the time when when i hear the term
collective intelligence it's coming from the mouths of intellectuals who are a tiny fraction
of society so i'm wondering how can we foster a collective intelligence that's inclusive and
integrates other forms of wisdom beyond just education or kind of like whether it's um
self-initiated or institutional is there are there other paths that that can kind of bring
us all up to speed without becoming an intellectual
so interesting question
there's several sub-questions in there that i hear one is does everyone have to develop
their intellect for society to function well and refining that would be how much development of
intellect is necessary to engage as a citizen well and the other question is what types of human
development other than intellect are meaningful and can contribute to collective capacity in some way
and then how do we engage those effectively and maybe also a question around does everyone
even have similar aptitude for all of the different kinds of intelligence and how do we
work with that and like those are all very interesting questions
the term collective intelligence is a term that is not exactly synonymous but close to
synonymous with other terms that other groups use to mean more broad things like productive capacity
right there is some relationship between those topics so for the most part traditional
economists aren't going to talk about collective intelligence but they will talk about a society's
productive capacity and its productive base and they will recognize that the invisible hand
of the market is an emergent collective intelligence that is contributed by all of the
supply and demand and innovation patterns across the interaction of all those people
so collective intelligence theory would look at the market as a collective intelligence mechanism
and that what people want and the up regulation of who supplies that well and that driving
innovation and whatever that whole kind of market theory you can look at that through the lens of
collective intelligence and acknowledge that people's innovation their creativity their desires
all kinds of things are part of that other than just their intellect
there's obviously study and collective intelligence of types of group problem solving and coherence
and choice making that are other than intellectual like a tribe that gets together and they have a
big decision to make so they all start by dancing in a drum circle around a fire
and that doesn't seem like an intellectual thing but what's happening is
the drum circle itself is having the people do their own thing on the drum but also find
synchrony with each other so there is a balancing of individuation and harmony right of sovereignty
and communion and the people who are dancing are all doing their own dance but all to the same
base beat so similarly there is a embodied experience of being an individual in harmony
with other individuals and that embodied experience where then they're seeing each other and seeing
their eyes and having that experience then they sit and they have a felt sense of their own individual
place and their connectivity with each other that changes the state there and when they go
into solve that problem so that's kind of like a social technology that's a pretty awesome social
technology that evolution selected for for a long time that isn't what you would consider an
intellectual process but absolutely might increase the quality of problem solving of that group
might it might even make their intellectual capacities more capable of coming to bear
we can look at other things that it probably does like move people from a more sympathetic
to parasympathetic place which makes executive function more capable and limbic hijack less
possible and you know other things like that so the question of are there lots of different types
of knowing and intelligence that are possible and important and can we figure out ways of
engaging all of them and not over-norming on some of them is a super important question
and well beyond the scope of me answering how we do that
um
will everyone be equally intellectual of course not
just like will everyone be equally artistic or kind of course not
is there a minimum level of kindness and a minimum level of rationality that is necessary
for people to be able to be part of effective social constructs yes
and this is kind of the baseline of what we would call a culture or uh yeah
if you think about the chakras as a model for types of intelligence
which is a good way to think about them that each one of them was like a a center of capacity or
intelligence or wisdom or awakening or something like that um the chakra corresponding to
the solar plexus would traditionally be interpreted as being associated with will
that the kind of intelligence that is is related to what we were talking about earlier with like
power literacy is there's a the generator question there is how do i relate to this topic or the
situation in a way that empowers me that's a kind of intelligence right it's a kind of intelligence
to say what do i focus on what meaning do i give it how do i relate with it that empowers me
which is a different question than what is objectively true and provable it's a different
kind of intelligence the chakra that we would associate with the throat having to do with
communication if i'm communicating i'm not just talking at somebody i'm trying to create communion
with them i'm trying to find commonality um there's some purpose why we're talking so i'm
wanting what i'm saying to be received in land right so i have to actually put myself to communicate
effectively i have to put myself in the other person's shoes and say how would i communicate
this thing to them where this would land and wouldn't hit their triggers or be rejected so
how do i communicate effectively involves empathy for the other and self reflection around what is
true for you and what your intent in communicating is those types of intelligence would be associated
with that chakra and so the intellect which is the capacity to discern what is same and what is
different right what what where is their sameness or commonality between things where is their
difference or distinction and then what is the kind of relatedness you can think of intellect
which is distinct from what we might call mind mind might involve a lot of narratives running
and a lot of identity and software but intellect is kind of just the pure compute function of the
capacity for discernment discerning truth from falseness sameness from difference those types
of things and that was actually of in in the yogic chakra system that was the very highest
of the chakras before union with everything um what i would say is that any of the develop
like the human developmental philosophic traditions
i interpret that the highest thing they're offering is how to develop all of the parts of self
for everybody so we can say oh the you know the heart chakra the the path there is bhakti yoga
about love and devotion or if it's uh and maybe the intellect would be gyan yoga and
there are different paths and i can pick one i think the more kind of well-rounded interpretation
is for us to connect with all the dimensions of our self and develop all the dimensions of
our self so that there gets to be a maximum wholeness of self in the fullest relationship
of the wholeness of reality so if any for someone to say oh i'm an intellectual i don't need to feel
their intellect is going to be limited by the depth of the experience of what those symbols
mean related to the ground of experience right um so i i want a culture where everyone values
intellect and experience and artistry and all and all of those things and everyone values
developing all of those aspects in themselves in a way that is aligned and unique to who they are
not that everyone will be developing them identically or equally
beautiful thank you
awesome um so uh we have about five minutes left so let's uh end here um
there's any juicy questions in the chat maybe you can throw another that google doc we have
running so we can kind of save it for next time or anything that came alive
before i close out i'll hand it to daniel for any kind of concluding thoughts this is kind of a
interesting ride that we went down with these questions but anything i'll ask you at the moment
i'll just this is this is fun it's fun to have a group of people that care about these things and
want to take time to think and reflect and develop themselves and and create a community of shared
development both for themselves and in thinking about society and civilization more broadly
and the relationship between those of how do i become a citizen of the future i want to see
how do i develop myself so that i can actually apprehend that world and i'm a part of it um
and so that i'm more capable of helping bring it about um that kind of bi-directional relationship
super important and uh you know when you um offered for me to come and do the four
times in a row i happened to be in a in a very busy time with trying to launch this project
and so i was thinking okay maybe we'll do that in a couple years but um it doesn't actually take
that much time since it's just questions and you're hosting it doing all the work of it and um
what i think i think this community is actually very well set to
help the kind of movement process conciliants project is working on asking these questions
being in practice around it and uh so yeah this is fun and i think the intent or the hope was that
these four get to build on each other so we don't need to ask the same questions again mostly we'll
kind of ask new ones and maybe get to reference earlier things we talked about so it'd be interesting
to see where we get by the end of it beautiful um so i'll make some closing announcements in a moment
