All right, everyone. Welcome to Stoa. Today we have our friend Daniel Schmockenberger returning
and we are very lucky to have Gilbert Morris visiting us as well. Gilbert is a philosopher,
legal scholar, and former diplomat and author of numerous books. An absolute genius if you feel
like blown away by his scope of knowledge, listen to him speak with Daniel. And both Daniel and
Gilbert have had a wide-ranging conversation on the history of racism and racial conflict
relevant to the American situation, which was posted back on the Stoa in September.
And they're visiting today to continue that conversation with us here at the Stoa. So
how today is going to work? We're here for roughly 90 minutes. I'm going to take in Daniel in a moment
and he's going to kind of have an open, set the frame for the opening exchange that he's going to
have with Gilbert, set the context of why they're here and why they're dialoguing about this issue
and we'll pivot into for Q&A. So if you have questions anytime, pop them in the chat. I'll
call on you. You can ask your question to Daniel Gilbert. If you submitted a question on the survey,
please let me know privately in the chat so I can know you're here and I can take you in.
And yeah, that's it on my end. So Gilbert, Daniel, welcome to the Stoa and Daniel, take your hit.
You're on mute, Daniel.
Which is one thing Gilbert was calling you out on quite often in your exchange with him.
All right. Can you hear me well now? Yeah. All right. Thank you very much, Peter. I'm happy to be
back and getting to do the Q&A of this session and happy to see everybody who's here.
So opening remarks about the intention of this and a little bit of a recap from the last one
that I'll give and then Professor Morris will do the same and then we'll
dive on into people's questions, which is the intention today.
In case there are some people who are here that did not watch the previous one we did,
this was intended to be Q&A for that one. If you did watch it, awesome. If not,
it was our second recording actually and we squeezed it into like three hours because the
first time it was like six hours and we decided that not enough people would make it through.
But it could really easily be much, much more than that because what Gilbert was trying to do
was walk us through a few thousand years of history of slavery globally, of racial conflict
globally, of philosophic rationalization and economics benefits of slavery and the encoding
in law that all create context for what was both in common in the American slavery situation with
others but also what was very unique about it that brings us to the uniqueness of the current
conflict that is all really important part of the context for saying how would we understand
this well enough to know how to go forward. My intention in hosting that or in having that
conversation with Gilbert, very important for me to be clear, I do not have any deep expertise in
this topic. I had earnestness and curiosity and the lack of expertise and there were a few people
that did a kind job of educating me and Gilbert was the person who was able to kind of walk me
through the history of different schools of racial theory and how did critical legal theory
turn into critical race theory turn into the woke movement and BLM and how has it held differently
in different countries and kind of helped me understand not just the history of it in an
objective sense but the different views on it and I think why it felt very important to me was
somehow the I think the Stoa has done an amazing job of being metapolitical and not getting partisan
captured and being able to have people that are traditionally far right and far left both be in
conversations together but the Stoa Rebel Wisdom IDW corner of the universe that I have found myself
in has a leaning in the anti-woke direction that affects a number of things racial conflict being
one of them and it felt like it was attack of the worst elements of wokeism without a deep
understanding of the history or the real issues and kind of straw manning rather than steel manning
and one of the things we talk about so much is let's make sure to not be adding to culture wars
that we're truly steel manning the other perspective to be able to find synthesis and it felt really
important to in this corner of the universe steel man the history of the racial conflict issues in
the unique American case to say what is the actual problem space here what has what are the solutions
that have been tried why would people not feel good about those solutions so as to be able to see
how to forward it most of the questions that people have today about how do we actually solve these
problems or what about somebody else's thoughts on the history will be directed at Gilbert because
he has the expertise here and I'm mostly here to support facilitate I think one thing I want to
just comment on is I get two comments almost equally often because of what I do have some
expertise on in terms of global catastrophic risk there are people who are working in say the cutting
edge of AI risk or synthetic biology risk and they're like why are you why would you waste any
time focusing on an issue like racism that does not portend the ability to kill all life on the
planet in the next few years when we're at the brink of possible nuclear war between NATO and
Russia that both have strategic nuclear arsenals and when we're doing gain and function research
with synthetic biology and leaky labs that could kill almost everything and the speed of AI is what
it is you could work on those like racism is just not a comparably destructive issue to all life
that's and how close we are with planetary boundaries on catastrophic die off of dead zones
and whatever I get another perspective that says it is a privileged position to be able to think
about existential risk in the future because people who are living in the ghetto or comparably in a
refugee camp or whatever are facing existential risk every single day that is not a future forecast
thing it's a real here and now eminent reality that you're taking attention and away from to
focus on hypothetical things and specifically systemic racism through the system called police
and the judicial system in many areas of the US is a existential risk to many people today
so like both of those have some truth to them and I think the thing that has called me is how
all of the issues are interconnected the meaningfulness of all of them and how we can try to pay
attention to that hopefully more competently with finite attention and finite energy one thing that
I will say about why is it actually a really big deal beyond why is it a really big deal to
the overall thriving of life on the planet long term not just the individual people and populations
that it is affecting in the US today or the history of it is when we see how much an issue like race
in the US factoring how in how you cannot separate the institution of the US and its history from
systemic institutionalized racial violence and yet you also can't separate it from leading the
world in democratic process rather than autocratic process today and both are true if it is at the
heart of political divides in the west that can break the capacity to find any way forward of
democracy itself which ends up leading way for autocracy to be the only way forward in which
case they're like we just don't care what you think this is what rule of law is from a top
down way that portends something for the environment and for nuclear issues and everything so if
democracy is not a viable system that matters for every other issue for democracy to be a viable
system we've got to actually be able to take issues that are at the heart of our democratic
institutions like this and say can we forward this in a meaningful way so Du Bois statement of
the color line being defining of the 20th century and the possibility that the color line is actually
one of the defining features of the 21st century as well is part of why this is such a important
meaningful conversation to me so with that Gilbert thank you for being here and would love to hear
your opening thoughts before we jump to questions. Thank you very much Daniel
and good evening it's evening here in the Bahamas so good evening to everyone
it's a great pleasure great pleasure to be here and it's always a great pleasure to be able to
engage in conversation in which the presumption is not that we'll never get along it may be that
we won't find agreement but the agreement is that we should return tomorrow and continue our
discussion and it seems to me that that is a foundation of J.S. Mills notion of the marketplace
of ideas in which people come to the town square to exchange between themselves without the notion
of winning but with the idea and the ideal of understanding and protecting each other's
capacity and opportunity to gain understanding and so I appreciate that immensely. Daniel
and I met during the pandemic I think and we got into several discussions on a variety of subjects
but he saw certainly and I agreed that this was a crucial topic which had to be addressed for the
reasons which he which he has said. What I tried to do is to distinguish between race and slavery
there were flashes of the notions of race very early on in human civilization recorded
history such as we understand it in about 1250 BC in China the China like Russia that has
Eugene O'Negan poem written by a black man as it's a it's it's it's key poem the magical
cologne was China's sort of original literary fair and so at this early stage there was a
recognition of a distinction of race but there wasn't anything assigned to it that was either
negative or positive in the current iteration of the discussions on race for the most part
the strangeness of the culture behind the race was the key thing that was that was the point of
emphasis. If we come into the period which Daniel and I began at beginning with Aristotle's
concept of the slave Aristotle did something which he always does he if you ask Aristotle
which is the best form of government he doesn't tell you he doesn't pick one he says well if you
want democracy this is what it would be and if you want monarchy this is what it would be and if
you want that and so on and so on so he's not very committal and he made it it seems to me a
cardinal error on a very important subject and
he's frozen is it so it seems
and you want to pick up where he left off I cannot
I cannot pick up on the cardinal error that Aristotle made in this particular topic
we'll wait for him to come back as we do I'm hoping that the opening remarks don't
take up too much of the time because we really want to get into people's questions and so I'm
curious if people as Gover gets back online have questions that they want to start populating in
the chat that would be wonderful and of course if it is a question is great if it is a comment that
wants to be discussed that is also fine and since I do not know how long it will take for
Gilbert to get back I am willing to engage any that I am competent to right now oh there he is
back all right you're muted Gilbert but you're back
all right we lost you at the cardinal mistake Aristotle made
and we were just having saying that as you got back on and we finished our opening comments that
we'd get to questions so people are starting to work on questions but please continue with
what was important I'm not going to say much more than that pretty much except to say that
what we were able to do I hope was to trace how this open cavity conceptual cavity that Aristotle
left was constantly filled conveniently filled with notions of race as distinct from slavery
and it almost became irresistible and has become something very interesting
the people who were formulating these notions of race they knew that their
that their statements and their I wouldn't even say their attitudes their claims about race
they knew that they were false the problem is when another genus that there's an acculturation
problem and an intergenerational flow of understanding and what eventually happens is
the first generation knows that what they're saying those claims are false but the second
generation this is all they've ever known by the third generation it becomes completely accepted
and now it's almost impossible to dislodge and then something interesting happens the victims of
this and we're speaking very broadly here they then having their backs against the wall
take up the mantra of these racial nomenclature and definitions and where it is a badge of honor
and then a false or meta-level conversation begins where people having been pushed or ensconced into
a racial language and a racial acculturation that is misdefined then defend themselves out
of that wearing it as a badge of honor and in this way you can never have a real honest conversation
about race because both parties are speaking at such an asymmetry that it's impossible now to
achieve alignment and so what we are seeing with the with seeing what is generally called the
wildness although that was a positive thing at one point and then it became a negative thing
strangely enough and or like discussions about discussions about critical race theory
critical race theory was at one point merely the acceptance of a different perspective on
the history some people say the truer perspective on the history to be included in the curricula
and because the coordinates of the race conversation have been so bastardized
it's almost impossible for the two sides to meet in an area of understanding
I'll make one last point about that I was having a talk with someone in Richard Kimball
and he writes for a Catholic magazine he's quite famous and when I arrived in in America in 1995
I was giving a talk at the St Thomas Aquinas Society but somehow met at the Four Seasons in
Washington DC how the Christians have come up in the world but what was interesting there
he was talking about charter schools because each side seems to have these very strong positions
on particular things and so he was talking about charter schools now coming from the Bahamas and
growing up in the British system where private school means government school and public school
means private school and all these things have to do with class rather than racial divisions or
anything having to do with say in the American situation where taxes are paid or schools are
financed from property taxes and therefore the best codes have the best schools and so
we were talking about charter schools and the person saying to me oh you know one should have
a right to choose which school one child goes to and I thought yes that's true I believe in choice
so no problem therefore charter schools are an excellent way to exercise that choice my point
was but don't you see that means that you've committed to the idea that the government that you
everyone pays taxes to the government to run a proper school public school system and while you
can have your charter schools you cannot make the argument that there's a clear tracery from the idea
of choice to charter schools the real problem is your tax model is vulva that's the real problem
you're not having a real conversation about schools because you're you're willing to say
charter schools are not available to everyone for democracy to work you have to have broad
education for broad education to work you have to have good public education public education
the bargain that we make in democracy is that we pay taxes so that there's a generalized
equality of opportunity across the political sphere and if you get into these cul-de-sac
arguments about fundamental principles and what seems to me somewhat exotic choices
you're not having a real conversation about the fundamental issues that plague the society
seems to me and so I think the racial conversation has
this sort of migrated into such a cul-de-sac where people are not speaking really from the
same position about from fundamental principles about some ideal which which everyone adheres to
and even if people do adhere to it to them they seem afraid to admit it because it gives too much
to the other side in the argument and the capacity seems to have been lost or somewhat waylaid
in this ability to make to make the proper argument to get to the point of the ideal
which probably would have broader agreement and where you'd have broader agreement so I'll
leave it there that's what we we try to achieve in the first discussion and then we can we can go to
questions I see some questions that I I would focus on because I think they're knowing some of your
solutions I think they're fruitful areas so just to kind of guide the conversation a bit
it's so I think for many people it might be like why the fuck do you start with talking about
ancient China and Aristotle when we're talking about the situation in the Americas and I I beg
of everyone to have the benefit of the doubt and the attention span to follow what seems like a
circuitous route because it is actually fascinatingly relevant and oftentimes when there's a wicked
problem that seems intractable it's because the framing is wrong and we actually have to step
out of the frame so it's interesting if we take Aristotle having been such an influence to western
thought and the idea of a natural slave that some people are disposed naturally as slaves
and then we take motivated reasoning and the desire to answer the question who are the natural
slaves like it was a very very good frame by one of the leading thinkers to then have everybody
seeking to answer that and then of course economic motive creates motivated reasoning and blah blah
so I think the topic of motivated reasoning and how mind-blowingly easy it is and destructive it
is it would be one of the first things we would say we would want in a conversation regarding
racial conflict is racial conflict ends up pertaining to actual conflict around economic
issues where there are real scarcities like if are we going to actually deal with it intergenerational
wealth issues of that the the GI bill should have happened those those cities shouldn't
have been burned down the you know there should be black populations with a lot more generational
wealth than they have are we going to have a situation where nobody wants to just give up
their wealth like just not there aren't that many people who have it even if it came through
non-fair means who want to give it up does that mean that then we use when we write law to change
it where law means that it's backed up by police and a monopoly of violence that
takes some people's money give it to other people there's hard fucking issues in here right like
we get down to conflict theory over scarce rivalrous resource that affects the actual
materiality of people's lives so to at least say hey we're all subject to motivated reasoning here
because the effect of this conversation has real materiality differences in our lives can we at
least try to notice our unmotivated reasoning on each side get out of it you know recognize
the sensitivity of it and see a way forward that is at least possible i think that's a very good
thing to keep in mind gilbert you went into the topic of schools and that's obviously one key
thing and one of the questions someone asked here's about schools and i know one of your
solutions has to do with schools and that given that one of the biggest issues is not just could we
make situations that have no institutional racism today could we make laws where we fix redlining
and we fix institutional racism police force today that doesn't solve the historical issue
and wealth is a big thing in generational wealth is a big thing the historical issue
is where the reparations would ever come up that is such a clusterfuck of a topic
and you discussed in the previous one the difference between restitution compensation
reparations but how do we make a path that does provide fair equality of opportunity factoring
how much that has been damaged in the past but that doesn't require some of the things that are
more impossible to move through politically you have a model with the historically black
colleges and universities that i think is really fascinating that i think is worth talking about
here and as an entry someone asked this question so i i think one two if we could get to historically
black colleges as a second topic and the first is someone asked kevin is there an ideal way to
teach about race and racial conflict in schools and he says ideally throughout different levels of
cognitive and emotional development elementary up through middle school and high school obviously
you have talked about this topic in a university setting different states teach about it differently
in the u.s currently is there anything you'd like to share around how the school education of this
topic could be meaningfully better yes there's a tedious hermeneutics which goes into this because
one has to perform a kind of unraveling first and then come forward because people are ensconced in
the points of views with which they have been raised and there are social structures which
seem to confirm appear to confirm people's prejudices in many respects i don't speak of
racism as an emotion for instance but rather as a set of set of structures everyone is
prejudiced so for instance you hear the topic well everyone can be racist or you know reverse
racism or that sort of thing so one of the things we would try to examine without insisting that we
had the right point of view certainly when i was teaching and in this case i was teaching
the faculty to teach to to explore ways of teaching about race and one of the things i said was well
look let's look at it everyone has prejudices we cannot escape that black people have prejudices
white people have prejudices women men all these sorts of things but on the racial question
it seems to me that when a person has a prejudice and also has the power and there's a structure
that allows that power to be exercised to make preferences on the basis of race that that is
racism so that's not an emotion or a feeling that is prejudice with the vertical of power to be able
to apply that prejudice in the apportionment of benefits in a society where everyone pays
the same taxes but only one group of people because of that prejudice and it's relative
the power associated with it to be able to to coordinate outcomes and if we think of it like
that it seems to me we get to some very interesting places about the notion of racism it doesn't let
black people off the hook for being unkind and for having you know virulent prejudices
but it also is able to demonstrate you're also able to isolate how power structures work in such a
that certain people can enact their prejudices on everyone whereas other people have prejudices
but they can't enact them they don't have the power structure or the vertical of power to do so
so that's one little frame that we speak about one of the things I speak to
to uh to uh black americans about is the term african-american and I try to explain that
if you think about uh the continent of africa before the 17th century the the average person in
benin could never see himself as an african he saw himself within the terms of this particular
tribe so if you were a tith uh in what is now nigeria or edu or you were a basa in what is now
like birria or or or vai in one of those places that's what you saw yourself as and you saw if
you were a basa you saw the vai as different from yourself as the mongolian from the swiss
because you these are ancestral cultures with long oral histories and these oral histories
and ancestralism created in fact a sociological divide between these uh these uh uh micro-civilizations
in some cases uh that separated them from one another so that the argument came to me that uh
well the italians call themselves italian-american the you know the french call themselves french
american although i've never heard a french american call himself a french american i think most of
the irish uh uh do that and the italians and tomasil has a wonderful some wonderful writing
about that actually and um uh i would say to them well you've it seems to me you beg the question
because if in fact we're going to claim that the history has been a sort of lost right
or at least uh uh there's been a a separation a displacement and a marginalization
from the lines and the tracery of the history it seems very much to me that you have to leave
it that way and not use in the you know so nomenclature as a bandage for that and rather
leave it the way it is so that would mean that the blacks are just americans because they can't
make a historical reference for a cultural or ethnological reference um to their point of origin
and that forces the question to have to come up over and over again and forces a public debate
now you may not agree with that but that's in the framing it seems to me that in all these little
areas one one has to try and work these things out this is part of the walking back of the
incrustication of what is i think are a set of bad arguments that sit on top of uh
that sit on top of uh the history last point at daniel in our discussion i made this distinction
this notion that um that somehow people who were virulent um enslave us and also hypocritical
enslave us that they were simply people of their time and uh i reject that one rather vigorously
and i think we were able to demonstrate if you juxtapose the lives of lord mansfield
and and thomas jefferson thomas jefferson takes a young girl who's 14 and uh he makes her his
amenities and amaretta and he does that uh and i remember joseph ellis the historian i met him
when i first came to america and he was talking about presentism and it's funny that at the time
he also made a statement when discussing presentism uh he wrote a book called american
stints and he was promoting this book and it was a politics and prose in washington dc i think
and uh at that discussion he said something like uh jefferson was far too moral to engage
in an immoral relationship with an underage child and i didn't know what to do with myself i just
come from the lse where you know we were methodologists and we analyze things for the kind
of brutality and i didn't know how to respond to this uh strange in a strange statement and uh i
think that this is part of the asymmetry and the what i've referred to as monumentalist history
so there's a relation to history in which people wish it to be monumental and when i say that
you have in the schools at the moment in texas and some other places people deciding on which
textbooks to use and which not to use and people have said things like uh if history makes me feel
bad we should rather stay away from that because we should have a glorious notion of our of our
country and it seems to me that this is an unfortunate proposition it is not the case that
the people that we spoke of uh were people of their times were the people of their times slavery
was always contested at every stage in history always contested racism was always contested
at every stage of history the literature shows that all the research shows that in in in an incredible
way and even in america um from about uh the 16 30s to the 16 90s when the notion of racial
inferiority and white supremacy gained its paramountcy there were people who were opposed to it
uh bitterly and a broad cross-section of people as well in fact you had the raging movement going
on in in britain at the time uh with people like well later on the people like will before some
and some of those people and then before him uh in europe people like nicklas of cusa and so on
who argued against these sorts of things and so we tried to give a frame in a way uh to allow
scholars to see that the the arguments which have been developed in this late period um of our
history but those arguments don't have a foundation and when you press upon them they tend to fall
apart tomasol um i hate to disagree with tomasol really i do um but he he wrote a book um i can't
remember the name just at the moment but it's about uh slavery the history of slavery uh and um i
read i read the book maybe maybe three or four times in one of these online places and so on
and it troubled me tremendously he gave a good disposition on how um slavery evolved throughout
the centuries but he completely ignored racism and how racism emerged as the currency for the
economy or slavery all right and he at that point elided and so that means that he can't really speak
to when we come to the american context the use of racism as a kind of epistemology that allowed
people to feel comfortable with the diminution of others and i think it's a mistake and i would
have loved to have sat with him and kind of had that discussion with him and i i would like to
think that uh that we would have come to some accommodation uh on that point because if you
if you if you throw your hands up and say slavery has always been with us uh american
civilization is nothing new that's not exactly true right it's not exactly true um what happened
in in in the case of uh john casor uh the the person who by civil law was uh transferred out
of indenture into permanent slavery was an abomination of the law known to the people who
executed it they knew that right that passed down throughout the centuries and became uh
it became a fixed epistemological point but that allowed everyone to or so many people to
excuse their racism and the advantages that gave them jefferson pointed this out and this is the
incredible thing about him in the notes on virginia when he said i'm troubled at this question of the
yes of this yes the whites have become accustomed to because in the ordinary uh processes of life
you wouldn't have a situation where we can satisfy every need everyone every desire
all we hear is yes yes yes what happens when this goes away we'll have corrupted ourselves
corrupted our civilization and we would have had entire generations of people who were used to this
but that's because racism is the purchase for that attitude right it was and i was very sad to see that
that that so did not address that in a way that i thought would have been effective lastly your
point about hbc use blacks in america are a canada such that if the gdp of blacks were isolated
from the rest of america it would be probably the eighth or tenths wealthiest country in the world
it would be a member of the g20
if those if that is true it does raise a question uh which also on the other side
seems not to be metabolized well on the woke so-called woke side of the question
if you have this prowess that you have the wealth of canada why haven't we created a canada in america
uh for blacks now that raises all sorts of questions about integration whether in fact
there's a black community whether blacks work together whether there are systems that aggregate
black wealths effectively whether the by black movement which is seems to be more of a kind of
folk sort of thing rather than a major economic initiative whether that's an issue
when you run the numbers it's something like one in 60 or 70 blacks is a millionaire
and so it raises the question if there was a desire to be a real community in the sense of
you say listen america it doesn't mean we cannot have our own build our own
and integrate that with the rest of society because if you're in a negotiation and as a
diplomat this comes home to me as a methodology if you have nothing on your side of the table
or if what you have on your side of the table is disparate and dissipated across a
vast panoply of people with differing opinions who can't cohere around a set of principles
then you're not going to achieve anything in the debate now for people who are romantic about the
idea of an integrated america this is a problematic thing but the hbc use open up an opportunity it
seems to me to change that in the sense that they already considered black schools and colleges
although many of them are land grant or funded not essentially or historically by blacks at all
but let us assume that they are black colleges and universities for the purposes of discussion
many of them are also in areas where they have large
rule they're not in urban spaces they're in large sort of places where you have lots of land many
of them have lots of property and that kind of thing and it seems to me it would be an interesting
sort of thing if they were to focus on things like the 600 000 technical jobs in the united states
of the americans cannot currently fill and begin to educate with the aim of filling those positions
after all is a way in which society is competitive and this would give a competitive advantage
and any negotiation you have to have leverage and this would provide leverage in the sense that
blacks would still be integrated in american society at a much higher level and with a set of
defensible skills or like defensible skills which means that blacks could not be ignored
and it seems to me that if one were to build such a construct around the historically black
college and mind you they had it in dentistry and medicine and mortuary science these were the
things that flowed into the 50 or 60 black communities in the antebellum period all right
to distinguish them in america but those people did not divide themselves from america they did
not separate themselves from america they did not see them the the the white brothers and sisters
as their enemies they simply saw that we had to build our own circumstances led them to that
and if you think of coming out of slavery for several centuries and coming out of the brutal
period of a civil war and out of that civil war not asking for any benefits any help or anything
of that sort and going out and building those communities and then educating themselves to
be able to be successful in those communities it seems to me that that is the greatest greatest
ever instantiation and exhibition of the american values in the history of the united states
i'm sorry i went on a bit there
yeah but i have a question for you that actually i think a lot of people might also have i wanted
to just underscore briefly one thing that you said in case it wasn't totally obvious for everyone
that i think is so fundamental when you said that thomas all gave a history of slavery but he
kept it separate from racism and that when you combine the erasitalian concept of a natural
slave some people are naturally disposed to slavery and it's actually kind of best suited
for them because they cannot sovereignly figure out what to do with themselves when you combine that
with uh darwin and kind of the early natural science that was heading in the direction of
darwin with the motivated reasoning with the declaration of independence you get something
so fascinating and unique and gruesome yes where like if genghis khan has slaves he didn't say all
men are created equal and all deserve life liberty in the pursuit of happiness he was
fucking brutal and he embraced brutality and it's like okay he's a brutal dude um and he was being
brutal across racial lines but if you say all men are created equal all deserve life liberty in
the pursuit of happiness these people are slaves because they aren't men right because we we're
actually having to say in order to keep intellectual congruency with all men are created equal we have
to actually make them some evolutionarily lower type of animal that is a place where slavery
with that other value system requires a philosophic formalization of racism that is
really uniquely egregious and terrible and the persistence of that that is still felt today
is so fucked up and like i just want it's just such an important point and i just want to like
acknowledge what an important point that is because it is very easy to bring up the point
there's always been slavery which is true um but there has not always been a racial philosophy
of slavery that had that subhuman egregiousness to it um so i just want to like underscore that
and say i think any remnants of that being fully uprooted and cleared is necessary right like
there is no way forward as long as there is any remnants of that memetic complex right obviously
there is a remnants of it in our institutions and in our culture so how does the culture become free
of it and how does the institution become free of it this is now where my question is for you
in some ways there are issues that i'm focused on like how do we not all die from
advances in exponential tech in something like synthetic bio when we're doing super stupid
shit like viral hunting and gain of function research and leaky laboratories where you can
make super nasty pandemic weapons and release them everywhere but we don't need to actually get
everyone to understand that to solve it we need to get a fairly small number of people to understand
why that's a really terrible thing and create legislation the same thing with nuclear deterrence
we don't need to get everyone to understand the complexity of the game theory on the nuclear
deterrence well enough but on an issue that actually arises from culture right and then
it's institutionalized and where you as you're saying everyone can be prejudiced but they're not
all equally able of enacting those prejudices as systemic racism so those who are subjugated to
that need to figure out how to enact power in some other you know kind of way and then when
you're bringing up what the solution is that you just start with shit like the concept of
african is a problem right like even the word african-american we have to dissect that and we
have to go back to the history of race in ancient china didn't have these issues and why the papal
voles were an issue in Aristotle like what the fuck chance is there for that level of depth of
understanding needed to unwind the fact that even the words have embedded wrong concepts right even
the term african-american or whatever have embedded wrong concepts and that we don't need a few people
to get it to right to do regulation we need widespread people getting it in the presence
of vested interests continuing to feed them bullshit and in the presence of their own motivated
reasoning around it like it actually seems more complicated what how is it how is there a way
forward there's a level at which it's very complicated i'm i'm i'm very sensitive to
the choice of language because a language carries within it in the caribbean we have the belief that
that the the words of your mother carry a spirit in them and and people say things like
you'd better hope your mother does not speak you know ill over you over your life so to speak
and because we know from pediatric neuropsychology that when a child is bombarded with a certain
framing of its essence it takes that it takes that to heart and in many respects if it's reinforced
in the society you do a lot of work it's our friend Tristan Harris does on the limbic colonialism
which social media engages and so we've seen real-time demonstrations of this power
of framing issues and using words and that's the thing when we use the wrong term we're not
using words we're creating a conceptual framework and that framework is one that can influence
people's self-conception and their perception of of of the world and what is society but some
place where we try to align the best frameworks in order that everyone would assume for themselves
that that they can make the best of themselves in that in that social setting i don't think however
that i think why we have to work on all these things at the same time i don't think we can
and we get the nomenclature right first i don't think we can correct the school problem first
i don't think we can do many of these things i think we have to do all these things at the same
time if a if a if a group of people
dr king asks a question
are you are you seeking to change society or do you merely want a piece of the pie
so and this this has the notion of the export of harm at at the the back end of it so that's just to
say if if i'm a let's say i'm a black person who believes that the society in america has done me
wrong and i demand uh to be integrated into society to get the job at aching dump if i'm a
lawyer to get the job at bullman sacks uh if i'm a banker to get tenure at harvard if i'm a professor
am i not simply asking to be let in to the very system that is in some senses recuperate in the
sense that it never repented never reflected never really reassessed itself it just decided
to let me into the same thinking paradigm that had me enslaved and is now exporting that harm
elsewhere perhaps in ways that we cannot see and so the i asked this question in a book that i wrote
called the tryptic papers and epistemologies of displacement the displaced individual exists
and the question is whether he or she looks in his displaced situation for a way to renew the
society or is he looking out beyond his situation into the dominant culture which has refused him
and seeking a way to enter that dominant culture but if he does right it implies that there will
be no reform of the culture since he enters the culture on its own terms and may in some ways
carve out unique spaces and niches for himself but those niches don't have the skill
to be able to change the culture in a way that's beneficial for everyone
so when uh one of the things i've told my students is don't own don't own atrocities
don't own uh prejudice or or rather racism don't own uh these terrible things which may
have happened to you you cannot say that we as a people are fully susceptible to these things
absolutely and forever it's just you know that you can't make that argument what you can say
is in this period with this overton window with this degree of self-understanding at this stage
in history with this political structure with these power relations and verticals power
it prioritizes this sort of engagement with me or this sort of framing of my humanity
now dr king's question if i want to change the culture or i could go with malchamex here right
the first thing you need is an active integrity that's what malchamex said when you want to change
a culture we need first an active integrity the blacks and many whites who supported them
in the antebellum period who became state senators and lawyers and physicians and so on
that was an act of integrity aimed at changing a culture it's just that they were overwhelmed by
greater forces which they could not control so it seems to me that if we're going to be practical
the first practical thing is to is for the blacks of america and perhaps almost everywhere around
the world have to ask themselves are we a community for the purposes of our development
and the defense not just of our humanity but of human value that will be an act of integrity
because and and this is not a christian proposition it's not a christian proposition
um in every wisdom text whether it's the pedantic scriptures or it's the works of confucius or
wherever have you you see this paradigm shaping up those who have been displaced have an obligation
to both mitigate their situation and then to move forward out of that mitigation
not with vindictiveness or revenge because it actually destroys the active integrity which was
exercised instead you have to reconceive the culture that is the obligation and it's a very
difficult obligation and you probably will not live to see it come to fruition but that is the
challenge and that's the human situation and i've tried in my my in the best way not to to
paint it to use a cliche with rose to rose colored glasses it's a great struggle and people have
sacrificed both blacks and whites for the defense of human value in this way which currently does
not define uh the dominant culture so having understood that and seeking an act of integrity
and i won't say here that i have the absolute solution i will say that if the attitude is such
as the one that i'm describing where you mitigate uh uh the atrocities committed against you
by being wise by being sensible so is there is there voter suppression yes
but then take it as an opportunity for everyone to get ids that's actually not a bad thing
that's a very good thing in fact if you exercise yourself on that you can be the first to integrate
digital ids among among black people that's a that's a good thing and that drives into a future
towards which we are headed if we say that uh well you know blacks cannot succeed in
this school or that school then come to the black universities and the society has a problem finding
600 000 persons to fill technical jobs make the degree six years uh as in science bow in
france or uh french law degree and build the basis and the foundation of an excellent education
tomasoul draws this i'm all over the place at the moment but tomasoul draws this distinction
the blacks the american blacks in russia who uh were there after the second world war
remained there after the second world war in japan and germany
perform in education at the same level of their japanese russian and german counterparts
the literature shows it explicitly so in formulating this drive towards this active integrity
black americans actually have something to look at they have they have an example to look at in three
cases where people of their own uh history tradition and culture are succeeding in ways that they're not
succeeding in america the answer to that is not to ask what is america doing to me but how can i
mitigate my situation in fact reflect the success that those people are showing in those places
those places find out what they're doing and replicate that but who is going to initiate this
and how will it be initiated at scale all right in order to uh to somehow impact the culture
that is the question so i'm sorry daniel there's no easy answer no no and i know you know that
there's no easy answer and there's no no one thing that can be done we have to promote the idea
of the mitigation of atrocity and that's not blaming the victim in every area of law if you
if you read law and you understand and i'm not just talking about jurisprudence and constitutional
theory i'm talking about basic everyday law of tort law of contract you are called upon to mitigate
the law of insurance you are called upon to mitigate someone burns your house down you saw
them burning your house down and you come upon the house it's half burnt down and you stood there
and said that someone burnt it down you did nothing all right you're penalized for that
and so this principle of mitigation has to be something that in the parlance of today's
today's cultural narratives we must normalize and and then this active integrity is another
element understanding that we are having asymmetric conversations that's another element
and then building leverage for blacks those blacks who are committed building leverage for them
you have the nba players you have these celebrities you have the the wealthy black businesses you have
large numbers broad cross section of black middle class people can an appeal be made to them in any
way that is not prejudicial against whites or so's enmity against the dominant culture but
just to say in our house we are taking care of those things which are priorities to us but having
built the house we invite you so in our conversation i made it very clear the historically black
university should not try to be exclusively black in fact if they are going to do what's necessary
to revolutionize the culture and treat an evolution in self-conception towards human value
then the thing they would do is say this is a place that's predominantly black in which our
white brothers and sisters can achieve their full potential and if enough of that is happening the
society itself has made itself so sick that these places become repositories of human value
that have their own attractive power now that may sound like a whole speech idealism but i'm afraid
that in the circumstances it's a choice between that and nihilism i think it's that narrow it's
choice between that and nihilism and um president bush the father had this phrase which i enjoy so
much it didn't mean anything but he said it i think it was written by Peggy Nuno who has a way
with a turn of phrase and it's a thousand points of light that's the solution a thousand points of
light right and if any social efforts that we were thinking to undertake to address the problem
of the power structure of racism i think this thousand points of light approach would be the
approach and i do know that people like Mark Eckert and Greg Thomas and some of the others
are doing a lot of that work already in a wide variety of communities there were people like
marva columns the teacher in chicago who took people in with no particular system taking
grandmothers and three-year-olds and somehow got everybody into university what is that an active
integrity an active integrity that was a mitigation against the situation the forces that were
arrayed against her and so if the dominant society wants to understand how is spending all this money
on children who are not going to university and marva columns can take over a warehouse and teach
three-year-olds and grandmothers and get them into university obviously our resource allocation and
all the efficiency propositions that we brag about they they don't work and so in this case
from the displaced environment comes a new epistemology capable of renewing the culture
the dominant culture uh to me that is the cycle and we have to somehow ignite that cycle
there's so many questions that i want to ask regarding the real politic assessment of what
it actually takes to do the thing since the ethics is usually considerations of cemetery but the
ability for enactment is usually considerations of power and the bunch that i want to get into but
in lieu of time i want to get to questions uh i'll i'll paraphrase what you've said overall
because i think what you're saying so mirrors what i end up saying talking about metacrisis
there's not a theory of change because there's not one cause of the problem
there's and there's not even one problem right there's many different aspects of problems there's
many elements of it so there's an ecology of theories of chains that are needed trying to
get too reductive to what the solution is and even too reductive in the problem framing is
then where people get polarized on the thing and so this is when you're saying you know a thousand
points of light there's an ecology of theories of change and there's this dialectical principle
throughout everything you're saying which is don't generate enmity in the dominant culture
while seeking to change the dominant culture um seek to change it don't you seek to get a piece
of the pie and don't you seek to have your own segregated thing but don't create enmity with
a thing that currently has more enactment power than you have it's it's not an answer it's a it's
a set of considerations to hold and similarly when you talked about what should be done in
education you were saying don't just say man of their time because that's nonsense and yet i've
also heard you say at other times don't throw jefferson out as purely evil you have to hold
was a great man but not a good man so what i'm hearing you say is in education share the authentic
complexity don't share a weaponized uh a sided version that then has other people say you left
out something critical and then they hold another side try to share an adequate complexity of the
thing so people don't reduce it to something that then polarizes and um it seems like what you're
saying overall is it's complex how do we educate people into the authentic complexity and how do
we generate solutions that deal with the authentic complexity and it is the reductive process itself
that ends up leading to a lot of the intractable problems so i really appreciate that i wanted
to ask when it came to questions um seems appropriate people in the audience who are here
who happen to be people of color if you have any questions or thoughts first i wanted to offer
priority to that and then see if anybody else does in remaining time
i have a question um it's more along the lines of like sense making and communicating that
synthesis because i worked in a space where i was helping um black founders get funding some
venture capital and i came across a lot of the underlying issues of why certain founders have
barriers and you know the education system etc like why we have less founders of color in the
pipeline and in the whole culture of polarization and people picking one side is just so difficult
to communicate truth without giving um a point to the other side like one example is um absent
fathers like that's something that has been proven to have a negative impact on someone's life and
then their economic outcomes etc so it's like how do we best communicate the truth of like what are
real barriers that are impacting black people today without giving a point to like oh this is why
racism exists or this is why like the culture is inherently bad in producing good people that
are contributing to society like i have found that very difficult um and doing the work
yes i i i can emphasize with that i was uh a private diplomat to the swiss private bankers
association and if you want to see superiority you need only spend some time around uh
swiss private bankers and you'll have a clear picture of how they see themselves and do try
to understand it wasn't superiority against me it's a superiority against everybody particularly
the french and uh so one has to one has always when when you're in this kind of frame you are
asking yourself all the time whether it's racism should you be hurt by it right it's probably always
unfamiliarity and that you're not part of a tribe and that you're not trusted in some
way to act in the manner in which they act and this is a very difficult thing so that
is a kind of cultural expectation which people have in those kinds of circumstances when it
comes to the bc's there are all sorts of systems one of the things i'm somewhat known for is a
theory of sovereign funds and a new principle of citizen equity and that is that the the Lockean
and uh all the Hobbesian uh constructs um of political science even down to John Rawls for whom
i have some sympathy at least his thought experiment in a series of justice um but the
idea of the passage citizen who merely and what what you have is this problem and it's relevant
really in the transition from active monarchies with actual political power to parliaments and
congresses and so on the power the vertical of power didn't really change that much so that
effectively we've been constantly electing monarchs and one of the ways in which that is true
is the notion of government ownership because if the theory is correct democratic theory even
John Locke's very sloppy theory in the two treaties on government it means that government
doesn't own anything the citizen owns and the government manages for the sake of the citizen
and you know Estonia has just made this a principle of their constitution
that they are not the rulers of Estonia right they are providing government as a service to the
citizen now i add to that an economic component that says the resources of the country belong to
current and future generations and therefore is the obligation of government to create a structure
to allow people to realize the benefits of those resources and the preservation of a share of
those resources moving forward for future generations it seems to me that given everything
from automation uh to the wealth gap which affects more whites than blacks uh uh to the
loss of belief there one of the things i see across the world it's not a question of whether
people are conservative or liberal or people have lost the capacity to believe in government
it seems to me almost everywhere so if you took the Estonia principle of government as a service
and you added to it the idea that citizens are not passive in terms of the economics of their
societies and in fact there ought to be something called citizen equity all right by which citizens
have some direct measure of control or some direct engagement with the economic resources of their
societies and and and and have to actively engage in preserving some of that value for future generations
this produces a more responsible citizen but there's no impediment for blacks or any group of
people beginning to enact this kind of economic model right now you you have all the all the
financial architecture all of the various structures are available from churches to social
organization to community groups to black colleges however you wish to see them the tools
the the financial tools and the structures are available to create a situation where and and let's
imagine that it's created blacks create this for themselves if you have no enmity towards the dominant
culture and you're open to them on the basis that they ought to have been open to you in the first
instance according to their their primary principles then it creates this new momentum
in the social order that that this is what dr king was aiming at with the poor people's march on
washington he saw almost in an epiphany way that are i can advocate for blacks but i'm actually
doing blacks a disservice because blacks have to live in a world with whites and they have to
integrate with each other on police forces as teachers on school boards and these sorts of
things in various neighborhoods but the truth of the matter is that the dominant society is
prejudiced against these poor whites as they are against the blacks now how do we get them to see
that well again this act of integrity right where you use the two and this mitigation where you use
the tools to create this new paradigm a paradigm that is open and that invites all who believe in
these principles and the principles of citizen equity human value and government as a service
to the people that's a completely that's the 1872 republican manifesto that's what that is
which fulfills the decoration of independence more readily than any manifesto in the history of the
united states and so you know we i don't think i do think that many of the so-called black leaders
have really been kind of racial entrepreneurs in some way and they have operated in this space
where the asymmetric conversation they have found niches in that asymmetric conversation that benefited
them and the people who accorded with them for an economic gain and that we don't want to say that
they are thieves and you know hate mongeros that's not what we're saying we're just defining
the model that they have used and we're saying that's the wrong model this estonia model of
government as a service breaks the whole of the old monocle imperative about government as
somehow being dominant and the owners of the country so to speak and it becomes a rousseau in
democracy such as you have to a limited degree in switzerland probably the the most decentralized
country in the history of the world and blacks can achieve that now and you don't have to wait
for everybody to get on board there'll be any number large number of whites and other groups
that would cotton to this kind of thinking because it's not socialism which i know is a bad word in
america it's not socialism right it's not your typical rapacious capitalism that's based on extraction
and the destruction of human value so it's not neoliberalism all right it's not mixed government
it's actually on the principle of personal responsibility if government is a service to the
citizen then you've maximized personal responsibility in that paradigm if the citizen has equity and
has already a responsibility to preserve some of that equity for future generations you already
have the economic discipline that militates against the kind of greed that we have seen
you see and so if we were able to somehow uh map out such a model it seems to me that we have a
message then to send and then it would be a point of connecting to those thousand points of light
and then generating the overton window which drives that message and reforms societies such as we
have been discussing gen i will um offer a short additional answer and gilbert was uh going into
the economics since you were talking about working in venture capital and being able to
you know provide economics to people doing startup projects and i think one of the major
conflict theories the world looks at today is racial conflict one of the other deepest conflict
theories is economic basis of conflict so obviously looking at economic self-determination of groups
it makes a lot of sense why there's so much focus there um but i also heard you ask them a medic
question which is how do you acknowledge yes there are a lot of black children who are growing up
without fathers in their home without conceding a point to racist see they cause their own problems
um and so i want to offer something to the communication because i heard of a medic question
and i would say there are two things that i'll offer one is the question itself is really important
which is how do i communicate to whoever i'm communicating to while being cognizant of who
is not my intended audience and what they do with that message it is mind blowing to me
how bad we are currently at paying attention to the effect of our message on our on whoever isn't
our intended audience right and so we don't pay attention to the polarization and blowback of
and to a large degree it's because of the actual structure of the political process and voting
it's why people like larry less they really want to rank choice voting is because it would
disincentivize polarizing the other side against you currently there's only an incentive to get
your support base to support you and otherizing the fuck out of the other side is fine and but
of course if you want to succeed in anything you don't want to engender a very large percentage
of the world to hate what you're doing and so the general principle for everyone communicating
about everything to say okay who's my intended audience marketing 101 what am i saying to them
what am i trying to do but also who else is going to hear this how are they going to respond
because they're political actors and they're going to do stuff so how do i make sure i'm paying
attention to how everybody's going to hear it i so wish everyone thought about that a lot more
to avoid blowback and polarization on the particular topic of fathers
the that one seems so straightforward to me there's many elements that just to start with
if when someone looks at the reconstruction period where black communities were becoming wealthy
black people were becoming doctors and lawyers and senators and etc
you had successful synch monogamous marriages where the fathers were in the home right
and what there's nothing about black genes that couldn't do that they did that so we're like okay
what happened and when you look at the total amount of rape that happened during slavery
and then following slavery and the fact that the men could not actually protect their wives from it
and that in the even the period following slavery where you had all of these bullshit
reasons to arrest black guys and put them in jail forever for for really things that had no basis
and reasonable due process for jurisprudence for vagrant for loitering for whatever so so
white people and even white police officers could harass fondle rape whatever white women and the
men were completely emasculated can you spend 400 years emasculating the fuck out of men of a
particular type and not have that have an effect on how they know how to be a man you know so it's
like yes there's a fucking problem in the black community with fathers but there's a reason there's
a problem and the reason is not because black people just suck at being fathers right like
there's an actual historical reason so when you communicate about it that's the other part of the
story you have to communicate there's a there are a couple of things there I draw on what you've
said Daniel quite effectively and I apologize I didn't I left that part of your your answer unattended
um the the the thing I would say is this I always like to ask under what conditions
that people do what they did so not only did uh in the antebellum period that people become blacks
become physicians and uh lawyers and mortuary scientists dentists dentistry was a very very
very big one and insurance uh was another uh a big area but state senators school boards all
these kinds of things and all over the growth point in Detroit rose would we know about Tulsa
also but uh you know people forget about north and south carolina these were places where people
people had developed interesting and powerful societies um uh washington dc another place
where people had developed these really amazing successful societies with good families and good
jobs and these sorts of things and if you think about this period Daniel this is when the lynching
paradigm took place so if you had a father a brother a son a husband right an uncle a grandfather
women were hiding their men the black culture so so if you go from Eugene Genovesi's analysis of
the plantation system in which enslaved men ceased living in the same compounds with their
wives or their their their their female counterparts because if the the enslaver knew
that you had uh affection for someone they could use that as leverage against you
and they could come and rape and punish you and and and draw on your emotions but terrifying
violence which is exercised again and again and again you can read Philip Curtin the plantation
system all these wonderful books uh which lay this out for us uh uh David Byron Davis uh also
and others so if you if you think about that the circumstances under which during the antebellum
period these families were established means that those people had a high inclination
disposition and propensity towards family even after coming out of the plantation system
where they were separate from their families right so somehow they had maintained the ideal
and they kept that ideal in treacherous circumstances so after 1879 and the compromise
made by President Grant that removed the northern army uh from the south New Orleans was the site of
the first massacre all right and then Jim Crow came in uh after that in in the lead up to the
first world war so so here you are you've come out of enslavement right you haven't asked for anything
you built a bootstrap so you can build yourself up by a bootstrap all right and so you've done that
so you are an instantiation of the highest performance of the American ideal all right
and what is the response to that slaughter you know mayhem misery
and you come to a compromise and and and the 1872 shows when the the Lincoln Republicans
were in the position to enact the true values of the Declaration of Independence
America showed that she preferred not to have that and that was defeated right and then incomes Jim
Crow so now you're suffering that and as Daniel said both men and women black and white believe
two things about men here to be a protector and the provider and black men in the situation
could do neither and this is where and at the same time you were fully emasculated not only that
a white sheriff could walk up to you on a Sunday morning where you're walking with your wife and
your children going to church and could harass or funnel your wife and there's nothing you could do
and imagine a man standing there feeling all the sinews of himself and wanting to defend
his his wife and his family and she's telling him don't do it this is this is what we have to get
the teeming quotidian misery of this situation now if you understand that and then you go into
the lynching paradigm this further emasculates the male because now he's the he's the hunted
the protected the infantilized all right this this is not french theory this is what happened
all right and out of that leading up to the first world war there's a fear that blacks
will not come forward and fight wb du bois and the crisis magazine writes an essay called close
ranks and what he is why does he say that well he says that because of the despondency and the
nihilism that had taken over the black community he was saying listen wake up let's go to this war
and show we're not going to this war to win the war that's not our primary purpose our primary
purpose is to demonstrate a patriotism to those who do not want us and will abuse us and see us
dead close ranks with them and let us demonstrate because they cannot be so psychologically
uh infected with racism that they will see us go to die for a country that has treated us this way
and upon our return they will not accept us if not as heroes at least as equally patriotic to them
I haven't seen very many works that for all the studies of trauma and so on and I read them
incessantly I haven't seen very many works on the trauma of this period of people going through
this kind of thing Ralph Ellison however writes a novel in which he depicts the condition of a man
who has gone through this and that's why it's called invisible man I am invisible to the society
right and so this is why Dubois says I ever feel my tuness I'm a human being and a black man
and and I can add to that a Foucaultian although some certain British friends of mine will never
forgive me for mentioning it but Foucault advances concept of the panopticon if you are black in a
lynching paradigm you live in a panopticon if you are black in a paradigm where groups of men get
together at night and come into a house and chase a black man out and then hunt him in the woods
with dogs you live in a panopticon of terror that's where you live blacks cannot nurse this pain
this is the problem it cannot nurse this pain this is the mitigation part and Dubois was seeking a
way for both mitigation and an act of integrity an act of integrity which could not be demanded by
whites an act of integrity which could not be expected by any reasonable psychology an act of
integrity that was so profound and so astonishing that blacks followed Dubois went to war performed
magnificently in the war with acts of bravery only to return home to be lynched in their uniform and
so in a sense Dubois himself moved to Ghana convinced of the idea okay I get it you you you
really don't want me you don't believe in your principles and values and even when you have
breached your values I don't ask you to repent you don't ask me for forgiveness you continue
abusing me and putting my life in danger reducing me to less than human and so I say I will take the
extraordinary step of behaving in such a way that no human mind can deny either their culpability
and my grace and yet both are denied both we're talking about fathers in the first world of war
the men went to war the women went into the factories black women when the men came home
the women left the factories thinking that their husbands would get the jobs such was the
social order at the time but the men did not get the jobs
they did not get the jobs when the second world war came around
the mothers of those women said you will get a job but now you will not make room for this man
and Orlando Patterson the brother of the or cousin of the former prime minister of Jamaica
PJ Patterson says sociologist at Harvard wrote a book called blood of our sons
I disagree the thesis of the book but he lays this out in some measure and so
when you're struggling against all of that let us come down to today there is a gentleman
who is on youtube he gave a TED talk and he says uh if I go into a radio station or I go into a
music um you know someone who commercializes music and say I want to talk about Jewish people
and I want to talk about killing them and uh them killing each other and so on they would throw me
out of the building okay I want to come and talk about uh uh white women and shooting them and
killing them and naming them and so on and that this is part of my manhood they will be shown
at the door there was an interview with someone who presumes to call himself charlamagne the god
as if char charles the magnificent wasn't enough um but he gave an interview with a gentleman who
is a radio a music executive and asked him why do you keep giving people these formulaic songs
about black young men about killing each other all right and about having what they call beef
with each other that's kind of the the sort of thing and I'm not saying that all rap music is
bad I'm not condemning an entire genre uh I'm saying that this is a particularly pernicious
aspect of this genre and I defy anybody to tell me how you can find beauty in self abnegation
I I don't know how one can find beauty in that and he his answer on live television was
I have people to feed we have to eat and there's a market for that kind of music
so again when young men
are being socialized by that and then you add to that that tracery of history that we've just
gone through how are you going to have fatherhood how is fatherhood going to be a priority
when baby mamas and multiple baby mamas and when you can refer to a human being
who has been with you to produce a child and I'm not saying you have to speak of them in
sanctified tones I'm merely saying again this language this categorization right is a categorization
that denudes the human person of human value right it does not bear bringing its train
affection it does not bring in its train obligation it does not bring in its train
responsibility of any kind and so if if if people are living in those circumstances
and find themselves having to survive in those circumstances how are you going to prioritize
fatherhood family the sort of psychological resources necessary to live within a family
context to deny yourself to sacrifice yourself for the immediate others who depend upon you
to keep your word to be of good conscience or light and to be of a sturdy and reflective spirit
how is that going to happen what is the context for that and so the cycle continues
and I used to tease some american friends of mine who taught with me at george mason university
that they they would talk about having bad fathers but I would they worship their fathers
despise their husbands and idealize their sons
and so that's the cycle that's the triangulation it will it will continue because your father
is doing what your husband is doing but it's immediate to you so that's a problem but the son
who is about to do it to another young woman he's idealized and all responsibility is removed
that's not something that's inherent in blacks that is a feature of a social circumstance and a
set of constructs and a history which has become asymmetrical to its potential solutions and that
has produced the world that we have today so it seems to me
I am glad that you answered that and I'm glad that you asked that question I think
the idea that nihilism makes hedonism an appropriate rational response I think that's
so deep for so many issues it's for this issue and consumerism and so many things
from from a like moral psychology perspective under nihilism hedonism makes sense from a
evolutionary theory perspective if I could get killed at any time
maximizing the chance of offspring in many places makes sense
and so it's it's interesting to think about that we are past time there's so many places
that I would like to go but Gregory Thomas is with us and he's also a scholar in
related topics and I'm really happy to see him here and I wondered if you had any
thoughts you wanted to share with us as we're wrapping up thank you so much Daniel and and
thank you Gilbert Professor Morris I that's mainly the spirit of my comment in gratitude
for what you shared I'd like to briefly not counterstate but provide some other narrative
approaches to the stories that we're telling because as we know in certain meta theories
integral meta theory for example that many things are true but partial so there's such depth of
truth and historical content that you shared that I certainly agree with at the same time
there are countervailing narratives that we can draw upon so for example not a period you've been
talking about of course going back to Aristotle but mainly 19th century through the early part of
the 20th century in the Jim Crow period there were certain dynamics many of those dynamics
continue so we could point to the the welfare system where there was a disincentive for the men
to be involved in the family because if you put together you know two incomes you reduce the social
support and network that's needed and so other other incentives against fatherhood so that's
another example however there are studies that show that even if they are not a husband in the home
that people racialize as black black men spend more time with their children than any other group
that's a whole other narrative but it's also some empirical research behind that but I'm going to go
off this to give another something that I'm very familiar with a tradition that probably started
at the turn of the century but you can really gather steam from the 20s through the 70s through the
work of Elaine Locke for example you mentioned Du Bois Elaine Locke is a very important part of
this story Zora Neale Hurston Ralph Ellison who you mentioned Albert Murray there is a
perspective on our history that is not just focusing on how much we were screwed over and the
devastating impact of that which is true but what we were able to achieve in spite of that
yes how do you have a people to create through cultural forms music and other forms that totally
influenced the music around the world right one of the things that Ralph Ellison talks about and
this is not something that people highlight about Ellison's work is that he makes it clear
that if you are able to get people to dance to your rhythms to play music that's based on the blues
which is the foundation of American music if you're able to go from a march orientation where
you are told what to do on the one and three but based on music on the two and the four and give
people around the world tapping to that and dancing to that that you have actually impose
your values on the society so then you have a book like this African founders how enslaved people
expanded American ideals by David Hackett Fisher that talks about how in different regions of this
nation black americans influence the concept of freedom and the very culture we live in
so in spite of all that we've gone through we've had a profound impact on the culture of the
united states and the culture of the world so i'll just leave with this there's another book that
i would like to mention culture of growth the origins of the modern economy by Joel Mocher
economic historian he talks about cultural entrepreneurs you mentioned racial entrepreneurs
and yes professor morris there have been many who have gotten their little niches
through being entrepreneurs of racism race anti-racism but there are also social entrepreneurs
cultural entrepreneurs i consider myself one you know those and i appreciate you mentioning me before
who will be in the marketplace of ideas and will actually be entrepreneurs of certain epistemological
frameworks ontological frameworks that can influence the discourse to use a focoan term
to influence the very discourse we're in and we're in a period of such political polarization
of such um chaos within social media and such that there's opportunity there
for people and many of you find this in the heterodox spaces you find it in the stores and the
rebel wisdoms you you find it in these different places you have an opportunity to actually be
entrepreneurs of not just ideas but certain collectives certain we spaces that you can develop
so that we can influence the larger culture and we don't need everybody to do this
the enlightenment didn't happen through the majority of people believing a certain
a set of people with particular ideas that didn't influence the course and development
of modernity itself the same thing can happen now and the last thing i want to say because you
obviously you've given me the the floor here and there's so much more i've been i've been
chomping at the bit to share so i'm uh you know i'm sorry if i'm taking so much time
but i really want to set up a conversation between you professor morris and daniel alan
harvard philosopher daniel alan who is one of the preeminent political philosophers of our time
when we talk about democratic theory she highlights the importance of ralph ellison as one of the
preeminent democratic theories of the 20th century in his work she also highlights in this
article um this this essay i have integration freedom and the affirmation of life dr martin
was the king as a key 20th century philosopher political philosopher but she is that so are you
i love the ideas that you've laid out and the framings we need to have people who are willing to
not be reticent to actually be entrepreneurs of ideas cultural entrepreneurs social entrepreneurs
and who will engage in dialogue with each other to create a vision space a possibility space
right from which people can then create forms institutions and such to actually affect change
and i would say we need a tipping point we need a critical mass we don't need everybody
we just need enough of us but certain level of consciousness and culture to do this together
and i'm speaking in very general terms and i have specifics to it and i see the the professor has
stepped off for a second but um i'll stop i'll stop there uh daniel what would you like to
take the floor since the professor oh
oh he went to get something
um
gilbert are you ready to respond yes um uh i i love everything that uh
that uh reg said and the to show you that uh we are on one accord in the last conversation
i spoke about alley and lock and i wrote a paper on alley and locks interest in
becoming a diplomat and and working for the mandate system which preceded the independence
movements and alley and lock uh he he he made the application but he didn't get the job he had
a young understudy named ralph bunch and ralph bunch went ahead and wrote about the mandate system
of the belgian congo and that was his phd thesis of harvard he then was given a job first in the
middle east and then all across africa but ralph um alley and lock influenced so by the time in 1945
second world war comes around definitely the united nations declaration the notion of the
committee of 24 came from ralph ellison's work inspired by by came from uh ralph bunch
inspired by alley and lock and i was writing that article in turks and cacos
which gained its international protectorate status along with caiman bvi and anguilla and
bermuda they came out of the construct set up by alley and lock so there's no question about the
influence of of blacks across the region many of the teachers the the the the principles of what
would then call the normal schools uh all over the south and these were parochial schools that
were set up in various communities and so on many of them ended up in the caribbean and then across
pollination happened many caribbean people during after the um after the first world
second world war ended up going into the united states and becoming teachers in new york and
north carolina and texas and florida and these sorts of places the point about the music um
is profoundly true and uh our your friend our mutual colleague the late stanley crouch
spoke about this in terms of blues and jazz and its cross cultural influence all over the world
coming from the caribbean we say the same thing absolutely about bob marley and bob marley's
influence across the world as well and so what we but when we these are all points of mitigation
these are all acts of integrity where the fulfillment of talent right because that's
another type of obligation human obligation beyond above apart from race you have the acculturation
of people existing within a particular social sphere that gives birth to something like blues
or jazz that's true but the talent in the execution of talent itself to the point of skill
that's a human trait and so that reinstates human value in a non-racial way in such a way that
a a count basie could live in the bahamas near a next door to a 10-year-old boy
and tell him stories about how what he would call they got down in the old days
by the time he was in a wheelchair and i used to push him along you were the 10-year-old boy
yes oh my god and so and so and so that influence was there but that influence did not exclude
whites right that's right this is what's amazing it did not exclude whites right because they were
there as musical arrangers as percussionists as managers as you know also as as as as uh
uh beneficiaries listeners to the music and so on so you had this influence that exceeded
the politics and the sociology of the dominant culture and so i i agree profoundly with that
and i think what you have said uh really um aligns well and drives what i have said in the sense
that i have said this is what needs to happen and you have said here are examples where it is
happening and has happened and i think you you you read through my book uh the triptych papers
if you remember at the back of the book i gave about six examples of the types of things people
are doing a nurse in nigeria who was not only it not only became a nurse but a nutritionist
and helped to build uh numbers of clinics community clinics and that kind of thing developed a
formula and went all over with that cami sterling a friend of mine in lafayette who started a
reading group teaching grand marvel columns was a hero so she taught uh these things uh reading to
even grandmothers in their 70s and 80s who'd never read in their lives all right so that work
is being done um and we all know and that work is cross-racial there are people of every
racial stripe that are doing that work and inspired by that work because that work operates
at the level of human value not racial uh priorities and so these are examples of precisely
what i think i've been trying to say so i do think uh thomas your remarks brings the entire
discussion full circle and so we have what needs to be done what is happening and what
more needs to be done and if i think if we operate on that principle and what needs to
happen now is groups of people in those thousand points of light have got to find a way to talk
to each other right the young technologists who studied with me um i they always they often
ask me about things and i said to them well listen why don't you make a living market
mechanisms are very important so why don't you make a list of those businesses which treat
their customers including blacks well and appropriately i never saw the point my father
trained me in this of going to a restaurant where you were not wanted going to tell where you
were not wanted and you know this uh dr king talks about this a little bit uh harry bellafonte
i had the incredible thing happen at george mason university
mernan jordan harry bellafonte and sydney poitier came to george mason uh university
um and my mother had always told me that i was beautiful but i don't think that i could win any
arguments on that night and um harry bellafonte said the same thing that you said that paul robson
told him sing your music sing your songs get them to sing your songs and when they are singing
your songs they have to ask you what dayo means what the tallyman means right and what daylight
comes and they won't go home what does that mean and now you're engaged in a conversation where
there's interest and feeling and you've already touched the emotions of that person and so the
disposition to conversation has been established and i do think that uh if somehow i resist movements
i'm not a movement person although i do think that people acting in their own spheres
who on occasion where necessary and the opportunity presents itself work in collaboration with each
other and if you can build systems that knit together informational platforms that allows
me to know what you're doing and others to know what we are doing then this is how you
integrate those points of light and achieve an overton window
so we are closing now as we are just past the two-hour mark and i think we had booked for 90
minutes so i'm grateful of everybody's time and attention and really enjoyed that last
uh conversation and greg if you can get gilbert and danielle allen to have a conversation and that
can have enough time uh that would be fantastic that would be a really really worth having
happen and being like well produced and distributed i will support that if i can um i really wanted
to thank peter for making the space for these for this and the previous one on the stowa because
thank you the racial conversations are so you know have been so culture worry and i think
the stowa has done such a good job of avoiding culture war and but rather than to avoid it here
to say how do we lean into where it's hottest in a way that heals it and so i would say like my hope
is and i don't know if it is the stowa's dharma to do this or not that but i hope that some
whether it's a stowa or other places um take the next step in this which is more voices
and uh longer periods maybe some structured agenda and longer periods to unpack the way forward
more and uh whoever takes the initiative to do that if i can help i will whether that is with
budget for production and helping to get the capital together or uh helping with sharing it
distribution networks um if uh peter or anyone feels cold to do that and i can help i'm here
to do so and peter do you have any thoughts you wanted to share before we close
it just uh really appreciative of of the session uh for you daniel for arranging it and having this
conversation for uh gilbert coming in and dropping so much wisdom today um greatly appreciated and
greg might be returning to the stowa for a secret session to continue these conversations
sometime in february next year so some of the stuff that you're gesturing towards daniel
might be happening so uh we'll definitely uh reach out please let me know ahead of time so i
can share it and get more people there and if like if there are things where more distribution
could happen but it takes somebody's manpower to do it and we need to pay for that or whatever
like i would love to help actually have it be as meaningful as it can be so yeah please let me know
we'll do and any parting closing thoughts for daniel or gilbert before i close up today's session
i i would like to say that the fact that people have come and stayed here all this time
i'm truly humbled by that i have to say and you know i i have a mentor morris glinton
who's one of the most brilliant barristers and every time i think i've caught him i knew i
met him when i was 11 and uh there was a period for about 20 years where i spoke to him every
night and i was always amazed that this great man would take so much time with a young boy and uh
um every time i think i've i've i've become i am the the paul who's called g Emilio or the timothy
who's called paul he does something very pauline and i realized that i still have a ways to go
and he said to me last week um he referred he calls me young prince and he says um
uh never mind that i'm you know 57 or 58 but he says uh young prince and he says
you've spent a lot of time analyzing the old
and you've spent a lot of time criticizing the old it is time to stop criticizing the old
and to inspire the young and to me um it seems to me that the spirit of this conversation the
spirit of the stowa is that much has happened in our past but nothing will happen in our future
that we don't have the right kinds of conversation that can inspire the young
and so i appreciate that and that is the spirit in which i participate here today
um yeah that's a beautiful way to end um thank you for that gilbert we would love to have you
uh back here at the stowa uh from all sessions um and daniel you're always welcome of course
and for more sessions you can go to the stowa uh dot ca we have one this saturday on uh
seeking enlightenment relationships and nervous systems that's called p.m uh eastern time so that
being said daniel gilbert everyone thank you so much for coming to stowa today cheerio come to the bahamas
