The Stoa is a digital campfire where we cohere in dialogue about what matters most at the
knife's edge of what's happening now.
All right, let's not get too crazy in here.
Welcome to the Stoa, everyone.
Peter Lindberg, the steward of the Stoa, a place where we cohere in dialogue about what
matters most at the knife's edge of this very moment.
Last session with Daniel Schmockenberger, sense maker in residence for October.
Digital porch.
We all sit on the digital colonnade and the porch and just chat and have a conversation
with Daniel.
So far it's been kind of like anything goes, but we're kind of refining the frame each
time.
So how today is going to work?
Throw your questions in the chats in a moment.
I'll tell you when.
And then I'll call on you.
You'll meet yourself.
Ask your question, Daniel.
If you don't want to be on YouTube, because this will be on YouTube, let me know that.
And I will return your behalf.
So Daniel's going to set the frame for today.
He mentioned it last time, but we're just going to repeat it again and then start throwing
your questions in the chat and we'll go from there.
So Daniel, I'll take you and my friend.
I think you can unmute yourself now.
Let's see.
You look like you're in like a mastermind boardroom and you just kind of like erased
all your, your formulas for, yeah, there you go.
All right.
Good to see everybody.
And I've enjoyed the three conversations we've had so far and this is the last one
of the series.
And yeah, the, you know, original inquiry was, could we address questions?
So I was happy to do questions of any type and it's just in clarifying that a bit.
It seems like the main interesting intersection of questions that happens to be possible here
in novel is not just asking about how do we solve world problems or just asking how do
we develop ourselves for personal developmental reasons, but at the intersection of the development
of ourselves in relationship to and service of what's going on in the world and what the
world needs.
So, you know, there's one that just asks the world question is like, well, how do we solve
multi-polar traps?
Let's take a specific example.
What would a good economic solution be?
But people have asked questions in here more like, how do I learn more about the kinds
of game-theoretic considerations to navigate multi-polar traps without being corrupted
by it internally?
It's like a development in the presence of world dynamics.
So I think the, I think the intersection of those questions is really fascinating.
I like I care about both of those spaces independently, but particularly the intersection
of minutes seems like the stove is uniquely well suited for that.
So just clarifying questions about and personal development means the development of the person,
not just what seems like psychological well-being, but cognitive development, skill development,
network development, whatever.
So yeah, I'm interested in people's questions and inquiries in that space in particular.
So boom, start throwing your questions in the chat right now, you know, take a breather,
maybe settle in and then people just bombarding questions already and just kind of feel into
it and I'll take someone in a moment.
Let's see if I can start off with a question related to the stoa and personal development
and my personal development regarding that.
I'm finding all the challenges coming up here is really serving as like a force, forcing
function to practice my stoicism and becoming more virtuous, which is quite cool.
I didn't really expect that.
And one challenge or theme that has come up and I feel like it's going to come up more
and we talked about it before on what's that is kind of unhealthy parasocial relationships
and how people can start getting fixated on you because you're in broadcast mode and
whatnot and I wrote this entry on kind of culture and that kind of hit I put like some
people secretly want a cult and they want to project things on you and I wonder how
you deal with that because all to say this, this session in particular, these series has
the most people reaching out to me requesting things like, oh, you should do this, you should
do this, you should do this because, you know, you were pretty popular and then your YouTube
videos, at least on the stoa, have more than most people.
And so I wonder how you deal with it personally and if you have any advice for me or other
people at the stoa who are increasingly becoming a more public figure and want to do good in
the world at the same time.
This might not be obvious to everyone since I've done quite a lot of speaking publicly
on podcasts and various things, but I've never liked public speaking, actually, particularly
don't like attention on me as a person and so I just avoided it for a very long time
and tried to work through channels of influence that were less public and I was particularly
bothered by when people would focus on me like even this question as opposed to focusing
on the topics that I was interested in and there's actually a certain point at which
I just had to accept that that's going to happen to a certain degree and not be too
bothered by it if sharing publicly is useful and, you know, both work to encourage people
to focus on the topics rather than personas but also not let the aversion to that get
in the way of sharing things that can be useful.
I think if someone is coming from the other place of having kind of desire for it more
than aversion there's slightly different things to work with.
I will say if there's anyone who is kind of excited to share things and be well known
for them, it's just less fun than you might think it is to have lots of people in a position
to either have hope attached to you that you have no ability to really do anything about
and then other people be able to straw man you that you can't address all of those things
like, yeah, I wouldn't say that's a particularly fun thing.
The other thing I'd say is the degree to which somebody actually cares about anything, right?
They have some basis of values and integrity.
The more incongruity is painful and so then also the more reflective they are and notice
the incongruity, the more kind of intolerable it becomes.
So Peter, when you were saying as you're here sharing these things, you actually feel kind
of an impulse to practice and embody the things that you believe more because you're holding
the space for other people to do it.
I think that's actually one of the cool opportunities.
There's this perspective that says heal or heal thyself like get your own shit straight
before helping anyone else and there's truth to that.
But there's also truth to in the process of helping other people, there's a kind of learning
that happens in sharing and facilitating and teaching that is different than the learning
that happens just on the other side of it.
Pedagogically the whole learn-do-teach model as part of learning is very interesting.
I've noticed a lot of people who became therapists actually became therapists because at least
in part as they were helping other people develop psychologically, they were gaining
continuous like instantiated nuanced insights about the nature of the psychology and other
people and it really helped them in their own reflection and growth.
So that's interesting.
How do you relate with impression management and like doing good in the world in a broadcast
medium where you're sort of like there's an avatar of you gets created in the spectacle.
How do you relate to that avatar because I know you seem very careful about what you
say and you want to know your audience in case any kind of information hazard kind of
gets unleashed or something like that.
So I'm curious how you relate to your own impression in the spectacle.
In a way obviously that kind of informs me and other people who are putting themselves
out there.
Yeah, I mean if you have a clear sense of why you're sharing something publicly, you have
a sense of what the positive opportunity associated that you care about is, you know there's kind
of a swat.
There's a there's some threat or liability associated with the opportunity and you just
think through that and so for instance talking about catastrophic risks because you mentioned
information hazard.
If people don't understand the reality of catastrophic risks and there aren't enough people who care
to work on hopefully solving it so there's benefit to try to help more people understand
how eminent catastrophic risk possibilities are.
And yet if you get so detailed that you start saying okay, let me give you examples of very
specific types of terrorist attacks that are possible and specific fragilities and supply
chains you're actually helping a lot of people who don't understand how to cause problems
understand how to cause problems more with that research or there's a direct info hazard
so it would have the benefit of motivating some people would also have a risk associated
so there's definitely responsibility in considering those things.
And typically like there are some people whose work is as a public intellectual where their
public sharing is the main method of contribution.
But I think more often what's effective is that people have projects that they're working
on to try to benefit things and the public sharing is is adjacent or you know facilitating
something associated with that.
I don't think I would think doing this is very useful by itself like it's not hopefully
it's not totally useless.
But there's a lot of people who I work with right now in projects who I found through
these mediums right there was putting some information out and it served as a kind of
bat signal or a tractor dynamic they're very useful to projects that have theory of change
that I really believe in.
And then to the degree we want to actually launch projects that need some public traction
having groups of people that are in similar conversations that weren't happening that
get to be a place to advance certain kinds of cultural projects and movements is useful.
So I have to think about the public sharing as part of usually more integrated strategies.
Thank you.
So I'll start searching for some questions that are at that intersection but beneath
the Roy privately message me a question that's your secret technique to get me to choose
here.
Bonita.
I really like your question if you can unmute yourself and ask it to Daniel Daniel.
Oh, let me get this.
Hi Daniel.
Yeah so you know I want to know like like who are your mentors that's kind of like elders
from you to elders but also like who are the young people that you think are emerging
like you know like like they're not there yet so you're not going to maybe advocate
for their whole their whole view but like where where do you see something emerging that
seems like something possible that hasn't been possible before like like in what fields
or what individuals and and again like these are half-born thoughts right if you're looking
at young people or these areas and then you just I'm going to throw this on this because
you said you're looking at people who have interesting theories of change and I was just
wondering who they were.
Thank you.
Yeah mentors I feel like I've always been fortunate to find and be able to interact with really
good mentors and there's so many topics that I know are really consequential that I'm interested
in that I don't have really deep expertise in and one of my fastest ways to try to get
enough of a sense that I can navigate it hopefully competently is to find experts in
the space that I think are earnest and really care and particularly find multiple of them
that disagree on critical things and so then I'll reach out to them and really try to understand
have them guide me through the basic understanding of the topic and what they think are the foundational
how they're forecasting it those types of things and then also and why the field is consequential
what they think is important that everybody's getting wrong you know those types of things
and then where people that I think are earnest and smart good thinkers who've spent 1020 3040
years working on a topic and I'm just not going to be able to catch up with that where
they disagree and is it because they're looking at different data because they're coming in
with different epistemologies because they're waiting the data differently using different
models and if if I can understand where they agree what is seen as common knowledge where
they disagree and why then I start to feel like I'm getting some sense of how to navigate it
then I want to see what would it take to bring about agreement right bring about conciliance
so I have like I actively seek out people who I think have good expertise in areas of history
and various sciences social sciences whatever and have been fortunate to have a lot of them
willing to spend a good bit of time like educating me I just got off the phone with someone that
everybody here probably knows Jim rut and he is you know providing ongoing advice from a kind of
CEO coaching point of view to what we're doing with conciliance project and we have a we have
a bunch of really great advisors that are providing advice and everything from technical to
communications to brand strategy to the experience of what makes a good online forum in terms of
the digital architectures and moderation and things like that I was just on a great call
yesterday with a kind of Gilbert Morris who should come on here at some point who I think has
one of the more novel and really nuanced perspectives on the history of race and slavery
and the situation in the US and kind of a third poll that is neither the pro or anti-critical
race theory that that I think could actually further and so I've been you know kind of
diving deep with a bunch of people he's one of them to understand those issues more from
really different perspectives perspectives of people who grew up in Africa who grew up in the
Caribbean who grew up in you know US and Europe and studied it from different perspectives so mentors
a lot and I don't require that I agree with everything to take someone as a mentor and I
also don't require that I agree that I would take them as a mentor in all spaces to take them as a
mentor in a space I think when we're young being able to get holistic mentors that are more like
parents is easier as we go on you know being able to find someone that you can really take their
expertise in the domain and not reject it because you really disagree with them in some other space
is important in terms of what seems promising in terms of younger people
it's interesting to watch like the way the rationalist community started to have very
very informed high-quality conversations where the people were were actually quite well self-educated
and were thinking about epistemology and formal logic and good faith dialogue and then where they
actually started to get to the limits of pure rationality and starting to think about symbol
grounding issues so then they started like circling and getting into different aspects of
other intelligences I think that's kind of interesting and I think there are some people who
like we focus on the downside of being a digital native and growing up in a digital environment
where you get false intuition you don't get an intuition that is kind of conditioned on physics
but on somebody's manufactured physics that's true and that's the more widespread thing but
there's some subset of digital natives that got kind of very epistemically oriented who
are just fucking amazing at online research and specifically the open source intelligence field
they're really exceptional at being able to do scrubbing of large amounts of data and image
recognition and things like that and that starts to offer some way to counter the asymmetric info
warfare that are out there so I find that very interesting seeing things like what Aubrey Tang
and friends in Taiwan are doing with digital democracy and how to kind of counteract misinformation
and do better sense making participatory governance I think that's quite interesting
so I think there's a number of emerging spaces that that I appreciate and some of them are very
different if you take kind of the you know ausent space and then you take the like permaculture
intersects with psychedelic space there's some intersections those are quite different but there's
and there's some really kind of significant omissions or flaws in each of them and some
gifts the fact that some of those spaces start having an intersection is actually promising to me
and that's the kind of metatride thing that's being explored here which I really like
it's why things like the intersection of thinking about macrosystemic issues and
how we personally and as a group relate to those is something that I am hopeful for
and then the last question you ask was theories of change
yeah that's that's like a big thing I'm working on and and and you happen to say that you were
looking at some people had interesting theories of change or something new on the horizon that's I
think it's a that's a big deal for me anyways yeah I mean this this would easily take several
sessions to try to say when we think of a theory of change being good does it mean that we've mapped
the problem space well enough that we can define a theory of change that is both necessary and
sufficient and be able to do some proof of sufficiency is that what we mean by interesting
theory of change that's a very high bar and or does it mean that there's something that from a
forward engineering that's kind of from a reverse engineering point of view or from a forward
engineering point of view a theory of change acts on a certain level of sense making an agency in a
way that both increases sense making an agency so even though it's not clear that it converges
towards sufficiency it's increasing its capacity in a direction that could converge and then maybe
there's a theory of change that by itself is not anywhere close to sufficient but it's really
meaningful and in connection with a number of other things could start to map towards sufficient
something working on governance something working on markets something working on culture you know
etc. So I'll give you just a random smattering of theories of change that I think are at least
well informed that friends of mine in adjacent spaces are working on that are not like commonly
talked about. So if you look at the way that the economy has shifted recently to have more
winner-take-all orientation than it previously had and small businesses closed during COVID lots of
unemployment happens but the value of Amazon and Tesla and kind of top stock companies double and
and those types of things and then you look at the fact that you know something like
2,000 to 5,000 families own most of the world's wealth and even though they don't necessarily
own all the wealth when you factor just people owning their houses times how many people there
are in land those people don't control the financial industry or the the underlying
you know financial markets so disproportionately to just ownership of capital is the ownership of
the change in underlying market dynamics so when you look at that and you look at the winner
takes all type dynamics that continue that wealth concentration and then you combine that with
high-speed algorithmic trading that can make very fast money on money returns you combine that with
the fact that the militaries of nation states can't the really top-end capabilities they have
are weapons of mass destruction that nobody wants to use so if you take those away private
militias are basically as big as nation-state militaries and those are available to the top
families so basically nation-state level military capacity is accessible for hire
and then you take that they don't have people that they have to have elect them in again
and they don't and yet they can affect campaigns and elections across countries they don't have
land they have to protect but they can influence land deals there are a lot of people that think
of this as the new emerging feudalism the 21st century kind of feudalism where families start
becoming more dominant actors than nation-states and so the theory of change being how to maximally
meet the needs of those families in a way that also influences them that what would cause major
catastrophic risk is actually decrease in security for them uh like that's that is a totally valid
and interesting assessment and theory of change and it couldn't be more different than something
like Bjorkman's um bildung kind of model that is much more decentralized bottom-up cultural
trying to decrease that wealth concentration so there's like one side says the wealth concentration
is it's pretty inexorable so really try to influence the top of the power law distribution
the other side says can we do a rolling debt jubilee or something to change that wealth
concentration reboot a new financial system those are both interesting and then the question is like
do you run a portfolio of those strategies is there a way that those can have synergies with
each other and then when you start to look at strategies that emphasize something like market
versus military versus culture versus state and legislation are there synergies between those
because nobody can do all that work so they end up emphasizing a particular subset of actuators
and yet multiple actuators if they were in the right synergy become more powerful
so I'm interested in a network of solutions that maps to sufficient not a solution that
maps to sufficient and so I'm interested in people that can have
really good faith interactions with each other to increase the coordination across different
earnest theory of changes
you're good be any follow-up thank you thanks so much um all right so next up we'll do
ryan you have something about design principles if you can unmute yourself
whoop how do I stir a video there it is
hey daniel thanks this has been really fun um so I had a couple of questions feel free to answer
one none or any of them um and they kind of piggyback off of what we were just talking about
about good faith um so I'll just read them out what are the design principles that you
have found most useful when engaging in collective problem solving are there criteria that you
rely upon to promote or create a pro-social environment within which a group of problem
solvers are more likely to encounter meaningfully useful discussion questions potential solutions
and generate working models have you found that there is a quote done bars number of
sorts for agents involved in collective design and lastly how do you think about leveraging
embodiment techniques or ritual to invoke such a container thanks so much that was great question
and if I don't address all the parts of it come back to them because they're all good
so when you talk about design principles there's kind of the object side which is what are the
design considerations for understanding the problem space and a good solution
and then there's the more kind of interpersonal side of how do you get people to coordinate well
to engage in collective problem solving and design and I heard you more asking the second one
um but probably both so I'll see if I can address them both a bit if if you haven't had it yet
having forest on probably forest and zack together to discuss e gp and agp which is
something that forest spent the last few years working on as a design methodology for doing complex
problem assessment and design criteria to do this thing he calls transcendental design basically
how do you do design in the complex rather than the complicated domain in a way that
maximally anticipates and internalizes externalities and also has the right design iteration process
to be able to internalize externalities and additional considerations that weren't forecasted
so it's both an upfront and an iterative process and I would say it is the best process that I'm
aware of for how to understand the problem well enough that you get the design constraints to
think through a solution and that's the e gp part of it ephemeral group process
and I'll just briefly say and I'm not going to address it at all it starts with purely questions
and this is actually a really valuable insight and just for everyone to kind of
factor in your own design thinking so we're before saying okay we're building a bridge here
now we're going to do a design shop on how to build a bridge the bridge is trying to solve a problem
but the bridge might also cause some other problems which is why if we have a proposition
to make the bridge or not make the bridge you're going to have half a people on either side right
very rarely do we have a proposition in in a kind of government situation that 90 percent of people
are on one side of which means that most any proposition that goes through about half of the
people really think it's a dreadful idea and so that process itself can't not polarize a population
and there was I don't remember who it was but there was some founding father that made a statement
around uh voting is the death of democracy and most of us think about voting as democracy
and it's like no no the town hall where you talk is democracy democracy democratizing the process
of input into figuring something out is what democracy means voting is what you do to sublimate
warfare when you can't figure it out um but the goal in a town hall is can we all share our problem
assessments the things that we value the criteria enough and then be able to dialogue about this
solution and not just yes no on that solution but that solution is pretty good for these things
but it cause a problem here what if we do this right until you come up with something where
everyone's like going ahead with that is better than the other options right and even if I have
some compromise the compromise is better than the warfare associated with the non-compromise
but if we can't get that we're like no fuck it just no on that way and so we go to a vote rather
than bullets then the population will start to polarize along those voting lines increasingly so
and then you start getting a situation where whatever somebody does then in the next term
the other people are trying to undo and most of the energy goes into internal friction and you
just can't do shit when all the energy goes into internal friction right and this is why the combination
of a binary two-party system or a yes no on a proposition system where half of the people
will dislike anything combined with a mostly voting and no no real town hall type engagement
combined with term limits makes long-term planning almost perfectly impossible
because whatever you're going to implement if it doesn't create its returns within the four years
you're not even going to try and you know whatever you do will be undone after those four years and
you know so so that's obviously not functional and then and then the business sector it's often
and even tighter it's a quarterly time scale depending upon the nature of the business and
if it's private or public so obviously before we have a proposition that we vote on we should have
some process to say what would a good proposition be did we even have a process to figure out what
is everything that people care about why some people are saying no to this proposition other
people saying yes so that we can even do a design process to come up with a good proposition the
fact that we go straight to voting on propositions that somebody makes up with very partial insights
and usually vested interest usually special interest and we don't even have a formalized
process for the proposition development like that's so obviously inadequate
and so maybe the bridge that we're going to vote yes or no on the bridge proposal it's like well
why does anybody want to make a bridge and it might just be a construction company wants to make one
because they're going to get the contract and it's purely vested interest that just sucks for
everybody well that's kind of worth knowing right but if there's a real reason that these two areas
are separated enough that it takes two hours for people to commute where it could take 15 minutes
and there's an economic situation where it really makes a difference and so then you say okay the
underlying need has to do with a particular set of economic needs that are associated with transportation
it might be that a bridge is the way to go it might be that because of the negative environmental
or aesthetic or whatever effects that that bridge would have that a ferry is a way to go it might
be a bridge somewhere else is it might also be that developing the local economies on each side
where the people don't have to commute as a way to go there's a lot of other options once you start
to understand what are we trying to benefit and then what are the adjacent associated things that
could be harmed by a particular solution what is this what is the space of things that we care about
so you have to do some deeper kind of questioning before you move to proposal process and so one
of the things that eGP does is get people to really generate the map of relevant things
that become the basis for design constraints so then you can do a design by constraint kind of
methodology and say what is the best synergistic satisfactor we can find and then you have an
iterative process on that one of the other things that happens though as far as social cohesion is
people don't polarize on other people's questions in the same way they polarize on other people's
statements and propositions and so if I make a statement that says we should do this someone
can instantly have a negative reaction but if someone says you know I question what some of
the negative environmental impacts of a bridge might be everyone can be like that's a fair question
you know I'm a fisherman I like to fish I don't want it to fuck that up too bad or whatever it is
right and so one of the interesting things is that the question asking process inherently can
allow dialogue with less intrinsic polarization and people don't have ego identified with their
questions as much as they have ego identified with their solutions and so it also leads to a
binding of a group in a different way and not the cleaving energy for the group there's a bunch of
other things that are involved in this that are really interesting it also makes everyone a better
sense maker because if you ask questions and then the question you ask you have an initial
question that a group of people are going to be exploring the first question you ask is what
additional questions would have to be addressed to really be able to answer this one well
and then what assumptions are built into this question and what is fundamentally valuable
related to this question that we're trying to understand you get people to actually become
better sense makers for their day-to-day life ongoingly plus they get to see other people
asking good questions they didn't ask that actually positively gets them to want to
perspective seek so there's a lot of badass design built into that design process
so that's a few things there now I'll answer more on the in a small group of people that I'm hoping
to have be deeper or longer-term collaborators less of a society-wide solution what what have
I found helpful to get people to collaborate well if there's anything I wish I had better
answers to it's this I can't say that I have had success here anywhere near as well as I wish
I can tell you some things that don't work I tell you a lot of things that don't work
I can tell you some things that seem like they have worked to some degree and then some things
I'm hopeful about the more you try to have people who say are not engaging because they're being
paid and there isn't a command and control hierarchy and they're just authentically coming
together to to work together the more you really try to accomplish tangible shit that way the more
you start appreciating command and control hierarchy with people that are paid and the
ability to replace them with other people that will do a thing because it just is so much fucking
easier and and it's it's important to actually come to understand why the thing that has been
selected for has been selected for to not just have naive ideas about the other things so it's
good trying to implement some of the naive ideas and really try to be accountable for the output
and watch them fail to then come to understand um specifically one of the things I found so
interesting is one of the things that really messes up deep collaboration good faith collaboration
is optionality um if I've got some poor people who all can't afford to buy their own house
and they're all really struggling and they decide to build an intentional community together
where the way they do a land co-op actually allows them to someday own something and gives them more
like foundational maslow's hierarchy security those people will put up with a decent bit of
difficulty from each other and in working with each other to make the thing work because they
have a real need that needs met that creates binding energy that overcomes the cleaving energy
but if I'm trying to do something with people that have already been somewhat successful in the
world who have the ability to do something at larger scale all of whom don't need the thing
to work because they got enough money they can just go somewhere else if it's difficult
the privilege and optionality that that creates makes one willing to put up with less difficulty
um most of the time so then you have to say okay well how do I bind myself to so
if I got a bunch of people who've all been CEOs or could be CEOs and they can basically be mostly
in control of shit and they're used to being effective at being in control of shit they and
they can recognize that there's an upper bound to what they can do on their own but it's a pretty
good upper bound and if they come into relationship with each other they won't have the same control
of shit and they optimize to be good at that for a reason right they psychologically were oriented
to be good at that and like that and now they're going to have other people that have a very deep
say in how the things happen and um and they're just as invested but without as much of a sense
of full agency and like that's that's difficult so I have found people trying to do intentional
communities or collaboratives or whatever um the people that have what seem like higher level
capacities to affect change in the world because of what they've already done are some of the people
that have the hardest time actually making meaningful sacrifices because they don't feel
like they have to um so then someone has to have something that motivates them more than the
seeming comfort of their own life and that's a nice idea and it's also hard um
this is yeah I know you guys had pat ryan on before he probably talked about um blackmail as
a currency of coordination uh there's always this question when you're trying to coordinate
where you're going to share some knowledge with the people you're going to coordinate with where
if that knowledge was widely shared you would lose some of the ability to do the thing because
you're going to corner a market opportunity you're going to release some patent you're going to
you know do a military attack whatever it is where you actually need some element of being
able to control the information but you're like the the challenge is if I want to implement something
at some scale I have to share some information with some people because I can't do the whole thing
myself but if I share information with them that and they defect and share that information with
the public the police the competitor the whoever it is that totally fucks up what I'm doing somewhere
between I get put on a bayonet or in jail or just become a pariah um or lose the market opportunity
how do I share the information to allow the coordination and protect against defection
and in a government setting it's you know you take an oath you have a commander you
violate the um confidentiality or the classification and you get thrown in prison
right you there's military prison all that type of thing in rule of law and generally in contract
law you sign a contract you can get taken to the court the court will enforce it if we're in a gang
and this is the mob and you snitch on somebody you're just going to wind up floating in a river
right but if we're talking about inter elite coordination where you can't have the people
just wind up in a river and you also can't use rule of law because there is no rule of law for
the thing that is happening how do you prevent defection and so the idea that having some kind
of mutually assured destruction on each other in the in a space that has power which would be the
public sphere which you know would be something like blackmail uh that that that can facilitate
coordination it's not facilitating trust right it's not facilitating coherence it's facilitating
anti decoherence right or anti defection but that fundamentally means that it is like the
culture is intrinsically fucked right the culture of the thing is not a trust based but a maximally
guard against non trust based situation so then you have this question to say if we don't have a
place where rule of law is the thing that we get to use and we want to create real trust that binds
people to to each other and to a mission where they don't defect under duress where that would be
consequential and we don't want to do it through some form of punishment what do you do it what
creates the binding energy that prevents defection under duress and you know knighthoods had a model
for this and of course they sometimes would kill someone for defecting so it wasn't without the stick
but the sacred oath where someone actually had a sense of what they were willing to give their
life for and that they were actually willing to give their life that there was a transcendental
meaningfulness bigger than their life and then they could see that these other people authentically
took the same oath and so that there was something that they they couldn't defect on each other without
defecting on what matters more to them in their own life and so they have a binding with each other
that is actually mediated through whatever the transcendental values are
I have some experience of that working and I hope to have more experience of that working
as time goes on no I don't think it's just enough for everybody to do
ayahuasca together and have some like nice experience that feels very deep because the
question is how does it hold later under duress but you know when you study the masons and you
study the temple or and you study those types of traditions you're actually studying a set of
social technologies that was developed very much to do that thing and I would say most of
people that are working on how to benefit the world right now are not studying those technologies
and what the modern applications would be as much as is useful and I would say do think about
how people's optionality affects it that's an important thing
there's a lot of things I can say having a culture
inside of a group of collaboration where everyone takes more of the responsibility for
the problems on themselves and gives more of the credit to each other helps a lot like if that's a
cultural value that everyone does so rather than have the status competition of your you're like
hey you copied my thing or whatever it is I want to actually whenever I'm talking and I'm saying
something I learned from you if I can credit you and I can help I can help whatever your
motivators are where you actually experience the things you're motivated by working better working
with me than not but where that is symmetric right symmetrically that's held as a value and
maybe even a vow I find those things are quite helpful I also find not setting them up as vows
up front and just seeing what do people naturally come in with what is the disposition that they
hold because if they don't already have that disposition they might not even be able to
or want to be bound to it by some agreement so to some degree simply observing where people
are coming from first and not moving too fast is helpful we could we could talk a long time on this
one Ryan did you have a follow-up I don't want to take any more of your time that was just
really really fun yeah that was that was great maybe if you could just talk to embodiment
principles or techniques not ayahuasca ceremonies that maybe help with group coherence
I'll share something that forest could expand on again I don't know if people here have how
many have basic familiarity with some of the concepts in the eminent metaphysics
the domain of the eminent the omniscient and the transcendent I won't belabor this long because I
don't have the time to explain it but if you do have the familiarity there are types of bonding
and coherence in each of those domains and one of the things I would say is that it requires
bonding in each of the domains so when you say embodiment you're probably mostly talking about
coherence in the eminent domain and this is this is everything from a tribal practice of dancing
together in a drum circle around the fire before making before tribal council making a decision
there's something very profound that happens in that kind of ritual because in the drummers
are both doing their own thing and being in sync with each other right they're all kind of following
a base rhythm but they're also doing their own thing so there's a balance of agency and communion
if they start doing their own thing that is out of beat it'll sound really shitty and everyone
would be like what are you doing but for them to kind of improv so there's a how do you find
individuality in a way that also has harmony and the dancers similarly are all doing their own thing
but to a similar beat right so there is a but maybe some are on the half step and some are on the
double step and the so there is a way that there is harmony between everyone with with individual
expression and that that can create an embodied experience of like oh we we have some deeper
than semantic level of connectedness and familiarity with each other then we go into the tribal
council we're going to talk through something and we're bringing in a sense of positive bonding
with each other plus coherence with each other right coherence in the eminent whereas coherence
in the omniscient in the cognitive would be like logical congruence are we factoring the same data
do we have the same waiting algorithms on it or using the same propositional logic
but eminent coherence can also be doing a barn raising together
which also means build a burning man camp together right the barn raising or the burning man camp
is we're experiencing actually working together and you get experience like who doesn't actually
really fucking work and who claims a lot of work and didn't who really does how does that kind of
fix itself where there is a sense of like oh we're all in this together working supporting
each other making the thing happen a real thing happened and there's a experience of a certain
kind of coherence that happens from building some real shit together that you don't get from any
level of psychoemotional bonding group therapy or cognitive work right it's the eminent domain
it's a different thing so I would say looking at some kind of can we actually work together can
we find coherence and work together and can we sync together in some kind of fundamental and
embodied ways then can we find logical congruence are we running similar axioms and epistemics
and in a transcendental way are we oriented to similar values do we have a similar kind of set
of transcendental values that we're oriented towards that there need to be some practices
in all three of those areas for it to really be effective all right beautiful and we actually
do have fours coming in tomorrow maybe I'll just plug that right now while it's alive at three pm
eastern time Margaret and myself are going to have a discussion with him on the ephemeral group
process that's pretty cool and also that black male guy Pat Ryan he's going to be in this Friday
for another session of the dark stowa so check that out um a question from Kerry above on the
ethics of a vegan diet uh if you can meet yourself and ask your question a copy and paste it right
here in the chats hey Danielle thank you um so I heard you speak uh in an interview I think it
was about six years ago on the ethics of a vegan diet um I'm a nutritionist and so I've
thought about food quite extensively for 20 years or so um so it's interesting to me because diet
seems to be at the intersection of personal choice and personal impact and community global
and civilizational impact uh with 2.6 million years of human species eating meat it seems
like we carry a biological imperative to eat some amount of animal for our best health um
and I heard you speak something about like thinking about it really carefully and educating
oneself on how to eat a vegan diet well and allergies and different things but I see accessing
these things as somewhat challenging not practical for everyone potentially even privileged um so
how can we move out of the nightmare of the commodification of animals but still meet our
omnivorous needs this is one of the trickier topics um I kind of wish that you didn't bring it up
because it's very hard to feel like we can do any justice to it in a short amount of time
because the science itself is actually very complex in the formal sense of the word complex
meaning what metrics do I pick to measure health and which of those are differentially
benefited more by different diets and did I control properly did I control for other
environmental factors and concomitant factors and genetics and and so you'll have a china study
and then you'll have a refute the china study and then you'll have an adkin study and then you'll
have a and um while I have seen some comparative nutritionists try to look across those datasets
and compare them well I have not seen epistemics that I consider adequate to the problem space yet
so when we're talking about ethics obviously there's going to be a what is actually possible
and what is actually true objectively that is going to be a part of that if if people really
can be fully healthy without eating animal products or they can't be the ethics of it is totally
different right and then you have things like short term versus long term and how long did the
study run for and does it you know change over time and and different genetic backgrounds and
microbiomes and whatever and so I think the complexity of the sciences is trickier than
almost anyone I've ever talked to acknowledges because like people coming to the issue of race
they come from either that they've been absorbed in critical race theory and the associated
histories or the almost opposite kind of the social science and so the preponderance of what
they've been exposed to makes them feel more certain and the view that they've had of the
other side is usually their side debunking the other side and so to the degree that a topic
is polarized is the degree to which even if people are familiar with both sides it's through bias
that they don't recognize that's really tricky and I think the way we feed ourselves is so
primal right like one two three five times a day I'm going to be doing this thing so somebody
telling me how I should or shouldn't feed myself and it goes against my culture my early childhood
my sense of sovereignty my like it's such a big thing and and on the same time the it's kind of
the thermodynamic basis of our impact on the planet right as a species is that thing and there's so
many of us that the that the net collective consequence of it is so important to consider
where you can't take a purely individualistic approach without cons categorical imperative
does this work for everybody and so I think it's just an authentically tricky topic so I
will share a couple high level considerations
so I became a vegetarian when I was a kid when I was nine
um saw a factory farming truck it was a kind of horrific scene red diet for new america got into
pita and animal activism and like that and then when I was a teenager became vegan I just hadn't
studied the dairy part yet and I I have been up until now I'm 40 and I am you know my blood labs
look good I lift weights you know I I am in good health my energy is good so uh that works for me
and I have tested at different times to see am I missing something where I don't have a good reference
so let me take a you know some small amount for a period of time uh eggs or whatever it is that
would be the test of the nutrient I might be missing and see do I notice a real subjective
difference I'm going to have a very hard time noticing an objective difference especially
when the blood labs are already in a good range and I personally have not noticed a difference
and I have noticed many people who have and I've known a number of people who have tried to do uh
vegan diets and were much healthier for some period of time oftentimes because it was the
first diet that they did really thoughtfully so it meant that they just cut out a bunch of refined
food and grains and whatever I find that actually most any diet works for somebody at first if it
is basically a movement from something like shitty unconscious standard american diet that if it's in
the direction of cleaner more whole foods more organic whether the macros are mostly fats mostly
protein or mostly carbs they're going to do better than they did on the like sugar and
hydrogenated fat diet um and usually any of them that they go to they'll have some more
consideration of calories and micronutrients and some basic things like that I find that
there's a lot of diets that people do well on for a short period and then badly on like too long on
keto or too long on adkins or for some people too long on vegan or for most people too long on
fruitetarian where the imbalance in macros and the associated imbalance in micronutrients
that go with it end up becoming not good long-term fits I think realizing that most people in our
evolutionary environment didn't have access to the same type of food all year round before agriculture
makes it pretty clear that dietary flexibility is the thing that was our primary evolutionary
environment so we would have had sometimes where there was more animal products less
animal product different kinds of vegetation but never like as much salary as we want all year
round or as much you know like that just that's a that's a weird thing and so I think that creates
metabolic inflexibility microbiomic inflexibility things like that
I think as far as the ethics goes I don't think that anyone puts forward a reasonable case for
why factory farms are a good idea or an ethically reasonable idea ethically environmentally
health wise or any other wise I think it's one of the like obvious great blights on the world
and one of the things that I'm I guess sad about so I have friends that are vegan for ethical
reasons and I have friends that are hunters for ethical reasons both of whom I respect
because they're if they're in a real earnest inquiry around what is true what is effective
how does their choice how would it portend for eight billion people doing that if they're really
in it I don't think that anyone can claim the basis of authority to say you have to come to
this conclusion or you're a bad person so I mostly care about the depth of earnestness with it
with which one is inquiring and practicing
but sometimes I will see people go from say a vegetarian conversation to a
a conversation where it ethically makes sense to eat animal products for them because they think
that we can't get heme iron or b12 or evolutionary environment of omnivore or whatever it is they
have some argument like that that would justify going in bow hunting or something but because of
that they just slide to animals or in rather than out and they'll eat mcdonald's and I think that is
super sloppy ethically right so how much meat does somebody need to eat if they feel that they
need to eat some and how was it sourced is really important not just a binary it's all in or it's
all out right I think if someone has endeavored to apply a vegan diet well and they have tried to
study the nutrition of it and they don't feel that they can be as healthy then there's a very
straightforward ethical conversation around it's not causing unnecessary suffering to kill some other
life because they are in some ongoing degree of suffering by not doing it so now we're weighing
sufferings and now we're in an in a authentically difficult trolley problem right but we're in a
real ethical problem as opposed to just a black and white it was unnecessary suffering for no good
reason of course there are heaps of questions under this around but how do we know what the
subjective experience or consciousness of an animal is compared to a plant and I address some of those
in that dialogue that you saw and that takes a little while and I wouldn't consider the same
type of proto qualia for a blade of wheat grass as I would for a redwood tree like I think those
types of categories are also nonsense or obviously for a clam as for a chimpanzee in the domain of
animal when we think about when we think about the fundamental principles of ethics one of the
this again a lot of things for us did a very good job formalizing the ethics of continuity and the
ethics of cemetery is a really nice formal way of framing up ethics writ large ethics of
cemetery is one of the main ways we think about ethics which is do on to others as you would have
them do on to you or Rawls's original position right you design a society but you don't know which
of the roles you're going to be put into and design a society in a way where you'd be okay being put
into any of the roles and make sure that if you design a deal with somebody that you'd be willing
to take any side of the deal pie slice theorem I can slice the pie but you get a pick or you can
slice it and I pick but I don't get a slice and pick so these are ethics of cemetery what I trade
places do I actually feel that the thing I'm dealing is fair not in a bullshit sense but the
embodied sense I trade places so if we extend that to animals essentially and creatures and say
what I trade places here if people aren't asking that question I don't think they have
contemplated the ethics yet and and asking the way we design a system for say a species right
cows or chickens in relationship to humans from Rawls's point of view would I be willing to be
put into the cow place there or in the human place and say like that's actually a reasonable
position or did I design something where there are positions I totally wouldn't want to be put
into it some form of you know what we would consider abject slavery or something like that
so I think thinking through that is important and so the hunters that I respect have a complex
relationship with killing every time like they have some basis by which they feel like that is
actually you know there's too many deer in the area because we've killed the apex predators in
the area they're actually helping to balance the environment getting that there as opposed to factory
farm meat is better even as opposed to agriculture that's coming through conventional agriculture
producing wheat that is you know destroyed whole forest lands that that feels like the right thing
to do but it also doesn't feel like nothing to them to kill the animal knowing that what that
animal is experiencing is a real experience and what the other animals that were part of
that herd or whatever are experiencing watching it and even more so if I raised it my whole life
right and then the thing shifts so I think someone's relationship with it should be complex
right like I think if it's really simple it's because someone has actually stopped wrestling
with the wholeness of it and if you look at most of the kind of tribal cultures they had a very
strong no waste orientation right they didn't take more than they needed and so in a situation where
it's like we're talking about health but then most people are obese on the thing no that's fucked up
right does it make sense to take it from much worse sources and more than is needed in a way
that's actually harming me not helping me no that's ethically fucked up I don't hold that everyone
necessarily can or should be vegan I hold that some people can I don't hold that no no one can
from experience of a lot of long-term people are quite healthy I hold that everyone can be
much more responsible with their choices and you know like also I I try very very hard not to buy
plant products that come from conventional sources that had damaging effects on the environment
in the nature of how the conventional agriculture works so it's not that's another binary that people
do of like meats in so I'll take the factory farm stuff or I don't do meat so whatever plants I do
are fine no like the the glyphosate wheat that is fucking up the environment or whatever is actually
really bad and kills lots of animals in the nature of how those threshers work and the you know field
mice and snakes and birds and pollinators whatever I think it's hard for us when we're dealing with
very large supply chains that we're emotionally disconnected from whereas if I was growing all
of my own food picking picking a carrot just doesn't feel the same as slitting a goat's throat
they don't feel like the same kind of experience and there's a there's something that goes with
being connected to that whole thing and honestly picking a carrot or wild harvesting a berry
doesn't feel the same as clear cutting an area of forest to create row agriculture does right
and so to try to take these very large-scaled things that are invisible to us like go to the
factory farm go to the conventional farm go to where clear cutting is happening go to the landfill
and really get in touch with what your life is producing and then say fuck how do I actually
take better responsibility for this now one can go excessive here and try to have not causing harm
be the whole thing they focus on their life will just get smaller and smaller because they actually
realize if I drive on the road I'm causing harm electric car versus a gas car my bike the rubber
where to come from the and so that can just shrink you into there is no way to have your hands
totally clean in a world that is built on institutional violence right like it is institutional
structural violence so there's a certain place where I am complicit by being in it that's a kind
of ethical humility that has to happen but then to also say I'm going to minimize those harms
while also maximizing my capacity to change it and if I'll never fly on a plane because of the
climate change but that also means I can't go possibly influence the thing at the the UN or
wherever it is that I got invited to do then I might be causing less harm in the moment but
decreasing my capacity for larger offset but then again that doesn't just mean well I don't think
about plane flights at all and I will do infinite amounts of them because it got put into the binary
category called plane flights are cool so I how to really take responsibility for the things that
I'm affecting but I can't tell I'm affecting right I can't tell because they're out of my senses
that's the deeper consideration I would offer
any follow-up question carry no that was really excellent thank you I live at a regenerative
agriculture eco village and I'm sitting with potentially exploring this complex relationship
and killing a chicken and so that really was wonderful thank you all right I'll say one more
thing about that when I was a kid I really just loved animals and took in all the sick and injured
animals I could find in our house became kind of like a animal rehab place for some time and
that also meant that there were animals that weren't going to get better that were really
suffering that we had to kill put out of ongoing unnecessary suffering so starting somewhat young
I learned how to mercifully kill something that I was dedicated to trying to save right that I
cared about and that's a very interesting process right vets obviously have to go through that and
typically one desensitizes when they do too much of it because like think about someone who became a
vet because they love animals and now they're in a situation where they're just euthanizing
beautiful dogs all day long because people are fucks and breed dogs and they shouldn't
um like how do you not shut down and so I had a process that every time I killed an animal I
I was completely tuned in with it right I was feeling it as loving it I was wishing that I
had been able to help it more and I cried every time right but I also wouldn't not do it because
it needed done so like you have to both have the courage and the sensitivity bound and if you go on
either side where you don't have the courage or the sensitivity you kind of fall off the razor's edge
there so when you have that experience with the chicken and the community does
that they really just feel and hold the whole thing thank you yeah all right we have 15 minutes
left so um we'll sneak in this question from Evan and then we'll close up uh Evan I pasted your
question below if you can unmute yourself and ask it to Daniel yeah thank you so um I think a lot of
people on the stowa might be in a similar spot to me here and so I'm gonna ask this question kind of
generally um so a lot of us want to spend more of our time and energy helping to actualize the
sort of non-rival risk systems and dynamics of the future that you talk about and um but are also
in a situation where we will be literally homeless if we don't keep our day jobs within a month or
two um and these day jobs require us to spend our time in a game A or rival risk kind of context
and um so I would just love to hear your take on how one can actually make moves in one's life
to um to move into a way of making one's way in the world for one's health and one's family
making a living in the world um without being so deeply attached and dependent on these sort of
um you know rival risk game a corporate dynamics that that most of us have to spend you know eight
hours a day doing yeah I get it the best answer I have isn't awesome um
so things that I did one was for most of my life I kept my overhead extremely low
and so I did a life design that made it to where I wasn't on the hamster wheel of you know
make a little bit more and then want to spend that little bit more on all the things that
society makes it very easy to want to spend it on that then binds me to that thing because I was
very clear that I was trying to liberate my time and then I saw it what are the ways that I can
make more dollars per hour doing things that I believe are good even if they're not the very
best things because I'm not trying to get my sense of how my theory of change in the world
is going to ever give me dollars maybe it will but I am not connected to that I'm not going to do
something high dollar per hour that I think is really bad um so when I was doing construction as
a kid going through college I remember seeing that the electricians made more than people framing
and I was framing so I taught myself electrical work and then started doing that and right like
I just kept seeing how do I increase the dollars per hour to not increase the total dollars but
to decrease the hours while keeping the dollar needs more fixed and you know then I was doing
counseling work with people and then I learned that doing executive coaching was basically
counseling that charged more and then I learned that strategic business consulting for businesses
made more than the executive coaching thing did and it was like what skills would I need to develop
to actually be able to help here that are also teaching me something interesting and valuable
and then how do I keep progressively keep the hours lower where the rest of my hours get to
keep growing and know that it won't happen that instantly like the development of right profession
is a you know it's a developmental process years uh and if someone now I mostly never had a job like
a w2 type thing I mostly took contract or type positions where I could control the dynamics of
my hours and charge and like that better not not everyone is oriented to do that as well
if you're in an eight hour position uh and you don't know how to make more dollars per hour
in some obvious way and obviously taking the time to explore how to do that is time outside of those
eight hours that you're not trying to figure out anti-rival risk stuff with
a few things I would say
the people who were under feudalism for most of the history of the world could never ask this
question like they didn't have eight hours and then some free time and some access to knowledge
and development uh or even the freedom that if they economically freed themselves that they weren't
forced into some position like it is even to be in what seems like economic servitude here have
no money in savings and be you know a month away from homeless but to not be working 12 or 14 hours
obligately a day um is actually a situation that allows us an upward vector that most people never
had and most people in the world still don't have now to say but fuck I'm tired at the end of eight
hours and you know I I want I like I need to chill or rest or do something else that's real
and the depth to which we care about it can motivate finding more energy um now one of the
tricky things is like what resource do you focus on first to be able to leverage other resources
do I just really double down and focus on money making so I can buy free time and fun projects
or am I going to really try to focus on my health so I have more energy so I can work 15 hours a day
and so I've got a solid seven outside of the eight that I work but I'm going to put some
energy into health to have like the physical vitality to do that am I going to try to double
down on my learning straight towards you know game B type things I've never found a good answer of
like the order of operations is really figure out discipline first and then figure out money
I found that it's like you level them all up one notch and you kind of take a moment you level
them all up one notch and then you level them all up one notch again and um and it's very easy to
focus on how we wish it was that it isn't in a way that is disempowering that just makes us feel
kind of shitty but to focus on I just don't find that a useful focus to focus on that we actually
have some developmental opportunity and development happening and then just keep saying how do I
double down on that is the most useful focus and then I would say like to the degree you're in those
eight hours a day can you experiment with game B type things can you even learn more about game A by
bringing like not just being there kind of disengaged but saying fuck I'm going to move
up through the ranks here and learn how business really works I'm going to learn more about middle
man and I'm going to learn those things to just bring more like care and engagement to your learning
and development I think can happen most anywhere when you realize everything's interconnected
then you realize that any domain of learning can be laterally applied to almost everything else
yep those are a few thoughts so quick follow-up if I may so I like what you had to say
I spent most of my 20s learning and being only occasionally employed in a more contractor type
basis like you described now I'm employed in a well currently in an engineering type role and
I'm starting to feel a pull to not do that and I remember you said in one of these earlier Stowa
sessions that most people should probably have a job rather than work for themselves so I'm wondering
specifically focusing on like how does one decide or what is your advice for someone who is in the
process of deciding whether or not to continue with a pretty good job for a pretty good company
that's making the world at least marginally better versus to strike out on one's own and accept the
much greater levels of uncertainty precarity and risk in the service of trying to actualize something
that you feel that you've discovered in your heart and want to share I won't answer this the same
for everybody because I think I think a lot of people kind of mostly just want to live a good
life and they would like to leave the world somewhat better than they found it but they're
not hugely aspirational or ambitious about that and that's okay I think that has always and will
maybe always be the case that that's where most people are and so have a job that is doing something
somewhat good and also allows some free time and some development is probably great
if you are
possessed by a need to solve problems that you can't not solve then it's a different answer
in which case I would say
I would take a job if and only if there was really strong developmental opportunity in it
but not just to maintain myself in my life but if I had the opportunity to either learn a shit ton
you're an engineer and you get to work with some of the best engineers in the world and your software
skills get to become epic which can really help future shit in which case when I'm there I wouldn't
stay eight hours I'd say 12 hours picking those guys brain doing additional shit and trying to
learn everything I could right I would actually take the developmental opportunity or you have the
ability to not just perfect your craft but adjacent areas you can move up in management and other
things and learn how businesses work so that you might be able to either launch something or understand
the intrinsic problems associated with them or you can grow your network there a lot if there's
very real return on your time in a developmental way then even if the project itself's output is
not all of what you care about but it's increasing your capacity to do the things you care about in
the future good if it's not I personally would rather get a van be homeless decrease my costs
figure out how to do a little bit of gig consulting and find something better and get off the hamster
wheel thank you yeah all right um we're going to land here daniel any closing thoughts um
like anything that came alive from this session or the series as a whole
I really liked all these questions uh some of the questions like I said I wish we didn't ask the
diet one because I because I wish we had I don't know 10 hours to start to address it
but it's actually one of the most important questions and base of like how do we take care
of ourselves as a human and what's the impact of that and how do we think through that um
and how do we come up with our own ethics that we care about so much we're willing to modify our
own life without trying to force that on everyone else and how do we feel okay not forcing it on
everyone else if we're so sure it's right we're willing to sacrifice for it that's a microcosm of
how to deal with israel palestine and shia juni and every other major clusterfuck like that in the world
so um yeah and the question of like how do I take care of my financial needs in the world while
wanting to contribute to something else like these are all I think every one of these are
questions that all of us have to wrestle with and how do we live in this world while trying to
move it towards a better world and so I'm hoping that the questions that other people asked other
people found interesting and meaningful um I would love to hear if people you know want to write
feedback afterwards of what was uh what was both good in this process for you and what could have
made it better um format wise or anything else because uh yeah I I don't get to talk with people
about these types of things very often I enjoyed this and would be quite happy to do more of it in
a better you know in an even better setting if such a thing became clear so feel free to put
in the chats what you got from it and maybe daniel can check it out um and I'm inspired to
because we're going to launch a metagame mastermind here at the still again and we're going to have
crews where we help each other out kind of source the collective intelligence to answer these questions
uh so we don't just rely on the guests coming in to to drop their knowledge
but uh very grateful for you my friend for coming and sharing your knowledge and wisdoms with us
we'd love to have you back you may or may not be uh uh coming in a couple weeks we won't say
