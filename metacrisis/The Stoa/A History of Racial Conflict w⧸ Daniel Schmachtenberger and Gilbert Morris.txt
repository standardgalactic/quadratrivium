Welcome everyone to this session on the STOA conversation between Professor Gilbert Morris
and myself. Thank you to Peter Limburg and the people at the STOA for letting us host
this conversation here and for the community that will be engaging afterwards. Gilbert thank
you so much for making this time and I've had so many conversations on the way to this
public conversation that have taught me so much. Would love to hear your opening thoughts
on our intention for this dialogue, your intention. Thank you so much Daniel and thank you to
your colleagues at the STOA. Anytime that one can engage in a meaningful discussion about a
great and important social issue that becomes important. I myself believe in the marketplace
of ideas as John Stuart Mill once called it and that is where there's a continuous dialogue
moving back and forth on social issues without necessarily the intention to win an argument as
much as understand its coordinates and so I'm pleased that we have that sort of
our relationship in exchange and so I welcome the opportunity for this discussion.
I'll share a bit of a long preface of my intention and hopes for this piece before we dive in
because I asked for us to do this piece. Actually we discussed we discussed what
turned towards us doing this piece starting during the George Floyd protests which is quite
some time ago now and have intended to do this ever since. So this is going to be a conversation on
the topic of race, racial inequality, injustice, the history of it and where understanding some
of that history brings us to today in terms of framing up what possible better way of going
forward might look like and so for my side these are not the topics that I am schooled in that I
was a student of in any deep more than just kind of cursory way as someone who's been interested in
activism and human welfare in general and during the George Floyd riots in particular
protests I was not mostly engaging in the deep scholarly work but the things that made it on
their way to YouTube so I was seeing the public intellectuals and I saw arguments from people
like Ta-Nehisi Coates or Cornell West on one side, people like Thomas Sowell or Glenn Laudry on the
other side and I didn't see what seemed like a bridge towards an agreement that was a way of
moving forward. I saw what seemed like arguments that landed for people who already resonated,
gave more intellectual support and ethical support for the people who resonated but they
continued a kind of polarized approach and so I was really without being able to become a deep
enough student in the topics to make sense of it myself wondering if there were any people who
had a sense of what a synthesis position between the various positions that might be able to
help us forward look like and Professor Morris I'll call him Gilbert throughout as he's asked me to
and I had actually talked other topics previously regarding mostly his work in the history and
philosophy of ideas, history of philosophy, legal scholarship related to some of my work on catastrophic
risk and but when we had discussed these topics and I knew he had actually been a director of
racial studies at George Mason University and taught and worked both in academic contexts
and as an ambassador to many different countries around the world had both an American and an
international and a kind of legal and philosophical perspective he was able to steal man all the
various positions well here's how the libertarians would think of it and here's how the critical
theorists would think of it in a way that was like legitimately sharing their points of view
very well and this was extremely valuable for me and so as I was in this fortunate position to be
getting educated on these topics by someone who could share the historical philosophical economic
contextual perspectives and share the various different groups perspectives and how those
perspectives had evolved over time I felt I was getting such a like invaluable opportunity that
I hoped to be able to share with other people and so one of my aims in this was simply to be able to
take a little bit of what I've got over dozens of conversations with Gilbert
and introduce that to other people who maybe like myself care would like to understand
are not already well educated and don't know how best to approach the topic so that's one of my goals
the the goal that had us starting to talk originally was is there actually a way forward
for how deeply entrenched the American racial injustice issues are and the various perspectives
on it is there a way that could be anti-polarizing and I don't think we'll get all the way there
in this conversation I think we'll lay groundwork because one of the other goals I that emerged
for me is that I've done talks that have wound up adjacent on the internet to a bunch of anti-woke
perspectives and that's strange for me I think it's because I'm interested in synthesis of
different perspectives in a conciliance approach and so I'll often try to explore a heterodox
orthodox distinction and find the dialectic which put me in the heterodox camp which put me
where the main trending heterodox thoughts are anti-woke and I'm super uncomfortable being in
an anti-woke camp is not my position and I would hope that and this is one of the reasons I think
the stowa is a good place is that the people in the stowa are really interested in synthesis how
do we explore the thesis of anything the antithesis the synthesis how do we explore more clear nuanced
trans ideological thought and peter limberg's original work that helped launch it on mimetic
tribes was can we actually inhabit everyone's mimetic tribe and feel what the world feels
like from that perspective so I'm hoping that after this dialogue the stowa community that
chooses to engage with this will be able to have deep rich dialogues about these topics and I know
Gilbert and myself are both happy to come back in and engage in those dialogues if it makes sense
but I found so many people critiquing strawmans of the woke perspective or particularly
unsavory aspects of how some people were expressing what they called woke ideologies
without seeming like they had ever steelman the underlying real issues of systemic inequality
and systemic injustice where woke originally meant awake to systemic injustice and so I actually feel
obliged to help to steelman that perspective to say before being anti-woke make sure you
understand because otherwise you might be a very moral person taking a position
that is immoral in ways you don't know because of the depth of the history so I think the main
thing we're seeking to do here is to construct elements of the history and the critical pieces
of philosophy and law that happened some of the attendant economic elements to really get
where the racial issue in the U.S. is today what's unique about the U.S. issue relative to other
global issues so that then if someone wants to say well how do we better move this issue forward
we at least have some better shared understanding of the history up to this point so that would be
it for my intention of where we're here I think that that's an excellent introduction
one of the things that I talk about when I lectured on this as you mentioned that George Mason
George Mason is the most conservative if not one of the most conservative schools I served on
that faculty with Robert Bork who I found to be an absolute genius Kenneth Starr was also on that
faculty and so was Carl Rove and everyone knows Walter Williams the great great economist great
personality and so on at the same time Roger Wilkins was on that staff whose father was
one of the founders of the urban lake and for a time in many instances Dr. Martin Luther King Jr
and A. Randall Philip and so on so one had these two sides and coming from both a Caribbean and
a British perspective you can understand that my I had been schooled in all these perspectives but
being in the thick of it at that time raised raised a great deal of questions at least of which
they then appointed me as as chairman of the African-American studies department
which meant that the knives were out should I step in the wrong direction
concede the program in a manner that did not be conceived before but it was an excellent time
with a bunch of great scholars Professor Jeffrey Stewart Rose Trubin Ben Carson Katya
Vladimirov and so you hear that already quite a diversified group of people teaching in the
African-American studies department and so I enjoy that kind of Catholic in the in the small
C sense of that kind of Catholic spread of ideas because it's consistent with J.S. Mills concept
of the marketplace of ideas when I teach this subject I explain the overarching frame that we
want to get is whether on the whole we are moving our behavior towards our values or our values
towards our behavior because no matter what side of an equation you're on if you establish a set
of values that you're not living up to it is important for each group to exercise some self
policing and culpability to ensure that what we say about what we believe is what others can
expect of us both in the way we continue to speak and certainly in our behavior in addition to that
or within that there is the Christian virtue which when you talk about slavery and race that's
relevant there is the legal issue which when you talk about human bondage and the removal of
freedom that's an important issue I already mentioned the values proposition and then there's
an economic issue and some people say that the other three are inflected by the economic issue
but we'll dive into that and see see where that goes the last point I'll make in this preliminary
phase is that we must be careful about historical monumentalism and that is where we treat history
as a monument to ourselves so that our status making and our sense of ourselves our sense of
our own prestige requires history with a certain narrative no matter what the actual history is
and when we come up against that this is one of the ways in which you and I talk about this all
the time Daniel when someone may have a wrong perspective innocently and then if that person is
curious and seeks a right perspective but when they are presented with the facts and still refuse
either to engage on the facts raise questions or to change their position then this becomes
disingenuous and that person is not an honest person with whom to speak
in an effort to to solve social problem or at least generate some sort of understanding
and so we have to eschew and reject monumental history and I'm afraid that both sides
in to some degree have now gone to the extremes of establishing history as a monument it's
unassailable elements of the history cannot be questioned cannot be challenged because
that the historical narrative is so important to us in one way or the other that we can't bear
criticism of it in any degree and that is those anti-human and anti-democratic
you're you're muted
what you're saying about viewing history as a monument to our current narrative and position
is a special case of the general case of motivated reasoning and as you are kind of mentioning
the economic case for slavery created a motivated reasoning basis for a whole bunch of
weird gymnastics mental gymnastics in terms of how to interpret Christianity and how to interpret
law and how to make the Declaration of Independence commensurable with slavery and like really weird
stuff so what we are seeking to do is to be able to look at which arguments are earnest but and
they're partial they need reconciled versus actually hold on to their partiality and claim
it to be more complete than it is out of motivated reasoning and the hope is to be able to strip the
motivated reasoning have an earnest inquiry they can give us a clear enough sense of at least some
through lines of the history up to this point I think why this is so important why this is so
important for me is and I'm really speaking to people who might be in a position somewhat
like the position I found myself in a couple years ago when Gilbert and I started speaking on this
as I would hear people that knew more about the topic say things very different from each other
and I didn't feel that I had the knowledge to be able to say these people who put 20 or 30 years
of study and that radically disagree with each other how am I going to figure that out and they
would say things that sounded superficially compelling like people who would argue that
mostly the issues of slavery and race are over and we should take a more kind of libertarian
perspective would say things like that as bad as slavery was Genghis Khan killed five times as
many people in his own life as the entire Atlantic slave trade ever even engaged with and there was
some sense that slavery was just part of history everywhere and the American case was not all
that particularly unique and that you know we actually bought the slaves from African slave
traders and you know those sound kind of compelling on the surface as I got deeper those all were
either red herrings or specious or at least cherry picked in a way that really did not indicate the
truth of the overall perspective well but simultaneously the critique of the American
situation oftentimes cherry picks in the other direction in a way that doesn't acknowledge just
kind of the real politic nastiness of humans largely and I really wanted to try to get a fair
sense for that so I'm hoping well mostly constructing what about the American slavery system and then
post slavery the continuity of that all the way up to the current day where systemic injustice
associated with race and it must I just have to say we're not going to be dealing with the
issue of the Native Americans we're not going to be dealing with the issues of feminism and
intersectionality and biracial discrimination and the million nuances that are really critical
that are just well beyond the scope of this and for everyone who has that deeper background
wonderful and this is really intended to be introductory but the hope is an introductory
pre the American slavery situation to the American slavery through the post slavery all the way up
to current they can give some contexts of what is unique and uniquely problematic about this case
that makes it so challenging yes and so with that I would say that first we have to keep slavery
and race separate at the time they let them come together organically as the process goes and they
will come together and we will see that the slavery was the thing that seemed to be a forerunner
and then race was brought in to to create certain justifications and even though slavery has ended
by certain definitions the race issue continues in the most pernicious ways so the beginning of that
if you look I think it's well established and and it's basic history that the reasons for slavery
were war so if you were a captive in a war debt if you had some some some debt that you couldn't pay
that these were the two main reasons why people found themselves in slavery there's a sociological
and anthropological point to that and that is in the ancient period if you go back as far as
32 3500 BC one of the things you find is that if you were engaged in war so there was a scrabble
for resources and so on hunting grounds and these sorts of things and if you were engaged in a war
once you captured the people who who did not succeed the question was what to do with them
they didn't have advanced sociology or anything like that and other cities to send them to
and people became sensitive about slaughter you mentioned you mentioned Genghis Khan
it was thought considerably that his own wives said to him at some point
my god must you kill so many people you know slaughter entire cities and so on so if you're
not going to slaughter them and you're going to integrate them and there's limited resources
and there aren't other cities for them to go to slavery was the means of integrating them into
one society you see this Greco-Roman situation where slaves rose to become important hold important
political and official offices they rose in the Roman setting to become great generals and were
trusted aides and allies of the people who enslaved them so slavery was never about the
humanity of the person it was always about some sort of social process to integrate these people
into our society if we did not wish to slaughter all of them that was a very very crucial thing
the change specifically specifically in the context where as a people that had just been
dominated and captured loyalty was in question and integrating them without some controls might
led to the breakdown of the society yes the vanquished were not likely to be
cooperative in the most meaningful ways and so once vanquished one had to pledge one's allegiance
to the certainty of who member of suzerainty of the the vanquishing power one had to pledge to that
now in in the politics book one and i'm not going to go into the excuse me the reference here
it's very long but you can read people
viewing can read Michael Sandel's Aristotle's politics in the Oxford reader and you'll come
to the same conclusion but you find it in book one of the politics where Aristotle talks about
natural slavery this has been a frustrating thing for both the Aristotleian society and for
Aristotle scholars throughout history because they think it's a blemish on him although he was a
many answers to alexander the great did abscond thinking that he would not meet the same fate of
socrates should things go badly so one can make an assessment of him that way but
the question is when Aristotle spoke about natural slavery so he made he sent two main points
about five points but two main points that's about five paragraphs when he talks about this
but he's really trying to set up the state and he's saying that the household and the individual
are to the state as the arms and the legs these are components and then he moves on to the individual
and he wants to define how the individual acts as the arm or the leg you know of the state
and he's worried because he says there's a certain type of individual who is a natural slave
and this is someone who ought to be this is a person who's given up his
rational capacity and so that's one leg of it and the other leg is someone who refuses to labor
there's a third leg where Aristotle talks about acrosia acrosia means weakness of the will and
that is when you know to do something right you tell yourself to do it and then you don't do it
anyway right so Aristotle said this is the weakness of the will it's our acrosia and this is
another type of self enslavement and so this natural slave the problem with this is it's kind
of an open concept he is not really thinking of anyone he doesn't think about the in fact he includes
the Africans in the asiatics so he says the asiatics are full of intelligence but no spirit
the Europeans are full of spirit but you know less intelligence and the barbarians have no
intelligence or spirit and so they are natural slaves and so he's justifying you know the formation
the building of empire in the Greek setting so these are the the people that he's referencing
as he's thinking this and so his notion of natural slavery is that they haven't really created anything
they are not interested in industrial and productive labor which is confusing because later on in
the politics he talks about you know agriculture and productive labor and the necessity of putting
slaves to work there anyway if i remember right he said he said something that really kind of shows
the view of that the domesticated animal has a better spirit than the wild animal because that's in
the same way the domesticated beastly person is better off because the domesticated animal is
acting within its own nature whereas the human being is not and so this this the main thing that
listeners should take away from this is it leaves an open sort of vessel into which people can put
all sorts of interpretations and say but Aristotle said that right and we'll see that this this kind
of has a through line all the way down from slavery to racism so and just to give the listeners
context of the arc we're going to follow we're starting with Aristotle and we're going to talk
about the american case that doesn't come for a couple thousand more years right starting with
Aristotle because this was significant enough to the western canon of thought that it became
something that got built upon absolutely absolutely no question about it now the second thing i should
like to say is that slavery was always contested and so one of the things we must reject is that
slaveholders in any period were just people of their times there were in every civilization
where the slavery as i said as we said before in prehistoric times
it was a question of do we slaughter people or do we integrate them to society and if you think about
let's say in china there's a there's a book or a set of narratives called the magical cologne
the magical cologne is actually a chinese sort of national cartoon it's a it's a series of texts
mythology and the central character is an african and this was i would say around
eighty six twenty uh something like that that you had these uh that you had these stories
in in china so they had the concept of they had slaves in china at the time but they didn't
necessarily think race and slavery went together so they are sort of hero of their
their mythological stories was a great cologne you can read uh i think her name is bolinsky
julie i think julie bolinsky is her name and she wrote about this extensively and then if you
look at the indian situation uh in the romanical texts the sudras and so on the slave master could
not eat before he fed his slave there were rules about whether you could rape a slave and so on
all these things were important and another thing for people to remember is the reason
that you would want rules for slavery is everyone was susceptible of being a slave
so your country could get overrun you could be vanquished and you wanted to know at least
that there were some rules in place to protect you uh if should you become a slave and so people
the rules around slavery were very very strong of course they were widely many cases and so on
but every major society uh uh had them and so that's very important once i just i haven't thought
of it quite this way what you're presenting is that the agreement on slaves is a very
rosy and kind of thing saying i am making a position where if i end up being on the other side
i'm okay with it because i might be on the other side because the power asymmetry is not so perfect
whereas in the later case the power asymmetry became so severe that people stopped needing
to consider they might be on the other side absolutely they they the inherent superiority
that they uh accorded to themselves meant that they didn't reflect on that at all and that's part of
the what americans call the pushback that you're seeing when they are held to task for some of
their behaviors that that that that assumed superiority seems to uh seems to infiltrate
their points of view so you have this situation with aerosol and so i make the point again
that slavery was always contested so when we come into the uh the period of what it's called
the dark ages loads of writers uh what are called the patristic fathers generally around the pope
and so on mystics and these sorts of people constantly railed against slavery and that has
been true from that day to this that they were always constantly people making very very rich
powerful arguments uh against uh slavery if we move quickly to saint thomas equinas
saint augustin thought that uh he agreed with aerosol who they were natural slaves but if they
had fallen away from god um uh saint thomas equinas in the some of their theologica he
makes this point also agreeing with aerosol who also agreeing that uh if they've fallen away from
god uh but then he says in the commentary on politics later on he says something like
there are those persons who are naturally masters and those persons who are naturally slave
and they ought to know themselves well enough so someone who is not a natural master should
not in fact present himself as a master over a slave because he will not have the internal
character and propaganda and so on and so that also becomes a useful sort of frame for people who
want to uh who want to justify uh uh enslavement so we've got these open frames there's one more
open frame which is very interesting the morse dominated stain for 800 years was thrown out
finally in uh 1492 same year that columbus sailed out of preneida and so you're not likely and this
is what tells you that race is a is a is a new is a new type of thinking not attached to any any
profound history you're not likely to think yourself superior to some group of people that
have run your country for 800 years and given you all of your you know intellectual development
your writing your your your technological prowess your art music all these sorts of things not likely
to think yourself superior to what happened is in spain uh people retreated to the mountains
and built these small societies in the mountains and they astute sunlight and sought to become very
pale to distinguish themselves from the moors and those who were mixed with the moors and so
their their veins could be seen through their flesh and their veins were bluey and this is
where the notion of blue blood came from at the same time the breeding of horses and so on became
very very significant and this idea of the prestige of horses based on breeding and the
notion of a blue blood somehow got melded together and and so race this was already beginning to
distinguish now race as a a separate categorization for for human beings so those are the upper
framings that uh that we that we should work under and with those things in mind we can get now to
to the issue of of enslavement
the they've been slavery in on the continent of africa just as there was in europe both in
the north coast of barbry coast it was later called so that's tunisia libya and all those places
that you know Morocco and so on and in sub-saharan africa right there they had been there had been
slavery um and in this early period certainly um you had significantly large societies large
societies up and down the what is called the swahili coast so that's the east coast of africa
just off of madagascar all the way up to egypt running along denial and all the way down to what
is now tanzania and then somewhat inland inland as well so you had these great civilizations all
of them had slaves for the same reasons debt and war very very significant and if you think about
uh the center of africa on the north coast this is to say uh morocco marley these sorts of places
these were where the greater kingdoms were located uh that the most well known the portuguese
began their incursion into these areas with the canary islands which are just off the coast
just off the coast there and spent about a hundred years wrestling with the dwellers on
the canary islands to achieve control they would lose some wars when some they would go away for
five or ten years come back they would and so this is a very very and this is we're talking between
now the 14th century so the late 13th and throughout the 14th century they could not seem to get a
hold here but eventually established a foothold in the canary islands and then attempted to make
incursions uh into the mainland at the same time the spanish were observing this and observing
you know the opportunities uh columbus was gearing up at the time to head out to uh
to what is called the new world new world for for europeans and what is very very significant
in this period is that there was slavery was not the main driver when the portuguese and the
spanish first began well they were all trying to to traverse the coast uh of the west coast of
africa all the way down to the cape um and this took about from the first incursion about 120
140 years to to get done but slavery slaves were not the main focus gold was
gold was the main focus uh and it's the main thing that made them start succeeding much
better than taking a hundred years to get a little bit of foothold mostly gunpowder revolution
yeah um you what you had in in in west africa well you had many small kingdoms
the arabs were the dominant uh a group up in the upper north of the continent of the time
uh and trading routes between morocco spain the rest of the mediterranean and so on were
already very well established uh you had it's worth just noting the arabic
influence in northern africa was already before what you're describing as the european influence
coming into africa but it had many similar properties absolutely that's so what i'm saying
is that the portuguese incursion into the canary islands while that occurred the the relationship
once the particularly the uh the morse once they left spain they entered all along the
barbary coast but largely into ethiopia and they began trading uh into the mediterranean
from those countries not only slaves but all sorts of products uh that um uh you know um
that were very important to europeans at the time very few agricultural products but last
goal was one of the main things that everyone was in search of part of the reason was a king
at the time called musa mensa right who was uh there's a wonderful book i i thought i had it
somewhere around here by howard french uh which is called born in blackness and it's a wonderful
book to read uh to to get a sense of what was going on what is the real sort of argument being made
here and by that book that history has kind of overshadowed this period and jumped straight to
christica columbus and the raiding of the african coast for slaves but they've missed about 200 years
of open trade for gold during the 13th and the 14th century excuse me so if you look along the coast
there was a place called el mina which is in modern day gana which the portuguese eventually found
and there they were able to correct much of their fiscal problems and most of their economic problems
and they saw an economic expansion and economic boom from dealing gold from el mina where they
built their first port as well uh the el mina castle um and this was in this was so this was
this completed the search for for gold when i say complete i don't mean that that was the
end of it i mean that finally they found what they what they were were looking for
the the association with slavery and enslavement um of uh blacks didn't come
organically out of that situation henry the navigator uh was the the brother i believe of
the king alfonso of portugal and henry the navigator hit upon an idea uh where he thought
he needed he thought that there was a an opportunity in trading in african slaves
in slaves from the continent of africa it wasn't called africa at the time he was concerned with
that because he saw from the canary islands that the plantation construct that they had there
was insufficiently uh developed so then he began to plead with the popes because he recognized that
the king of portugal could not give him dominion over these lands there could be a declaration
but in order to get a real declaration and prevent other catholic powers from incurring
into these lands and to give himself a monopoly that uh that he needed the popes imprimatur
so he was the first to have gone to poke Eugene uh i think it's like 1418 and and to convince poke
Eugene that saracens basically muslims uh were lurking all throughout uh the west coast of africa
and that he needed uh to form what was called the army of christ um to to go and proselytize to
the africans and get rid of uh the saracens completely untrue but Eugene issued the bull
i think it's called sane charisimus s a n e charisimus and that was the first
papal bull aimed at identifying um africa the not yet for slavery but putting um
the portuguese and henry the navigator in particular uh on this trek for
incurring into the continent itself uh beyond the the search for gold
you're muted and for those who aren't familiar papal bull simply means a dictate of the pope
which is a particularly significant thing during that time um you're mentioning the content of
afric continent of africa and you're mentioning that it wasn't called africa and this um very
kind of specious notion of they sold their brothers into slavery which assumes that this
giant continent that china and and the us and many other countries would all fit on is just
this one thing maybe speak to that for a moment because i think that helps to start to frame
for people who haven't thought of it um a bit about the history yes um the it's fascinating
some degree there were a host of small kingdoms along the west coast of africa at the time the
continent of africa uh and um uh none of those people could see themselves as africans so to
speak um this appellation came much later when uh the europeans could not be bothered to learn the
particulars or specifics of their assemblages and nearly sort of referred to everyone by the
continental by this continental catchall and so there is a deep sense in which one can't possibly
the the notion of brotherhood that the idea that there was a brotherhood amongst them
and that is an unfortunate notion i will say that um henry the navigator
learned the lesson he actually learned it in his lifetime i think he died in 1460
but in his lifetime in dealing with the kingdom of benin now when he went to benin he met
a magnificent wall city right a magnificent wall city with great metal work and art and a king
that it took him almost six months to get an appointment so to speak because they did their
due diligence right they you didn't have the freedom so so two things you didn't have the
brotherhood and while you had some some raiding that went on in the earliest phases
you're not going to move 12.4 million people by by chasing them around the coast of africa
so they went to benin benin drove a very hard bargain it was a very significant
civilization at the time had its own art had its own culture its own music
um he wrote about the hospitality of the royal court and that one could not see the king at will
and that there was a process uh involved why is this important because when we come to the racial
argument the racial argument is that there was nothing there anyway so why find a slavery
enslavement so abominable here's a racial argument that categorizes all these people
that have been around for all this time and say that they have never amalgamated into anything
significant and they have no great accomplishments so i just want to add to this that it is not
necessary that someone has advanced metal work in giant walled cities to say that uh their life
is worth something and should not be taken by force ethically um i think the habsian idea that
pre-advanced civilization people historically had the short brutish nasty mean lives in a war of
all against all is just absolute apologism for the narrative of progress as defined
if we look at the kalahari or minion the bush or whatever that didn't have the great walled cities
some of them had types of art and poetry and wisdom that is mind-blowing yeah so i i wouldn't
want to make the argument their lives are worth something because they had advanced technology
though it is worth noting yeah that is a part of the history yeah but it's well it's it's worth
noting in this way as well that is the european definition of an advanced society and the point
that i'm making is not that i think that that makes them advanced but the very people who accused
them of not being advanced categorize them as not being advanced when they encountered them
met them with these implements of civilization that they themselves prioritized and so that is
very significant you're absolutely right if you take the sand people people use refer to them as
the bushmen of the kilahari they have no great structures but if you want a phd in linguistics
today you'd better be going to them to learn one of their clicking languages or the messai who can
control you know 200 head of cattle with their interspecies linguistics and so on so those are
not great buildings but those are actual processes that now human beings want to use it in fact
it's people in the machine learning and ai area so the most advanced western
disciplines who are going into these places now to study the linguistics of these ancient
ancient people so you're absolutely right and i wouldn't want to leave that impression and i
i think it's a good point to make in addition to that i will say this though that for those
who thought that great civilization were important is a sort of dishonesty about about
this because the framing of people at that time on the african continent was that they were not
advanced yet you know we see as i say diplomacy we've been in and then been in finally cut off the
portuguese for slaves and cut off their trading with the portuguese no no argument just they were
self sustained and self satisfied and so on and did not feel that they gained any advantage
by dealing with the portuguese and this is what gave uh henry the navigator the idea that he had
to come up with another another concept and needed another papal boat but before we get to that
for those of you listeners who want to review the case you can look at the pre-egyptian societies
in the sudan um as examples of one type of civilization so to speak you can look at uh
places like borough whale or the great zimbabwe uh an area called you can look at a great zimbabwe
right in what is now zimbabwe so all the way down the nile and then uh below the lumpoko river and
so on you can see uh great civilizations which existed uh long before uh the european the european
uh incursion uh shroda is another great city something called the swahili construct which
is a series of uh swahili speaking and uh uh uh countries or or small kingdoms along the east
coast in what is now tanzania that that entire area so for those persons who believe as you point
it out and in a kind of obscenism that that these kinds of societies where where not only
examples of progress and other philosophers can't hume all believed that these were this was an
example you know writing systems big buildings art you know all these sorts of things this was proof
of civilization and i'm saying that proof was there that proof it was ignored
and this is the second great deception so we said the first great deception is is uh
henry the navigator attempting in some way to uh to ingratiate himself to uh to the popes and the
if you think about uh this period in european history uh pope he goes to then to pope martin
and he gets another um uh he gets another henry the navigator gets another um
um uh papal bull this time that specifically gives the concession to the portuguese king
as opposed to the spanish king and these bulls come all the way down to to uh in in in 1444
there is a what would be called a treaty and this treaty lays out because of the papal bulls
now they're free to do business and this treaty lays out all the dominion now of the portuguese
uh of the portuguese side and then in uh i think it was um uh 1455 that uh you get the uh the
papal bull that changes everything that literally gives portugal the right to enslave people from
the african continent in perpetuity and then the final this i think is a critical piece as
you had mentioned that historically uh many cultures including european cultures enslaving
other european cultures where there was no difference of race um greeks enslaving greeks
that the main reasons for enslavement were either debt so like a peonage enslavement system
some types of crime um where that was a punishment to kind of work the crime off
and war but that unlike this later system there were limits on that slavery and you were starting
to mention some things of limits of rape and like that but there was also that it was not a
forever system that's right i want to make sure that you make that clear so that the the kind of
rights that one group one kingdom inside of the continent of africa may have had with a warring
tribe that they conquered inside the continent of africa who would not have both considered
themselves africans any more than two european groups at war would have themselves europeans
they would have been you know vikings and frenchmen or whatever it was um that they would have had
binds on what that slavery was that when the slavery that was sold changed completely and
i think that's one of the key cases we're building well that you're precisely right about that and
the the people bull which changed everything uh was called romanus pontifex
in 1455 and now and there are a couple of things to say about that number one it became international
law because the the spanish kingdom sorry the portuguese kingdom lived in a competitive
area of the world and it became international law and as a side note you can kind of understand
henry the eighth when he uh destabilizes or disestablishes the catholic church in the uk
this frees him from the international law imposed on spain and the other catholic powers
uh in respective portugal so that's something to bear in mind and that's important to bear in mind
uh because of the relationship between elizabeth the first and her pirateers who end up fighting
the stain on the fighting stain on open waters and capturing slaves uh to bring them to the
united states but before we get there so romanus pontifex happens and this produces essentially
a free-for-all and as you said i just want to make sure we we close that point and that is
do not if you're thinking africans sold their brothers for slavery if you happen to be black
and you think that this is the wrong idea they didn't know each other in the way that we talk
about if you're from the caribbean if you're from you know wherever it is that your brothers or if
you have a white friend who's close to you and you two share you know you say that's my brother
that didn't exist in that way they didn't know each other they never referred to each other as
africans you referred to yourself within the context of your particular tribe the mobility of
which unlike say the sand people right who had been part of the great migration 1500 years ago
you know from near marley and morocco all the way down to the corner of africa most of the tribes
were not peripatetic right you had the the bedowins and the berbers and so on up in the north but
for the most part in the sub-sahara uh they were not peripatetic they were gathered around
watering holes largely or the ocean and that's where people lived and so on and they you know
africa is vast so they lived you know some miles from one another and if you look at the footprint
of where slavery where where the slaves came from you're looking at places that are now
sort of between guinea bissau right uh senegal that area all the way down to angola
so this is a very small small footprinted area um and uh i mean the the the
arab trade enslaved was many times larger many many times larger the difference here was
you were being enslaved outside of a historical context with a new set of people under a chattel
framework all right uh that didn't allow strangers may sound uh people who were enslaved in the in
that uh that arab logistical corridor in uh west africa were sometimes sold to other
africans in the north but still in africa right egypt tunisia you know these sorts of places
morocco and so on so there was a chance that they could return to their to their home you could
trek where you were going to uh as people would have seen from the amistad is a wonderful scene
in the film where when the the uh the enslaved is asked where are you from and the gentleman
steps back a little bit he steps back all the way into the shadows until he disappears and he says
this is where i'm from and so the i thought that was an interesting uh way to to to depict the
psychological impact of someone now inferring the newness of the place that they have now encountered
by by by force so that's an important thing to note uh the other thing to note is that
once romanus pontifex is taking place what we usually call the slave trade we have to change
really change our reference point uh to that this was a guns four slaves four commodities trade
so you bring the guns small tribal kingdoms you you meet the first tribal kingdom of course i'm
just giving a scenario here that tribal leader says no i don't want your weapons you know
i don't want to kill people i don't i don't really want to do that you go to the next one you say
listen he bought a lot of guns from me so he's going to attack you you'd better buy guns from me
to protect yourself so first it becomes a protection thing so you have this uh multipolar trap
that you find yourself caught in which you uh Daniel this is yes go on this important to just
underscore um so as we're going as the gunpowder revolution is kind of advancing and it's advancing
disproportionately more in europe than this in africa absolutely from this like 1300 to 1600
time period the asymmetry in weaponry is becoming much more significant so where um the spaniards
or the portuguese might have taken a long time to make a certain degree of progress once the
british really got involved coming in and they were coming with lots of effective ballistics
that's right changed everything completely and then it's really a racket that they're doing
because they're like we sell guns to one side of a rival rival tribe and then go to the other ones
and say you have to have them to protect yourselves right but it's basically a protection racket
that we drove by introducing asymmetric weapons right and so they have to get the weapons and
then they trade us the slaves for the weapons right obviously you'll see what the rest of it is
but that's another thing where it's like they didn't really have a choice because at the moment that
we introduced that degree of asymmetric weaponry between tribes that might war with each other but
have a certain binding on the ethics of their war with each other based on long historical context
we break their whole historical context and force them into our terms that's right and so now they
can't survive without without these weapons and so it moves from a protection thing to an ambition
to a status-making proposition so it's no longer about protection now rival tribes want the guns
because they want to be larger so they don't they don't want it for protection anymore
it's now part of an ambition who it seems like there is this through line right protection
and necessity into ambition because the ambition is to get ahead of them of the race the arms race
but if you weren't trying to get ahead of it you could forecast you would definitely lose
at it because the other guy's trying to get ahead yes absolutely no the the the the the the
multipolar trap remains as an animating force in all the relationships at that point and so
this begins and the other thing that the viewers might wish to to to think about and you mentioned
Betty Wood who wrote a wonderful book which neither of us can remember the name of but we love it so
much a very small book maybe 120 pages on slavery in colonial america and uh it's a beautiful book
and this is one of the things she points out she does she's a careful enough scholar to think
about the change to the anthropology sociology and psychology of the people from the african
continent when they are put into this mix so the origins of american slavery yes absolutely so if
we're speaking uh at the moment about uh uh people on the continent and we're accusing them
and some countries angola has apologized to um in 2016 africa has five regions north south east
west central and uh 54 countries well the by resolution the african union uh in in in 2016
created a sixth region and a 55th country called the um the country of the diaspora
now there's an argument there that every human being is a member of this diaspora
right because you can and this is the some of the conflict we have when people make these
arguments on the one hand you say everyone is from africa but when we say the diaspora we're
speaking in national terms which were invented by the colonialists right denying mother africa so
to speak for a full panoply of humanity which uh which should be assigned to us anyway that was done
and uh the idea there during that period angola and about four other countries apologized
to the diaspora for selling them but they used the language of a brotherhood and they didn't seem
to recognize or didn't seem to argue and this this gets the reason now some people will say well
i think that's nice or i think that you know that's gracious or you know whatever have you yes
but we should always try to get history in in its proper context because the narrative that we use
at that end is going to bleed through when it's come time for the solutions and then we'll have
a very difficult time sort of crafting the solutions if we're depending on a narrative which
while it feels good is actually inaccurate you know so this is this is profoundly important so
so you have that situation now you have the rival risk situations of you know kingdom against kingdom
and so on and uh uh you now have the uh the slave trade everybody knows about the slave trade uh uh
and uh the but now we know about the guns for commodities for slaves of commodities and so on
in a triangle that uh that that that that moved people uh 12 and a half million people to the
united states to what was then america um but it moved close to uh four or five time stats uh
two places like brazil the starting point was actually uh one of the main starting points was
nevis where alexander hamilton was born uh and then barbedos which was a very significant plantation
and then jamaica and these were largely so so human beings arrived in these places as cargo
sugar was the main thing that left right sugar was the main thing and the united states was
cotton and then tobacco right so these were the commodities that were the most uh uh the
the most uh important and so it then uh cycled to jamaica and then uh of course uh
nasol was impossible to either maintain slavery or maintain plantations or maintain anything
since it's mostly limestone and very shallow and the the because it's very shallow and very low
at the sea level uh you don't have very good soil for any kind of growing and so it became a pastoral
colony uh and as people have seen i'll reference the film again just in case people haven't read
the books but pirates of the caribbean you see that the fight for nasol is uh uh mostly piracy
because of the the archipelago uh that uh those islands are and then hati saint domingo
was the big had 36 000 plantations hati did and this was run by the french and so you see
the caribbean was was split into these various areas uh as well and all the european powers had
their little dominions constant fights between the french and the and the spanish even though
in in 14 in the 1490s a treaty was made called the pope's line the pope's line and in the pope's
line because the portuguese the the spanish had said to the pope how we are members of the church
as well how can you give all this dominion to portugal and leave us out of the equation they
then divided up things between themselves and what is now north america was spanish at first
north america and then south america was portuguese at least brazil was and then smackerings the
british were sort of picking off small places around the caribbean and this is how the the
structure was developed the salient period or the salient moment uh was the arrival of some people
in in uh in 16 19 into the american setting now there have been lots of discussions about that
about whether or not uh this was the first landing of slaves this is actually quite a complex
complex situation and and i mentioned all this stuff about uh the europeans and what's going on
and some kids nevis what's going on in barbados jamaica right the united states or america at the
time because there's a unique legal situation going on i wrote an essay about the reception of
english common law into the 13 colonies and it was one of the most complex jurisprudential
documents you know uh to put together uh because for instance while it was a british uh america
america was was british uh the difficulty was that uh british law was made and basically imposed
in the colonies by the lord proprietors who were given grants by the king so america was not seen
as part of the jurisprudence of britain going up to their to their privy council
which is part of the house of lords and so on but going up to their high courts and so on this is
very very important and so in 16 19 you have a ship uh sorry you have at the time a governor
called governor i think it's argil who is the governor of jamestown and uh but there are two
fiends one is a cousin to the palace uh his name is hawkins and the other one is warwick
and they are uh pirateers who conspire and they say wait the situation is anomalous so
there's a war going on you've got the spanish using dot ships or the british war against spain
largely because spain's dominion given to them by the pope does not apply to britain so and then
we are british north america so what we can do is we can raid spanish ships and appear to be
fighting spain which means that our british king will not find us offensive
and then whatever happens with the cargo we get paid because nobody's going to argue if we're being
cargo of value into this new american setting and so this is how these 20 plus odd as it was
described in a letter uh persons arrived uh black persons from the continent of africa arrived now
here's the thing they were not slaves in the legal sense they couldn't be because they were baptized
and under english law no christian could be enslaved you had a similar thing in france with
the code noir which created all the problems of Haiti because it wasn't christian though the french
were a little bit more personal about it if you were french you could not be enslaved so uh so each
country as i say had these little uh uh niches of legal and jurisprudential uh uh limitations that
could be exploited and so these people were landed they were indentured so for all intents
and purposes they were enslaved because they couldn't go anywhere they couldn't buy their
passages away they couldn't escape they couldn't none of that and so there they were on this landscape
now in this new setting and many of them negotiated indentured contracts and things of that sort
and and they were accommodated because nobody intended at the time that they should be slaves
in perpetuity they were already growing free blacks in uh in america at the time and one free
black became very very important to this story now as i said for those of the listeners who are
thinking to themselves but surely they felt they must have those was 20 plus odd blacks must have felt
like slaves right they wherever they came from they were either sold the slaves or stolen
kidnapped so that's one their take they didn't look on you know hawkings or warwick
and say to themselves oh my god rescue when they were taken uh to to uh to america
what they would have found that uh there was kind of benign uh non agency that they experienced
there but they could negotiate uh terms of their labor they had times to work and all that kind
of thing on the regular indentured contract now there there's some things to note the indentured
service program had occurred uh about 16 to 18 years before in england in 1601 they had passed
what are called the poor laws and the poor laws were kind of an apprenticeship law and this shows
you how the anomalous nature of the application of law at the time to get people off the streets and
get them into productive labor so the routine was that someone could they had to volunteer to
become an apprentice if they didn't volunteer if you were a prisoner you were just made an
apprentice to make yourself productive in society right if they didn't send you to australia first
right and um what eventually happened was people were just being kidnapped off the street
and me and then we're talking about europeans you know were kidnapped off the street and
put it in because the the profiteers could and private they could argue
that they were following the poor laws so the indentured program was itself
if you like uh problematic from the very beginning so it was not a safe position
to be in and therefore changes to that position were not difficult to contemplate
and in the 17th century in the united states from about 1639 to 1690
the life of blacks in america changed completely absolutely and completely
and this began there were little skirmishes here and there but the real situation was
antony johnson a uh a uh well you had john punch and john punch was an indentured servant
uh and he ran away along with two europeans and when they were caught the europeans were
punished by having their indenture extended and he was made to serve indefinitely
that's the key thing indefinitely
in 1655
a black man named antony johnson
had a white and a black indenture and
they left to begin another service and johnson was saying no i have the right to their service
and the court ruled that in the case of the john one john casor ca s or
that antony johnson had the right to his service for life
between that period and 1690
you had a transition uh
rights of blacks or privileges if you want to call them that for being taken away so
uh they couldn't own property so that that changed the uh the status of the mother
became the status of the child and that locked in lifetime servitude
fortune and the reason for that is because i i actually refer to it as the free rape strategy
because if you rape a woman before then the children were yours as per the the french
situation but this was the opposite of the code noir because it said that the the
status of the child passed through the mother and this meant that if the mother was enslaved
that the child was enslaved but then if the mother was quite indentured that the child was
indentured as well so there was no escape and and you saw the so the shackles the anti-freedom
the loss of liberty was growing by a progression what what what financial people call stacking
it was a stacking going on so just to um wreak have a couple things with regard to
this question of uh multiracial kids if a white man and a black woman had a baby versus if a
black man a white woman had a baby how do you deal with it when that law got formalized that
it's the status of the mother there was now a situation where um if there was a black female
slave all of her children including by rape including by whether from black men or white
men would all be owned by whoever owned her absolutely now incentivizing the maximum amount
of rape was highly profitable because you could either use those slaves or sell them absolutely
and to just get a sense of like how mind-blowingly gruesome that is
then to go back and say you're making a case that is exactly the opposite of the Hobbesian case
and exactly opposite of the kind of pinker way of thinking about things which is the history got
progressively better that it's always been nasty and yes there were nasty things in the past but
like I think a lot of people who don't have a deep study of history who grew up in the United
States think before 18 before the Emancipation Proclamation just seems like ancient history
like some before 1776 like why would anyone even go go back that far and that there was probably
worse slavery they jump straight to Genghis Khan type examples and assume that it was bad but it's
been getting progressively better and you're actually painting an opposite story in which case
the slavery was way less bad and got progressively worse and there was a process codifying slavery
in America and then in the Americas the Caribbean in the Americas and then specifically slavery in
the United States and then specifically black slavery as opposed to other forms of non-racial
slavery in the United States that became discontinuous with the way that most slavery
practices historically had been and much worse where it did reify because it needed some continuity
it reified a version of Aristotle and a version of Papal bulls but like the worst ones with the
worst motivated reasoning that now had nothing to do with the captures of war and had nothing to do
with debt and had everything to do with a permanent breeding labor class for economic
competition right and that's the point that I think is really critical that you're constructing and
if anyone is just getting lost in the fact that it's a lot of details and obviously for every
detail that Gilbert is sharing there's a thousand relevant ones that he's you know trying to avoid
you know that are important is that the American slavery case and the U.S. slavery case and the
racialization of the slavery is actually unique and particularly problematic and so I want we're
going to continue on that arc right wanting to kind of brush stroke where we're going absolutely I
think that's a fantastic way of seeing it and and the reason is because here's some head swinging
some head swinging propositions to make the case about how slavery America the American version
survived because now race race has become central to the question we're now defining a specific set
of people as non-human now where does that come from lower than human what does that come from so
in 1570
Abraham Ortillas creates a map cartography was drawing because the and and here's the thing
that people talk about the value of whether slavery produced and slavery produced value
you wouldn't have had global shipping were it not for enslavement so cartography grew
in many respects I'm not going to say it's absolute but there's a wonderful book by
a fellow I think his name is David
Immer Immerwah or something anyway he wrote a book called how to hide an empire
I can't remember his name um a beautiful but amazing book and he demonstrates that the
cartography of the United States is almost completely motivated by race
almost the reason that they don't take all of Mexico is because they were like there's too
many brown people there we let's take this portion and that's enough right the reason
that Puerto Rico has one status and Hawaii has another is because there were more Caucasians
in Hawaii at the time compared to Puerto Rico where you had this massive group of
brown people which whose behavior were unscrupulous so you you have these issues now
or Abraham Ortillas when he makes this map he he he has artwork you know people will know
if you if you if you if you if you live in the UK if you go to university in the UK
the books the great texts even Darwin's origin or species they have something in it called a
frontest piece which is like a beautiful decorated page with a dedication to the king or something
like that with ornate artwork all around it so here this map did not take the entire
page it's just two circles and then excuse me on the top of the map this Europa and the bull
right the bull of Europa and a lady a beautiful elegant lady looks like Botticelli's Venus or
something like that and then over on the other side is the Asiatic and they have someone
representing all women there's a woman representing her and she is in beautiful colors
like we're in a you know traditional dress so and and then they have the the India and then they
have Africa at the bottom what's significant is Africa is at the bottom so already this map is
beginning to say it's filling in the Aristotle and the Aquinas you know this open category that
they've left based on civilizational advancement and all these sorts of things plus there's the
dominance that's going on in West Africa at the moment and nobody is saying hey it's a guns
first for the enslaved for commodities trade and there's a rival risk proposition that's
being exacerbated on the continent so they're not actually losing or they're not actually just a
bunch of disagreeable people who can't behave something is happening to them no one says that
it just says those people always warring and so on killing each other but here we are you know
living in a great civilization and so we have advanced more than they have because again you
know here we are then how does this get reified who what happens here well it turns out that
David Hume part of the Scottish Enlightenment right great philosopher David Hume it tells
a story that a man is said to be very intelligent but the fact that he is black
is a clear proof that he is merely parroting what he's heard before
now this is a this is coming from not some vicar you know in Burmese you know in Britain
this is David Hume friend of Adam Smith friend of Thomas Reed who I think Jefferson read more
than he read Hume actually Orlock um friend of Dr. Johnson and understand this Dr. Johnson had a ward
a young man who when he died Dr. Johnson left all of his books and all of his money to this
young black man so it's not like Hume was estranged from the experience in fact when
Hume died he was an atheist and Dr. Johnson who was a terrible wit went to see him to ask him
whether or not he believed in God now he was going to hell and Hume gracious even unto death
aristocratic even unto death so they knew each other that way so and Johnson did not treat
this young man like a slave he was as well dressed as Johnson he educated him all these sorts of
things so is it that that Hume looked at and said well he's just parroting Johnson
or is it that he just believed that in a general sense but either way he wrote it
now I don't understand and I'm not sure if you can tell me
I don't understand how after they knew of the pyramids in Egypt and they knew of the
whatever they knew of the great Nile traditions how they could say something like that because
they were in some ways I mean obviously there was some gruesome motivated reasoning
but they were also trying to be men of natural philosophy and science and the architecture
that is involved in those buildings obviously did not come from parroting white people and
involves very very complex science how how did they think that well this is what's really
interesting is that the enlightened voices at the time would say things like
it's not a question of whether we built better buildings than they did
they've been buildings that were suitable to their environment and we built the ones
suitable to our environment but they got things from us and we got things from them
down in great Zimbabwe they were influenced by by Egyptian architecture
but Egyptians were influenced by Sudanese
right so and all of them were counter influenced in later years by Europeans
and that kind of thing so human history really is a knitting together a confluence of influences
rather than any self-generated influence such as we like to think of the lonely
artist who just comes up with genius on his own right you can just look at the work of
Picasso and know that that that's not true so Hume I don't want to paint a bad picture of Hume
I want people to just know what he said and understand it now when I was teaching
in the african-american studies department at George Mason I didn't teach anything particularly
african-american so to speak because it was my view that all of human history
belong to all human beings so if I teach Hume a student then says to me
how can you teach that racist dead white male my point is well is that an argument
against him you can say he was naughty or terrible or whatever have you that's not an argument
the real argument against him is in Hume's philosophy which is an anti-epistemological
philosophy meaning Hume didn't think it's much more complex than I'm going to say but Hume
didn't think we could justify our knowledge he was a skeptic right so that means Hume believed
that you could not by induction meaning looking at something know anything
Bertrand Russell who is very funny and in his great big book which you know when I was the
boy I read that book maybe 10 or 11 times the history of western philosophy because it was
so funny he has so many funny moments in there and he says what Hume is basically saying is
that if you eat an apple every day and it tastes like an apple that's no guarantee
that tomorrow when you bite the apple it won't taste like meat right and then he wrote another
book the ABC's of relativity where he's talking about the subatomic world and how the table appears
smooth but really the table has mountains and crevices at you know the subatomic level and so
and it's splitting apart and rotting and you know all these kinds of things which you cannot see or
experience so basically what he's saying about Hume is the core of Hume's philosophy
is that you cannot secure your knowledge by saying that you experienced it you experienced X
but here is Hume listening to someone speaking and deciding absolutely that person's capacity
and his complete humanity not just him but the entire race to which he belongs
that's the argument against Hume that he offended his own philosophical treaties
and that's how we have to argue in the you don't have to say he's a terrible man he's a
dead white male and so on what we have to do is to be able to look at his core arguments and say
his arguments may be valid on the philosophical side but in fact he offended them and therefore he
must be put to the question Hume scholars must be put to the question why don't they write about
that as a significant breach of his own theory right so there's a there's a performative contradiction
which he is an extreme epistemic skeptic in most contexts so any place where he makes a definitive
statement would seem to go against a general grain of his epistemic skepticism absolutely yes
and he makes a very definitive statement about the cognitive capabilities and dispositions of
people's black skin or african descent or however he described it and so you can't know about apples
but you can know about black people he probably had much more experience of the apples than and
so then one asked to say if he is rationally thinking about the limits of epistemology and comes
up with his general view why then does he violate it with this performative contradiction in this
area is there some deep motivated reasoning or some identity complex or something that has him
be against himself in this way right right no it is it raises quite quite quite deep into
profound questions the same thing unfortunately applies to Kant who many people will argue that
Aristotle and Kant the two greatest western philosophers that ever there were and Kant
says there is a man who is black from head to toe and this alone is a clear proof that he is stupid
so it's a it's a stunning you know there's no escape you don't have any room to convince this
person of another thing why is this important Kant actually teaches he's a philosopher but in those
days geography had the role of sociology and some elements of history and he taught geography for
his entire career so Kant would have seen the otelius map and all the other cartography which
followed otelius abraham otelius after 1570 and Kant makes this statement similar to humans
that that merely knowing that this man is black you can already conclude so basically this is
a priori knowledge which according to his philosophy is impossible to know from mere induction
right from mere observation now what's really significant there
is this Kant not only offends his epistemological thesis
he also offends he and john lock have come to the same conclusion that
the subjugation of the negro is appropriate because he has come essentially come from a culture
and Kant writes this in his essay the sublime and the beautiful everybody every philosopher wrote essays
like that sublime and the beautiful it's part of the critique of judgment so judgment is the estimation
of things and so on and but Kant has something called a categorical imperative
and it has two planks one plank is treat others in such a manner that if you universalize that
treatment the world would be a better place so behave towards others in such a way that if
everybody behaved that way the world would be a better place clearly this statement doesn't fit that
number two he says human beings should be ends in themselves rather than needs to
well you're setting up this situation where blacks can't be humans yes absolutely so
so it's a it's a serious serious problem where we find this problem resonating in
the americans and so now we're fully in the american set is with thomas jefferson
and thomas jefferson is the most frustrating human being to read because thomas jefferson
says the absolute right thing on opposite sides of the same argument constantly right
so if you want to read a justification for slavery you you read thomas jefferson if you want to
read a denunciation of slavery you read thomas jefferson go on before we get into jefferson
and the founding fathers and the declaration i want to close up something on the philosophical
antecedents that they're going to draw upon right so we are an hour and 40 minutes or something like
that into this conversation and have not actually gotten into the united states of america even
existing yet let alone post-slavery and house systemic injustice is still happening but you're
setting up something really important which is if we don't agree on the history and don't
understand the history well it's very hard to agree on our current state assessment in which
case it's very hard to move forward and i know that from Aristotle to the popes to human cons
these were all structures that ended up being utilized for what's going to get set up which
is a form of slavery in which the human rights are stripped from people associated with race
in a way that previous slavery didn't have and which makes the case so pernicious which also ends
up making how it's how it has continued here so pernicious i'm just i'm just thinking as you're
like it's almost like if someone was not thinking critically you could see some grand
multimillennial white conspiracy from Aristotle it was obviously not christian to popes to again
like humans and atheists to Aquinas across from spaniards to portuguese to british to
colonialists where the americans could fight a war against the british but agree with them on
supremacy of race it like it almost seems like that but when we go back and look at it when
Aristotle was talking about natural slaves he was mostly not talking about a racial consideration it
was some Greeks were natural slaves to other Greeks it's just that concept got drawn on and when
the papal bull was made for the portuguese navigator it was really a catholic versus muslim
fight as to how it was framed right and so it's not that as conspiracies often are it's not that
there was actually this kind of great coordination it's that all of the useful things got to be sown
together by the later economic motivated reasoning and that's the end of the case
that you're building that building blocks for is that correct yes absolutely at the
london school of economics when you study politics they warn you all the time that what seems like
extraneous uh political considerations can set up and metastasize later into real central problems
so if you take i mean we're we're we're off a little bit but if you take things like
global mandates from organizations like the g20 or the complete shutdown of the world
you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist if you study politics political science of
london school of economics they warn you that when governments find that they can do something
then they find a way to do it because that's just another area of power and people have
given says this in book volume four of the clan full roman empire that once a power has been
experienced it will be experienced again that nobody's going to walk away from that and say
i didn't like how that felt you know unless you're the most sort of extreme democrat
um or a libertarian who you know has read uh fredrig Hayek i suppose but so so you're absolutely
right and let us just remember this complex between the uh the plentitudeist potist status
of the pope which is the pope's global power right and uh the distinction between the british
and uh and the spanish and the portuguese um but when we come to to cant to hewin cant
jefferson of obviously hegel uh argued this is wellvoltaire as well you know all these
sorts of people believed in the did they create a great civilization you know do they have a
chancelizé right do they have right books like candide right you know uh and if they and you
know where what country actually is the instantiate of the fulfillment of all these things that the
europeans believe are imprimatures of civilization it's russia from peter the great to the president
it's russia and even though uh leo tolstoy had a great influence on many so tolstoy influenced
gandy tolstoy influenced schopenhauer the mystical elements of schopenhauer's work
are all influenced by tolstoy the first 40 pages of war and peace were written in french
because tolstoy thought that was more aristocratic
right peter the great also tried to mimic the cities that he saw in europe so this idea of
great cities and great writing and so on are you know the proper parties cattillions these
sorts of things are emblems of civilization that is a very provocative and profoundly
infectious way of thinking right and jefferson had that in spades himself so if you think about
monticello with his constant refurbishing jefferson was always broke always always always
i told you before we came on he has something in common with the the rapper who gets the first
album and then goes out buys a bmw or the basketball player who gets the first contract and
goes out and buys a super expensive car in jefferson's case of course it was books and
things like that huge trunks of books and ben franklin who was a more prudent fellow
would constantly joke with jefferson about his his spending habits well beyond his needs
but every time jefferson traveled he wanted to give the image of being a country squire
and one example jefferson writes that the black is inferior right let's remember
huam's relationship with dr johnson and his amenuance is the young black man
but when a french orchestra came to to play at jefferson's home
he he begged them to remain for several months so they could teach
members of his slaveholding crew to learn to play so that when he puts on his dinner parties
he could say i have my own private orchestra you're using the very brains of the people you
say have no brains to promote yourself as being a squire and so one understands a pernicious
argument where a fellow says uh blacks are inferior i need to say that because i don't
want to give them any hope because i don't want them to run away i need to keep them a
state that's that's one type of thing but is that what he's doing we don't we don't we don't
know it's it could take a massive uh a psychological study so jefferson has read lock
and i'm afraid everyone who knows me knows i'm not not a fan of lock at all right um
um but he he read thomas reid who i thought was the greatest of the
Scottish Enlightenment philosophers and thomas reid's philosophy is a common sense philosophy
which most embodies jefferson's positive thinking and uh because of jefferson's
penning of the declaration of independence and you know the uh the excursions to the west
which he which he authorized and and and oversaw the building of monticello the other writing was
the farming manual with in his notes on virginia and president um there's no doubting that jefferson
is part of the he's not just a founding father he is sort of in that top four of what is held to
be the founding fathers and students struggle with this when they find out you know jefferson had a
relationship with sally hemmings but she was 14 beginning when she was 14 so he's writing at the
same time that that she many people might not know that who sally hemmings was well sorry sally
hemmings is a young slave bureau who who belongs to jefferson and then he he uh he basically beds her
and she becomes his companion now there are historians like joseph ellis and a couple of others
who rejected this idea saying that jefferson would never have done that
and uh he uh there's one point at which uh i think is joseph ellis who said jefferson was just too
moral for that and then uh the evidence came out that he did in fact have a long standing
relationship and children with this young girl and we have said how do you talk about this how
do you talk about winston churcho right who oversaw you know slaughter in in uh i think it's gallipoli
and then a famine uh which he calls the indian subcontinent and said many many i mean absolutely
brutally racist things did not want to let colonies go call again the kafir and all these
kinds of things and you're sitting there as a young whether you're black or white but obviously
if you're black you know it's kind of you're telling me to treat your lecturing about this man as a
piece of hero and at the same time he's saying these things which diminish me and you and i
daniel and spoken about this about the difference between the good man and the great man and jefferson
was a great man you cannot take that away from him the his his intellectual abilities his curiosity
the range of his interests and so on he's a great man winston churchill
during the second first of all had the courage to see adolf Hitler coming when nobody else did
that's one number two uh he convinced his country that they could win
and he convinced america to enter the war on the british side two big one political one diplomatic
two big feats if you had any doubts about that in the middle of a war he writes the history
of the english-speaking people and wins a Nobel prize for literature right he wins a Nobel prize
for peace but oh by the way if you had any doubts about that he enters the paris grand prix for
watercolors under a pseudonym and wins for his watercolors right he was constantly broke
so he had to write articles all the time oris johnson attempted to pattern himself after churchill in
this way um christopher hitches probably had the better of the two experiences writing articles
of the last minute which turned out to be masterpieces and so churchill did that so churchill is a
great man who may not have been a good man jimmy carter is a good man who as president never
became a great man but his goodness was so good that it made him great such as you see him doing
all this work for the poor now i think if we use that instead of dead white males we could
we could extract from the person real value while recognizing
their failures because we're not saying these are follies like all human beings are imperfect i've
heard people say that too as a defense these are not imperfections these are vinalities right these
are outside the pale these are vinalities and moreover they're contradictory and and if we
want to be able to embrace someone like jefferson even a uh i found this problematic with george
washington because he's presented as the pure version of american humanity compared to
thomas jefferson but washington does something that i find almost unforgivable when colin
capernick was doing the kneeling a friend of mine who was in the us military he says to me
with gilbert you know my colleagues and i we bled for that flag so that flag really is us and i
said no no no it starts no no no you've got that there are people who identify with that flag
much more than you they they are way more patriotic than you and not because you don't want to be
you just are not in the circumstance where you can exercise that level of patriotism
and so of course he said to me well who could that be and i said to him the slaves
who fought for george washington against the british who would have freed them
for someone who had enslaved them and then re-enslave them after the revolutionary war
this is before we go back to jefferson and great man not good man and the ability to
hold the complexity so that we don't reduce history into one or the other of the two reductionist
narratives and before we go into why the declaration of independence is so complicated
for anybody of african-american descent this thing about the american revolutionary war
and the slaves fighting and then moving on into the civil war and all the way into world war one
this was something i hadn't known when i started to look into it and it's it's such a fucking huge
part of understanding it can you just elaborate a little bit yes absolutely i mean if you think about
if you think about uh it's a key it's a really key point but it runs through
it runs through if you if you read people like uh philip curtain on the plantation system
right or jean genovese you read uh wb dupois on on black reconstruction you begin to see
some of the uh psychological fallout of attempting to make this commitment
in the cognitive neuroscience of it we we human beings are constantly attempting
to to find more than a marginal likelihood of a particular outcome okay that sounds
complicated what do i mean if you live in a society that's organized according to laws
rather than kings or men it should be relatively predictable right
within a certain band it should be relatively predictable this if you go into your house there
things in your moving around your house it's generally predictable you actually don't have to
have a high cognitive uh exercise yourself at a high cognitive level in order to move around
your house because you you you are familiar with it you know what to expect
the experience from 1619 i would say to the present
is that blacks could never situate themselves it seems properly in the society
and gain more than a marginal likelihood of what will happen to them in any particular situation
and there are people who have written about this ellis coast wrote a book called the rage
of the privileged class so these are people who i call them brine dumbbells so there they speak well
they dress well they're sophisticated they're knowledgeable they went to the best schools
they have some of the best jobs they're black and they're writing about the constant
shock one of the other things about cognitive neuropsychology is that
the brain is always seeking what is called a proportionality constant with the world
so you you you're not expecting surprises you drive a certain way according to the rules
people aren't supposed to run the red light that's a surprise right uh you service your car
you don't expect the tires to blow up that's a surprise so there are all these things that
people may call it taking it for granted that's a little bit too general we organize ourselves
to limit surprise we're constantly trying to limit surprise and the neuroscientist
Carl Friston speaks about this very often but if you live in a society in society of laws
and you can never seem to get by the entropy of surprise because the normal things in which you
you know where you place yourself you don't you know so i'll give you another example i didn't
finish that statement but i was surprised when i came to america as teaching at george mason
and president clinton president bush president obama was issuing medals to soldiers black and
hispanic soldiers who serve in v yet now in some cases in the second world war
who did not receive the benefits that was the so you can't make excuses for that you that's a sort of
look margin beyond a margin of likelihood that is just you can't metabolize that and feel that you're
part of the society right i met john mccain once and i asked him i said well you know how do you
having your medals when in military terms it's a brotherhood of blood patriotism and iron
and if you if we're going to believe in that right i couldn't take my medal if i know you
deserved one and you weren't given one because if you're going to have a covenant and this is
where we're getting to this is where we're going to end up if you have a national covenant
and that covenant is that those who sacrifice for the national well-being those who risk their
lives well what if the people who are risking their lives are actually slaves that the society
enslaved that's that was the question of the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa
right uh desmond tutu asked the question well we are all supposed to obey the laws of the state
but what if the state is the terrorist yeah you'll put you can't say that the citizen must
find a way and this is i think what you were referring to at the beginning where some of these
narratives are just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and you know the little engine that could
you know suck it up you know and and and deal with life as it is
yes you have to do that because in law there's something called mitigation
and if you see your house burning and you didn't burn it you have an obligation
to attempt to put fire out that's that's that's your job so mitigation is the highest point
of personal responsibility because it's actually taking responsibility for something for which you
are not responsible so every citizen has to do has to do that as their duty but that doesn't
eliminate the responsibility of the state where the state has denied that citizen a benefit
to which that citizen is entitled if i pay taxes of the united states
i pay taxes in the united states i expect the police officer or the person in the
post office or any of these places to treat me just as they would treat anyone the issue
isn't that i want special treatment the issue is i'm a taxpayer and the covenant that we've made
is that i pay my taxes right as a duty as a contribution to the state itself so
here you have jefferson sorry washington
at valley forge the soldiers before we get back to jefferson and washington because i know
we're going back there i you you said quite a lot of things that reference conversations
that we've had where i think i might have since i don't know as much of the history as you do i
might have an easier time gruesomely truncating critical parts to be able to just make sure a
couple um pearls are hit i want to just do that on a few things if you don't mind and then we'll
okay so to just make sure these parts go in there i had not known that during the civil war
that there were slaves who volunteered to fight on i mean not during the civil war
during the american revolutionary war slaves on both sides some ended up going and fighting
with the british but some fought on the american side against the british even though the british
were already getting rid of slavery before the us were and even though when the us and
setting up the declaration of independence all men are created equal and a constitution and could
have easily said slavery was a british thing we're done with it now it's we're done with britain
they didn't they doubled down on it and in finding their constitution imagine being a slave who had
been treated so gruesomely already now generationally who says you know what as an act of good faith i'm
going to fight side by side with these people risk dying with them because afterwards they'll
return the favor and say hey i'm going to free you and let's do this thing together and then they
just re enslave you afterwards and then to have that happen again in the civil war and to have it
happen again in the world war one and where there is no act of good faith that is ever paid back well
across the whole population it's almost every act of good faith on behalf of the black population
is violated right and then after the emancipation proclamation finally happens it doesn't really
enslave you just moves the system to this weird kind of um peonage system where now being black
just becomes illegal since the 13th and 14th amendment give the possibility of slaving for that
yes and the part that you told me so and that i again i hadn't known of how intense the reconstruction
effort was after emancipation that whether we're talking about black wall street or what happened
in 50 different cities right that the most intensive effort for a people to educate themselves police
themselves hold themselves up by their bootstraps generate economic welfare in somebody else's
culture that they did that and then were externally bombed by larger military forces the people
who were black who got into positions of mayor or senator were assassinated right there does come
a point where you're like fuck how long telling the pull yourself up by your bootstrap story
when that's happened so much and it never doesn't get betrayed and this is where this is where when
we get to the current pissed off woke perspective right if someone doesn't know that history they're
just like dude why are you so upset yes and the problem there i'll give you this sets it out
bold relief so i'll cover all the points that you've made jefferson has salient right and this is a
as i said a young girl uh and it's uh
lord mansfield in 1772 has elizabeth bell right she's called dita she's a black woman young woman
lord mansfield is a a judge of the british high court so fully two years three years before the
decoration of independence if you want to show the contrast
jefferson says i i want sally hemmings i have her as my my woman from the time she's a child
i'm writing a declaration of independence is there no love in my heart that i can
make this explicit that i know better than most americans the humanity of these blacks now he does
write that i fear that god is just when i think of what we've done to uh well what's the
writing that when you don't your actions your your behavior he's still a very harsh slave master who
chases after his slaves if they try to escape punishes them rather than saying i know the
withholds of your your desire for freedom lord mansfield has a war a young woman
she stays with him at his estate he adopts her jefferson says we can't let the slaves go because
it'll cause such economic turmoil and it'll be very very difficult uh to assimilate them in society
and so on i told you the story of jefferson's of sally hemmings brother who was a chef
who's jefferson's chef goes to paris he can he's being invited all over the place he he
he sets paris ablaze with his cooking his style his humanity and so on jefferson sees all of this
right and he comes back and he says to jefferson when he gets into the white house
i would like to be the chef the official you know chef of the white house at the white house
and jefferson doesn't answer and he drinks himself to death and some gutters all right he can't
believe and as you said jefferson could have just paid his passage back to france where he could
have a good life fully assured that his sister was okay doesn't happen lord mansfield is a case
is brought to him called the somerset case in this case the the british slavers and the british
had a surreptitious way of being involved so the barkleys the lords the entire board of the bank
of england almost every lord in bristol live a pool in london were all engaged in the slave
trick they they were secretly owned ships and things of that sort provided insurance provided
loans even though it was illegal in britain right but when this case came before mansfield
the plaintiff said uh uh sorry the defendant said if you rule against us many of us will
come to economic ruin mansfield judgment was let justice be done though the heavens may fall
now so on the economic side he's different the men of the same era men of the same intellect
distinction prestige mansfield with a wealth much wealthier man i mean he was what jefferson
wanted to be so that's your ambition this is the man you want to be like
he rules by conscience and says let justice be done though the heavens fall
and then he does something he makes elizabeth bell the first eras of the western world
black eras by leaving her a share of his estate
so every action he took towards her embellished confirmed and embellished her humanity
every action that jefferson took towards sally hemmey merely used her as a means to an end
although in the end she negotiated with him a settlement for her and her children
so the point you are making here is when there's so much debate around monuments made to people
who were great men but not good men currently and we think about early history one of the
arguments as they were a man of their time and you're basically saying no the best arguments
against slavery happened in ancient india and happened in ancient athens and that there have
been very good arguments against slavery by moral people for thousands of years and at the time
of american slavery there were other aristocrats and positions of high responsibility arguing
against it so it really wasn't man of the time it was a particular kind of motivated reasoning
and that it is important to hold that clearly yes and and you gotta be able to hold that
without throwing our hands up and saying i want nothing to do with jefferson you can't
avoid jefferson that's not the the real the real lesson in life whether it's in your personal life
or in political life is that you have to hold things together in yourself that are anathema
to your values and so on and be able to to maneuver them in the right way and figure
out what the lesson is in that thing so jefferson washington is a valley forge soldiers are suffering
from smallpox is a young man who's brought by an american aristocrat says this young
man has a solution for smallpox this young man shows them how to create a medical solution
for a smallpox and then inoculate members of the army at the same time there's a prussian officer
who whips the army into shape right who turns out we learn later to be a gay fellow so you have a
black and a gay saving washington's army that valley forge it's hard to process to metabolize
where the sympathy is in washington given that he had the capacity much greater than lord manstead
to put matters right in america right he had he had if you're going to say that he had the kind
of influence and he was a kind of example of people honored him in the way that they did
respected him in the way that they did you can't you can't use that as a trophy you have to ask
where has he used that as a tool the fugitive slavery act didn't washington enact that
say gay i said i think washington enacted the fugitive slavery act didn't he
which happened to be one of the particularly great absolutely and so my point is at every turn
again when you expect the more than the marginal likelihood of an appropriate behavior
you get less than the marginal likelihood of an appropriate behavior and you get a surprise
but when you are living according to principles in general there should be fewer surprises
right there should be fewer so now so now obviously more people studying us history
whether from a blue state or a red state have come to know about who george washington and
who jefferson are then lord mansfield and so there there comes to be a question where it
seems like those who are good at the game of power and good at rationalizing abuses of power
that are advantageous to them while still being able to appear moral and maybe even
be moral in other contexts that are not too costly for them end up winning and so this seems to be
kind of the beginning of where critical theory starts to say we have to reevaluate in light of
the game of power being central but that ends up coming to where we are that is so challenging in
culture at the moment so i think there might be a few more steps that you want to set up i'm just
kind of making sure you know ralph ellison writes a book a novelist great novelist writes a book
called invisible man and he's basically saying that as a black man i'm invisible the book has a scene
called the golden day right golden day there's there's a black college in the town and the head
of the college is dr bledso and dr bledso mr norton is the man who sponsors the college the
wealthy northerner who sponsors the college and dr bledso tells one of the students okay you drive
him around but you take him to the pretty part of town do not take him to where those
true negroes are right because i don't want to get in trouble basically
so mr norton sees he's driving around with the young man they take him to the pretty part of
town but then he sees someone in the field and this is a old timer you call them a black old
timer and he's in the field and mr norton says take me to him and the young man knows immediately
this is against the instructions that i was given you're not supposed to go on the other side of town
they go on the other side of town uh the the the old timer's name is true blood and that just tells
you right away you know that sounds like a guy from louisiana standing in the marshes who has
wisdoms your head can never you know you can't really hold it in your head and uh the man he
he mr norton becomes aroused so to speak i mean in every aspect of his being he cannot handle
what is being shared with him he thinks and the young man is just terrified now because
i'm in in the south at this school with a white man in my car who's out this is not good so he
drives and there's a a bar called the golden day that's why it's called the golden day scene
the golden day but on top of the bar because blacks have nowhere to go is the insane asylum
so uh they take him to this bar uh and my grandfather and his friends used to pour everything
that was one inch high in the bar into one glass and they used to call that swill
so they give him something it's the equivalent of swill
and he turns red and he's just you know i mean it's probably equivalent to gasoline at that point
they take him upstairs to the insane asylum because there is a physician of their brain surgeon
but he's completely off his rocker he's insane but they figure that's the closest thing we have
to a doctor this is a wealthy man who sponsors the college in this town we need to make sure that
he gets some medical attention after all that's who we have to go to
and the scene there is one of the most powerful in my view in the history of american literature
because the the brain surgeon says why are you sponsoring this boy's education
and Mr. Norton gives the usual spiel because i wanted to do well and so the brain surgeon basically
asked well can he replace you and this is the ultimate question you're doing all of this but
can he actually replace you if you believe in this covenant what are the limitations to this covenant
and the brain surgeon basically tells Mr. Norton i am a brain surgeon i am at the apex
of what americans regard as brilliant a scientist a physician and not only that
i served in the war and that when i came home
someone was dying i get off the ship someone's died i take my little bag and i operate on
and the the white people they beat me to convince me that just because i have this talent
doesn't mean i'm equal to them
i mean it's a it's a it's a dramatization of precisely everything that we're saying
that when he came off that boat having volunteered for a country that enslaved him
and he's also a neurosurgeon which means he's achieved the highest level of scientific training
in the medical profession it's nobody walks around calling a neurosurgeon dumb i mean that just
it just doesn't happen right and so he's at the apex of what should be respectability
and yet he finds himself chased away because there is a notion that we can't let you believe
that even though you put in the work and you made the sacrifice that you've earned anything
so we we have to come back because this is obviously a case where at this point
the racism is so gruesome but that was not the case when we started with Aristotle where
it was a different thing and so i want to come back to you've mentioned that the Declaration
of Independence is fraught because it was written by someone who raped his underage slave and
didn't give her or any of the other slaves the opportunities that he easily could have
so in one way you just want to throw the whole thing out and on the other hand the people who
are seeking a world that has the most kind of just social policy used the Declaration of Independence
as one of the best legal documents that they have it just hasn't been fulfilled as Martin Luther King
said we're just asking to build a promise right um but i think the key thing is the idea that
we became so economically wed to the slavery system and built a system that was so dependent
upon it until really the industrial revolution started and and capitalism more widely started
to make it to where we were less dependent on it which is an argument as to what actually ended
slavery and created a capitalist indentured servitude system but um that we had to do this
weird mental gymnastics that all men are created equal and that we're moral we had to make black
people not men right and that that was like that's the heart of the racial thing here that was so
key can you like go into that a little because like yes uh Daniel you're correct the Declaration
of Independence to me is like Cervantes La Mancha or Dante's Divine Comedies right or Beethoven's
Mises Celemna or you know Coltrane some kind of blue i mean i would always cry every time i read it
because it was beautiful right sorry not Coltrane uh my other states uh
it's it's and here's why if if you are a legal scholar and if you are a linguist and you are a
logician you'll read this document and understand so when Jefferson it took i refer to it as the
rational saying of the sacred that's that's how i teach it the rational saying of the sacred
so we hold these truths to be self-evident already there
they are not self-evident but the way we are going to metabolize them is as if they are
self-evident this is this is a duty we take upon ourselves to believe in narrative and moral perfection
we hold these truths so that allows the people who are non-christian they can't get away
from you know the the absolute statement that Jefferson he didn't say it is self-evident
that would have been a mistake right he says we hold these truths to be self-evident
that all men are created equal now when you say created equal you moved it from the realm
of logic and and language and you've added the divine right and endowed by their creative
with rights and alien why an alienable many of my students were confused my American students
were confused and jurisprudence they think an alienable means that your rights can't be taken away
and i will always teach this with ben franklin's statement that he who would limit his liberty
for safety or freedom will have neither or something like that well less statement is
kind of redundant because you can't live under the american proposition you can't limit your freedom
in alienable means you can't alienate not it can't be taken away from you you can't give your rights away
that's the one power over themselves that americans do not have
the power to end their rights i mean just think particularly big deal given that the previous
primary way people found themselves in slavery was through uh debt so absolutely they could give away
their rights by irresponsible spending habits absolutely you read you read all of charles
dickens and so on debtors prisons all over london and that sort of thing so so this is a profound
statement that does a an amazing logical trick and then subsumes it with divinity
and then formulates out of this a covenant that is impregnable
it's impregnable as stated right and there can be no doubt of jefferson's genius it reads beautifully
it's logical it has it it has brevity in the sense that the main statement says everything
that needs to be said all right and i i've always found it tremendous but you have to ask yourself
what and i've taken to i gave some lectures with uh with professor jeffrey steward and adrian davis
and nel painter and a group of others at the princeton mid-atlantic scholars association
between 97 and 99 and i referred to this as a moral schizophrenia that that that that the statement
is so profound that it actually it seems to me had to have been created by two separate minds
but with one mind creating that statement another mind enslaving human beings and near the bottom
in the jefferson actually blames king george saying that it was he who put us in this nasty
business of the slave trade and you read it and you're you just you're asking your human beings
in relationships psychologists always tell you they talk to you be careful of what you say there's
some things that you say that eliminates the possibility of anything rational following that
so if someone is going to make a statement like this and has slaves it eliminates the possibility
of anything rational which can be said after that right and so this is why the failure of the founding
fathers and many many americans at the front end of this period is not just a slight flaw it's not
just a tick it's an egregious breach which by now the nation should have addressed in the most
formal and formidable ways now you gave me a litany of things so you come to 1863
and then just just to be clear the nation could have said we don't have an economically viable
way to end slavery instantly where the economic disadvantage to us won't equal britain coming
back and kicking our ass or someone else and thus we have to start to phase it out but we're
going to have a process of phasing it out over a generation increasing the human rights right
right like they so it's it's also not just a theory of trade-offs right like you could say
we're in a hard position and we're still going to identify the moral vector right so you didn't
have to go with lord mansfield point let justice be done do the heavens fall you could have you had
all the power to do something you could have done something yes so now
there's always a discussion about lincoln uh it seems to me in my view lincoln was both a good
and a great man right and people talk about the lessons that they found where he was trying to set
up another a slave colony like uh liberia uh and all these sorts of things lincoln would have had
the same problem of trying to figure out where to put these people the ancient problem if we don't
believe in slaughtering people and getting rid of them how there's a there's a society running
how do you you know how do you in random i i read um tomas soul on slavery and you mentioned uh
glenn larry and uh he has a colleague uh professor john liq water and uh all both great professors
and so on and i've watched the exchanges on these issues and as i said to you it feels to me like
in america everybody has fallen into a ditch and they're arguing about who has mis-decorated the ditch
rather than how to get out of it and this is where the the argument on race and slavery has fallen
because there's never any real progress narrative progress conceptual progress right when when you
live in a country that has a governing mantra that asks its citizens to contemplate uh an ever
more perfect union so it this should be the american prayer before any public discussion
before any disagreement it should be that the end of any debate we have
should be setting us on the train to a more perfect union that really you have that there
doesn't matter that it was written by people who didn't didn't follow it
because you know it's like the nba or football people say well we didn't create this league
and this league is for all the owners and so on yeah but if you don't show up to work and you do
whatever you want you're not going to have a league you know you're not the one negotiating
television contracts you're not the one putting up the money for you know you're not doing any of
that there's an entire industry behind that and if that industry can manage to pay you a total
amount of players 35 percent of the total revenue generated even if you say you deserve more than
that the fact is they generated that much i mean you know you you have to see that so
the united states of america exists it exists right the question is whether or not even those
who feel themselves rightly victims of what has transpired over its history
whether they have what it takes to pursue a more perfect union and and here's the point
that's not a criticism because we have discussed this already that
after the emancipation proclamation you would think people who've been
enslaved in one way or the other for more than half a century or almost half a century sorry
they've had their families broken apart their wives daughters and mothers raped
right uh um they've seen a spawn of children the families are not actually in many cases
unified 50 percent of all of the slave sales broke up nuclear families remove the absolute
absolute so so the the pain is devastating excuse me and when i read uh tomas soul
and i love tomas soul he's taught me things that i'm going to mention yeah brilliant insights um
but i thought his discussion of slavery was historical malpractice
because and and i and i would say i would give him a chance to explain himself but i think
glenn larry has kind of put himself professor glenn larry has put himself in a similar situation
just arguing about wokeness without the preliminary argument for how we got there
let's go through that the logistics of that
if you say lincoln says america is that place where i work for another today
so i can work for myself tomorrow excuse me so that i may hire another to work for me the
following day now if that is the process i show diligence and initiative work for someone else
i show creativity work for myself i expand and i have another work for me and then he can repeat
or she that same process that's america all right
when the slaves are freed those enslaved are freed
they don't ask for anything they don't complain they don't demand anything
what they do is they build 52 enclaves all over the united states
they negotiate for schools
they more than 150 that i know of become public officials or congressmen or you know these sorts
of things you get all of these medical schools like maharie zavia they produce
morticians dentists physicians all these people because whites don't want to do these things
for them they create a vibrant society most people know about tulsa or rosewood or
rose point to detroit and a couple of others i have actually found that most people don't
i found that maybe now education has changed where most millennials do but um
it's amazing how many people that are gen x or older never had no idea black wall street
never heard of the bombings never heard of anything like that it's stunning because
and and the way i teach it is not just
blacks have their own things it's hey they had the right to complain to demand to what they went
out and built these things themselves so in terms of the american ethic these are the greatest
americans that have ever lived in terms of the american ethic these are the greatest americans
that have ever lived because they pull themselves up by the bootstraps pulling yourselves up from
having been a slave from both generations is different and pulling yourself up from being
poor it just it is just totally different it's a way higher degree of trauma and lack of agency
and you're doing it not just from slavery but in an atmosphere of racism right and let's try to
understand what racism is everybody has prejudices racism is not a feeling racism is a construct
is a is a is an infrastructure of power and that means that that's why when people say well
blacks are racist actually know they're prejudiced they they have prejudices just like you everyone
has prejudices but if i can apportion benefits based on race if i can impose on you based on
race if i can eliminate your ability to complain and find a solution based on race
that is racism that is more than prejudice because i still have the prejudice in me
but i'm able to do something externally that limits your chances because of my prejudice
and so they operate in this circumstance and it would be interesting to me i mean there are books
about it there's one called the burning which is a good book um but i haven't seen the kind of studies
or museum exhibitions or conferences that doesn't just merely show that they built these communities
but to understand within the terms of the american ethic what it would take for a people to come as you
would have said out of slavery and have your own insurance companies your own railways one or two
people have their own planes banks all these sorts of things with a community laid out and designed
as any gated community you can find in today's world and to do that in a wide variety of places
it seems to me every american black or white should hold that up as a model of what it means
to be america and you know this brings up why you said uh that in your idea of what the american
ethic is um Frederick Douglass was maybe the greatest american who ever lived
but again for those who don't know the history and it obviously is beyond the scope of what
we can do is we've got to wrap in this bit of time all of those great reconstruction efforts
where people took themselves out of slavery still in the presence of ubiquitous racism
figured out how to educate themselves to then be able to build whole cities and infrastructure
and wealth why we don't still see those is because they were all attacked by asymmetrically
larger forces from the outside and destroyed in a way that had no grounding in law with government
complicity and so you you had that now think about this you you come out of slavery you have
this pact where the the union army is in all throughout the south states have their chances to
and you can read about this in black reconstruction for those who who want to read it by wb du Bois
and and uh there's also a great a great series of studies by a young professor
elora de renan court uh it should read her as well on migrations to the north
and why and people just gave up people but but but why wouldn't they you've been in slavery
enslaved all this time you come out you you show the greatest exhibition of the american
ethic ever on american soil in 1877 is a presidential election and a compromise is made
and grants sully's his reputation by making this compromise with haze and the compromise is
that the the army will be pulled out of the south and as soon as that's done
slaughter takes place beginning in new orleans of of of of state senators and people like that
councilman and all those sorts of things and this continues and rosewood they burn it to the
ground uh wilmington delaware uh sorry wilmington um uh north carolina where people
don't know that there was one of these major major uh residential and commercial areas
they're built up by blacks again uh and and the hurt feelings are still there and it seems like
like they can't the state or the people there don't know how to be christians
because christianity provides the process of repentance there was some there was some very
weird i don't know the mental gymnastics involves some very weird christian considerations about
darkness yes darkness and blackness was you know that which was against the light and evil and
associated with skin color so that christians could justify the most un christianly behavior
even where christians could earlier pre emancipation enslave blacks rightly un well being christian
because it was the only way that the black who is could actually ascend to god like i i
mental i had a student when i came to america i mean i i taught him written i taught him and you
know uh and i can't i'm from the bahamas but but i came to america there was a student in the back
of my class you know they're at george mason and he said to me well you know what about the book of
filiman in the bible where it doesn't say to emancipate slaves it says treat your slaves well
and the class was in an uproar and my point to to them was no no no no no no no uproar was necessary
we're talking and so he i hadn't explained himself and i said okay so your view is that
slaves should obey their masters here's the problem if i agree with you it means you shouldn't
be in this classroom you should be back as a feudal surf somewhere in euro obeying the book of filo
and it's just one of the things we have to understand i mean you know this from game theory
me from from logic i'm a you know addition methodologist that bad arguments can never
sustain themselves they just can't right you can use power to enforce them right but even that
uh and yes a lot of damage will be done but even that in the philosophical literature certainly
for myself if you read people like an aximander and others or if you read dr king truth trust
to earth shall rise again that and he was speaking of a divine power of this an aximander was speaking
of the karmic power of truth not the divine necessarily a divine power of truth but it's
just unsustainable it's just unsustainable and so when people say things like that we've got to
engage them and rather than the outrage demonstrate why the argument is not good now i want to offer
something else first i just want to acknowledge we're at three hours and the thing that happened
last time you and i had a conversation we had to scrap it was it was five hours we didn't believe
anyone would watch it and one of our main goals was to do this quicker right and obviously we've
jumped around a bit but we have not got through the founding of the country through the civil war
or post civil war or the debt slavery or you know the amendment system or jim crow so i'm going to
just acknowledge we i believe both of us are willing to come do a second round of this yes
to address questions and do the rest of the narrative if people in the store are interested
i want to just think of how we move towards some closing thoughts so far realizing we're
going to have to make some leaps and one that i want to offer is
when you're saying let's not get outraged let's be able to have good
honest rational conversations because we want to be connected to the truth that karmically
logically divinely in all ways that's a good thing i agree and obviously that's what we're
trying to do is be able to have a conciliance perspective but this also ends up getting to
be one of the reasons that people become anti-woke as they say look at these people who are so
outraged and i'm going to throw their argument out just because they're outraged right and
so i want to just kind of steal man again where it's like what the fuck is left if in the if during
the um great rebuild effort that you're talking about they're like okay we won't educate ourselves
in the traditions that we had come from in molly or wherever we were from in africa we'll educate
yourself in your traditions and wear these clothes and educate ourselves more than you to be able to
prove the things that we need to and like that um and we'll do good faith contracts we'll create
economics what you talk about but then even if we get democratically elected we get assassinated
and even if we build the property it all gets burned down and then even if all this work happens
for a civil war to say we're not slaves anymore a loop on the 13th amendment says all we have to
is be arrested for an indefinite period of time and now we can be slaves again and a bunch of
bullshit laws like vagrancy and loitering get made for black people i'd be i'd be fucking pissed
and i would i would think that if i continued to engage in good faith with a system that had more
power that used that good faith to then fuck me over every time that i was a sucker yes and
this is where you start to see the hip hop community adopting the 48 laws of power as a bible
and being like come on don't if you don't know who the sucker in the room is it's you and so one of
the things we've talked about is you have kind of naive good faith in which case if you have less
power and you engage in good faith you get fucked then you're cynical and you're at the 48 laws level
but in here there is no good answer for the world game theoretic in a way that with more tech does
end in a war of all against all right and then you have to become post-synical so there's a kind
of post-synical good faith where you can tell if someone is really good faith or not but you're
oriented towards how do we create it right it seems that the thing we have to do is be able to walk
through those steps into a kind of post-synical good faith that can look at all of the really bad
faith and the fact that like it's not just historical the stuff we're talking about that
whether we're talking about redlining or the remnants of the war on drugs or whatever that
these are still current things that systemic injustice associated with race is still happening
today right right and so like I think I want people who are you know who will get in the
uproar about it to do a better job of trying to engage in good faith conversations where the other
side really is coming from good faith the question I also want more willingness to participate with
the upset right when it arises because it has it has reason behind it and that's kind of what I
wanted to construct is a sense of life yes I uh my is a gentleman who's a mentor to me uh since I
was 11 and I speak throughout the Caribbean Africa and so on in my role in varieties of roles
he said to me one day Gilbert we've spent a lot of time criticizing the old now it's time to inspire
the young uh because we can't promise them a world filled with a bunch of old liars and crooks
you know we can't we just can't we can't promise them that world that's not a world to live in
and this was one of the criticisms of Tanahasi Coates in his uh book uh where he writes a letter
to his son and the idea is you promised your son a world in which you're only at the cynical level
as you say is how do we get to the post-cynical level and I see that uh professor Lowry and
professor McWhorter have mocked him for that but they haven't acknowledged the the rightful righteous
rage uh which has come on now what they do is they say yeah but you're killing people in Chicago
and you're killing people in all these places and I didn't believe in the 1980s when they said
the FBI or the CIA is spreading drugs in the black community I didn't believe it but it turns
out to be true and then empirically empirically true yeah and I didn't know the drug thing has
become quite clear it's become quite clear and I didn't believe when uh you know um uh they were
talking about targeting and so on and now police officers are I've been collecting them over the
last 10 years police are white police officers who say in retirement we planted things on on blacks
we we did a lot of that and so if you live in that it doesn't matter so so the Lowry I'm getting at
your point about how you get to this post-cynical stage power's diffuse in America which is a good
thing in one sense but power's diffuse in America it means that any attempt you make to organize
yourself especially in a digitally integrated world means that you are vulnerable to attack not
just attack but having your reputation destroyed all these kinds of things so that's one there's a
line that black americans and any american who wants to pursue a more perfect union will have
to accept it's from methanic he was prime minister of austria from 1848 sorry from 1808 to 1848
and kept the peace in europe for almost 100 years and ran a small country that controlled a bunch
of large countries so he's unique in that perspective and methanic said large countries are always right
small countries can only keep from being wrong so but he said another thing small
countries should never pursue their ends they should pursue the ends of the larger country
with their ends embedded so now i want to say something because what you're saying
there are certain people who feel that they are part of the metaphorical small country right now
that's right would feel just fucking enraged at what you're saying because it sounds totally
unethical right and you're actually not making an ethical argument you're making a pragmatic
argument that's right you're saying i'm not saying that this is what would be good if you just got
to have divine rule but you don't have divine rules and this is the best way to advance the
interests of your people and if you do the other thing you'll actually fuck your own people and
you'll be the only one who thinks you're right right so you're making a very pragmatic argument
here about how to advise the principles of my country not what they would like to hear but
how you get from A to B and if those options are all equally bad options my job is to explain
which of the worst that which of the bad options is the best one to pursue because tomorrow is going
to come and the powerful nation has done what they've done to you no one will care how you feel about
it right black america is a canada if it were a country it would be the eighth wealthiest country
in the world the problem is does it have a unifying thesis in which blacks can work together now the
truth is i've seen some of that it's a documentary on youtube i don't i don't remember who did it
but there's a lady there who is leading this by black campaign
when one of the young entrepreneurs was told well some of your stuff is white
by black is not an absolute not an absolute thing white people make beautiful things we're
need them as well it's just that if we can we can make laundry soap and you know we can buy from
food stores and we can you know they are black designers and people like that as long as a
significant proportion of the money circles in our community we have an opportunity to do something
so that's one thing that can be done uh you're offering a offering a offering a
go on sorry you're offering a synthesis of uh martin luther king and malcolm x right now
yes uh so that's what malcolm x said and martin luther king said the same thing and where do we go
from here in fact he he was a proponent of universal basic income on the same basis there's
sufficient wealth in america to solve every problem that black americans uh have economically
is sufficient wealth in america to create a nation within a nation now people say
is that a good thing should we should we segregate ourselves you're not segregating yourself
when you live in a neighborhood you live in your house you pay for your groceries right
you and in trade terms in the in the in the economics of trade there's something called
liberalization and there's something called harmonization what you've been sold traditionally
is a harmonization proposition where you open yourself up 100 to people who are not open to you at all
but there's another way of trading which is called liberalization and that means you pick the areas
that you're going to liberalize and you say this is sufficient for us to have an exchange with ourselves
that's what benin did with henry the navigator so just to emphasize it if if if you have harmonization
that means you and i live next door you can come in my house eat food lay down sleep you can do
everything uh use my lawnmower whatever have you if we're liberalized you have limits you can't come
into my house you can use my garden tools you can sit under my tree you know uh and so on we can rake
up each other's leaves and so on so we bring a mutual benefit to each other so we're enabling
but we're not unified so that i'm always the one taking the risk that you're going to give as much
as i've given yeah and while this is diplomatic and trade policy if a people wants to regard
themselves as a people this is the strategy that you have to have methanic strategy that's
the strategy you have to have but at the same time you have to say that prayer at the beginning of it
that we are seeking a more perfect union and at the bottom of that eat pluribus unum out of many
one what is the one the one is the things that we agree to liberalize between ourselves
the other unifying factors that brings the country together and if you don't do that
everybody is going to lose blacks and whites so this is interesting i think i'm not actually
going to try to touch this here because the proposition of the way forward has so much in it
you're presenting something like soft black nationalism with a progressive bent like you
know kind of a Malcolm X black nationalism but soft it'll do trade but it'll do trade that is
real politic informed and make sure that the balance sheet balances out and it is real
politic enough to know who it balances with and who doesn't while being progressive enough to try to
do better and you know that that sounds roughly like it's at the synthesis of a bunch of things
but there's a million devil in the details that i would love to actually have this conversation
and hear more of your thoughts well you and i you and i have spoken about this about hbcu's
and how hbcu's actually are the lynchpin human beings can only create institutions that's it
that's the only things we can create out of thin air institutions institutions turn out to be
at every stage in human civilization when something has gained scale a concept has gained
scale a strategy has gained scale it has been through some sort of institutional framework
even if you have a flash situation where people do a thing you don't have the coordinates to
continue that thing and to build on it in any way you can't triangulate it to make it strong and
give it a future because you don't have proper coordination at the root level so hbcu's are
institutions that exist already this is what you don't know historically black colleges and
universities but the question is whether or not blacks themselves have recharted them so they're
actually on the balance sheet of the black community that's that's that's one of the big
questions and there's sufficient wealth in america to do that and there's also i'm speaking now as a
finance guy right who advises governments on development and there's also sufficient wealth
to develop those of the hbcu's i mean i when i first arrived in washington dc howard university was
in what was called the ghetto you could buy a brownstone in the howard neighborhood everybody
would warn you but you could buy a brownstone in the howard neighborhood probably between 80 to
150 thousand dollars now you'd have to pay three million but did howard university owned those
brownstones around itself so that's wealth that had been gentrified that you've missed
and the reason you missed it is because one of the things that people who don't live in
development zones and trading zones one of the things they don't understand is that essentially
cities and countries don't die they may you know they don't really die certainly not in a place like
the united states in the manner that we're talking about certainly not in washington dc if there's
any place on earth where there'll be humans running around for quite some time it'll be washington dc
and you have you have to have a strategy of the future you cannot just you have to have a vision
of america this is one of the criticisms of barack obama by diplomatic scholars he didn't wake
up every morning with the idea i want britain to do this i want germany to do that i want
china to do this and it doesn't matter whether they do it or not i have a picture of the world
that i want to enforce and i'm prepared to get as much of that as i can what is the black
personally the if there's such a thing what is their vision for america one of the problems
is that the black vision for america is being defined by whites who oppose them and saying
that their vision for america is the behavior of some hip hop artists or some entertainers or some
drug dealers or some guys in chicago that's what america they bill o'reilly basically said that
right that's what america would be but 150 americ black americans is a millionaire
150 so there is and the question dr king asked is are you merely along for the ride this is what
you said at the beginning if you merely adopt the virtues of the dominant culture then you are
exporting harm based on the same philosophy that once enslaved you
so it can't just be that you want to be part of the harvard club that you want to be part of
you know you want to get a job at goldman sacks you want to get your bmw with your summer house in
Miami because those things export a type of harm and they generate from a kind of perspective on life
that was actually the underlying perspective in slavery
you must assert a new set of values that could become the future values of a country and that's
what people who are maligned subjugated and marginalized i wrote a book about this called
the epistemologies of displacement they are in a place they are displaced away from the dominant
culture but they are actually the source of renewal and they can only be that source of renewal
if they believe in the foundational principles and come to embody those principles with a vision
of the future that the entire country can benefit from and if you think of people who
of oklahoma of rosewood of all these places of wilmington and so on
if you could teach that ethic
that ethic because the people who didn't experience that can't teach that ethic that applies to blacks
and whites many of them but if you could teach that ethic that would be something renewing
and it just seems to me as you said from the beginning and i think you're right people are
talking at each other people are repeating narratives the so-called black conservatives
are largely black republicans right and they haven't said to themselves i have to increase
the marginal likelihood of the outcomes of the values of america that's that's what we have to do
right what is the model evidence that if you are good and if you follow the rules
that your outcomes will be predictable not exact but within a margin predictable
if that doesn't happen no investor you can't convince any dc to give up their money if you
can't make some sort of statement of a marginal likelihood of the outcomes that you propose
and so to me that would be the synthesis and obviously what needs to happen is even though
we have this discussion and i know you're committed to that we have to get a lot of people around
the table and tear the synthesis apart and figure out what can happen to it and we also
have to understand that the world is continuing to move you still have the social media construct
the social media construct that our mutual friend tristan harris has done this film about
the social dilemma which is corrupting our children corrupting minds making democracy and
a proper shared narrative almost impossible so we have all that to military against and
and but i do believe that when you look at civilizations that have thrived
even when they face this kind of calamity people have come together and generated a new vision
and then fought for that vision
so i'm going to try to ensure this is the last round of things i say i hear you saying that we
have to have a vision kind of vultures without vision man parishes that we can orient towards
i also hear you saying that a minor nation can't have a vision that is outside of the
interest of the major nations and so it has to have a vision for the major nations that it is
embedded within and so i hear you saying that right now a lot of black america is still having its
vision defined by white america if you want to call it that's interests as opposed to defining
its own interests but some groups seek to define their own interests define it in a way that is
um
unintegratable with what you could say from a power point of view as a dominant interest said
and so there has to be some way of being able to have unification of visions across power systems
well beyond the scope of what we can discuss right now i want to acknowledge quite a few things
that i think are worth us discussing that maybe if we do a follow-up we can do is
uh you've mentioned in a conversation before that in the way that uh dibois said the color
line was defining of the 20th century that it might be in the 21st century and that it seems
like the woke anti-woke of which race is probably the deepest center is the biggest dividing line
in the us and that when you have a polarized democracy which then polarizes the representative
class which then creates gridlock in the presence of increasingly effective autocracy i.e. the chinese
model here then you're in the process of that democracy absolutely leading itself so the racial
issues seem like they might be central to the viability of democracy writ large period like
so the domestic issues and the geopolitical issues then we look at china and its treatment of the
Uighur and we say is that a better racial model or not and if not then is there actually a
requirement for domestic solidarity well understanding how hard the domestic solidarity argument is
because when debois said that and said go ahead and fight world war one they just got fucked again
afterwards so what kind of insurance would need to be in place um there's a lot um you've brought up
approaches to reparations that you think would be helpful versus terrible
there's obviously going quite a lot deeper into the historically black colleges and universities
as almost like economic development zones that could be methods of post-cynical upward mobility
that are useful we also have to face all of this in light of the fact that where the previous
answers had always been more GDP so more pie for everybody but now we're hitting planetary
boundaries we're not going to be able to keep doing that for environmental reasons the whole
thing's about to get really clusterfucked and with a lot of new constraints and as you mentioned
the polarizing nature of social media so all i'm acknowledging is we have not even scratched the
issues here yet i am hoping that we have built a couple useful parts so that those who just
weren't familiar can see when people are talking about systemic injustice and systemic racism and
people representing perspectives at BLM or whatever that if you were unfamiliar you might have a little
bit more um empathy and i just want to say two things more that are just random points simply
because they're ones that were very motivating to me and they weren't mentioned one is um i just want
highlight for everyone how statistical warfare works in information war where you're trying to
control populations by controlling what they think it's easy to cherry pick statistics so i might
have a Gaussian distribution of true things and i just picked the ones on this side and i can claim
true facts and conciliants papers we wrote a paper called how to mislead with facts so when you see
people quoting facts regarding systemic injustice oh look for statistical warfare because they'll
what somebody can say their police are not more fatal than two black people than they are to white
people when you factor these things and the relevant violence in their area which can actually be a
true stat but it doesn't mean that it's not true that the police do stop and frisk black people
a lot more and they do get harsher sentencing for the same crimes across a Gaussian distribution and
so it's like you can have a lot of competing things that are true and you can cherry pick
almost every argument from it that's one thing that i'll say and to just watch that almost every
speaker slam dunks with a cherry picked argument and then i find that i i'm almost incapable of
actually empathizing with slavery like i really try to feel it but i've just never experienced
anything close to that and you know when you read the depictions of what it was like on those
slave boats where everyone is in each other's excrement and whatever it's like i don't think
anyone who hasn't been there can get a real sense so i try but i find that the more recent cases that
seem less egregious but are still so egregious actually boil my blood more because i can imagine
them more fully like honestly my empathy is slightly more capable of it and you were mentioning this
case of you know just coming up to the civil rights time where a man in a suit would be
walking to church with his wife being good Christians who were in every way respectable
and upwardly mobile and the police would come by and fondle his wife in front of him and he could
do nothing about it because any kind of aggression towards the police would be one of those things
that the 13th amendment was a hole for and the the radical emasculinization of that where then
you go a little ways forward and you hear shit about oh well the black community has no fathers
see the fault is really the black fathers you're like fuck like yes black fathers that's a really
important thing we have figured out what to do with that but when you've had systemic emasculation
how do you overcome that yes and so there's just like the empathy of like the recent history is
important is to be able to put yourselves in the shoes of lives that one hasn't lived and to try to
get a sense of is the advice i'm offering them advice i could even do in that situation right
jefferson your your your your points are very profound and it was always jefferson worried jefferson
said i'm worried about yes i'm worried that the white population of america is used to a yes which
is unnatural in a normal society in a slave society they're used to hearing yes from all quarters
for everything that they want what happens when a normal society is set up and they can't hear
that yes you know this is a big problem and i think you see examples of that in some of the
people who are used to things going their way in fact john paul sarke writes about this in the
anti-semite in the june and he talks about the anti-semite and his claims cherry picking facts as
well and and and is able to make i mean i think lead the lead up to the first to the second world
was a good example of how adolf hitler's speeches are filled with these kinds of
gaussian distributed facts where he just picks things but he never says what germany did to
put itself in this situation in the first place i'll i'll i'll end with this there's a wonderful
scholar uh at duke university uh whose name just jumped out of my head but i'll remember uh
um who is written about reparations extensively
everybody it seems to me i that i've read seems to me i'm speaking now just for me as a as a legal
scholar as a methodologist uh as a logician get reparations wrong
mostly what they're talking about is compensation or roman law restitution
and so in this uh conclusion that we're making where we're thinking through options i just want
to end with this because i want people to understand the options that they're vying for
for reparations cannot be demanded compensation can be demanded because there's a contract
and the contract was not fulfilled restitution can be demanded because something was taken
and needs to be restored right we get them the institutes of justinian restitution is a roman
law concept been with us for a very long time reparations has no accounting reparations is
atonement the person who committed the wrong is the only person who can execute introduce or
execute reparations when we look at what happened with germany and the jews that was restitution
and compensation right that means you have to have an accounting that means you need a system
you need a balance sheet you need a set of wrongs you need to connect in common law those
wrongs to the reduction of that balance sheet in some way right or you need to show injury
to a specific group of people or you need to show loss all right where a game was expected
rightly within the law the university of blasco discovered that they benefited from slavery
in scotland they decided without telling anybody that they were going to set up a
20 million dollar program for students in the caribbean because their slaves came from the caribbean
georgetown university found out that it had about 200 slaves or so
they shut down everything held a great conference invited a speaker who's an expert on these things
and they're trying to figure out what is the best route all right both they want all three compensation
restitution and reparations because a great institution cannot stand idle when this kind
of fact comes to the fore otherwise it undermines its entire purpose for existing
right and i have to give them credit that they've done that so in the solutions
i see a lot of people arguing uh the the the scholar's name is is derrity
professor derrity at uh at um at duke university
and he's a brilliant guy he and his brilliant fellow he and his wife and uh brilliant arguments all
around but
rest reparations is a moral act no court can impose it no one can demand it so
the real issue for us is in whatever we do
we mitigate which means do what you can do for yourself now
we have a trade policy and a vision right trade with everybody because that's how friendships
were made throughout human history with people trading with each other because trading sets up
terms where one party isn't giving everything and the other party is simply receiving and giving
nothing right and then if we can work with the difference between the various compensatory
strategies where if there's compensation so for instance people who should have gotten the gi
bill and are still alive or their children are still alive that's compensation people who gave
labor or gave value and got nothing restitution
but where etna and princeton university and some of the big institutions in the country
recognize that they themselves have benefited from uh slave labor or racism
or racism that allowed them to pay people inappropriately or not pay them at all and that
kind of thing it is there you can't protest for reparations you can't demand reparations
you have to just continue to mitigate
and this is dr king's principle and hope that the conscience of that person
that the loss of reputation that you create an overtone window that the loss of reputation
impels them to do the right thing and that's what democracy is about convincing people
that there is a unified vision and a covenant that we will all adhere to that happened in norway
in 1934 in a war called the red and the black
so it can happen and uh so i i thank you daniel this was this was uh we i think we cut an hour
thank you for thank you for uh taking the time and uh having this conversation with me and really
thank you for all the conversations that we've had up to this point that have been uh that i
acknowledge on this topic have been radically asymmetrically beneficial to me and
so for everyone in the stowa who is watching the stowa uh post their youtube videos without
comments but if you can message peter i think there's a discord if there are questions
um if there's an interest for a discussion on this i look forward to see what that is and
obviously i have mostly just my own interest to contribute to the space but uh professor morris
has a lot more expertise and also um depending upon how this unfolds other colleagues that could
be engaged in the conversation and um we will in the show notes the link a few resources that are
good and a few documentaries and papers and things like that okay listen it's good to see
you my friend likewise my friends cheerio you will
