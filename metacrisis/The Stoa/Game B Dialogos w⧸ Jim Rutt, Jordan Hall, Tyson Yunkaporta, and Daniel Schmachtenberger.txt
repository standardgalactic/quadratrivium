Welcome everyone to the Stoa. It's pretty wild here in Toronto right now with the snow today and
lots of energy in the collective field so I hope everyone is safe and sound.
And if you're here now you probably just watched the premiere of a film, Initiation to Game B,
on the Stoa's YouTube channel and this was a film that was written, directed and animated by Jake
Ruiz who's here today and produced by Jim Rut, Jeff Gomez and Jake, all of who are here today.
So I'm going to take Jim in a moment but how today's going to work is
Jim is going to talk to the three J's who created this film. They're going to have a quick
discussion about the film and then Jim is going to take me back in and then I'll introduce the
Epic Deologos panel that we have today that includes Jim Jordan Hall and Tyson Yonkaporta
and Daniel Schmockenberger and they'll be talking for about 45-60 minutes and then maybe we'll have
some time for some questions. So if you have questions anytime during the panel talk just
put in the chat and then if we have time I'll call and you can unmute yourself and you can ask
your question to the panel. So that being said I've got to give Jim an unmute access. Jim you're
up my friend. All righty thanks Peter thanks a lot for putting this together. Yeah this is very
exciting. This has been a lot of work from a lot of folks to get us to this moment. I thought I'd
start off with just a little bit of history of the project. It started out I don't know a little
over two years ago on the Game Bee group site on Facebook I believe. There was some talk hey you
know we need to move out of the world the word of just words and get our word out in art. You know
art speaks to a different part of the brain. I said well you know I'm a word dude you know
my art I'm about as good as art as nobody you've ever met. My high art form might be a construction
pencil on a grocery bag to design a deer stand or something like that. So I started putting
feelers out and saying hey anybody working on art in the Game Bee space and chatting with a couple
people nothing really clicked and then Jake Ruiz reached out directly to me and you know I don't
even know if he knew I was looking. Did you know I was looking Jake? Nope he said I got an idea and
we had a convo as I do all the time with folks and we really clicked and I said wow I really
really like this guy's vision let's see where it goes. So we started a process which took a while
and eventually resulted in this movie. So let me this film I guess Jake always bashes me whenever
I say movie he says you know that's you know cheesy old people say that you know this is a film so
yes so now that we have we're ready to launch our film here. So let me introduce the other two J's
Jake I call our principal filmmaker he runs a creative agency Futurity that utilizes an integral
methodology to align organizations to their purpose and design he designs content for effective
trans media communication strategies. Our other J is Jeff Gomez he's been exceedingly helpful
I refer to him as our narrative guru. Jeff's the CEO of Starlight Runner which is recognized
as a premier consultant in the fields of brand narratives story world development creative
franchise design and trans media storytelling we're amazingly lucky to have a dude of the
punching power of Jeff on our on our project so and I guess I'm the third J and me I'm kind of the
head janitor of the Game B movement it's about all I could say so with that you know let's
like to turn it over to Jake to talk a little bit about the process and you know how he went
about it and all the things that were not all things some of the things that were involved.
Thank you Jim. Yeah Jake here. Peter it's a great honor thank you for hosting the film here
and holding this event with all the Game B OG's present the sheer amount of
sagely wisdom in this room will surely break something right and I especially like to thank
our executive producers the Brut family aka the Medici's of Game B
so you know every artist needs its needs amuse right and and perhaps our old muses like secular
individualism have aged and withered and need to be put to rest for me as a protopian vision you
know Game B is like a sexy person who's always walking ahead of you into the future and they'll
always have their issues but day by day they encourage you to transform your head, heart,
and body and be more of a team player so my hope for this film is simply that it will encourage
artists who create you know anything from memes to speculative dreams that their vision
to share their vision with Game B of Game B you know a future that they'd feel a little more proud
to leave their descendants and we'll keep iterating together until we accelerate the exodus out of Game
A. I won't talk too much about the process I want to give the panelists the time here so with that
I'll introduce the master of trans media Mr. Jeff Gomez.
You're on mute there Jeff. Right how about that? There we go. Okay well people it's so fantastic
to be here this is the realization of a little tiny dream I've had since first hearing the term
Game B from Jordan Hall. This was some years ago and being so privileged to be able to sit in on
these talks these discussions and learn that there were people all over the world who were
thinking about the systemic crises that we face as a human race and as custodians to the earth
that people were actually thinking about solutions that were systemic a systemic approach to
solving these problems was astonishing because I come from the realms of fantasy and science
fiction so the only way that myself and people of my background have had to to communicate such
ideas was through you know science fiction and here we are sitting talking to each other about
real world solutions to these problems. Now I have to admit sometimes I would sit on these
conversations and not understand what the hell you were talking about. It can be dense the language
can be you know rarefied and yet the fact that that people like me can have access to this
to this the very nature of what Game B is about is the ability for us to mix and match our skills
and our perspectives to come up with unexpected answers so I began to implore Jordan and Daniel
Schmockdenburg and Jim Rutt can't we find ways to communicate these ideas to the people to the
population. I'm from a background that's used to placing a megaphone in front of popular storytellers
why can't I apply those skills to get some consensus of what Game B is and help to defeat it to
an artist like Jake or a team like Jake, Jim and myself and come up with something that distills
some of these basic concepts and so we got together and then asked some of you some questions and we
compiled I think a list of wonderful traits some of which made it into this animated film
so I'm really proud of the journey that we made I think it's wonderful and I'm very interested in
what everyone here has to say about it I'm also interested in of course spreading the word
showing others and interpreting the film for others so that we could actually you know start
answering some of these fundamental questions. Very good I'd also like to just mention that
we had a lot of help from what was called we called our editorial advisors number of people
that have been in and around the Game B world for quite a while and I'm just going to read them off
Jordan Hall, Daniel Schmockenberger, Tyson Yuccaporta, Nora Bateson, Zach Stein, Brett Weinstein,
Mark Allen Kaplan, Alexander Beiner, Peter Wang, Mick Rocks, Velfan Horne, Bruce Kunkel, Sharon Lewis,
Nicholas Limbacher and Ellie Hain all of whom had some input into the into the project
many of whom were interviewed in depth by Jake and Jeff and this film wouldn't be what it was
without them though of course as always all faults and errors are ours.
All right you ready Jim? I am ready so let me introduce the three folks that will be joining
me on the panel first Jordan Hall you know he and I have been working on what eventually
became Game B since back in 2008 I believe you know long time ago and he's the co-founder of
the Civium project and an intrepid explorer into the deep code of civilization design and dynamics
and always good for a very interesting and deep conversation. Tyson Yuccaporta is a senior
lecturer in indigenous knowledge at Deakin University in Melbourne Australia. He's a member
of the Appalach clan in far north Queensland and he carves traditional tools and weapons.
He is also the author of what I consider one of the best books of the last few years and an
indispensable read for anybody in Game B land and that's Sand Talk. If you haven't read it, read it.
Daniel Schmockenberger is a founding member of the Consilience Project
aimed at improving public sense-making and dialogue. The through line of his interests has been
with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and societies with a virtuous
relationship between the two as a goal so that be us. Let's take it away the question that we want
that we put to the panel we'll start with the question actually I'll ask the panelists to give
a short take on what they thought of the movie say no more than a minute and then speak to
the role of the arts in the unfolding of Game B and then after each of us has our chance at the
question we'll have a general discussion about what's going on in and around the Game B world.
So Jordan why don't you go first. And if I just jump in before Jordan if everyone could besides
the panelists just shut their camera off that helps the YouTube video pick it up and create
some intimacy. When the deal logo is over I'll jump in turn on my camera and then we'll pivot
to Q&A. So off you go Jordan. I was going to punt into the other panelists under the premise that
I was going to be the craziest one and then I realized who else was on the panel so sorry you're
just stuck. Okay so maybe let me work backwards on the last piece because it made me laugh a little
bit. I've been on on and on in that sense like rambling on about this notion of art
for the past maybe two months or so. With the mindset of saying we typically get very stuck I
think in the way something has shown up in sort of our memory or our life experience. So the notion
of art in our world and the world that most of us are familiar with perhaps not everybody here
oftentimes is identified with what I would just call artifacts. So stuff made out of stuff
oftentimes in shapes or colors you know paintings and statues but also music but it's
it's that kind of thing the stuff the the greek sensibilities it uses but my my sense of it is
that that's not really what art is it's art is how art has shown up and that rather the notion of
art has to do with the particular capacity to express by means of access to what forest lander
would refer to as the transcendent so that there is a a way of navigating the world that is governed
by certain rules of mind right so for example logic etc and there's a way of navigating the world
governed by a different set of rules and like all those transcendent rules the rules of feeling or
quality or vibes if you're a gen zed and I would say that that simply is art art is the
the actual capacity to navigate the world by means of this other modality and I would propose
that the shifting into or in some sense the return the remembering of how to live life artfully
is in much the essence of this concept of game being right to move from a way of living life
effectively or in an optimizing way which is very much of the essence of game a moving into
living life artfully in this modality is very much of the essence of game b or at least of the
transition um in the context of the the film or the what would you call digital animated short
I suppose if you want to be pedantic Evan um as we know any given expression is going to be what
it is so it captures what it can capture expresses what it can express and what I noticed when I
watched it more importantly actually when I watched it with my daughter who's three was that
it conveyed certain feelings that seemed to be what I would say right or in alignment meaning
I felt a feeling in my heart when the heart feeling was being called and more importantly
again my daughter seemed to she reacted to it in a very particular way and she's asking a bunch
of questions she was very curious about what was going on I would say by the way that would seem to
be the most powerful thing for her was the the girl in the beginning and the girl in the end
and the realization that that girl was a human and then noticing this other place that was pretend
and what it was like to feel the relationship between the human and the pretend
so it's interesting right one of the things that happens when you're interacting with things in the
artistic is it's open you know people will be we begin to dig into it in ways that are
well not only not obvious but in not necessarily at all with respect to what the explicit intent
or the the mental notion of the artist would be and it's the invitation into the inquiry that to me
is more important like I don't the content is nice the content is good I told Jeff I was uh
surprised that Jim let it actually show up the way that it showed up
but the context and the degree to which it invites people into a certain kind of inquiry
and a certain relationship with disposition I think that's nice that's a good good direction
okay Tyson let's hear your take
well everyone I like showed it to you know my family and everything they're just like
punch in the air and say yeah that's it you know I think um you know when you're preaching to the
choir you know people are gonna love it um I haven't I haven't tried it out yet on anybody who um
who isn't already across all of the concepts in it you know and um see this was my I was
my criticism my criticism of it was um you know it's an initiation but there's no ordeal
but then I figured no no there's no ordeal because I already know what's in it and the people I
showed already know what's in it so they didn't feel a um you know a fear and danger response
so there was no ordeal to go through but I imagine if someone's never come across those concepts
before uh that would be something of an ordeal and a bit of a shock to the limbic system
that would give them a bit of a jolt so yeah that's okay um and I guess uh you know for a lot of
people I don't know I don't think everyone in the world's gonna see it but I think if it really
took off I think the main uh responses um that you're gonna get will be negative is like will
game be is all pale male stale non-indigenous able-bodied um dudes and um you know why do they
have all these female and indigenous and people of color and eastern or whatever um avatars you
know and and I don't know so there'll be like representation concerns but I think uh anyone
coming from that point of view if they had that view of history I think if they thought really
thought it through then they might arrive at the conclusion of well that's it's appropriate that
that's the demographic um of the majority of game b because you know you made the mess so you
clean it up uh kind of thing I I think that would be a more helpful critique I certainly haven't
got a problem with um you know with that demographic in in game b I think it's I think
it's highly appropriate I think the people who understand the structure best are the people who
made it um you know just as you Jim you you understand the internet pretty well because
you're one of the senior elders and founding fathers of the internet from my point of view
because you've been around there for forever and um yeah I think that's the way I think it's
it's it's very appropriate uh the demographics of game b but then at the same time it's going
to be really important to get uh I think you know uh to achieve the goals of game b to have uh
a nice uh some some bigger uh front doors and and bringing all kinds of people in and um and I
think that's where the arts side of thing is going to do it and I sort of see uh I see the film as
a good little leverage point um uh for for making that happen looking forward to seeing it happen
thanks Dyson uh Daniel
I think the thing about the film that I like the most uh there was a lot of content in it that was
good it was really is a trippy experience because I didn't even know that it was happening until
you sent it to me to watch um I think I had missed my emails updating so it's trippy to like see
all of the content that we've talked about put forward in a form like that for the first time
but I think the thing that I'm happiest about is just that an investment into other media and
forms of communication and starting to think about artistic presentation is happening at all
and the main thing I would hope is that it just inspires a lot more endeavors of totally different
kinds someone said in here one of the things they prefer aesthetically about solar punk was
more uh focus on the arts uh I think I think that is an area that has been deficient in some way
in um our kind of thinking and community so far so I'm I'm happy to see that and um I think the
question was asked like what is the role of art and game be I think it's a a really good question
and I'll just say the first couple thoughts that came to mind the first time I went to Bali
someone was telling me that uh an idea from the kind of ancient Balinese culture is that they
said uh the art museum is the sign of a dead culture that has relegated art to a place
and that if a culture is not dead the entire civilization should be the art museum they
humans should not build anything that isn't art and that they had this idea that nature
is beautiful enough that we should only build something if it adds to the beauty of nature
and that that was actually core to their thinking and that when you look at the temples and the
streets there's this idea that anywhere the eye falls or anything that lands on the ears
elevates consciousness that everything is art in a way that is consciousness elevating
and when we when we realize that technology is not values agnostic that technology has
inexorable effects on us it codes for patterns of behavior that affect us like that the kind of
ontologic design movement of how do we rebuild the human built world not just for the specific
functional purposes but to elevate develop and enlighten the people and the relationships
within it then art takes on a very central theme right like how how would if if we thought about
everything in the built world how it lands on all of our senses having an elevating effect
on consciousness i think that's a very interesting kind of artistic renaissance perspective for game
b i was thinking about from uh you know the the greek true good and beautiful triad there's a
poem i wrote on her birthday to an artist friend of mine once where i said something like the
truth and goodness only matter because beauty is and it was kind of an exploration of
like if reality was not inherently beautiful in a beyond visual sense but like beauty is the sense
it's like the embodied sense of the inherent meaningfulness of it i wouldn't give a shit
about goodness i wouldn't give a shit about truth like i only actually even care to understand it
and i care to serve it the true and the good because there's this inherent beauty in it
and um and i was noticing how much truth and goodness were inherent to my pursuits and
yet it's all in service to the things that i that i see in people who live artfully
and then i think just the last thing i'll say there is a pretty simple distillation of
maybe everything that i have learned regarding how to live a meaningful human life
everything of being doing and becoming uh all kind of synthesizes down to appreciate the beauty
of life add to the beauty of life develop your capacity to do both um and that the mode of being
in its depth is really appreciating the beauty of existence as it is being able to take it in
be moved by it be raptured by it and then the protective impulse and the creative impulse
in their deepest sense the doing is the add to the beauty of life and if what you're creating is
not adding to the beauty of life and the way the Balinese said then it's not the right thing to do
and the mode of becoming the human development is really deep in your capacity for being to
appreciate and be with reality more and to add to the beauty of it more and the recursive relationship
between those three doesn't really leave anything that i care about out and so if i was going to
kind of define the superstructure of game b uh i think that would be a decent starting place
well thank you thank you daniel uh now on my take on it it's uh you know jordan's was
surprised jim let this thing out well uh i wouldn't have put quite the same emphases and
weights and things on the various elements in the film but that's not what art's about right
art's about getting in the heart and there's not a thing in the film that i disagree with
i said i would emphasize different things but it struck me that the right thing to do
was to let jake resonate with his artistic vision and i was supportive of that throughout and i think
that's really really important uh to the degree that art becomes didactic it becomes propaganda
and it's no longer art right so if we're going to have an art scene around game b we have to let
the artists be the artists and i think that's uh sort of just fundamental and not think of it as a
branch of didactic uh instruction uh now of course there may be some things that are didactic
construction which instruction which includes some arts but that's not the same as a work of art
and so i'm very uh very happy the way this thing has turned out as what i truly believe it to be
which is a work of art from the artistic vision principally of jake with a little bit a little
bit of contribution from from the rest of us uh in terms of the role of the arts uh in game b uh
you know uh one of my day jobs to the degree i have one is the study of cognitive science and part
of that uh goes into the study of personalities and learning and memory and one of the things that
you learn when you start studying how that thing between our ears works is there's a lot of difference
amongst people in how their minds work uh you know there are some people who are very good at
syllogisms and writing things down carefully and reading closely and being able to regurgitate it on
standardized tests etc and then there are other people who are not and some of those are some
of the most brilliant and effective people i've ever met uh who experience the world
experientially who are saturated in it uh and to my mind uh for historical and accidental reasons
game b was way overloaded with that first class of folks right uh some of the early discussions
nerd fests of transcendental proportions right uh the writing we did and some of on some of our
projects together group writing was phenomenal but it was because we were those kinds of folks
and actually turned out to be important because i think it's built us a very deep base uh you
know people sometimes will compare and contrast us with other game b adjacent uh movements and
i say that's good because there are many many people on this mission together uh and some of
them have a more artistic temperament than we have so far but i am pretty proud of the deep deep
digging that we have done over the last uh what was it eight years or so almost nine years now
uh i guess 10 years you'll be coming up in march uh actually from the very earliest work
but but uh you know this uh syllogistic logical approach is not how you get the word out
to the world and so while we'll continue to dig and still a lot more digging to do and a
lot more intricate work to do in protocols and designs of various aspects governance system
software etc uh you know the time has come to turn and tell the story in ways that the people
who uh interact with the world experientially uh can in can engage with and to my mind that is really
the role of art and of course even for those of us who to use a horrible popular cultural cliche
are more left brain don't believe that left brain right brain stuff by the way because it's well
there's just sort of a little hint of something to it it's not nearly as black and white as people
say but let's use it anyway uh us more left brain people i think we'll have our own understanding
of our own work uh will expand tremendously when we get exposed to uh artistic reflections
essentially of this work and will allow the the work of digging to go off in whole new
directions that we never would have seen i gotta say i mean this this film has caused me to think
about the the journey to game b quite differently and for many other people who are you know i still
recall in our early game b days there were some members who were probably more of this other
tribe who complained that our online world was a wall of words right and i go well what do you
expect you got too much of words yeah that's what we're doing here well you know what uh that was
stupid of me because there are a lot there were a lot of really valuable folks who could have
contributed a lot more uh if instead of it just being a wall of words we had also included uh you
know some more artistic and aesthetic sensibilities and uh so i see that uh also as the role of the
arts in game b uh you know i hope this is just the very first uh it's not actually not the first
there've been people that've created game b poems and uh you know a little bit of music and such but
not very much and i hope this is the beginning a little pebble rolling down the hill that starts
an avalanche and sees the deep hole of the deep work of the deep code to steal jordan's phrase of
construction and logic and syllogisms and writing uh to be a a base from which the artistic
representation of this new world that we hope to see come into existence uh can take fire and
just start growing exponentially back to you peter
i was just sensing you four have a conversation for 45 minutes yeah open
sweet we can just riff yeah how about it gentlemen's
i think i think arts arts art has to be emergent and it has to come from those liminal sort of
places and i think if it's not then it's just propaganda and um i feel like game b's resisted
the propaganda side of things really quite admirably so far and uh yeah and i feel like
this one hasn't sort of just sort of dropped straight out of the center of things but it's
kind of uh emerged a bit and yeah i'd like to see more of that too
if no one's jumping in like i jordan said something to me about um the last week or week
before it was about um it was about it's really stuck with me it's about being a um a game b loser
in game a which is which is really cool so i've looked at myself and gone oh man
i'm a i'm a game b loser in game a like especially on this continent that's currently called Australia
however daniel if i go to barley which it's cheaper for me to fly to barley than it is to
fly home on this continent and um suddenly i'm a game a winner in a place that was formerly
arguably already game b um because i can just um stretch out my my hideous fat body on the beach
and and get some young girl to to give me a massage for like two hours for five dollars or something
so that makes me a game a winner in a in a game b place so i guess context is everything isn't it
but while i'm here game b loser in game a
i think jordan's talking sorry i was on mute um we're trying to figure out how to
thread the needle or to go through the eye of the needle it's like that metaphor of figuring
out how to be a game b winner in game b um and of course it's not easy one of the things that we
ran into a lot back in the pre-sport mode days was the the challenge of actually recognizing
like really deeply recognizing the necessity of the vulnerability of the immaturity of game b
and there's oftentimes there was a desire to be able to sort of specify something
and and specify something that was i think good but then try to get there by using the tools of
game a including the mindset of game a um and so and that does work um but that's the precise thing
that can't work it's what gets things in it turns it turns art back into propaganda right quick um
and so being able to actually really really gently hold each of those pieces and learn how to have
the sensitivity to know precisely when you're doing it right which i would say by the way
to throw a lot of problem into this conversation would be to rediscover the notion of the sacred
like what it means to actually be able to treat with care the things that need to be held carefully
was a big part of the learning and maybe that's another way of describing the notion of art
you know to say that art is more like midwifery which means more like learning how to treat with
care that which needs to be treated carefully which is in the process of bringing itself into the
world and you happen to be a steward or a custodian helping it come in
Tyson I was just thinking of what you said about uh that arguably Bolly might have been
more game be historically and as you mentioned the continent now called Australia that it might
have been more game be previously and you having a mindset a heart set a way of being
or orientation that might be more game be from those roots that still has you a game a loser
um I've never thought about it this way before so this might not be right it's just a thought
that's coming up uh in the moment is one way of maybe thinking about game a
versus game b is that game a is defined at least largely by inexorability arguments
that's the nature of the multipolar trap that's the nature of the arms race the tragedy of the
commons in moloc and the need to keep up with competing oota loops is uh our game be civilization
is going to get fucking killed by those guys and so we have to get better at warfare than them or die
and if the Spartans are putting all their energy into warfare and we put any of our energy into
put any of our energy into arts we're going to die right so you either have to beat the most
successfully extractive and violent at extraction and violence or get beaten by them so what happens
to art and culture and anything else and so there's a certain kind of inexorability argument in that
right the I mean you take somebody as considered as Einstein and the Einstein cellared letter
is what got the U.S. to start the Manhattan project because the inexorability of otherwise
the Germans are going to and and so but what's interesting is that inexorability arguments
are fundamentally antithetical to the nature of choice like any kind of authenticity of freedom
and one could say that maybe game b is something that is rooted in the reality of the nature of
choice and that fundamentally seeks to protect and uphold it and yet obviously
it still has to deal with inexorabilities and so this is something that we've talked about
of how do you make something that doesn't lose at game a while not also converging to winning at game
a because if it loses at game a it's not game b it's just a cul-de-sac but if it's way to not lose
is to just also be game a it's also a cul-de-sac and so the threading of the needle is something that
and and so fundamentally what it's saying is that the inexorability is a fully causal thing
because of x y must be otherwise y is overcome by x so what it's saying is a way of working with
the field of choice that is actually more effective than purely the domain of causation
and then I would say as far as this conversation more effective and also more beautiful
just just a thought that came up as you were describing that history
yeah I think I was I was thinking and I hadn't thought of barley as being
game b before but you know I guess if you you the way you were talking about the built environment
sounds very game b sounds like something that game b is um aspiring towards but yeah of course I'm
aware of the um you know the the game theory side of things and that idea that the seed the seed of
game a uh was there in uh ancient societies you know however um it wasn't a problem until
things started to scale I think I've heard your story about the plough before being the
being the turning point for that as well which is pretty cool yeah but um I don't know they had
ploughs look we used to trade with them like for about a millennium ago you know we were trading
with the mccasins so you know most of what I know about their prehistory use is through that trade
and through the law that we have you know passed right right across around the continent you know
about what those people were like before and they were very different you know because they were
mining they were doing all kinds of things like so that they brought steel here so we had things
like machetes and anchors and stuff like that um you know for a few centuries before things changed
here yeah yeah but I speak to what Daniel was talking about about this great conundrum
uh and I'll call it the great conundrum and I will first be the first to admit we don't yet
have the answer uh which is how do we build game b stay true to game b values not be co-opted
and at the same time uh not be crushed by game a uh you know this this is one of the many riddles
that we have to solve and we have just the most rudimentary ideas on how to do it
and I think it's going to be one of the key parts of our work going forward the phrase I like to use
is how can we build game b while simultaneously parasitizing game a which is to build membranes
bubbles of benus where people can actually live a true and authentic game b life mostly
while at the same time creating things of value to people over in game a and trading with them on
terms that actually work for us and obviously you can think of the potential coordination issues
you know what happens if game b membranes protobesiviums uh start uh you know
thinking that their status comes from how many uh shekels they stack up that they pulled in
from game a that's a failure mode right uh on the other hand if they don't pull in enough to
keep themselves going uh and to defend themselves in legal and political and if necessary kinetic
terms uh then they also fail uh so this is going to be a very interesting and difficult
balancing act and I think that these are highly high dimensional complex systems problems
which we know are not actually tractable to analytical solutions you can't actually do the
math and say this is how game b parasitizes game a and remains true to itself so I think this is
where art can essentially be a tuning mechanism as we start to confront these issues people will see
artists people who know how to speak from the heart uh will start to see these conflicts and
potential compromises and will through through art uh put out things that remind us that uh
that we have to be true and we have to somehow uh thread this needle and you know this is not the
only such uh very difficult transition we're going to have to go through to really bring a game b
world into being and uh it sort of at least makes some sense to me that our artists can be uh represent
much bigger higher dimensional uh possible ways of thinking about these problems than can logic
and syllogisms uh and can and if we resonate with those and with some discernment amongst those
it may help us collectively organize as we try to work out work out these solutions to you know
what seem from here to be really difficult problems I think um on the staying true side I think you
got that's why you got your stoics in here it's the thing I like about game b is I reckon it's
the stoics that make it work um because you just can't bullshit uh around them you know so I I
you know I know there's a tendency in me to do that sense make a guru kind of thing where I can
just kind of let myself off the hook I can go oh I've only got like 12 peer reviewed publications
and most of those are co-authored um that's not because I'm a crappy scholar that must be because
I'm being persecuted for my for speaking the truth and you know the the system doesn't listen to me and
then I can like you know signal out to all these sort of disgruntled sort of people out there and
get massive audiences and all that sort of thing you a lot of your sense maker gurus go that way
but I find that um you know game b is a really calm place where that doesn't happen and I think
it's because of all the stoics and like your uh you know your actual first principle stuff going on
tends to sober people up and um I know that that sounds like infertile ground for um arts but I
think you need a calm place for arts you know as well and I think I think this kind of makes it
we need a soundtrack by the way so I like uh turquoise sound she's here I like her for that
she's starting to put together some interesting uh game b beats that I'm that I'm liking I hope
she finishes that album soon can you drop a link in the chat no not yet oh I did the wrong
thing recently I sent I like I sent a link to something that she was still working on and
apparently that's a no no in the musician community so I like I've done the wrong thing like that so
we're gonna have to wait for it fair enough for being as good I hope she gets it done soon
because we need a soundtrack we need an anthem is what we need well we also should figure out how
to support turquoise sound in her work uh in the same way we were able to support uh Jake in his
work uh you know I think that one of the things that in this really early game b world we have to
think about ways to collectively collect resources uh to fertilize artistic expression and uh you
know I look forward to turquoise project turquoise turquoise turquoise turquoise sounds project
and other projects that I'm sure will be coming forth and figuring out how we as a community
can support those people so they can make a living and they can contribute to the
soundtrack and the interior decorating and the uh you know the the dancing and and shaking of
hands and the and and all that to really turn game b into into into a real thing and not just
a bunch of logic so on this notion of the stoic and the relationship between the stoic and art
um so one of the senses that I was having is I was trying to listen here is the the difference
between dialectic and dialogues is the degree to which that there is a third or however many an
end the center the whole is the one and everyone is listening to that and trying to find a way to
speak for it right and one of the things that the stoic does is it creates um a protective
boundary for that space it actually creates a a spaciousness or a coolness or a quietness that
allows the uh the whole to settle and then begin to be able to speak itself and um maybe that's
what I would part of what you're sensing there Tyson. Yeah sorry I was just typing like a tape
worm you know tape worm puts that substance out around it that sort of tricks the body into
thinking it's not there um yeah and just kind of dials down the immune response around it
yeah that that's I reckon the stoic stoics of that substance you know to follow on with Jim's
parasitic sort of metaphor which you know all good symbiosis start out that way right
I had a thought and Tyson you're mentioning that um I've talked about the plow as one of the turning
points um and you're talking now about symbiosis emerging from parasitism um I
I wouldn't describe the agricultural revolution as the beginning of game A it was a major step
function in our ability to uh in a way you could say it was a major step function in the beginning
of the Anthropocene where we rather than hunter gather where we wanted ecosystems we wanted to
now start converting ecosystems to row crops and um and our ability to extract calories from the
world much faster than a natural environment grow populations faster surplus that whole kind of
thing obviously we can look at the industrial revolution and oil as being a next major step
function there were a few in there and then um you know nuclear and digital and but I would
take it back to stone tools and fire um I take it to kind of uh the ability for the capacity
for abstraction to increase our predatory capacity faster through tools than the environment
could increase its resilience to our predatory capacity and there's just increasing early
hominid anthropology coming out about how much our migration was not homo sapien migration was
probably not just moving into empty spaces but killing all the neanderthals and earlier
non sapien hominids in those places that uh that extinctionary tribal warfare was key to the actual
niche that sapiens were moving into and that was both abstraction applied to language for
coordination and and toolmaking I I might say that that was the beginning of game a in a way
and it's just a very long compounding curve and it has a couple step functions along the way
um we because before that you could say there was rivalry but the rivalry had bounded
cemeteries because nothing could increase its reverence capacity faster than the other things
could increase their response because mutation was pretty evenly distributed and co-selective pressures
but you could even say well fuck then evolution is has a lot of rivalries built in its game a
it just had bounded cemeteries I would say like rivalry with unbounded cemeteries because of tech
is really maybe the game a distinction and or one way I think about it
and so then that creates these inexorability things right if the other guys are doing the
the more powerful unbounded tech we have to or we lose because of the rivalry that was all
the way back to pre-human pre-human rival risk selection criteria and but that fucking thing
that inexorability on rivalry driving arms races on exponential curves only has shitty attractors
right maybe some long-term stable dystopias and otherwise catastrophes
unless we can figure out how to consciously direct that thing to something other than an
inexorability and this is now where art comes in centrally like what is the superstructure
what are the coordinating values what is beautiful that is worth and that is capable of binding
that kind of a specifically tech power and very specifically exponential tech power
so it's real interesting as we get further into this arts question
like Marvin Harris following Marx defined this pretty well with cultural materialism that
infrastructure drives social structure and superstructure but I would say all of the
metacrisis is defined by that direction right the social structure and superstructure getting
hollowed out by the inexorability on tech competition and I think the exact opposite
is key for game b how do we actually reify superstructure deeply what are what is a good life
what is beautiful what are the coordinating values to then have that reify of foreign by the people
social structures that can bind and direct the infrastructure and that is fundamentally the
domain of like arts and religion and spirituality so it's interesting as I think about it kind of
all of my hope actually lives in our ability to deepen that and have that be the basis for being
able to build new social structures that both implement and bind the tech I think in terms of
tech I think there's some cultures in the world who jumped straight from flint napping to forging
metals they skipped steps in their apprenticeship you know so if you don't come from a culture
that didn't have a few thousand years of ground edge ground edge stone tools then then you you
missed something in your development this is I don't really believe this I'm just this is kind of a
joke and a provocation but um yeah so I mean on our continent here you know we had ground edge
stone tools with thousands of years before anybody else so um and there's something you learn over
deep time from ground edge tools if you've ever made a ground edge rather than I'm sure everybody's
had a go at flint napping and I don't know what you use deer antler or something like that over there
um napping the flint and and that's fun but it's it's really immediate and quick you can make it in
a few minutes you know whatever you need um but a ground ground edge tool it takes weeks months it
can take a year you know to make it just right it takes a very long time and it's something you put
a lot of effort into and it's something you expect to last for a couple of generations it's something
you hand down to your kids and your grandkids that ground edge tool um you know and I've made
I've made a couple of axes and a couple of knives that way and it's taken years you know
that there is something you learn from that that's a kind of a more slow tech kind of way
but yeah that I I think you write the seeds are always there because we have it in our stories here
the stories are here warning against against those seeds of narcissism and everything in our law
and everything in our tech is about has always been about holding those things in check and
preventing multipolar traps from happening it's as soon as I learned that concept of
multipolar trap from you I think was the first time I ever heard it um you know I was looking
back through all our old stories and and it's like that's all I could see was people kicking
off multipolar traps and then getting smashed for it um you know and being punished and that being
stopped there yeah um very cool anyway I'm just teasing you about the the flint napping you
your flint tools are great they're lovely I was noticing um um in this notion of primitive
in the notion of a shift and maybe that's exactly right a shift into a uh kind of a different
mode of expression at least an up regulation of this notion of art one of the things that was
coming up for me was how important it is that it not be in the intent of translation
right so this this isn't an effort it would be it'd be wrong or to say it cleanly would be wrong
for the ones who are coming to with with art as a capacity to imagine what they are doing
is trying to take what Daniel said and express it in as in artistically that's the wrong move
there's a different move a right move which is that there's a a thing that just is and
the artist's job is to express it directly and to to learn how to become capable of expressing it
and to the degree to which the words and the drawings that have been produced allow a way of
tuning to the thing yeah to be able to notice that we're we're in the same place and then the
expression has a consonance with the words there's a correspondence or a or a harmony
of more specifically a coherence but isn't even vaguely trying to use the words to direct it
then it's well it goes beyond right that's the point right this next stage is actually
going beyond anything that's come so far so it's not a I think it's definitely not marketing
right it's not a try to wait to express to a broader audience something that has been expressed
so far in words or even to try to capture the ideas and polish them but rather a unique form
of expression of something that is calling for this mode and that's that's the way I would
urge it if there's a desire on the part of the artists to begin to play
yeah in art you never say the thing and that's I guess I guess you could argue that the game B
initiation video is is not art because it says the it says the thing it's it's it's
instructional is this this discrete sort of you know this knowledge is directly
sort of given their information um but I tell you I was talking to you heard of that find horn
community yeah in Scotland I was talking to them and and they were telling me about a problem
they had with an arsonist there so they got an intentional community but there was an arsonist
in the community at some stage they had no way of dealing with that now just telling that story
you know of a woman watching her house burning and and trying to figure out how the hell she's
going to deal with that in an intentional community where they got their own law it's like uh just
telling that story that would be a game B piece of art you don't mention game B at all you don't
mention um you know the game A bloody you know free loaders and all that kind of thing yeah
I have a thought on game B art and a game B art project that is somewhere between art and
design there's certainly a rational and consequentialist consideration but it is
there's also simply a feeling and maybe this would be the intersection of those
I was talking to B. R. K. Ingalls about a project that he's working on that is
uh putting together a model for the technosphere of the world that would work to solve the kind
of limits of growth problem and it's not trying to do the enactment of how do we actually get there
but with current tech what would a what would the energy system waste management agriculture
manufacturing production um city design transportation if if we could rebuild the
world from scratch today how would we build it that solved those things um just to basically
be able to explore the limits of what is doable and desirable with current tech and have us kind
of rethink it that that's an interesting project um I think there's an art project would be super
fucking interesting to me from this point of view of like environmental psych ontologic design
and environmental psych the broken windows theorem just changing like it's interesting because you
you cover over the graffiti and you fix the windows and you pick up the trash in an area
and crime drops 50 percent right like simply and you can say that's because it's signaling
there is law here and people care about it it's also that it's a more beautiful place
so people intrinsically care about it but the idea that like how criminal people are or the
nature of their psyches what's going on inside of them and their behavior changes so much by
their environment and then how a cathedral is designed or mosque is designed to evoke experiences
and the people inside and if we think about if you could apply cathedral design to the entire
techno sphere um not just how do we make a techno sphere that works well with the biosphere
but how do we make a techno sphere that works with the social sphere to enlighten the people
inside of it as the kind of design consideration and have people who are thinking from an environmental
psych point of view and from an artistic point of view so it's what is the most beautiful world
but not just limited to a particular lens on aesthetics but factoring the environmental
psych of what is a world that evokes the most beauty in the people and if we were to just say
if we got to kind of rebuild the world from scratch we got to redesign it re-art it how would we
do it what would it look like if you factored that the entire experience of the behaviors that
elicited and how it interacted with all the senses was maximally developmentally enlightening for
the people in it i would just love to see people working on that project
yeah that's what's going to be one of the fun things about the protobee movement as we actually
start to build communities on the ground uh membranes that are be-ish but communicate with each other
and with uh game a is that i would expect each protobee to develop its own aesthetic right uh to
essentially find its way towards mutual resonance between the people who live there uh and uh and
the build out of the property you know how much of the land goes for agriculture versus beautiful
gardens and nature how much for grazing versus field crops trees versus shrubs efficient quote
unquote rectilinear buildings versus less efficient but perhaps more beautiful uh you know no no sharp
corners kinds of buildings etc and then at the next level up you know let's say we have a thousand
protobees scattered around in uh 50 years 30 years or 25 years 25 years uh and someone comes of age
right so a a b grows up and you know they in like a lot of 17 year olds they look around and they go
damn this is some stuff you old shit you know this is stuff mom and dad designed right so one
could imagine them going on a on a heart journey uh and visiting many protobees right and one of the
things that they could be doing is tuning their aesthetics does the aesthetics of this protobee
that i'm visiting for two weeks uh resonate with me bring me life bring me joy make me a bigger person
than i was when i got here and when they run spring up yeah run spring i yes absolutely uh
but oh yeah and when they find the one that is aesthetically correct for them that may be a big
part of the halt of their journey uh and so this way uh protobees by the thousands and tens of
thousands are essentially a series of experiments and how does aesthetics and ways of living uh
resonate with the people that live within them uh and there is no right answer i would expect them
to be rather different right you know of course there'll be horizontal communications where tricks
of the trade uh that are figured out in one place like you know how do we build a package
sewage treatment plant that produces high quality compost right uh you know that'd be great to share
those techniques when somebody figures it out but when it comes to aesthetics and what songs what
kind of dance uh you know what what is the schedule of our rituals uh those probably
differ considerably at each one and that's a good thing right so what i've come to call coherent
pluralism is that we have some deep uh small kernel of coherence uh that we all agree to but
in terms of the build out of our of our lived experience uh we design it locally and and
resonantly between the people and the ideas and we should not expect them to be the same
you know how i know gameb is working jim is that um none of these participants here
hundreds of people none of them are listening to us right now it's all going off in the chat
that's where it's all happening they're not even listening to us they got their own things going
on in there that's how i know it's working that's how i know it's good oh well it's gonna be even
better when we're just completely silent and they're not listening to us then it'll be absolutely
perfect and let's see if uh people are listening so let there be light in the the stoa we'll pivot
to some questions uh and uh we'll go with Amy first our resident art critic here at the stoa
Amy if you could unmute yourself hello um so i really enjoyed the film um for me as a person
that's kind of ensconced in art and aesthetics i kind of look beyond just kind of the uh
the visuals and you know the script and that sort of thing to like the underlying what is being
communicated um i mean to me there's a fear-based mentality that kind of defines game-made dynamics
for me um scarcity that kind of thing so to me when you have a character like the pioneer um
whose voice is so anxious throughout the whole film and and i'm not i'm again i'm not like i'm not
trying to diss uh jake's film i think it was very well done um i'm wondering if
that's overly aligning with game a aesthetics and if game b artistic production needs to find a
different kind of aesthetic language that is not kind of aligning with fear with anxiety with
competitiveness and etc i i don't know if that question exactly makes sense and i think i mean
this is kind of what daniel was talking about with the idea of not just you know not just you
know kind of creating visuals but actually embodying a new kind of um mentality but i just
wanted to make that point and see if you all had any thoughts on it
truthy i'd like to hear jake react to that one
oh gosh oh thanks jim um i don't that isn't i don't i don't know maybe i don't understand
the question so much but it it doesn't feel whole to me to to think about a game b is not aligning
with that kind of energy um it's funny actually
the this i submitted this script to jim the first time and he was truly shocked and baffled and
and and then he said he said give it another round just see what you you can do with it and and i
said well how about i just write a completely separate film a completely different idea and it was
it was very uh pathetic it was it was the opposite it was it had uh some extreme kind of existential
horror in it um but to me that's you know that that's got to be part of game b too right i mean
when i said in the beginning this approach uh pro-topian vision you know it includes
it includes the shittiness of life right um so yeah yeah i'd also like to add that i think a
key consideration as remember we we are at the very tiny first baby steps of game b hood here
we are tiny game a is huge and powerful and all of us are completely saturated in what we've called
game a malware right there's all kinds of fucked up shits shit in our heads and you know at least for
me uh when i uh watch the film uh the pioneers journey is uh you know a whole lot about her
kind of going going back and forth between the possibility of game a and having all i mean
possibility of game b and having all this game a malware in her head represented by the parasite
and so uh you know this kind of ugliness uh strikes struck me at least uh as appropriate for a person
who's just stepping out of the big and strong game a into the tiny weak little game b
any of the other panelists have any thoughts to share on that question
i was writing something in the chat so i didn't hear the question
jeff you had to hand it yeah i mean um i think there's a a lot that we have to think about
in terms of conveying these ideas um and and the the way to do that is a little bit different
from the conventional way that we've been uh telling stories and expressing some of our our
artwork um i've been talking with jordan and some of the others here in the room
about new modalities of storytelling you know instead of the the drama of conflict
can there be a drama of reconciliation um the excitement of attempting systemic change rather
than wiping out the bad guy you know um the engagement that can be accomplished with
participative narrative we have technology that allows for um you know dozens or hundreds or or
tens of thousands of people to contribute to the story even to be credited for their
contribution through things like blockchain um that's really exciting it affords us new
opportunities to convey some of the elements of the of the game b narrative it's really exciting to
me in the past guys and i know this is a little trojan horsey but some of the some pieces of
popular entertainment are responsible really for changing attitudes and conversations about things
like race and gender all in the family um there was a a soap opera that came from South America
about a maid who was oppressed and who figured out how to educate herself through night school
and millions of of women across South America in the late 1960s started to go to night school
you know um Willan Grace started the conversation in the popular sensibility about being gay
we can do this with with game b narratives and game b components i'm pledged to i'm going to
tell you right here i just sold something to the wall disney company and it is going to be shot
through with game b you know and i'm going to trojan horse that thing right through the mouse's
ass so um you know let's all try and do that if that's our our inclination there can be some
Malcolm X's in the room but a few trojan horse through the mouse's ass this is how like game b
language is created creating culture right here there you go best meme ever uh graduate
student of the future who's unraveling how game b uh ended up being the world operating system
that'll turn out to be the pivotal moment in their dissertation
did you have any uh follow-up share
no i i but i think um jeff that you are correct that i think that they're that even the most
pop cultural kind of um you know sitcoms and tv shows have the possibility to change culture
i would just um love to see artistic product that was less aligned with game a personality
and dynamics just because i don't find them interested in personally um but thank you so much
agreed
but they um just did something come up about violence there i think there needs to be violence
i don't think it's a good idea to completely remove violence from your from your proto b
because um it ends up bubbling up that's how you end up that's what i told the find horn people
it's like like i asked them do you have any any combat rituals do you have like you know do you
all get out the front and punch on for a bit every now and then let off some steam you do you have
any violent games you play like to to work out all those problems do you have combat do you have
anything like that said no and i'm we eschew violence completely and i'm say well that's why
every now and then you know one of you's goes nuts and starts burning everyone's houses down
you need to uh humans need that outlet you got to let off some steam you got to punch on every
now and then amy so uh yeah that that came that came up there i reckon need a little bit of violence
it's got to be uh factored in the people who are defending and protecting game a are going to fight
you know so there's going to be violence there's going to be confrontation it's the reason why we
would fight that's the sort of the the curious thing about the whole is that it contains everything
that people ask the question early early about things like logic there's logic part of this game
being violence of course the answer is yes the question is can you use it as a medium of art
and you're actually coming from the place the place that is the thing from which art comes
and then you use the medium as a medium to express if you are then you're doing it and if you're not
then even if you're playing music or dancing you're not doing it you're doing propaganda or
marketing and so it's it's the connectivity the continuity the being part of the whole and
service to the whole to bring more wholeness in each step in every breath and so to live artfully
is art is to be an artist and that is in everything in every moment and every breath and every
stress and of course in every silence tyson i'm really glad that you brought up the uh maybe
fendorn had a problem because of not having violence um and and i'm thinking of art uh
i i grew up watching star trek the next generation when i was a kid and i think as far as art that is
visioning a like the stewing sci-fi that isn't dystopic um it was maybe one of the high
watermarks in pop culture and the fact that they had a wharf character and he needed to go to the
holodeck and fight i thought was a really important thing because you have the data character you have
the diana troi character you have like they they were kind of elements of the self being
archetypally represented or that's how i took it and uh you needed wharf's character right and
but you also needed a holodeck where they could go to war games otherwise it would reemerge um
there needs to be a place to experience oh yeah the multipolar trap actually sucks we
don't want to do that thing oh we have to understand this phenomena otherwise you never
get away from cultural decay that in a few generations the same shit repeats again because
you lost the lessons of the guys who figured out how to deal with the violence that emerged
and so you you're stuck in patterns of like four generation or however many generation
decay cycles then violence again if you don't stay connected to the lessons that were learned
through violence and um and so then you know and jordan said it's all still there i would
then say fear too right they all the things that evolved would have an evolutionary purpose and
this is if anything one of the things i noticed about the film and i don't think it did this wrong
because we just have to do this a million ways is in the very beginning it seems like you've
been playing game a do you want to play game b i think even thinking about game a to game b is
a fairly binary thing ends up being problematic that doesn't mean it's not useful or instructive
to begin with but when i think about defining it i'm like is do we get rid of conflict theory no
do we get rid of the evolutionary basis of fear no do i want to hold that as a value that drives
it into everyone's shadow so it just unconsciously hijacks them like an arson inside the way that
happens in the culture no um do we get rid of violence no okay well if we're still gonna have
conflict theory and we can see that there's a way in which even game a you can say has been
the like steven pinker's not totally wrong right the the book positive some is not totally wrong
things have moved towards more collective intelligence and more cooperation in many ways
um so in the face of how powerful the effects of our rivalry through warfare and how much our
externalities can be we're moving into a phase where we the phase where we just have to deal
with externalities and rivalry more than we ever did and so game b to me is kind of a threshold
dynamic on those um yeah
so as i spent a little bit more time with some zen Buddhists um i discovered that the
the notion of pissing people off isn't necessarily a bad thing so i i also noticed that i pissed a
lot of people off when i told them that the the nomenclature of game a game b was intended to be
a coin so if you hear game a game b and you hear a distinction you're hearing with game a
ears when you've landed in game b ears you don't hear it as a dichotomy it's a coin
that probably just pissed you off and so it probably landed right
i think it's it's like a rhyme scheme for a poem the a b a b
yeah there you go we're gonna get some game a b a b a b poems happening
so we're approaching the top of the hour and it might be good to have uh just like a go around
the panel to close and maybe i'll ask a question or prompt and i was like trying to hold back my
my giggles my stoic giggles as being the token stoic here at the store when you guys were talking
about stoicism as pier he though he he considered the stoic so they called the stoics as artists of
life not artists of reason as modern philosophers and the the idea is viewing life itself as as
a artwork and by trying to like earnestly adopt that this is i see everything as art like making
my bed to hosting a zoom room so i guess the question to close out is how are each one of you
making your life more life more artful
uh i'll start i'll take that one on first uh as not that much of a creative artist myself in fact
not at all uh i suppose to the degree that i'm trying to make my art my life artful is intentionally
living a far away from big cities uh on a farm uh you know growing our own food cooking our own
food hanging out with regular people and that sort of stuff it just feels so much more real than the
life uh uh used to live as you know deeply embedded in the matrix of game a so just
physically getting away from all that stuff uh is in its own way a way of living more artfully
i just said in the chat that the way you curate yarns on your podcast is art
thanks
jordan you're muted i was just pointing out jim's f bombs are particular you know he's a master of
the medium well my my um i suppose whether i like it or not my approach has been to endeavor to
sort of i imagine that everyone here has noticed that the world has continued to be even more of
a shoot show than it normally has been and it seems to just continue to press on that and uh
the approach that i've taken is to try to continue to to metabolize it and to continue to try to
drink as much of it in as i can and then to try to find a way to allow that to continue to become
part of me and then continue to show up in life in spite of that which is always very close to
not quite um and yet every morning there's a waking up and a continuing so that's the way
that i've been living our life artfully
janula or tyson do you want to close with the share
uh shared just a very simple thing not uh not very philosophically interesting but um
i've been writing more poetry again lately which is something that i go through faces with and
really love and it is very different than writing logical prose in terms of
both the feeling and states that it elicits in me and also even the types of insights so that's fun
just to thought there's no word for art or music in my language
which and um doesn't mean doesn't mean it's never been done it's it's it's interesting the kind of
art you do and the kind of music you do when you don't have words for those things it's very
unselfconscious um when it's not a thing when it's uh when it's a process yeah let's see that's
getting into linguistic relativism there which is a whole another whole another stowa episode
all right so i'll make some closing announcements in a moment but uh
jim jordan tyson daniel thank you so much for coming today to the stowa to be on this panel
and uh jake and jeff thank you for uh producing and creating uh this premiere
um so here at the stowa for 2022 we're trying to make art uh and we have um experimental art
with sessions and we have a few coming up this week one called the embodiment hour with skyler
brown uh skyler would you like to unmute yourself and share what that that's going to be
hi everyone this was really really fun thank you so much for for this um yeah so the embodiment
hour is um we take a piece of culture um anything from a tweet to a piece of a film
piece of art would be great maybe this week to stay with the theme um and then or an essay or
article like a conciliance article and we um take it in together as a group and then notice
what's going on for us in an embodied sense so we look at the feelings the sensations the
emotions that are arising and then we share um and make sense of the experience at that embodied
level together it's really fun yeah we watched a clip of don't look up last time and it was like
really a lot of constriction in the body uh and then the other session we have is called social
alchemy turning socially awkward situations to social art uh and a j bond and i uh it's kind of
like mba schools you know they have case studies for business cases we take social
awkward situations that someone brings forth and we try to transmute it into art and then the
session itself attempts to be art because as the stoep say don't explain your philosophy and body it
uh you can check that out at the stoa.ca and beneath roi uh and john revakie will be in
conversations on the session called the ecologies of the south which is the first time they're
in conversation so that's going to be quite epic uh so that being said uh everyone thank you so much
for coming to stoet today and thank you peter again for pulling this together
