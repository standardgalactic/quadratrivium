Checking Wade Center/Owen Barfield and Clyde Kilby on C.S. Lewis.txt
 It appears that you are sharing a conversation about the significance of a piece of furnitureâ€”the Marenny Waite collection, specifically the wardrobe from Lewis' home, which is associated with C.S. Lewis and his brother Warren Lewis. This particular wardrobe, which has become a focal point for fans of C.S. Lewis, particularly those who appreciate the "Chronicles of Narnia," was acquired by an individual or collection (referred to as "we" in the text) through an auction in Banbury. The wardrobe is handmade and carries emotional value as it was brought from Belfast to Oxford and survived the bombings during World War II.

The conversation then shifts to discuss the collection of C.S. Lewis' works, which includes first editions of all his books, and the impact of his children's book "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" on young readers. The speaker, Owen Barfield, recounts how he and C.S. Lewis first met at Worcester College, Oxford, through a mutual friend during a time when the college was expanding and hosting tea gatherings for students.

Owen Barfield and C.S. Lewis initially did not see each other frequently due to being in different colleges and their own social circles. However, after they both graduated, their friendship deepened, particularly during the 1920s when Barfield lived in Long Crandon near Oxford, and Lewis visited him often.

The conversation then touches upon a broader philosophical discussion about the nature of truth, as posed by the famous question: "What is truth?" Barfield highlights the difference between seeking to ascertain the truth about specific questions and the more profound existential questioning of whether truth exists at all. He notes that during C.S. Lewis' lifetime, there was a growing skepticism or peronist philosophy, as well as the influence of Darwinian evolutionary psychology, which were leading many to question traditional beliefs and values.

In summary, the conversation is a rich tapestry weaving together personal anecdotes about the acquisition of significant C.S. Lewis artifacts, the friendship between Owen Barfield and C.S. Lewis, and a philosophical reflection on the nature of truth in the context of early 20th-century thought.
