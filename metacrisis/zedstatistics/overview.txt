1. **Prior, Likelihood, and Posterior:**
   - The prior distribution represents your initial beliefs about the parameter of interest (theta).
   - The likelihood reflects how likely your observed data is under different values of theta.
   - The posterior distribution combines your prior beliefs with the information from your data, giving more weight to values that are supported by the data.

2. **Effect of Sample Size:**
   - As the sample size increases, the posterior distribution becomes more focused around the parameter values that are most consistent with the observed data, assuming the prior remains fixed.

3. **Point Estimation:**
   - In Bayesian statistics, you can estimate the parameter in several ways: by the mode (most probable value), median, or mean of the posterior distribution. Each method has its own reasoning and is a valid representation of the central tendency in the context of Bayesian estimation.

4. **Credible Intervals:**
   - Unlike frequentist confidence intervals, credible intervals have a probabilistic interpretation: there is a certain probability that the true parameter value falls within the interval.
   - The Highest Density Interval (HDI) is a specific type of credible interval that contains the highest proportion of the posterior distribution's density. No point outside the HDI has a higher probability than any point within it.
   - As the sample size increases, the posterior distribution becomes more normal-like, making it easier to calculate credible intervals using similar methods as those used for confidence intervals in frequentist statistics.

5. **Constructing Credible Intervals:**
   - The 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI) can be constructed visually by identifying the range of values where 95% of the posterior distribution's density is located, or more formally by using statistical software that can compute the HDI.

6. **Final Notes:**
   - Bayesian statistics provides a coherent and intuitive approach to dealing with uncertainty in parameter estimation by combining prior knowledge with observed data.
   - The choice of point estimate (mean, median, mode) and the method of constructing credible intervals can be guided by both statistical considerations and subject-matter expertise.
   - As you collect more data, your beliefs about the true value of the parameter will become more focused around the estimated value, assuming the prior remains the same.

Remember that Bayesian statistics relies on the choice of a prior distribution, which is not without its controversies and debates. It's important to choose a prior that reflects genuine uncertainty or informed belief, rather than one that imposes undue influence on the results.
