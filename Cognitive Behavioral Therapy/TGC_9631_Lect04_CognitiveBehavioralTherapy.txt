let's start with a quick exercise now it's important that you follow my
instructions in order for this to work whatever you do please do not imagine a
white elephant don't think about its shape don't think about its size don't
think about its color whatever you do don't think about its features do not
think about a white elephant so what happened well unless you were distracted
you probably thought about a white elephant the instructions were not to
think about it but in so doing it made you think about it and thus are the
nature of cognitions at least according to what's called the third wave of CBT
so what happened and how did we get here welcome to our lecture on CBT's third
wave thus far you've learned the basics of CBT the CBT triangle the basic
assessment tools how to create a formulation using the building blocks
of cognition and behavior in this lecture we'll take a look at therapies
that preceded CBT the first wave and therapies that have followed the third
wave although there are dozens of different types of therapies I like to
divide them into these three waves within each wave there are of course
subtypes but each wave shares core principles for wave number one we have
to go back to Sigmund Freud and his contemporaries although much of his
work has been discredited today he was incredibly influential in shaping how
we think about our minds our relationships and our day-to-day functioning in
wave one our mental lives are full of deep and meaningful symbols Freud's
cigar was not just a cigar but a representation of something else dreams
aren't just crazy images they have meaning and they often relate to our
deep-seated desires and fears a wave one therapist here's what you say but is
always trying to interpret what you really mean to say in a way it's all
very mysterious and difficult to follow but of course our interests our passion
really for deep symbolic thinking and analysis is part of our great literary
and religious traditions both are full of hidden meanings just waiting to emerge
700 years ago Dante was telling us oh you possessed of sturdy intellect observe
the teaching that is hidden here beneath the veil of verses so obscure it's a
treasure hunt and it's a challenge move to wave number two the cognitive model
or current CBT as we know it if you recall from our last lecture we had
talked about how oftentimes we think an activating event caused us to feel a
certain way or to do a certain thing what Beck and his contemporaries did for
us is to help us to see that there's actually an important middle step the
step of cognitions and specifically of automatic thoughts we have an activating
situation we have the beliefs or thoughts which are triggered and they in turn
trigger particular reactions emotional behavioral or maybe even physiologic
reactions but to dig a little bit deeper it's important that we think about the
different types of automatic thoughts that one might have and why we would care
now a core assumption behind cognitive therapy is that human beings by nature
aren't particularly rational in fact we aren't even mostly rational we take all
sorts of shortcuts in terms of how we think of how we process and how we make
decisions most second wave CBT CBT therapists are very familiar with what
are called habits of mind so just to give you an idea of some of the kinds of
habits of mind that we typically employ first example would be personalization
now some of us do this often all of us do this sometimes where an event happens
to us maybe in reality it was completely random but we believe we were
individually and specifically targeted we have over personalized something we
rely on magnification or minimization maybe we've lost perspective we've made
a mountain out of a molehill or maybe someone's given us a compliment but we
have devalued it or decreased it or minimized the positive thing that's
just happened to us we might be using what's called a mental filter we may be
selectively attending only to the good things or to the bad things or we might
be selectively recalling only bad things from our past you may be engaging in all
or none thinking you are there a complete success or you're a complete failure the
last two that are most common are mind reading oftentimes in social situations
even though we might be having a conversation with an individual there's
often a dialogue on a back channel where we're trying to imagine what it is that
they're really thinking what their motives might actually be sometimes we're
accurate oftentimes we're not so accurate and the last is something called
fortune telling where we're trying to predict what's going to happen in the
future if you're someone who's depressed you're probably making very dire or
very negative negative predictions so the first assumption is about automatic
thoughts knowing that they occur knowing that they're not particularly rational
and knowing that we oftentimes rely on these different habits of mind and
different individuals have different preferences for some of those habits of
mind you should recall to another key part of Bex model is it's not just about
the automatic thoughts but it's about the beliefs that are underneath those
thoughts and any any given activating situation different people might have
very different automatic thoughts why is that it's because of those beliefs that
are underneath those automatic thoughts we have rules of life or something called
conditional assumptions if I don't get an A on that test then I'm a failure we
also have core beliefs am I lovable am I worthwhile am I successful do people
care about me do people care about each other those core beliefs again vary from
individual to individual and they make themselves manifest in the present by
fueling particular flavors or types of automatic thoughts so I would suggest
doing just a quick homework exercise on your own as we begin looking at wave one
wave two and wave three why not apply it to your own life and see what it looks
like so ask yourself what are your preferred or most commonly used habits
of mine those are things like maximization and minimization things like
mind reading fortune telling over personalizing things there's no right or
wrong answer do you use those habits of mine and which do you use more often than
not what are your common conditional assumptions and these are the rules in
life the if I'm not perfect then I have failed or if I assert myself then people
are going to reject me it's not about being right or wrong and remember many
times it's not even rational but we've learned these rules growing up we've
internalized them and they continue to influence and affect our behaviors what
would you say are your core beliefs or schemas about yourself the world or
others and notice that I always use those three categories and that does come
from back core beliefs about your value your worth your success your love
ability core beliefs about the world and the way the world operates and core
beliefs about other people can you boil all of this down to those two core
beliefs about love ability and achievement as Beck would suggest or is it
more complex than that in order to collect more data on yourself I would
also suggest that you could fill out two questionnaires on your own the first
is called the DAS or the dysfunctional attitude scale in order to find it you
just go to our friend Google again type in DAS dysfunctional attitude scale and
you'll find PDFs as well as scoring guides the dysfunctional attitude scale
is a long list of a number of attitudes that we commonly hold about you guessed
it ourselves are the world and other individuals the second questionnaire that
I would recommend is something called the ATQ or the automatic thoughts
questionnaire as you might as you might imagine from the name it is a list of
different kinds of automatic thoughts and you endorse whether or not you often
have those particular kinds of thoughts again you can find it using our friend
Google let's go on to move to our first clip this is a clip of Maria now this is
an example of a fairly prototypical wave to exercise in which we're doing
something called the ABCD but you've done a great job with the capturing of
cognitions on the cognitive recording form and I wanted us to take that to the
next step where you're not just capturing cognitions but you're capturing
triggers and then we're thinking about how those cognitions affect your mood
and how they affect your behavior and what I've drawn for us is something
called the ABCD they call it that just for the four boxes the activating event
is the A the B is the beliefs the thoughts that you have the C is the
consequences so that would be the emotions and behaviors that are often
driven by the thoughts that you've had and the D is the dispute box so that's
the box where if you decide the consequences aren't something that you
want you begin to wrestle to rewrite to rethink these thoughts and I think for
us to do this there's a couple of things we should keep in mind one is the idea
that we've talked about before that thoughts are neither true nor false
they're helpful or hurtful their opinions their interpretations and
oftentimes we're making guesses and any number of guesses might be accurate I
guess if you want to use that term but they have different consequences so if
you're thinking about things in a certain way and it's causing negative
consequences we want to see if we can't help you to think about that same
situation in an equally valid but different kind of way so one is I think
one assumption is we want to remember that thoughts are just thoughts they're
not facts and they're changeable the other assumption is that thoughts serve
it as an important mediator between things that happen in the world in the
way that we feel as a consequence oftentimes we'll talk about how work
made me stressed or my daughter made me angry but it's not just the external
circumstance it's also how we interpret it how we understand it how we think
about it so it's the activating event the trigger it's how we think about it
or interpret it those two together help us understand why you're feeling a
certain way or doing a certain thing and if we don't want that then we go about
changing it this exercise is all very orderly organized and rational maybe
deceptively so but it does give us a framework to start dissecting potentially
complex events now Maria goes on to share her activating event of leaving her
husband to go out to do some errands and shopping and she was hoping to treat
herself by stopping at Starbucks before going home but she doesn't do it she
goes on to complete this exercise and we begin to understand why in this next
clip so you were out doing errands and some of the beliefs you had or the
the feelings you mentioned you felt guilty yes and you rushed through your
errands and you went home early yes I went home early okay Jack was asleep so
it didn't make any difference but I felt so bad and there was no Starbucks no
Starbucks alas okay so those were the consequences those are emotions and
those are behaviors you were out doing the errands you started having some
thoughts and you felt guilty so you rushed you went home early and you
didn't treat yourself so now we want to write down those
cognitions and this is just like that cognitive recording form that you were
using so in the moment when you were out doing those errands what were some of the
thoughts going through your mind well I was thinking something could happen to
Jack I was thinking that woman doesn't really understand him I was thinking I
ought to be there I mean I'm the one that's supposed to be taking care of him
I just felt guilty about not being there and not taking care of him I thought he
might be afraid or lonely or confused as the often is I've just written down a
few and as we've we've mentioned before there's always lots of cognitions and
really the skill is to hone in on some of the more potent cognitions that more
potent in the sense of they were really driving the guilt or driving the
behavior changes so I've written down something could happen I could see all
that would make you anxious and worried the home health care worker she doesn't
understand him so that's part of the guilt that's there I should be there and
you're not there so again the guilt set definitely seems like a driver he's
afraid and lonely and confused and again sort of guilt and maybe some sadness too
about that so all of those seem like they're pretty potent thoughts I'm just
going to draw that arrow to remind us that you have this activating event
triggers certain thoughts gives rise to certain emotions and consequences this
brings us to the dispute box so the D part of our this is the hard part this is
the hard part you know and oftentimes you want to come up with multiple
disputes and okay you probably want to pick just one of these we can do them
all but you have to start somewhere so well which one would you like to start
with I don't know what would you suggest well I think all of them seem to have a
an emotional charge yeah probably one three or four okay let's let's do one
okay so something could happen mm-hmm okay so what we want to do in the dispute
box and remember our goal isn't to be true or false it's to be fair it's to be
balanced it's to be rational it's to think about whether cognition is helpful
or hurtful so something could happen and I think sort of in the realm of
possibilities that would always be true right so even for a healthy person
something something could happen right so it's really about probabilities and
the probability may be big but it may be small but so it's yes something could
happen but what would you say to if you are out with Judith your friend and she
was worried that something could happen to her daughter or her husband or what
would you say to her they'll be fine okay right and why would you say that
because they can take care of themselves but how about your husband he can't take
care of himself well there is that woman I mean she is trained even if she
doesn't understand him and if he doesn't like her I guess nothing terrible could
happen because she would do something yes so well how about we put if he isn't
alone a trained just gonna use a symbol it's shorter a trained woman is there to
help okay and much of her training I'm sure is what to do in case of an
emergency I'm sure that's true so if something were to happen if you were to
fall then she would be right there okay and I'm just going to since we're
focusing on this one this is the one we're disputing but let's come up with
a couple of other ways that we might dispute it so one is well he isn't
alone a trained woman could be there to help so if something does happen it's
taken care of okay let's come up with another dispute what would help you take
care of that anxiety again imagine speaking with Judith or with a friend
or just trying to find a helpful way to think about that yeah I could talk with
Judith about it but maybe maybe I should look for a different caretaker one
that I trust a little more one that I mean I don't know if he'd like another
caretaker or not but maybe that would be the thing and that's a good example of
in the dispute box you know we usually think about cognitions but it can also
be a very specific concrete plan to do something differently so if you are not
comfortable or are not reassured by the caregiver that you have if you're afraid
she's not trained or qualified or husband doesn't like her you can certainly
find somebody else in this exercise we go on to talk about habits of mind
finding balance and what to do the next time she's out and she has a bout of
anxiety or guilt we're in a sense wrestling with her thoughts the exercise
follows three main steps we've talked about before we first identify
cognitions we analyze or evaluate those cognitions and then we try to rewrite
or restructure them now remember in wave 2 it's not just about cognitions it's
also about behaviors so we'll do some self-monitoring around behaviors we want
to know what behaviors are rewarding which are punishing which might have
shaped over time or which behaviors might have eroded or even disappeared over
time in our depression lecture we'll talk about a specific subset of CBT
called behavioral activation but it's still very much part of wave 2 let's
move then to talk about the emergence of wave 3 and in wave 3 it focuses on the
process of cognition rather on rather than on the content of cognition it's not
just about having a negative thought it's how much attention you pay to it
and to illustrate this I would like to share something called the bus analogy
taken from Steve Hayes who is the founding father of a third wave therapy
called acceptance and commitment therapy now in the bus analogy it goes
something like this imagine yourself as a bus driver you are driving your bus
down the road of life hopefully in the direction of your goals and your personal
values as you drive along life happens as it always does and people get on the
bus and people might get off the bus some of them are very positive and very
supportive some of them probably most of them are going to be fairly neutral but
some of the people that get on this bus are going to be negative they're going
to be disruptive they're going to try to pull you in a different direction now
you have a choice are you going to stop the bus and are you going to argue with
them are you going to divert and go somewhere else so they don't make so
much noise or are you going to continue driving down that true path in pursuit
of your goals and in pursuit of your values now you can guess what Steve Hayes
would say you keep driving your bus you don't give attention or time or
credence to those disruptors that have gotten on your bus you stay focused on
your value values and you act accordingly this is a central tenet of
acceptance and commitment therapy or ACT usually pronounced as the word act as
I mentioned it was developed by Steve Hayes who's at the University of
Nevada in Reno and it came out in in the late 1980s now act differs from
traditional cognitive behavioral therapy in that rather than trying to teach
people how to better control their thoughts feelings sensations memories and
private events act teaches them to just notice accept and embrace their private
events especially previously unwanted ones the core conception of act is that
psychological suffering is caused by experiential avoidance if we're afraid
or we're nervous of things we will not do it which deprives us of the
opportunity for learning and growth it's also caused by cognitive entanglement
this is where we get tangled up in our own thoughts and we begin to ruminate and
we often will go around in circles and circles and circles telling ourselves
not to think of that white elephant but in so doing it makes us think about it
even more and lastly psychological sufferings caused by the resulting
psychological rigidity from avoidance and from cognitive entanglement that
prevents us from driving down that road towards our values now act says that
many of our core problems are due to fear and it uses the word fear as an
acronym F E A R where F is fusion with your thoughts so rather than seeing
thoughts as opinions or mental activities that blows in and out of your
head you see yourself and your thoughts as the same the E evaluation of your
experience or maybe mis evaluation of your experience losing track of where
you are avoidance of your experience is a and they are reason giving for your
behavior or sometimes coming up with excuses for your behavior and the healthy
alternative is to act ACT to accept your reactions and be present to see choose
a value direction and T to take action now ACT has six core principles that are
meant to promote psychological flexibility and first we've talked
about a little bit cognitive diffusion so learning methods to reduce the
tendency to see thoughts and yourself as one in the same thing thoughts or
opinions they are just mental noise that may or may not mean anything
acceptance we want to allow thoughts to come and go without wrestling with them
remember wave 2 we literally write them down and we try to rewrite those thoughts
we're actively working with them in act we don't do that we just accept them as
thoughts that have come in and thoughts that are going to go out we want to keep
our contact with the present moment you don't want to get tangled up in those
thoughts the past you don't want to start fortune telling or future tripping
about what's going to happen in the future you want to cultivate and develop
a sense of mindfulness or the awareness of here and now experience with openness
interest and receptiveness you want to observe the self you want to be able to
do what Steve Hayes calls access the transcendent sense of self and what he
means by that is throughout our lives there's a lot of things that happen good
and bad there could be medical illnesses there could be divorces there could be
marriages there could be new jobs but inside all of those events the one thing
that's common is you the core of who you are or some people would say the soul of
who you are I've heard him ask patients before who were terminally ill and had a
lot of physical symptoms and a lot of physical suffering saying how are you
the person inside that illness how are you doing teaching people to observe the
self the core of who they are teaching people to look at their values now I
mentioned driving that bus down a road towards your value one exercise in act
is to help people to remember what their values are when was the last time that
you sat down and created a list of your values and did an evaluation of whether
or not you're living your life in regard or it being true to your values and the
last is committed action so setting goals according to values and carrying them
out responsibly so we've talked about evidence-based medicine and the
importance of research what research supports the use of act or third wave
therapies and I want to share just a few studies so the first was a systematic
review published by Swain and colleagues in 2013 where they looked at 38
different studies that included a total of 323 different patients these were
with a variety of different kinds of anxiety disorders they found that there
was what they called preliminary support for broad spectrum anxiety disorders the
problem was these weren't particularly well-designed studies and many of them
did not yet have control groups so looks good but not particularly convincing
just yet next study this was a higher quality study done by who know and
colleagues in 2013 this was another systematic review put out by the
Cochrane collaboration if you're not familiar with Cochrane they do a number
of very high quality and also very expensive systematic reviews so a lot
of scientists researchers teachers and clinicians will go to Cochrane first and
see if they've put out the final word on a particular treatment so Cochrane
through who know publishes this particular review of third wave therapies
in comparison to other therapies both first and second wave they found that
there were only three high quality randomized controlled trials at this
point and only about 144 people had been treated what they found though is that
act was equal to CBT and to a subset of CBT called behavioral activation that
we'll be talking about in our depression lecture the last that I'll
mention is an act systematic review and meta-analysis published by Lars Gorin
Ost in behavioral research and therapy in 2014 now in this one he found 60
randomized controlled trials about 4200 patients and concludes that act is
probably efficacious for chronic pain for tinnitus so ringing in your ears
possibly for depression for psychosis for obsessive compulsive disorder for mixed
anxiety drug abuse and work stress so that's a fairly long list again there's
some issues with quality as there are with all of these studies but again for
a relatively young therapy it's looking like things are pretty good let's move
on to our next clip here we have a clip of Michael and in this particular clip
we're setting up what might be considered a third wave exercise we're
talking about de-centering and we're moving in the direction of diffusion
let's see how we describe this for Michael okay Michael so the next thing I
wanted to do is just to take a few minutes to talk about something we've
been practicing a bit already but to put a name to it and to develop the skill a
little bit more and what is called as de-centering or sometimes called de-fusion
and what I mean by that is is first of all it's an attitude or it's an approach
that we are different from our thoughts we are different from our emotions that
our emotions our thoughts they're all they're both mental activity but they're
not the sum total of who we are we have lots of different thoughts lots of
different emotions that come and go even if we have favorite ones we tend to
gravitate to there's still a person inside there whatever your your belief
is your your personality your soul your whoever there's a person in there that
experiences those thoughts and emotions and we don't have to necessarily get
tangled up and pulled into those thoughts and emotions if we don't want to so we
want to step outside of the center of the storm if you will to de-center
yourself or not allow yourself to be fused to those thoughts or emotions so
you defuse yourself and part of what you've been doing with the thought
records and even with the ABCD a little bit is that we've been stepping back and
saying thoughts are neither true nor false they're helpful or they're hurtful so
they're they're not who you are they're not a fact out there in the world they're
an opinion there's something that we can write down there's something that we
can think about there's something that we can step outside of or de-center from
so it's it's partly an attitude but it's also a skill set so I think when you
are in the moment when that storm starts to blow in those thoughts and emotions
there are things you can do like a thought record but there are other things
that you can do that maybe work better in the moment to keep yourself from
getting sort of swept up into that current and I know for you we've talked
mostly about anger a lot of different emotions too but but anger is one that
comes up and I thought maybe we could talk about a hypothetical but likely
scenario where a storm might blow in and there are things that you could say to
yourself in the moment that would promote de-centering okay how does that
that sounds good okay it sounds good so the idea is I don't always have that
thought record with me or I'm not always in a situation where I can just
process it so this is another strategy for separating out exactly and of
saying and reminding yourself and this is might even be something you say to
yourself in the moment I'm I'm different than my emotions I'm different than my
thoughts I can choose to attend to them to pay attention or I can choose just to
let the storm blow through okay right so the part we weren't able to show you
was the ongoing practice in mindfulness that Michael must engage in if
something like diffusion is going to occur mindfulness is not something that
can be done in one exercise two exercises or even ten exercises you have
to as they say put in your time on the cushion in order to develop those
skills of being present fully present in a non-judgmental way now there are a
number of different strategies to get to mindfulness meditation is usually the
most common most of them or all of them involve some form of concentration
often concentrating on your breath some degree of relaxation or somatic
quieting and a hefty dose of acceptance acceptance of the self and
acceptance of others now the last third wave therapy I wanted to mention is
something called mbct which stands for mindfulness based cognitive therapy
developed by Zendal Siegel and John Teesdale and others and here as the name
implies we're back to mindfulness but we're melding it with cognitive therapy
in a way that Zendal has described it before it's sort of like Buddhist
meditation meets cognitive therapy now the two may seem mutually exclusive at
first how can you wrestle with your thoughts in wave 2 CBT and how can you
just observe your thoughts and accept them in mindfulness based meditation and
you're right you can't do them both at exactly the same time but what Zendal
and John and others that practice in bct would suggest is that it's important
that you have both of those tools and depending on the situation you may want
to roll up your sleeves and wrestle with this thoughts or you may just want to
sit back and practice mindfulness and acceptance let the storm blow in and let
the storm blow out again let's turn to look at the evidence in a randomized
controlled trial of 145 recovered but recurrently depressed patients versus
controls versus mbct over a 60-week period they found that 66% of the
controls had relapsed versus only 34% of those who were in mbct in another study
a systematic review and meta-analysis by piet in 2011 they looked at six
randomized controlled trials of nearly 600 patients they found that mbct
significantly reduced the risk of relapse or recurrence with a risk ratio of
0.66 meaning that the relative reduction of relapse dropped by about 34% now we
know that people who are depressed even if treated successfully will often
relapse so it looks like the addition of mindfulness with CBT helps to reduce the
risk of relapse in those individuals so where does that leave us well recall we
have the first wave in psychodynamics this course is mostly focusing on second
waves but there is this important third wave that seems to be qualitatively
different where it's not just about content it's about process now there are
a number of case implications for Carol who's tormented by anxiety provoking
thoughts with clear experiential avoidance for Michael who may need to
review his values and is he behaving in a way that's in accordance with his
values or for Maria her primary stressor her husband's death is beyond her
control what would acceptance bring for her now in the end it's about
integration of the different waves and it's about finding a recipe a mix through
theory and trial and error that will work for each individual people can learn
seemingly contradictory skills and switch between them if one turns out not to
work so well please join me for our next lecture where we'll talk about stress
we'll talk about the what the how the why we'll talk about assessment and most
importantly we'll talk about interventions
