In this lecture we're going to move into the 17th century and look at the most important
function to be discovered since the trigonometric functions, namely the logarithm and also the
exponential function, exponentials were certainly dealt with before the 17th century, but as
a function that really only begins in the 17th century. But before I start to look at
logarithms and exponentials I need to back up a bit into the middle of this 16th century
and look at what was happening in astronomy because that would directly influence what
would then happen in the 17th century. 1543 is the year that Nicholas Copernicus published his
groundbreaking work on the revolution of the heavenly spheres. Copernicus was a Roman Catholic
monk in Poland and he was trying to understand the motion of the planets and in particular he
was very disturbed by this problem of retrograde motion, this apparent backward motion of the
planets at certain times. And if you recall back when we looked at astronomy in ancient Greece,
this was one of the problems that Archimedes raised and a number of different Greek scientists,
astronomers looked at this problem and one of them was Aristarchus who suggested that what was
happening was that the earth was actually going around the sun and that would explain this retrograde
or backward motion of the planets. The problem with that explanation of Aristarchus was that we
have absolutely no sense of a motion of the earth, it appears that the earth is stationary and so
that was quickly dropped in favor of a slightly later explanation that came from Apollonius of
Perga, the same Apollonius who did the important work on conics and it's Apollonius who came up
with the idea of epicycles that in fact the earth is stationary at the center of the universe and
what is actually happening is that the planets are traveling around the earth on little circles whose
centers then travel around the earth and this would become the foundation for what was known as
Ptolemaic astronomy, certainly there were many Greek astronomers before Ptolemy who established
this system but Ptolemy really showed how you could model the movement of the planets using
these epicycles and over the succeeding centuries the system became more and more complicated because
whatever system was in place never really matched what people were observing in the heavens and so
they tried the idea of equance, they tried putting epicycles on epicycles, they got very complicated
models and what Copernicus decided to do was to simplify this process or try to simplify the
process by going back to the idea of Aristarchus and postulating that it was in fact the earth that
goes around the sun rather than the sun that goes around the earth. The problem with Copernicus's
work is that he also assumed that everything went around the sun in a circle and observations were
sufficiently accurate by this time the mid-1500s that that simply did not accurately predict where
the planets should be, the planets weren't where they were supposed to be if in fact they were
traveling in nice circles around the sun and so a number of astronomers began to try to to improve
on this model and figure out what was really happening. Something else with Copernicus is that
in his book on the revolution of the heavenly spheres actually he probably did believe that
the earth moves but he simply puts it forward as a hypothesis as a possible model but succeeding
astronomers began to suspect that maybe in fact the earth is moving around the sun but what was
needed were much more accurate observations of the positions of the planets on which a better
model could be built and the person who undertook to find these observations was a Danish astronomer
by the name of Tycho Brahe born in 1546 he would die in 1601. He was a very wealthy nobleman
it's actually been estimated that at one point he personally owned one percent of all of the
wealth in Denmark and he set up an astronomical observatory on the island of Häven it's just
off the coast of Sweden actually between what is now Sweden and what is now Denmark although at
that time what is now southern Sweden was was part of of Denmark. Brahe had studied astronomy in
Copenhagen he had then gone to Germany to continue his study of astronomy while in Germany he engaged
in a duel where his nose was sliced off and rather unfortunately he went through the rest of his
life with a tin nose something that makes him very distinctive we know that he also studied medicine
and alchemy. He made two important observations in his observatory in Häven the first 1572
was a careful observation of a supernova so a star suddenly becomes a brilliant light in the sky
and then disappears and Brahe observed this and one of the things that this showed is that in fact
the stars in the heavens are not eternal they can appear out of nowhere they can disappear
and so this began to undermine the Aristotelian view of the heavens something else that Brahe
observed in 1577 was a comet now if you really believe that the heavens are perfect you can't
have anything moving through the heavens it was believed up until that point that comets were
actually something that happened within the atmosphere of the earth and Brahe did very
careful observations and measurements of the position of this comet and he was able to show
definitively that the comet in fact was well beyond the reach of the moon it was well outside the
atmosphere of the earth and so it really was moving through the heavenly rain.
Brahe you must remember was working before the time of telescopes and so all of the observations
that he was making were being made simply by the naked eye with very accurate instruments to line
things up but without the aid of a telescope. Now the best you can normally hope for in this case
is to get an accuracy of about two minutes of arc so 360 degrees is a full circle
and one sixtieth of a degree is a minute and actually if there are two stars in the sky whose
difference is less than two minutes of arc it's very difficult to tell them apart so that's normally
about the best you can do with naked eye observations. Brahe actually was able to push that a little
bit further looking back at his records we now realize that sometimes he was able to get the
position of the planets down to within half a minute of arc very often within yeah within one
minute of of arc but he had these incredibly accurate observations in 1599 he was hired by the
Holy Roman Emperor of the time Rudolf II whose capital was in Prague to be the court astrologer
and as I mentioned in earlier lectures there really at this time was no difference between a
mathematician and astronomer and astrologer so Brahe as an accomplished astronomer would also have
been much sought after as an astrologer trying to predict the position of the planets and interpret
what that actually meant for what would go on on earth and shortly after he became court astrologer
he hired a young assistant Johannes Kepler. Kepler had been born in 1571 shortly after Kepler became
Brahe's assistant Brahe died and there was a story circulated at the time that the reason
that he died was that he was at a banquet with the emperor and he desperately needed to relieve
himself but being seated at table with the emperor he could not simply get up and leave the table
until the emperor was ready to get up and leave the table and the story was that his bladder burst
and he died of the infection well about 50 years ago Brahe's corpse was exhumed and examined
and I'm not sure how much of his bladder was left at that point but they did an analysis of his hair
and discovered that in fact he had died of mercury poisoning now this raises all kinds
of suspicions because in fact Kepler benefited greatly from Brahe's death and it has been suggested
that perhaps Kepler had a hand in doing in Brahe. Kepler inherited Brahe's position as court
astrologer to Rudolph II and he also inherited all of Brahe's very valuable data and it became
Kepler's life work to take this meticulous data and try to find a model that would fit it and Kepler
eventually would succeed in doing this but to do it he needed to do very extensive calculations
very involved calculations eventually he would come to the realization that the reason that
Copernicus was off is that the orbits of the planets are not circles they are actually ellipses
they're ellipses not with the sun at the center of the ellipse but with the sun off at the focus
of the ellipse and so he realized that the data that Brahe had collected could be explained with
this model Kepler came up with other rules other laws of celestial motion he realized that the
planets sweep out equal area and equal time and practically what this means is that the
planet speeds up as it comes in close to the sun and then it slows down as it moves away from the
sun so it's not always traveling at the same speed and another one of Kepler's laws is that the
square of the time that it takes to complete an entire revolution is proportional to the cube
of the average distance to the sun now Kepler came up with many other laws in many respects he
really was an astrologer and a mystic he explained the relative distances of the planets in terms of
platonic solids each one sitting inside another he also talked about the way in which the crystalline
spheres that the planets were embedded in would rub against each other and he talked about the music
of the spheres and he actually describes the kinds of harmonies that the planets make as they
travel around the sun but i want to get back to his question of trying to work with building this
model by doing these very involved calculations with the kind of data that he had inherited from
brahe kepler needed to be able to do calculations that were accurate to five digits and in fact
shortly after kepler began doing his work on brahe's data the telescope was invented galileo
would be the first person to actually begin to use the telescope to look at the stars and this
happened very early in the 1600s kepler then would begin to get even more accurate data very
quickly he needed not just to do five digit calculations but seven digit calculations and
certainly by 1630 the data that was available coming from the telescopes was sufficiently
accurate that people needed to be able to do calculations that maintained 10 digits of accuracy
now doing multiple multiplications and divisions and evaluating trigonometric functions to five
or seven or 10 digits of accuracy is extremely difficult and so a computational device was
needed in order to make this easier to do and that computational device would be invented
by the scotsman john napier napier was born in 1550 he was a scottish nobleman he was the
lair of marchistan in what today is is now part of edinburgh and he had many interests he was
interested in theology one of his famous works was published in 1593 and it was a diatribe against
the catholic church called the plain discovery of the whole revelation of st john in which he talks
about how the revelation of st john is really describing the pope as the antichrist but despite
this great skepticism of the catholic church he did travel to italy in 1594 it's very possible
that he actually met gallileo at that time but he clearly came back from italy with an interest
in developing these computational tools for making it easier to do multiplications and divisions
and in 1614 he finally published his work what he called description of the wonderful canon of
logarithms now the word logarithm is a word that was invented by napier to describe what he had
created and there are various ways of understanding its etymology you can actually see its root in
the phrase ratio number which is a reasonable explanation for what's going on with the logarithm
but the etymology that i really like is to take logarithm as being composed of two greek words
logos and arithmos and if you recall back when i was talking about greek mathematics i said that
they viewed mathematics as two different areas one was logos or logical mathematical reasoning
and the other was arithmos from which we get our word arithmetic and this is calculation
and the beauty of the logarithm is that it applies this logical mathematical reasoning
to the problem of calculation and that's precisely what napier was getting at trying to simplify
calculations and the idea behind the logarithm is to exploit what happens when you're working with
exponents so let me give you a simple example let's say that i want to multiply 16 times 128
well if i know my powers of two i know that 16 is two to the fourth power and i know that 128
is two to the seventh power now one of the results that the islamic mathematicians were
certainly very well aware of and was now known in western europe is that if i want to multiply two
to the fourth times two to the seventh i can accomplish that by adding the exponents two to
the fourth times two to the seventh that's four copies of two times another seven copies of two
i get 11 copies of two four plus seven is 11 and if i know my powers of two i can simply read
off a table two to the 11th is 2048 well that's great if i'm trying to multiply two powers of two
what if i want to multiply 19 times 33 well it is possible to write 19 as a power of two
you can work with fractional powers of two two to the one-half power is the square root of two
two to the five-thirds power is two to the fifth and then take the cube root of that
so if i have any rational exponent that actually represents taking a power and then taking a root
that represents some number and there actually is a power of two that gives us 19
it's going to be between two to the fourth which is 16 and two to the fifth which is 32
and the actual power of two that gives you 19 to seven-digit accuracy is 4.247928
in the same way we can write 33 as a power of two so and then we can multiply 19 times 33 by adding
these two powers of two that gives us two to the 9.292322 and if i've got a table of powers of two
i can see that that's approximately 627 since 19 times 33 is an integer i know that it's got to be
exactly 627 now if i look at that exponential equation two to the 4.247928 equals 19
what is happening there if i start with a 19 and i want to know what that exponent is
what napier did was to call the exponent the logarithm of 19 now the number that we're
exponentiating that two is called the base so two is the base 4.247928 is the logarithm
of 19 for the base two and the problem then becomes given an integer find the exponent of two
that's going to lead to that integer in other words find the logarithm base two and then if you
know the logarithm if you know the exponent what is the number that that comes out of that
and so this introduces the idea of the exponential function we're interested not just in two squared
and two cubed and the integer powers of q of two or the simple fractional powers of two
we're interested in two raised to a power that could be any real number we're now interested in
the exponential as a function now in order to be able to do the kinds of calculations that napier
needed to do and that the astronomers people like Kepler needed to do if we want seven-digit accuracy
then what we're going to need to be able to do is find tables of logarithms for all of the numbers
in increments of one in 10 million now i can simplify the problem slightly by just asking for
the logarithms of the numbers between one and ten if i know the logarithms of the numbers between one
and ten and i've got two numbers like 19 and 33 i can divide 19 by 10 and 33 by 10 and i'm taking
the product of 1.9 times 3.3 and if i know that product i take that answer and i just pull put
the factors of 10 back in so i'll take my answer and multiply it by 100 but this still is a problem
of how to get the logarithms of the numbers from one to ten down to the kind of accuracy that you
need and one of napier's great insights is that if you know the logarithms for base two you can use
them to find the logarithms for base three or any other base you want to use that there is always
going to be a simple conversion factor so that if i calculate the logarithms for base two i can use
them to find logarithms for base three or base five or base ten or whatever base i might want to use
now a base that actually makes sense if you're going to do seven digit accuracy
is the base 1.0001 so that's 1 plus 1 over 10 million if i can find the logarithms for that base
and the powers of that base are fairly easy to calculate if i want to multiply a number by
1.0000001 i just take that number and that that same number with a decimal point moved over seven
places and add those two together if i want to take those powers that will give me the seven digit
accuracy that i need but in order to get the logarithms for all the numbers from one to ten
i'm going to need 23 million powers of 1.0000001 now that's an impossible task and napier realized
that he couldn't do those 23 million calculations but his insight that once you know the logarithms
for one base there will always be a simple conversion factor that enables you to find the
logarithms for any other base actually enabled him to find these 23 million values very easily
what he actually did was to first find the powers of 1.01 that go from 1 up to 10
you only need 230 powers in order to accomplish that and then what he did was to interpolate
between those so he then took the powers of 1.0005 20 powers of that enabled him to get numbers
between 1 and 1.01 between 1.01 and 1.02 and so on and then he looked at the first 50 powers of
1 plus 1 over a hundred thousand and that enabled him to interpolate between the values that he
already had and then he looked at the first hundred powers of 1 plus 1 over 10 million
and that enabled him to interpolate behind beyond the the remaining powers so with just a few
hundred calculations he was actually able to set up tables that would enable somebody to find
logarithms logarithms to the base 1.0001 for all numbers between 1 and 10 to the desired
seven digit accuracy but he also realized that since it was so easy to change these
bases back and forth it was there was no reason to stick with the base 1.0001 he could choose
any base he wanted and so the question that he next grappled with is what base to use and what he
did was to consider two lines with points moving along each line and on the first line we've got
the point that we want to take the logarithm of so we're going to take the logarithm of a real
number and that real number is traveling along this first line and on the second line we look at
the image of that point under the logarithm so i've got a point like three on the second line
the position is going to be at the logarithm of three when the first point gets to five
the point on the second line is moved up to the logarithm of five get up to 13 it's moved up to
the logarithm of 13 the point on the first line travels at a uniform speed how fast is the point
on the second line move well what napier realized is that the point on the second line
moves at a speed that is inversely proportional to the distance that the point on the first
line is moved in other words if the first point has moved to position x the speed of the point
on the second line is going to be some constant divided by x the value of that constant is going
to depend on the base that i am using for the logarithm and what napier decided was to choose
the base that would give him a speed where that constant of proportionality was exactly equal to
one now for those who know a little bit about calculus you may have realized at this point
that that's exactly equivalent to finding the slope of the derivative of the logarithm function
and that the slope of the derivative of the logarithm logarithmic function is inversely
proportional to the value at which you're you're evaluating it and that it is this particular
logarithm that napier chose that is what today we call the natural logarithm napier never actually
worked out what that base needs to be but it was later observed that it's it's a number between two
and three it's about two point seven one it's a number that would later be referred to by the
letter e and e now is known as the base of the natural logarithm it is the base of napier's
logarithm the actual name natural logarithm would be invented later on in the 1600s
while napier used this particular base two point seven one
henry briggs down in london got a hold of napier's work on logarithms and recognized that a lot of
the calculations would be much easier if instead of using this strange number two point seven one
napier would actually go back and use the base 10 uh if you're actually taking powers of numbers
a base 10 makes it much easier to to work with and so briggs went up to edinborough in 1615
and he convinced napier instead of working out his table of values with 2.71 as the base to use
10 as the base briggs would then go on to develop his own tables of logarithms and in 1628
briggs would actually publish a table of logarithms that was accurate to 10 digit accuracy
but napier's logarithm this 2.71 base would wind up having a very important role to apply in the
calculus and in the mid 17th century two belgian jesuit sgregoria st vincent and alfonso antonio
de sarasa would consider the problem of finding the area underneath the curve of a hyperbola so
that's a curve that's simply the reciprocal of the variable so the graph of y equals 1 over x
and what they were able to show is that if you look at the area underneath this curve starting
at x equals 1 going up to some value say t the area underneath the hyperbola from 1 to t is actually
given by napier's logarithm of t it's given by this natural logarithm of t and so we get
both the exponential function and the logarithmic function coming in and they would be very important
concepts as mathematicians then went on to develop the calculus i'll talk about that more in later
lectures but for the next lecture i want to go back to the beginning of the 1600s and take a look
at another one of the important influences of astronomy and that is on the work of gallileo
and the beginning of the understanding of the mathematics of motion
