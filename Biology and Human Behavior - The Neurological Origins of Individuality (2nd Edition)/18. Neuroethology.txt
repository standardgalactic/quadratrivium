Lecture 18, Neuroethology.
Well now that we've all had a nap, we can add to the concept in this lecture of ethology
by adding on two more syllables, now switching to the notion of neuroethology, the notion
of beginning to understand how the brain responds to ethological sort of signals in the world
around it, releasing stimuli on how the brain in turn produces those fixed action patterns
looking at the way in which ethologists think about the brain basis of behavior neuroethology.
Now in order to approach that we need to pick up one more of the building blocks of ethology.
Where were we in the last lecture?
We're looking at how these folks thinking about behavior, not rats and cages, not give
me a boy, a dog, a rat, a pigeon, whatever, not there are only single rules for how behavior
works but instead this vast variability of animals behaving in their appropriate context,
their natural setting, asking number one, what's the behavior look like, the fixed action pattern.
Number two, what's the adaptive value of the behavior and rather than evolutionary models
speculating about adaptation, actually going and doing the experiment to show what the
adaptive value is. What we shift to now is that third piece that ethologists would think
about what is it in the environment that triggered that brain to produce that fixed action pattern
of whatever adaptive value. What's the releasing stimulus? And it's in this realm that one
needs to most definitely interview an animal in its own language and back to our simplest
version of that which we've seen a couple of times by now, back when the limbic system
was the Rhine and Cephalon, makes no sense until you recognize for a rat most of its
language is olfactory and you sit there and you count the number of synapses going from
the ear to the limbic system, the mouth to limbic system, the eyes, the nose and nose
has far more access to emotion in a rat. And that's a realm in which neuro-ethology
thrives understanding how the brain is wired up in one species, dramatically different
from another. Geez, wonder what that's about because different species are paying attention
to dramatically different things in the world, different releasing stimuli. So of course
the first question becomes, how do ethologists study this? And we've already seen rather
than armchair speculating what they would do were a lot of these experiments actually
out in the field sort of thing and getting at the notion of what a releasing stimulus,
what the sensory information is which triggers an animal to produce a behavior is where they
did a whole classic style of experimentation. Okay, suppose you've got some bird and is
the case with a lot of birds, there's some distinctive dot on its beak and it's bright
red, something like that. And it looked as if in some species this was the thing that
chicks would hone in on when they would peck on mom's beak and that would be a signal for
mom to give it food or however things worked at that point. And of course you come up with
this ethological speculation, what is triggering this pecking behavior on the part of the kid?
What is triggering this fixed action pattern? What's the sensory information that triggers
it? And there would immediately be the speculation that it was this spot on mom's beak. So what
would you do? All sorts of experiments, first version, you get some white out or something
and you paint over the spot there so you've now got a mom without that spot to the kid
stop pecking at it. Then you do the replacement, the substitution, the replication strategy.
What you do here is now after you've whited it out you paint back a little red dot there
and you see if the behavior starts coming back again. Okay, is it the redness of the
dot? Is it the size of the dot? You put a dot that's blue, you put a dot that's checkered,
you put a dot that's paisley. Whatever you put on a pattern all over the beak, is it
the dotness or is it simply having anything there? You see how much of the behavior you
would list it or you can give what they call a super stimulus. Instead of this little red
dot it would be this shining huge fluorescent red dot and you would see if these chicks would
now peck till the cows come home you would begin to understand what are the parameters
of the sensory information that would trigger this behavior. And these would be this classic
sort of experiments these guys would do and once again actual experiments showing well
what is it that triggers this? And it's in this realm that you would begin to see this
whole universe of animals getting sensory information we haven't a clue about. We limited
human primates. And what you would find out is not only are there all sorts of different
types of sensory communication but in different species what's the most salient type of information
in the world around you can differ dramatically. So some examples. Auditory information. There's
all sorts of deer species where you've got seasonal ovulation or induced ovulation a
female will ovulate if and only if there's an appropriate male around how does she figure
out there's an appropriate guy around and it turns out it's this vocalization. The males
give this calling this bellowing thing that's heard for miles all over the woods of Minnesota
or wherever this occurs and it's the sound that triggers the ovulation. And you by now
could probably construct some sort of hypothetical pathway probably not the right one but almost
certainly a perfectly plausible one for evolution to have come up with getting from the ears
of those females to the limbic system to the hypothalamus to reproductive hormones and
we could begin to imagine a plausible neural circuit by which some guy bellowing across
the lake makes you ovulate. So for this species the releasing stimulus for a whole bunch of
reproductive behavior is auditory. Meanwhile there's those electric fish and they're going
about courting each other singing an electricity and you get species specific animal specific
electric songs you get males competing with each other and in this case rather than the
sperm competition of that prior lecture you've got electrical competition singing their electric
songs and jamming each other's frequencies trying to block each other's calls that way
this whole world that would make no sense at all unless you're thinking about interviewing
an animal in its own language an electric one in this case. Or as we've heard a number
of examples of the centerpiece of our Rhine and Cephalon there's a gazillion species out
there where the most important things in their lives are olfactory. Olfactory information
pheromones is the term we've been using at a number of points here odorants out there
in the air coming from another member of your species bringing you information and in the
world of rodents and canines there's phenomenally subtle olfactory information pheromonal information
telling you the gender of the other individual their health whether they're scared whether
they're stressed whether they're ovulating whether they have their testes whether there's
testosterone derived molecules in their pheromones whether there's estrogen derived all sorts
of information like that for a rodent its world of releasing stimuli is overwhelmingly
olfactory. Now this approach also helped inform a much more subtle much more landmark side
of studies telling us about the releasing stimuli for something else. Okay you ask what
seems a mindlessly simple question about child development why do babies get attached to
their mothers and you're some behaviorist and you have the answer immediately because
mom positively reinforces you what is that mom provides for you she provides calories
that sort of thing ooh without calories you die and you don't pass on copies of your genes
the positive reinforcement of behaviorist viewpoint you attach to this female this organism
who is mom because when you're hungry she makes the hunger go away great I think I'm
going to hang out around her. Perfectly obvious solution and the behaviorist explanation that
dominated throughout pediatrics in the early part of the last century and then along came
one of the most controversial scientists in all of psychology a man named Harry Harlow
working at the University of Wisconsin who questioned this assumption and came up with
in some ways an ethological experiment a classic one that winds up in every single textbook
out there asking why is it that infants attached to mom and this is this iconic picture that
you always see he took baby Reese's monkeys and he gave them two types of artificial mothers
to choose from one of them was made out of chicken wire this chicken wire tube and stuck
on top was the styrofoam head that kind of looked like something with two eyes and ears
and all of that and out of that chicken wire mom's torso came the thing that every behaviorist
on earth would want which was a bottle filled with milk. Meanwhile next to it was the other
surrogate artificial mom and in this case not giving milk but the chicken wire torso
was covered with warm felt and what you wound up seeing was a very surprising answer very
surprising if you're BF skinner who would be there clutching the chicken wire mom with
a bottle there but what everybody else is able to guess if they ever had a baby or if
they ever were a baby at some point or other which is you don't attach to mom because she
gives you calories you attach to mom because she makes you feel safe and warm and enveloped
and all those things that chicken wire can't get you in a million years no matter how many
of your calories it provides and what Harlow showed was an astonishing finding that seems
idiotically obvious now but this was a period where mothers would be allowed to visit their
children a half hour a week when the child was hospitalized oh don't worry we feed him
three times a day and even put a blanket on him now and then pat him on the head in the
process what is appropriate child development about it didn't include concepts like warmth
and physical contact let alone something even more scientifically obtuse like the notion
of love and Harlow absolutely revolutionized the field by showing it's got nothing to do
with simple behaviorist models it's got everything to do with different things releasing these
behaviors why it is you wind up loving an individual who's your mom now all of this
wound up being real important in making sense of some other findings and these are some recent
neuro ethylogical ones really disturbing ones on first pass okay back to the amygdala we've
heard about the amygdala oh so many lectures ago the amygdala fear anxiety as we will
see shortly aggression and this is imaging people's brains one of those metabolic imagers
what part of the brain gets metabolically active and showing people pictures often very fast
demonstration of them subliminal faster than you can consciously see finding a certain
type of picture which in the first studies we're reporting would make the amygdala suddenly
get metabolically active and these were really unexpected or maybe expected but really disturbing
findings what this first state of study showed was the amygdala would be activated when you
would look at the face of somebody of a different race oh boy did that stop everybody in their
tracks and make them wonder what's going on are we looking at a hardwired fixed action
pattern of responsive xenophobia of people who are the them versus the us all sorts of
disquieting things and what's emerged in more recent years is a more subtle literature
showing that doesn't happen all the time and straight out of our world of fixed action
patterns it depends on who the faces celebrity faces don't evoke that but it also depends
on who you are and how it's framed and there's some remarkably subtle psychological tests
that can get at somebody's sort of innate levels innate that's the wrong word to use
but implicit levels of racism how much they distinguish traits of people based on race
and the higher they score on that sort of scale the more their amygdala activates but
in a brilliant study that was done by some psychologist at Princeton primarily someone
named Susan Fiss showing if you frame the setting if you frame the way the person looks
at the face if you make them think about the person as an individual beforehand with some
extremely subtle questions having nothing to do with race if you force them to think
about them as an individual the amygdala doesn't light up anymore so what initially looked
like a very disturbing bit of uh-oh our brains may simply not be all that thrilled about
people who look different than us what you suddenly have instead is it depends on the
context it depends on experience depends on we are not looking at any sort of neuro ethological
inevitability okay so that sets us up now for looking more at how the ethologists would
think about the brain as they called it as you heard in the last lecture in innate releasing
mechanism and that used to be this utterly mysterious piece you got the releasing stimulus
something out in the sensory world and the behavior pops out the other end and something
has to happen in between and that's that brain stuff and all the people with the lab coats
and we don't go anywhere near it and recent decades instead the study of brain function
in an ethological setting neuro ethology has become the hottest topic out there and what
those studies have shown in some cases some remarkably detailed obsessively tenacious
research has shown exactly what the circuitry is how this happens for example there is bird
species where every year during the mating season they learn a new song and their scientists
who by now can show you a circuitry map like you can get down at the uh you know the hardware
store showing how to wire up your whatever it is you wire up at home and I show I know
nothing about hardware either but you can get one of these circuitry maps and by now
the people who study these bird systems here they can show you exactly which pathways in
the brain do what under the control of which hormones which do what to the excitability
of which action acts and hillocks and all that stuff out of those earlier lectures it's
completely understood in the same way many lectures back we heard about the lordosis
reflex in female rodents where if and only if estrogen levels are high enough you get
this reflex of arching the back when pressed on the flank and that one has been charted
out with a whole neuro ethological map as well people knowing exactly the wiring of
that very interesting recent one has been sorted out with humans and with rodents as
well and this is back to the amygdala and I'm focusing a lot on the amygdala here because
this is a prelude to the coming lectures looking at aggression and looking at the roles of
fear and anxiety and aggression and you better bet we're coming back to the amygdala big
time okay so you got the amygdala and we have this paradigm already stick a person in a
brain scanner and you see the sort of circumstances that make the amygdala become excitable and
you look at someone who's been through a trauma someone with post traumatic stress disorder
and what we've seen already is for the same stimulus for the same frightening stimulus
even for the same frightening subliminal stimulus you're not even consciously aware of what
you've seen has been flashed up for a sixteenth of a second your cortex doesn't know what
it's seen your amygdala knows and individuals PTSD what you get is an amygdala that lights
up more readily and once it's up it stays active longer you have a hyper response of
the amygdala and suddenly out the other end you've got a heart racing things like that
what people now understand and that will come to review in subsequent lectures is what exactly
is it about stress how do stress hormones on a cellular level soon on a genetic level
how do they make the amygdala become more excitable for the rest of time and we're close
to constructing a circuitry map for that what sensory information okay you had some trauma
with a person with a certain accent a certain whatever and umpteen years later you're not
even consciously aware there's a voice with a similar accent back there and you don't
even know why it is your heart is racing your amygdala knows and more and more we understand
the circuitry by which it taps into a certain sensory memory and you've got this hyper
excitable amygdala and off it runs so this is a very vibrant area of research explaining
how you get from information in the outside world to behavior or the physiology that underlines
behavior what the brain is doing in between okay now this sets us up for looking at in
lots of ways the most subtle realm of ethology when these guys would start to think about
learning how things would change with repeated experience and learning obviously was something
the behaviorists focused on all you need to do to explain behaviors figure out what has
been learned that brings about positive reinforcement versus negative the world of reward punishment
all that sort of thing however ethologists thought about it in a very different way and
the single best way of showing that the behaviorist viewpoint of how things work how learning occurs
can't apply in all cases to animals in their natural setting and the simple fact is discussed
in the last lecture whether you were studying experimental animals being subjected to stress
pets being abused or those of us in bad relationships who persist in the world of abused women who
leave the shelter and go back to him even though everyone is saying this is going to happen
again and is going to be worse why do we love individuals who treat us poorly why in the
world of being negatively reinforced for a certain type of attachment doesn't the attachment
go away why doesn't that happen and behaviorism is at a loss to explain it and ethologists
who wants to show the classic behaviorist rules of learning don't apply in lots of circumstances
now some of the time what he thought it just would focus on would be classical types of
learning and what they would show is when they occurred in untraditional settings they
could be very interesting one example of this okay what's one of the great instincts out
there if you ask people about instinctual behaviors and one of the ones that immediately
gets summoned is a maternal instinct and mothers just know instinctually how to take
care of their kids and this is hardwired this does not involve learning and what was shown
by ethologists is it involves learning at all sorts of species including non-human ones
for example you look at baboons female baboons what's the old view you've just given birth
to your first child and you just instinctually know what to do and this turns out not to
be the case at all baboon females have to learn to be mothers and what you wind up
seeing is the more kids you've had the greater the likelihood of the kids surviving and even
more interestingly if you had an older sister and you've got the chance to do babysitting
and to behavior for the kids if you've got experience with infants before you had your
own your first child is more likely to survive than a female who's had a first kid without
an older sister to have practiced on it's not an instinct it's something you learn and
this is a realm where people would have pulled out instinct as a instinctual reflex or something
as an explanatory mechanism oh females just know how to be maternal that's sure not the
case for baboon mothers this is a realm where trial and error learning applied to animal
behavior very unexpected now there were realms in addition where all sorts of learning would
go on that utterly violated the notion of what behaviorist rules of learning is about
and one of them is probably the most famous phenomenon to come out of ethology and this
is one that Lorenz came up with and that he's most famous for this whole notion if you are
a newborn duck if you are a baby duck how do you decide who mom is well you could do it
by behaviorist learning and trial and error and sort of thing and this large creature
that turns out to be a tree you thought was mom and when you're really getting hungry
you decide by trial and error that's not mom after all and this large predatory cat may
look like mom and that doesn't work out so well after you're predated no you don't see
trial and error learning instead what you see is what the ethologists called imprinting
and this is very different from those imprinted genes we heard about back when and another
lecture imprinting somewhere shortly after birth there's this critical period this time
window where these newborn birds have a rule anything that's big and moving around and
hovering over me I am going to imprint on I am going to consider to be mom and in the
most famous sort of scene out of all of ethology you would have Lorenz imprinting all these
little baby duckies who would follow him around as he was goose stepping across a field there
and that sort of stuff you would wind up seeing this is not by trial and error this is a completely
different type of learning one that the neuro ethologists have not really sorted out much
yet what's going on so that you have this critical period in a nervous system where
whoever is big and moving and looming over you you learn unstoppably for the rest of
time that that is mom at that point this is a completely different type of learning one
with no ready explanation if the world consists of trial and error instead you have a nervous
system that is simply wired up to do this one trial learning now another realm of learning
that the ethologists focused on is something that they term prepared learning and this is a
really interesting concept it's the notion that you can get behaviors that emerge out there and
are subject to learning to experience all of that but certain versions of the behaviors are
learned more easily than others you are prepared to learn certain types of things more readily
than others here's one example of this and this one has been studied like crazy it's back to those
birds that learn their bird song and it turns out different birds have different bird songs
different bird species do different populations of the same species have different versions of
their songs dialects has been used appropriately to describe this so how do you learn the bird
song of your own species and your own neighborhood or often your own family okay trial and error
if you don't learn the right bird song nobody mates with you who knows what something like
that but what the ethologists have shown is there's prepared learning what do I mean by this you
are sitting there and you are this bird and you are being exposed to the song from your species
in population and with the same frequency the same volume the same everything you're being exposed
to the song of some other bird even a species that's not far from yours and for the same sensory
input the same severity the same magnitude of releasing stimuli the same experience at learning
these birds are wired up to preferentially learn their own song they don't sing that song without
experience this is not an innate instinctual thing you got to learn your song nonetheless there's
some sort of wiring in there for prepared learning you are more likely to learn the one of your
own there's some sort of predisposition there and the ethologists proceeded to show there's all
sorts of realms of prepared learning another example of this monkeys one of the great sort of
myths about monkeys is that a monkey who has been sort of born of monkeys in a laboratory setting
for 4,000 generations nonetheless is instinctually terrified of snakes that's not the case but there's
prepared learning for the same aversive exposure a monkey more readily learns in a version to
snakes and some random other object for the same yoking for example to a punishment it makes the
association of bad things with snakey shaped things more readily than what other stuff there is
prepared learning for yoking the experience of the snake to bad things now here's another example
of this and this is one shown in humans and it is called the sauce bernet syndrome and almost
certainly is pronounced differently if you actually know how to speak French but we'll call it the
sauce bernet syndrome for the moment based on sauce bernet is a type of French food which oddly
enough is central to this example and this was an example outlined by a psychologist Martin Seligman
based on his own personal experience he went out for dinner one evening one evening at six o'clock he
had dinner and it happened to be French food sauce bernet's and in his carefully controlled study
he ate dinner from six o'clock till seven o'clock exactly then he stretched or did something or
other or studied science for the next hour and then at eight o'clock he started listening to an
opera and the opera being a Wagner opera went on interminably until midnight or so and then at one
in the morning he started getting queasy because he was having a stomach problem he started feeling
not well okay so you are a behaviorist and you are asking what associations do you learn you learn
the ones that are most recent you associate some outcome with what happened most recently to you
ooh I pick up this item and I get a shock what caused me to get that shock is it picking up this
item or is it something I did four and a half hours ago no this is a much more logical association
you make so you're sitting there at one in the morning feeling queasy and awful what was the
strongest sensory information you got recently well let's see I was listening to some very
marked auditory information music up to an hour ago whereas it was what six hours ago that I finished
that dinner by all logic the next time I find myself in a Wagner opera I should feel queasy but
that's not what happens what you find instead is the next time you sit down with that food you feel
queasy and there you have the prepared learning your stomach feels bad do you have the equal
likelihood of associating that bad stomach feeling with a certain sight with a certain sound with a
certain tactile stimulus or certain taste we have prepared learning to go in the direction of
associating taste with stomach outcomes so that's a bit of our wiring another interesting example
of that is found in human babies there is a point where kids under a year old are just acquiring
language and what you find is that you can teach kids to recognize certain sounds we saw already
how you can show that a child even a child who can't speak yet can tell you they recognize
something as familiar novel things make their heart speed up faster you can tell if a child has
learned a particular sound and an infant can learn sounds syllables from any language on earth as
we get older we get worse and worse at doing that for languages other than our own but a six
month old can learn the sound from any given language on earth and they can learn all sorts of
other sounds as well but what you see is we humans have prepared learning an infant is far
better at learning a sound that comes from a human language than a sound from some other source
for the same intensity of input we are wired up in some ways to be predisposed to learn the
sounds of language not any particular language but languageness we have brains that are well
set for that okay so this begins to give us a sense of how ethologists think about things and how
neuro ethologists have begun to give us tremendous insights you can't understand the brain and how
it works without understanding the special evolutionary setting the special ecological
setting the special solutions the special language of behavior that that species has come up with
you need that to understand the brain now what we've also gotten to now is completing our last
separate bucket we've looked a whole lot at the nervous system what produced that behavior that
occurred two seconds later and we have now examined separate disciplinary approaches beginning with
the evolution of these genes relevant to behavior the molecular biology that fetal life early
experience all the way up to the smell the sound the electric sonnet the electric lullaby that you
heard one second before the behavior we are now equipped with a whole bunch of these different
disciplines and what we'll now be doing in the rest of this course is applying it seeing how
you begin to integrate thinking about all these different different disciplines in thinking about
a realm of human behavior and amid the ones that could have been chosen parental behavior sexual
behavior communication whatever what we'll be focusing on is one of the most fascinating one
of the most interesting one of the ones that most calls upon us to integrate these different
approaches and their interactions and one that I believe is overwhelmingly the most important
topic in behavioral biology for us to master understanding the biology of why some of us
are so appallingly damaging to other humans what's the biology of human aggression so armed with
our tools now our various disciplines and far more importantly a sense of the limits the assumptions
the confounds of each discipline and how they intertwine with each other we will now begin to
look at the biology of violence and embedded in that some good news the biology of cooperation
