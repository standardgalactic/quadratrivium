Lecture 23 Evolution, Aggression and Cooperation
We are back and in the home stretch here, ready now to look at our most long-term influences
on the biology of aggression.
In the strategy of this whole course, we have looked at the neurobiology of the environmental
influences on working all the way back.
And where we finished in the last lecture was looking at genetic influences on aggression.
Genetic influences rather than genetic causes.
And insofar as there are any genes relevant, they are not going to be genes all about aggression.
There are going to be genes about pain and fear and stress and frustration and impulsivity
and sensory processing and all of those caveats that we've had hammered in by now.
And where we left was with our inevitable next subject.
If you're talking about genes, you've got to talk about how those genes evolved.
What about the evolution of aggression and violence?
What about natural selection?
What about the ecosystems, the ecological factors that have sculpted over the course
of evolution our genetic make-ups and those pieces that are relevant to aggression?
What does evolution and what does ecology tell us about where aggression comes from
in us?
It turns out ecology is very informative.
And one of the useful things we've done as humans is go and inhabit every single corner
of this planet virtually and thus come up with very different societies as a function
of what sort of ecosystems we find ourselves in, what sort of livings we make.
And out in the less developed world, the non-westernized world, you get broad categories.
People tend to be agriculturalists or hunter-gatherers or nomadic pastoralists.
People who wander the desert, the open grasslands with their goats, their camels, their cows.
And you tend to see very different social structures relevant to aggression.
One of the more reliable findings out there is nomadic pastoralists have more violent
societies than do agriculturalists.
And in fact, taking the form nomadic pastoralists seemingly invented the concept of having
standing armies, having warrior classes.
And the logic of that is quite straightforward.
It is very hard for somebody to come and steal your five acres of corn overnight.
It is quite easy for somebody to raid and steal all your cattle overnight.
Moreover, there are times of years when the grass not only is greener over there but fourteen
plateaus over where half the men in a village will be elsewhere grazing the animals and
you need to have some sort of system of reciprocity and stable sort of military cooperation to
protect the animals there.
Pastoralist societies have much higher rates of organized violence than do agriculturalists.
Another thing in there that winds up being fairly consistent is derived from this desert
societies versus rainforest societies.
And desert societies are basically the ones in which nomadic pastoralism was invented
and you see far higher levels of aggression in desert cultures than in rainforest ones.
Far higher levels of aggression, far higher levels of things like taking of slaves, of
trading of women as brides, far higher rates of very stratified hierarchical systems of
command within the society.
And very interestingly and not of trivial significance, it is the world of deserts that
have invented monotheistic views of the world.
People living in rainforests dealing with a thousand different edible plants seem to
have far less trouble coming up with a multitude of deities relevant to their lives.
The desert world has given rise to some of the most rigid and singular and monotheistic
views of the world and violence and aggression and organized violence in hierarchically organized
systems are more likely in those cultures.
So that tells us something about how ecology may influence the sort of societies we come
up with.
What is now framing that in the concept of evolution?
We know by now what that means.
How these factors just discussed change the distribution of genes over time and we can
go off and running with that from there.
What do changes in gene distributions mean?
We know that on a molecular level.
We know by now how that may turn into differences in brain function.
What does evolution tell us about aggression?
And initially it tells us nothing but bad news.
Back to our building blocks of evolutionary thinking from way back when, a zillion lectures
ago, we've got individual selection, a chicken is an egg's way of making another egg, we've
got kin selection, I'll lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins and those two,
the first three building blocks are real informative in explaining some of the most appalling and
common features of violence on this planet.
Here you are looking at virtually any primate species out there, including humans and culture
after culture.
One of the most common forms of violence is male-male aggression over reproductive access
to females and all you need to do is look at human literature and that runs through all
over the place and if non-human primates had soap operas and could write novels and things
of that sort, it would be one of the major themes there and jeez, what's that about?
That is inclusive fitness, 101, that is passing on as many copies of your genes, that is one
of the driving forces on aggression in this planet, once again back to that dichotomy we
had between tournament species and pair bonding species, you don't see high levels of male-male
aggression in the pair bonding monogamous species but the polygamous ones are specializing
in that and as we saw in the section on those imprinted genes, we as humans are most certainly
genetically not a monogamous species, so we've got plenty of violence built around that.
Now that basic building block of evolution also tells us a lot about that utterly puzzling
pathological form of violence, we've seen a number of times infanticide, competitive
infanticide, again it makes no sense if you're behaving for the good of the species and even
in a species on the brink of extinction, it makes sense on that level of individual selection.
So none of that's good news, shifting to the level of kin selection, none of this is
good news either, it's essentially what the notion of is you cooperate with relatives
and the more related the RTU view more cooperate, what have we just defined on evolutionary
terms, this is what xenophobia is about, this is what us versus them is about and this
is a whole world of organized violence amongst non-human primates, this is about animals
obsessed with kinship and it's not merely to figure out who to invite to the bar mitzvah
sort of thing, this is a whole world of who is the them and who is the us and we see among
those chimpanzees, talked about a few lectures back, organized violence, patrols along their
territory, killing males from elsewhere, who are these male chimps, they are close relatives,
they are brothers, males do not leave their home troop, they spend their whole life together
and one of the most dangerous things you can ever get on this planet are a whole bunch
of males who have grown up together and get along well and who were worrying about the
folks in the next valley because that sets you up for this patrilocal world of organized
cooperative violence.
Okay, so now we think about these issues as they apply to humans and there's something
different about us, how does a rodent figure out who its relative is, we heard the pheromonal
stuff, it just knows, it can tell by smell who its relatives are, this is the case in
all sorts of species, how do we humans figure out who we are related to, we have to think
about it and that's where we get problems because as soon as it is something we can
think about, it is something where our thinking can be manipulated and that leads us into a
world where rather than non-human primates thinking about kinship, what we think about
and can be manipulated about is the sociological concept of pseudo kinship, being made to feel
more related to somebody than you actually are genetically and this is a theme that runs
through all sorts of human societies over and over after revolutions, people adopt terms
of pseudo kinship, calling each other brother, sister, comrade, after the French Revolution
it was against the law to use the French pronoun that you use for people outside the family,
we have to be addressed in the informal form, we are all siblings now and one of the things
that militaries ranging from the most high tech one to the nomadic pastoral warrior tribes
do, one of the things they are brilliantly skilled at is making people in the military
feel more connected to each other than they actually are, producing pseudo kinship bands
of brothers and all the rituals about it are to build up that sense of when it is the critical
moment the person standing next to you for whom you may have to sacrifice your life feels
as good as a relative, in some societies what you see is people when they go into the military
go in as cohesive units from their high school, people who have known each other their entire
lives, in other societies various pastoral societies what you see in the militaries, the
warrior classes there are ornate rituals that hold for the rest of the lifetime of pseudo
kinship terms for each other where a woman who will marry one of these men will refer to the
men in his warrior class age group as their equivalent terms of brother in laws, all of this
built around trying to make people feel more related to each other, pseudo kinship and this is
run through every military out there and of course lurking in the background is the flip side of
pseudo kinship which is pseudo speciation, hands and hand with all these manipulative means to
make your us's feel more similar than they actually are is a brilliant legacy of manipulation to
make them seem so different they hardly count as human and this has occurred over and over
beginning with the huge percentage of cultures on this planet whose word for people is the word
for their own tribe that them hardly even counts as the same species throughout American wars
this has happened again and again even down to the level of medical journals giving articles
proving how the them are different medically from normal humans you see cases of this endlessly
you see an astonishing case of this that occurred about some years ago in the early 1990s one
that we as a country here in the United States fell for it approximately in 92% rates in the
fall of 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and in the aftermath of that producing what is now historically
known as the Gulf War and during October of that year a refugee Kuwaiti nurse who had escaped
from Kuwait City came and testified before the Congress of the United States and what she
testified about was an incident that had occurred in her hospital Iraqi troops had come in and as
part of the plundering shipping things back to Iraq they plundered a critical thing in that
hospital they took more than 300 babies out of incubators and stole the incubators and shipped
them back to Iraq and we were left with this astonishing notion these people leave premature
infants out to die they care so little about life that they will let babies die in order to
steal incubators and our collective breaths were taken away and this was covered in every
newspaper and at the time of the vote authorizing the Gulf War a vote that passed by five votes
seven of the senators cited this incident in their decision as to how to vote and it wasn't
until a few months later that it became clear that this refugee Kuwaiti nurse was not a refugee
Kuwaiti nurse she was the 15 year old daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States a
publicity PR firm in Washington had been hired with the cooperation of the US government to concoct
that story this child was trained to come before our Congress lie to us and we fell for it with a
92% approval rate for that war and the story saying that this event never occurred we're buried
in the back pages of every newspaper and there's no rodent on earth who would have fallen for that
they would have smelled a rat in a second and this capacity we have to have our best of emotions
and empathy is manipulated and to wind up saying these people hardly even count as human they
leave babies out to die had a galvanizing effect on our decisions of what counts as moral or
immoral behavior and thus what you have the second you have humans with their capacity to have their
cognitions about who is an us and who is a them to be manipulated dramatically and consistently the
us versus them has very little to do with what board games we like to play but instead always
has something to do with what we look like and what we speak light and what we eat and who we pray
to and that is a defining feature of how readily we are manipulated into thinking who is an us and
who is a them so seemingly what everything about evolutionary biology is teaching us here is bad
news the selective advantages of the well-placed killing how this drive towards kin selection could
be manipulated to produce some wildly damaging organized cases of violence but embedded in that
is the first of our bits of good news in this last lecture and the whole point here is if you could
be manipulated into thinking that they are so much the them and that they hardly count as human
pseudo speciation the same could be done in the opposite direction and what we see in our society
over and over is whenever we reach a detente whenever we reach some sort of peace with some
culture that we previously had tensions with we are flooded with articles about how basically they
just want to be like us they're really just like the folks next door and look at them and all they
want to do is have the same fast food and the same blue jeans and they're really just like us
after all and this is a theme that has run through all sorts of examples like this among
traditional Bedouin societies for example if there is a point where two different clans that have
been at war work out a treaty a peace treaty with each other there is a ritual where the elders
from each clan are brought out sit down and spend a whole afternoon kibitzing with each other and
what they always wind up doing is discovering a relative that they have in common aha we're not
really enemies we're related after all this utterly artificial mechanism by which you decide this
isn't a bunch of them's after all they're another version of us's and the same rituals that give
rise to being able to view somebody else as so different they hardly even count can be used in
the opposite direction and this is a theme that runs through a whole lot of cultures ways of making
peace seem more palatable because the thems are actually more like you than oh we appreciate it all
along and we saw a limbic example of that a few lectures ago that extremely disquieting finding
that the amygdala which lights up with fear with aggression all of that the finding I've come back
to a few times now simply because of its importance finding that the amygdala will activate when you
look at the face of someone from a different race of you oh my god a hard-wired version of us and
them and what we then saw subsequently were far more interesting studies showing that that won't
be the case if you were set up to view that other face as an individual rather than as part of a
category there's nothing inevitable about that that is your amygdala showing you right then and
there and a gazillion dollar scanner that pseudo kinship can work in that direction so what else
winds up being good news another piece of good news is run through the primatology literature in
recent years and this is a whole different version of individual selection passing on as many copies
of my genes as possible and what's that about within the realm of males males punching it out with
each other for reproductive access to females and what has become clear is that's not the only thing
that male primates do and the trendy term that is now used is male alternative strategies and the
increasingly recognized sort of ubiquity of this is really striking and it's built around the
incredibly radical notion that some males would rather hang out and be friends with females and
do all this jerky male-male competition stuff isn't that nice the Alan Alders of the baboon
worlds and isn't that wonderful and we know nonetheless nice guys finished last and what the
studies are also now showing paternity studies of the genetics of reproduction is these nice
guys are not finishing last in terms of passing on copies of their genes females have far more
control over who they mate with and a lot of these big hierarchical primate societies and then the
1960s textbooks would have you think and what is the shocking just staggering finding that has come
out of that literature who do females like to mate with guys who were nice to them guys who were
nice to them guys who when they're in a bad mood go beat up somebody else instead of you that is a
prince you bring home to mom that sort of thing this radical discovery that females in fact are
deciding to a large extent who they mate with and it's males who have the affiliate of relationships
with females there are evolutionary alternatives to males just punching out even in the classical
tournament species there are other ways of doing things so that's very good news now the next piece
of good news is our third piece of sort of the introduction to modern evolutionary biology
number one passing on copies of your own genes individual selection number two can selection
number three this concept that is run through a number of our lectures by now reciprocal
altruism and by definition this has to be good news this is the world of the evolution of non
relatives cooperating with each other what we saw many lectures ago was sort of the building block
of this world of studying the game theory of reciprocal altruism the prisoners dilemma we
remember those circumstances we remember the very surprising and pleasing bit of news when do you
release dopamine in those pleasure pathways and people playing the prisoners dilemma game when
you have screwed your opponent and gotten away with the most points no you see activation there
under circumstances where both sides are cooperating what was not mentioned back when of
potentially great relevance to that study this was a study only carried out on women and one would
be very interested to see if you see the same thing in males as to what counts as the most
dopaminergically pleasing outcome of the prisoners dilemma game but what we saw there was under the
right circumstances this is exactly what you want to be doing you scratch my back I'll scratch yours
reciprocity and we also saw the whole world by which it makes sense to cheat when you can
and to be vigilant against cheaters and we saw this huge theoretical problem of who jump starts
the system how do you get rosso reciprocity to start in a world where nobody's cooperating and
what we saw were some of the key variables that give rise that make cooperation more likely dealing
with an inbred population dealing with circumstances where you have multiple rounds of interactions
with an individual so treat them badly and they're going to have umpteen chances to get back at you
the shadow of the future dealing in circumstances where you have what was termed open book play
you sit down to play against somebody and they know what you've done in previous games reputation
we see also the ability to punish cheaters and even to punish people who failed to punish cheaters
secondary punishment selects for cooperation very dramatically and finally the ability to choose
who you're playing against all of these are circumstances that greatly increase the likelihood
of some sort of cooperation emerging and amid this being a whole world of wonderful theoretical
biology and as we saw biologists of all the unlikely things hanging out with mathematicians
and economists and computer programmers to make sense of any of this stuff what also emerged in
that literature is a sense of well do you ever actually see this going on and we heard a couple
of examples from the world of non-human animals where it looked as if there were some systems of
stable reciprocity maybe even ones that fit the optimal game theory strategy that we saw there
the tit for tat you cooperate until if the person defects against you you defect the next time back
you do whatever the person did in the previous round aha this was the strategy that out competed
all the others we saw there were some elaborations on it but mainly at the end of that stretch we saw
there are some animal examples of that out there the stickleback fish believing it is
attacking an invader bashing its lips against the mirror there and now believing it has a partner
doing the same the mirror alongside of it and then the mirror angled so that it believes it's
being defected against by its partner and it reciprocates by defection the next time vampire
bats that appear to do the same thing stable coalitions of non-human primate males if one guy
stabs you in the back at a point where you thought he was a reliable coalition or partner
that decreases the odds of you cooperating next time around yes there's all sorts of
examples of this floating around in the animal world and a very very active area of research
so what about humans what about humans and what about humans being able to evolve systems of
reciprocal altruism in the most unlikely of circumstances and the last bit of good news
we will hear is some very dramatic examples of this the initial one is not too exciting because
it has a structure to it that simply does not make for generalizability to other settings
nonetheless it is worth hearing about because it's just so dramatic and this was during the first
winter of world war one as christmas approached and the vast majority of the combatants there
having some strong emotional attachment to christmas and some ritualistic belief that
this is not a good time to be slaughtering perfect strangers from across the trenches
it was decided in the upper echelons that there would be a christmas truce it's really not good
news and good luck to be having wild battles going on in christmas day so there was going
to be a truce this was a top-down decision the individuals in charge decided there would be
a christmas truce and it was meant to be just for the afternoon how that was decided how you
let the folks on the other side know we're not going to try to invade your trenches when we're
all singing around the christmas tree there please don't do it in return nonetheless they
managed to have this sorted out and it was known beforehand there is going to be a truce at christmas
and what was extraordinary is what was originally supposed to be okay we're not going to shell you
you don't shell us we're going to lay low for that afternoon before it was over with as documented
in photographs front page newspaper articles troops from opposite sides of the battle were
out there above the trenches sharing christmas dinners having soccer matches where it was not
even the french against the germans but intermixed by teams exchanging christmas gifts with each other
sharing food having concerts this soldier in the trenches who was an operatic singer beforehand
leading the singing and what is extraordinary is they almost stopped the war with that one
because they refused to go back to fighting until the officers had to come and threaten them to get
them to go back to their war and the people you were having dinner with and singing songs about
the blessed peaceful earth you were trying to kill the next day that's tremendously moving
but nonetheless the thing about that that is not easily generalized was it was a top down approach
the people in charge decided to institute it they nearly lost control over it at the end and had to
force the war to continue but it was a top down approach the next example is the one that is most
moving of all because it's a bottom up example and this also took place in the trenches of world
war one and this is one that was documented by robert axelrod we remember his name from many
lectures ago the economist who first did the prisoner's dilemma games with other social
scientists and emerged from that the tit for tat strategy in a book of his called the evolution
of cooperation documenting this one case that happened in the trenches during world war one
and the thing about this one is nobody planned it no one negotiated it no one let people know
this is what's going to happen this afternoon in two days there was a bottom up spontaneity
to it there was a bottom up emergent property the men in the trenches almost stopped the war
they worked out a system of reciprocal altruism with people who didn't speak the same language as
you people whose faces you may never have even seen there was a system of reciprocity that emerged
over and over in the trenches how do you do this here's what would be done you get your best gunner
up there who lobs some shell 20 yards behind the enemy's line and blows up some tree there
what do you do next you have the guy do it again and again and again what are you telling the other
side this guy is so good we could have put 20 shells down in your trenches just now but we chose
not to what are you going to do about it and then they get their best gunner and lob 20 shells behind
your lines and you've just shown reciprocally that you are willing to use restraint and this happened
again and again along the lines axelrod documents letters from soldiers they're writing back home
dear mom and dad i'm okay we've worked out something here they even worked out a way to deal with
the vulnerability of tit for tat which was if there was a signal error which is you get some new
gung ho gunner who doesn't understand how things work and takes out the trench on the other side
they get one shot back at you and document it again in letters dear mom and dad things are fine
right now we had a problem the other day we had this new gunner who didn't really understand how
things work here we hear they lost a bunch of guys on their side but everything is fine now
and over and over this emerged without negotiations without treaties without anything other than
people very intent on saving their lives and over and over the trench truces were broken up by
officers transferring troops up and down the lines laterally trying to break this up and
over and over it happened again and what is encouraging here is there were no negotiations
going on after months of arguing about the shape of the table there were no diplomats sitting there
eating their nice meals while discussing under what circumstances fighting would cease it was simply
people in a bottom-up way pulling this off using spontaneously the same principles that make sense
here and they almost stopped the war and essentially what we have is a punch line there is if it
could happen under those inauspicious circumstances circumstances why by all logic the other is just
nearby and your amygdala is screaming its head off and you are so frightened and your sympathetic
nervous system is going so wild you can barely stand it there are still mechanisms by which
it could almost have been stopped and if it could have succeeded to that extent there it could work
anywhere else we have no excuse for saying it's an unstoppable circumstance so this brings us to
the end of the lectures on aggression and if the last umpteen lectures had instead been focused on
integrating all these pieces and understanding schizophrenia or understanding parental behavior
or some such thing it would have been interesting as well this is an enormously important subject
though for the same reason that started off at the beginning of this this major challenge there is
no debate over the fact that schizophrenia is a disaster there is no debate over the fact that
childhood cancer is the worst thing imaginable Alzheimer's disease these are unquestionable
biological ills and unquestionable biological disasters but aggression is different and again
it's the same set of behaviors and some of those same neurons sending those same commands to those
muscles and in some cases it is the most exciting thing in the world and we can barely stop ourselves
from jumping in and in some cases it is our worst nightmares it is a rape it is poison gas coming
out of a shower head it's a mushroom cloud it is the things we fear most and have the most reasons
to and the challenge of the biology of this is how similar those states can be and it's for that
reason the biology of understanding violence is always going to be the most challenging subject
in this whole field and it's for that reason it will always be the most important one for us to try to understand
