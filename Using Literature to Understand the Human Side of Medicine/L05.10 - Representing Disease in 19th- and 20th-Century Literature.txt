Lecture 5 Representing Disease in 19th and 20th Century Literature
In this lecture I'd like to bring to a close my discussion of the representation of disease,
but to focus rather on more modern materials, on predominantly 19th and 20th century materials.
I want to first remind us of where we are and particularly pick up the notion of plague
again as I discussed it in connection with both phylloctaties and the book of Job.
And in particular the notion that disease is seen as God's curse and that it may trigger
the scapegoat mechanism to find the miasma of the source of the disease,
expulse that figure and then symbolically cleanse the community.
And as I suggested not only can we read those early texts but the edipus itself can be read
that way, people have read it that way, that the edipus you remember starts with thebes
being visited by plague and we are told by the oracle that the reason there is plague
is that there is a concealed crime.
Edipus we are told by the plot is the source of the crime, but if you were an anthropologist
reading that story you would say well that's just the cover story.
The reality is that thebes is sick and who's going to take the rap, who's going to take
the hit as the putative cause and so some of the anthropologists say well it's the story
of three guys, edipus, teresius and creon fighting it out in some sense to see who's
going to be the guilty party and of course Sophocles plot squarely puts it on edipus
but if you sort of deconstruct the plot you can see that those are the stakes of the play
is finding out who will in some sense bear the responsibility for the disease so that
the community can sleep better at night and feel that the disease has now been taken care
of and as we know the detective story model lots of different stories work the same way
to the detective story program that we see that ends up catching the thief or the murderer
in particular allows people to turn off the TV and go to sleep because they feel like
these people have finally been caught.
Well this notion of looking for a symbolic sort of cause that would cleanse us has very
ugly manifestations throughout history as well that throughout history people like Jews
and Gypsies have traditionally been blamed for disease or problems in the community and
there have been pogroms and there have been sacrificial events that we all know about.
In the 19th century plague still haunts the imagination London has experienced plague
in the 1660s a very famous episode of it in fact Defoe wrote a very fascinating book about
London plague called The Plague Years about the plague of the 60s very matter of fact
sort of really almost documentary look at it but in our day there's a very famous novel
by Camus called The Plague which many people read as an allegory about the German invasion
of France as the foreign invader who is responsible for the disease and then there's Bergman's
famous film The Seventh Seal which goes back to the Middle Ages to talk about the black
death but it's Bergman's way of talking about the end of the world which he in fact foresees
as a possible nuclear event because his film was made in the 50s when people were worried
about atomic warfare and the only way that Bergman knows how to somehow represent the
stakes of this argument about the end of the world that could come through nuclear weapons
is to go back far enough in history to the Middle Ages where in fact a third of Europe
died with the black plague. I'd like as I said to look at some 19th century materials
there and the first story that I want to bring to your attention is one of Poe's more glossy
short stories called The Mask of Red Death which is Poe's version really of Boccaccio's
Decameron which was written in the shadow of the plague the Italian text but Poe in
the 19th century writes a wildly romantic picturesque extravagant version of these events
that the plague is called the Red Death and it is striking the kingdom people are dying
like flies and so Prince Prospero takes a thousand revelers with him into his sumptuous
castle and he shuts and locks the gates to keep the plague out and they have nothing
but revelries and parties with great opulence and fanfare. However at their grand party
a stranger appears in their midst to is described this way by Poe the mask which pardon me the
figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave
the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a
stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the
cheat and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revelers around
but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death his vesture was
dabbled in blood and his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled
with the scarlet horror he is death who enters the great party the revelries he gets inside
he cannot be kept out of the closed fortress and the story ends with a very powerful paragraph
about the dominion of death and of disease and of epidemic and now was acknowledged the
presence of Red Death he had come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revelers
in the blood bedou'd halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of
his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the
flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the Red Death held illimitable
dominion over all end of story now what I spoke about Hippocrates as being a very modern
figure even in 5th century BC I alluded in particular to his remarks about epilepsy as
a sacred disease and his comment that no disease is sacred we only call it sacred because
we do not understand it just exactly the view that some talk puts forth that we only metaphorized
diseases when we don't understand their scientific etiology well what causes plague during the
black death the medieval doctors had no understanding of the transmission of disease they didn't
know which is certainly allied to the religious explanation it makes as much sense to say
that God is striking you as anything else when it's a mystery why people are getting
these terrible boils and dropping dead in fact the university doctors had a conference
during the time of the black death and they declared that the black plague was caused
by a conjunction of planets that was the best explanation they could give this was quite
serious they did not know that the rats and the fleas on the rats carried the plague
but there are biological and there are social causes for plague and for disease material
causes that we know about poverty dirt disease these cause infection these are very much
related to way to the ways in which a culture takes care of its people the ways in which
social programs do or do not exist and it also has to do with the distribution of resources
and of power in a poem that I'm going to speak more about later I'll just cite you
the last four lines of it it's Blake's very famous poem London the last stanza goes like
this but most through midnight streets I hear how the youthful harlots curse blast the newborn
infant's tear and blights with plagues the marriage hearse and it's the speaker coming
to the very end of his walk through London he confronts the prostitutes that are on the
streets one in every six women some accounts say was a prostitute in the 1790s in London
that's how absolutely rampant this was and young girls girls you know barely at puberty
but notice how Blake insists on connection with what we think is separate that the youthful
harlots curse leads directly to the diseased children blast the newborn infant's tear
and blights with plagues the marriage hearse now plague in Blake's time means venereal disease
it means syphilis and so the prostitutes convey the venereal disease the men get it give it
to their wives and then children who were diseased are born and this is it properly an apocalyptic
theme because if children are born disease there can be no future there is no regeneration
marriage hearse also means however that marriage is an affair of prostitution by which Blake
is trying to say that the women are sold into sex much the way the prostitutes are that
when the father sells the daughter into the hands of a rich suitor in some sense that
too is a version of prostitution Blake is a very fierce critic of all forms of patriarchy
and tyranny or at least many forms of it.
I want to turn to Dickens as arguably the greatest exemplar of plague in human social
and ideological terms and the text that I want to allude to is his monstrous text one
of my favorites it's Bleak House it's about 800 pages long it's the kind of thing that
if you really have a whole summer with nothing to do that's what you want to do is read Bleak
House it's I think his richest novel this story is a London story and it's bathed in
fog and London fog for Dickens is not the romantic stuff of raincoats or the atmospheric
detective films that were used to in the film Noir it is really made up of filth and pollution
I want to cite you the first page of Bleak House Implacable November weather as much
mud in the streets as if the waters had been newly retired from the face of the earth smoke
lowering down from chimney pots making a soft black drizzle with flakes of soot in it as
big as full grown snowflakes gone into mourning one might imagine for the death of the sun
dogs unmist distinguishable in mire horses scarcely better splashed to their very blankers
foot passengers jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper fog everywhere
fog up the river where it flows among green aides and meadows fog down the river he puts
fog all around London he puts fog inside the people fog in the eyes and throats of ancient
Greenwich pensioners wheezing by the firesides of their wards fog in the stem and bowl of
the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper down in his close cabin fog cruelly pinching
the toes and fingers of a shivering little apprentice boy on deck fog is filth filth in
the air dirt that is in the air that is breathed into the lungs it is the source of disease
and Dickens novel is about disease at the center of London and at the center of Dickens
moral scheme is a slum Dickens calls it Tom all alone Dickens as you doubtless know is
a passionate social reformer particularly interested in issues of hygiene public hygiene and he
makes the slum the heart of the labyrinth I call it the heart of the labyrinth using
the mythic term of what thesis in the labyrinth because it is the central spot to which all
of the major characters in the novel must return everybody must at some point or another
enter the slum and encounter his or her destiny in this novel this is a very ecological novel
it's a novel about an environment I mean after all environmentalism says that there are no
privileged single autonomous figures we are all part of a structural setting we're all
part of a collective scheme we are all related and interdependent upon one another this is
an extremely powerful view however how do you persuade the powerful themselves that
this view is real because the powerful believe that as long as we're living in our castles
and we have enough money to board up you know to have guards that prevent the sick and the
diseased and the paupers from getting in we are safe I want you to think back of the mask of red
death can you keep disease at bay post text is about the failure of that that you can lock the
gates close the windows but you cannot prevent it from getting in and that's the way that Dickens
in fact describes Tom all alone this is a speech about Tom's and it's a subject that is in fact
much talked about in Parliament much mighty speech making there has been both in and out of
Parliament concerning Tom and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right whether
he shall be put into the main road by constables or by Beatles or by bell ringing or by force of
figures or by correct principles of taste or by high church or by low church or by no church
whether he shall be set to splitting trusses of polemical straws with the crooked knife of
his mind or whether he shall be put to stone breaking instead in the midst of which dust and
noise there is but one thing perfectly clear to wit that Tom only may and can or shall and will be
reclaimed according to somebody's theory and nobody's practice and in the hopeful meantime
Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his old determined spirit so everybody's talking a blue
streak how to fix up this slum we've got to do something about this nothing happens not true
Dickens says something is happening but he has his revenge even the winds are his messengers
and they serve him in these hours of darkness there is not a drop of Tom's corrupted blood
but propagates infection and contagion somewhere it shall pollute this very night the choice stream
of a Norman house and his grace shall not be able to say nay to the infamous alliance
there is not an atom of Tom's slime not a cubic inch of any pestilential gas in which he lives
not one obscenity or degradation about him not an ignorance not a wickedness not a brutality of
his committing but shall work its retribution through every order of society up to the proudest
of the proud and to the highest of the high verily what with tainting plundering and spoiling
Tom has his revenge and that is essentially the story that Dickens wants to tell
plague obliterates private autonomy epidemics teach us horrible lessons about linkage
and connection that's what Dickens plot is out to actualize at the center of the slum
is the poor urchin homeless boy Joe who only has one refrain throughout the novel which is
I don't know nothing I don't know nothing he is the denial of any knowledge
he is the most deprived figure in the novel and he is incessantly told by the constable
to move on you've got to be moving on this book is about homelessness he is the embodiment of
Tom all alone when he becomes sick the novel's protagonist Esther ministers to him and contracts
smallpox from him and in getting smallpox she becomes temporarily blind and partially disfigured
her pox on the face her lesions are Dickens somatic language writ large of the texts
occulted diseases by which I mean all of the secrets of the text what is written on Esther's face
is a version of the sexual transgression of her own mother who was an aristocratic lady
who has had her out of wedlock who has denied her who has never acknowledged this is her child
the pox that is on Esther's face is literally the sins of the mothers visited to the children
Dickens in this novel it's a fierce novel it's a severe novel indicts the countless failed families
of his text Esther's compassion for Joe for the homeless child is Dickensian knowledge it is a
suffered realization that all of us are related that we are flesh to flesh and bone to bone
I'm going to read you now another passage not by Dickens but by Carlisle of the same period
and it has to do with whether we are related or not a poor Irish widow her husband having died
in one of the lanes of Edinburgh went forth with her three children bare of all resource to solicit
help from the charitable establishments of that city at this charitable establishment and then at
that she was refused referred from one to the other helped by none till she had exhausted them all
till her strength and heart failed her she sank down in typhus fever died and infected her lane
with fever so that 17 other persons died of fever there in consequence
the humane physician asked there upon as with a heart too full for speaking
would it not have been economy to help this poor widow she took typhus fever and kill 17 of you
very curious the forlorn Irish widow applies to her fellow creatures as if be saying behold
I'm sinking bear of help you must help me I am your sister bone of your bone one god made us
you must help me but they say no impossible thou art no sister of ours but she proves her sisterhood
her typhus fever kills them they actually were her brothers though denying it
so this is the language of contagion the language of disease it points to relationships
that we didn't know we were having connections that we never saw people that are in fact
kin to us bonded to us in ways that nothing allows us to see
the next disease text in the 19th century that I want to look at
that is one of the most scandalous texts in Scandinavia and arguably in Europe and its
ipsons play ghosts which is published in 1881 and in some ways it literalizes Blake's apocalyptic
lines but most through midnight streets I hear how the youthful harlots curse
blast the newborn infant's tears and blights with plague the marriage hearse it's the story
of mrs. Alving and her son Oswald and Oswald is the promising child of a very prominent family
and he is beginning a career in Paris as an artist the play is about his return to Norway
to his widowed mother because he's ill we gradually learn he doesn't understand how this happened
that he is ill of inherited syphilis and he can't figure this out was transmitted to him at birth
he can't figure it out because his father is thought to be the lion of the community
the mother has kept secret the fact that the father was a total rake a complete reprobate
but the public image of the father and the image that the son has is that he was a man of good deeds
a spotless man so Oswald does does not know why but he does know the doctors and parents have told
him that his head is becoming putty the term that they use is vermouth worm eaten his body is worm
eaten he is enroute to becoming a vegetable we further gather that mrs. Alving was indeed in
the Blakean sense a harlot wife that like all good girls she was sold to captain Alving
and that their union is now recognized as a marriage hearse it has killed their child
or is killing this child ipson's depiction of inherited disease is a profound meditation
on the weight and legacy of the past we call it to play in English ghost the Norwegian word is
yen gongar and it means return ease people who come back again and it's a wonderful language
for a genetic script that actualizes the past the sins of the fathers visited upon the next
generation the encrustedness of genes and social forms that live on ipson's lesson in this play
is that the past isn't past that it doesn't die as we think it does his story is a story about the
terrible weight of the past the way in which everything has already been scripted
and so in this text we actually see the replay of the past it turns out that when Oswald is home
he begins paying attention to Regina whom he thinks is a servant girl we later to learn
that Regina is the illegitimate child of captain Alving foisted on an earlier servant girl
which means that she and Oswald are siblings they're half brother and sister this is the
makings of an incest when he's teasing with this girl the mother sees all of it and she sees then
a repeat of her own life that her son is going to do with Regina the same kind of sexual excess
that she saw in the life of her husband when she tells this to parson manders when i heard
Regina and Oswald in there it was as if i saw ghosts i almost think we are all ghosts all of us
pastor manders it isn't just what we have inherited from our father and mother that walks in us it is
all kinds of dead ideas and all sorts of old and obsolete beliefs they are not alive in us but they
remain in us nonetheless and we can never rid ourselves of them i only have to read a newspaper
and i see ghosts between the lines there must be ghosts all over the country they lie as thick as
grains of sand and we are all so horribly afraid of the light it's one of my favorite passages in
all of ipson it's a poetic passage it's a passage of being cursed to see the ghosts she sees her
son and Regina and she sees then the transgressions of her husband and then she makes the larger
statement that this is our condition i only have to pick up a newspaper and i see in today's
headlines the encrusted past the way in which we cannot free ourselves from superstition
from corruption and she says that it's like grains of sand we're meant to see this as palpable
as literally a medium in which we see the world ipson is saying that the past in its hold on us
is alive and will not die it has the life of radioactive materials can go on forever it reminds
me of our difficulties in getting rid of sludge and garbage waste his play is about waste it's
about the continued violence and life of things that we think are over and so oswald comes to learn
that he is the victim of things that about which he knew nothing that his parents have done
his disorder can seem terribly modern and contemporary to us in the way that ipson describes
it he is becoming a child again he says i'm not so afraid of dying though i want to live as long
as i can yes yes oswald you must the mother says but the thought of it is excruciating to revert
back to a helpless child again to have to be fed to have to be oh it's unspeakable
my child has his mother to nurse him she says never that's just what i won't have i can't
abide the thought of lying here like that for years turning old and gray and in the meantime
you might die before me i'm a really chilling line i could be vegetating here still living and you
could die because the doctor said it needn't be fatal at once he called it a kind of softening
of the brain some phrase like that i think that expression sounds so nice it makes me think of
cherry red velvet draperies something soft to stroke oswald alving is a portrait of someone
being reduced to childhood unlike our contemporary concern with alzheimer's that erases the the
intelligence and the widths of the elderly ipson places this scourge in the body and mind of a
young man who is being at his prime brought back to zero turned in reverse but it has all of the
same moral pathos that we have with alzheimer's about the indignity of people being robbed precisely
of their maturity and their achievements this play ends with a very contemporary problem as well
oswald tells his mother that he has some morphine pills that if he has another attack particularly
if he turns into a vegetable she must give him the pill and he has the attack at the end and the
play ends on it as a cliffhanger she's standing there with the pills and doesn't know whether
to give them to her son or not this is euthanasia this is jack cavorkian these are the medical
issues the legal issues the moral issues that confront us today what to do about preserving life
when there's no dignity left in it when the body seems to have shut down but will not die
so ipson's play is very much a kind of meditation about disease and the large
range of questions that it raises now i've got a couple of lectures slated later in this program
on the happy topic of death but i can't wait so i'm going to actually get into it a little bit
now and i'd like to compare two really quite wonderful texts one of them brief and the other
in tolerably long the first one is a book that you may have read it came out just a couple of
years ago it's written by a physician sheldon newland and it's called how we die it's a very
wise book it's not a piece of literature newland is a physician who has seen much in his medical
and human experience and it's a philosophical book about death and the chapter i want to
allude to is the chapter about bube his old grandmother and her death newland moves effortlessly
in this chapter between the evocation of bube's life her formidable presence for him as a child
and as a student because much of his family had died she helped bring him up he regards her he
calls her the yirisha mater a magistra on the one hand a woman who was an absolute vital fact in
his life and on the other hand consorting with this language of his moral and emotional feelings
for her a relentless depiction of her diminishing forces narrated in the clearest medical language
possible of failing organs and cells of biochemical entropy on a system-wide basis a natural
inevitable final chapter of life and newland is a gifted narrator on both of these fronts
she comes across bube in all of her ethnic and personal density painted in loving but very
unsentimental terms the grandson remembers at the same time he gives us a blow-by-blow account
as a physician of the physiological wreckage that is taking place the somatic performance
that has its own weird beauty and grandeur and we see that any life is both of these things
that's the doctor's account of the death of his grandmother and i want to contrast it
with an account that has really remarkable parallels in proust long novel remembrance of
things past the character in proust novel is an extremely precarious sensitive neurotic young
man and the figure of the grandmother is the figure of generosity and love who is like no one
else in that text it's a mean-spirited text most people in proust great novel turn out to really
be fairly selfish creatures that's proust view of the human subject but for whatever reason the
grandmother who often fuses with the mother is accepted from this view she is a creature of total
generosity he has perhaps the illusory sense that her life is devoted to him and we see in his own
precariousness a solution through the love and support of the grandmother and so there are scenes
where we have the child encountering situations of great stress for example when he goes he has to
leave his family and goes to the resort town of balbec and he is one of these oversensitive children
that as soon as he's in a room where he doesn't recognize all the surroundings it's a huge attack
on his nerves he cannot sleep everything comes in on him and he feels that it's a kind of all
a part potential obliteration life-threatening that the bookcases the mirror everything in this
room does not make any space for him the odors of the room take the offensive he's gasping he
feels like he's going to be extinguished and this is the way proust writes it having no world
no room no body now that was not menaced by the enemies thronging around me penetrated to the
very bones by fever i was alone and long to die you really see someone getting ready to be extinguished
at least in his mind and it's against that precariousness and helplessness that sense of being
totally invaded by a hostile world out there that the grandmother offers her kind of love
then my grandmother came in and listened to the spatial language here and to the expansion
of my constricted heart there opened at once an infinity of space she embraces him and in that
there's almost a blood transfusion she gives him himself back it's through her law for him
that he can be sustained and some very lovely description of this embrace he finally says
that when i felt my mouth glued to her cheeks to her brow i drew from them something so beneficial
so nourishing that i remained as motionless as solemn as calmly gluttonous as a babe at the
breast it's a perfect simile that it is a form of nurturance which is close to suckling the embrace
with the grandmother it's what makes him whole it seems to speak almost to a prior moment in which
we were not sundered atomized individuals but we were connected in his intense and sustaining
way as a child at the breast of its mother would be that the very path of life is still available
to us in that model now as i said that is totally at odds with every kind of relationship in this
long novel in this experience at this resort this lonely child is frightened devises a special
language with his grandmother they knock on the wall that separates their two hotel rooms
and after all he's not a kid he must be in his teens then so he knocks on the wall
and she hears it and she always interprets it and she knows to come and comfort him and give
him solace when she hears it and it's a very beautiful image it's like the frail membrane
that separates people it's the skin that makes me me and you you and how do we ever
somehow devise a code that translates this to one another this is like the alternative to
the tower of babel this is a language that connects people instead of divides them and so that
happens in this story the child is in fact restored by the connection with the grandmother
but because proust is so honest and so brutal a writer and because life is brutal the child soon
once he is back to his strength a bend who wants to take care of one's grandmother one doesn't spend
time with one's grandparents the child finds all kinds of other interests he attends to young
people on the beach and particularly falls in love with this whole band of very dazzling young
girls and the text and the child leave the grandmother later after vacation he returns to
paris and then the grandmother is struck ill she's struck ill by us she literally has a stroke
this is a woman of great refinement she has made it a practice of referring to the great classics
the writers who've helped her to come to terms with life and at this moment as she tries to
give a literary analogy to the way she feels all he hears is this guttural choked sound
it's a way of saying that the body now has moved front and center all of her wisdom and
refinement are of no avail as this ailment strikes her and then things go downhill the text deprives
her systematically of her various senses of seeing of hearing she heroically attempts to
remain a human being the mark of the beast she's trying to fight and we see these terrible scenes
where she's blind but she won't admit it so she sits in the room and keeps her head focused on the
door so they'll think that she can see them or she's deaf and she's going like this trying
to catch their noises there's a real sadism in the way the text operates like it wants to punish
this woman she is given every possible degrading treatment leeches doctors who are charlatans
one it's like mullier wrote it about one crazy doctor after another finally the child comes in
and he sees her on her deathbed and she's she's described by the text as someone
whom he doesn't recognize it's not a figure that he knows it's not the grandmother that he's ever
known it's a very interesting passage bent on a half circle on the bed a creature other than
my grandmother some kind of a beast that had put on her hair and crouched in her bed clothes
was panting groaning it's like a little red riding it's like the wolf that's in the bed it's not
the mark of the beast it's the usurpation of the beast shaking the cover by its convulsions
this figure was what she sees it was only a be if it was only a beast stirring there
then where was my grandmother he feels like someone has kidnapped her this dying
dead almost dead creature in the bed can't be the woman that he loved well here is where
Proust departs from newland because in this text it's not yet over it continues to go
the child continues to have life experiences he has sex with one of these girls and then later
bored he too revisits Balbec the town on the coast disenchanted and all of a sudden he wakes up
and he realizes that his head is against the very same wall that divided him from his grandmother
when he used to tap on it and create their language between them and in one of the most
beautiful chapters in literature she revisits proust calls it les intermitences du coeur
the intermissions of the heart the grandmother returns that this isn't science fiction she is
dead her body is in a casket she returns to his memory he re experiences her life and it's totally
different from this blow by blow account of her dying instead he has series of nightmares in which
he's trying to find her in which she's locked up in some room in which people are trying to give
him directions labyrinthine directions to get to her things where she tells him after her death
that she thought maybe he was going to be an artist and she says that grandparents never forget
their grandchildren he tortures himself with this all of a sudden she's fully present again and in
this return we get something of the logic of art that the dead die their somatic lives but they
continue to inhabit us long dead they live in the people who love them and who remember them
this is not appropriate for the doctor to write about but it's entirely appropriate for the artist
to write about and so the book is about her continued living in him she effectively undergoes a
second death a kinder death because it's one that is a farewell between the child and the grandmother
through these dreams he is doing what Freud would have called tower our bite the work of morning
he is finally able to cut the cord with her but she achieves a kind of human death through this
remembrance it's a very very lovely sequence and it says something about what the prerogatives of
art are versus what Newland does in his text the last text that i'd like to refer you to in this
discussion is a very very strange book and i've been saying that about a lot of books but i think
it's particularly the case with this one it's a book that i can be perfectly confident you've never
heard of in french it's called le cum des jours which is almost untranslatable it means the froth
of the days and it is translated in one of its translation as mood indigo the title of one of
Duke Ellington's pieces it's written by a writer who is something of a cult figure in France his
name is Boris Vian he was a jazz musician he introduced Louis Armstrong when he went to
France a book is published in the 60s it's a 60s kind of book and it's a book that the young are
wild about as they are about other novels of Boris Vian and i want to bring it to your attention
because it gives us one final still radically different representation of disease and i think
it's the most radical and the most poetic of all the texts that i have looked at this is a surrealist
text and therefore it offends in the same way that Kafka offends as i said it's the kind of text
that you could look at and say who needs this why shouldn't anybody waste their time reading a book
that isn't enigmatic and strange as this book doesn't behave by rules that i'm used to in this
book weird things happen if you slam a door it slams back sausages for example refuse to be eaten
they refuse to be cooked eels come out of faucets broken windows that are broken grow back again
leather is alive in this book it's a book of a kind of demonic world it's a world of extraordinary
gadgets and it's a world of power where the things out there are infused with the kind of energy
that is astounding it's also a brutal world it's a world where men are literally shackled to machines
when they work and it's a world where the police weapon of preference is called an arashkeur
which means heart ripper and it's a special gun that you aim at your target human target pull
the trigger and the target's heart materializes and they look at it in their hand they see
what a strange sight it has to be their heart for a moment and they die that's the weapon
that the police use in this particular text it's a text that said of brutality the welfare
literature in this text shows butchers strangling children we have ice rink scenes where there's
a huge hole and large numbers of bodies are just thrown into it it's an enormous amount of violence
it's a text that you have to read as an anthropologist like what are the norms here
the people in the text go by the norms they don't ask the questions that any reader asked
what's happening here this text is vion's version of a very famous american novel called love story
it's a story and love story is a version of romeo and juliet it's the oldest story in our culture
it's about a fated misaliance it's about a marriage that ends up being a death
and so it's the story of colin and cloe and cloe becomes ill they make a visit to the pharmacy
this is what the pharmacy looks like in this text the pills emerge through a pipe of blue
glass and were collected by wax hands which put them into cones of granulated corrugated paper
colin stood up to take a closer look at the machine lifted the rusty casing which protected it
and inside a composite animal half flesh and half metal was wearing itself out swallowing the raw
material and expelling it in the form of symmetrical pellets come and look chick said colin what at
it's very strange chick looked the creature had an elongated jaw which moved with a rapid
sideways motion beneath the transparent skin could be seen tubular ribs of thin steel and a
digestive tube which heaved lazily it's a modified rabbit said chick you think so
they do it all the time you keep whichever function you want in this case he's kept the
movements of the elementary canal without the chemical part of the digestion it's much easier
than making pills with an ordinary pestle what does it eat chromed carrots is the answer
when cloe takes these pills she says it's as if two animals were fighting in my chest
when i take one and we get a sense again of the potent medicine that we ingest the will of molecules
that fight our own molecules that's what's depicted here cloe takes these pills because
she's ill what is she ill of she has a flower growing in her chest she has a lily growing in
her chest and the threat of the book is that if this lily reaches full height which is one meter
briefly if it reaches that and flowers it will kill her that's the language that bois
mignon uses for this disease that she's got well it is going to happen the flower will
bloom cloe will die and i mentioned this text to you the only therapy that is available for them
is for colin who has no money to beg borrow and steal to be able to buy other flowers because
if she is surrounded by flowers maybe the lily will remain quiescent and not bloom
this could be thought of as a kind of lyrical episode the language of flowers but what vio
makes us see is that there is nothing childish or sentimental about these flowers no rosy
description here at all this botanical excursion is one of the grizzliest notations in literature
there is nothing soft or benign about flowers their fierce thirst for life is merciless and
unstoppable this disease will flower she will die and vio has found a language that stuns us
that shows us that no man's land that alternative world the alterity of our own bodies which we've
never seen on the inside and creates a totally new code for it thank you
