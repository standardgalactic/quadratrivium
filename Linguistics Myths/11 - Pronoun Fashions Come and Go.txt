There is now considered to be a generation of people who grew up watching Saturday morning
cartoons in the late sixties and through the nineteen seventies. That's supposed to be
a badge of honor. Such people are now, well many of them call themselves in middle age,
I refuse to, but I am in that group and that group includes people who remember learning
their parts of speech from the schoolhouse rock shorts and we can all sing the songs.
Well, there was one of them for pronouns. I don't remember it and so I cannot open this
up by singing a little song about what pronouns are, but I can definitely say that a lot of
the sense that English needs to be fixed is based on perceived problems with pronouns.
Pronouns are considered to be captious little things and it's hard to keep them in their
cages and we're taught a certain schema and we want it to stay the way it is. It's a beautiful
schema. So there's I, you, and then in the third person singular he, she, and it. So those are
the subject forms and then we have our object forms which are sometimes different, sometimes not.
So with I the object form is me. With you it stays the same, you's kind of boring. Then you have
he and she and the object forms are him and her and then it stays the same. Then over in the
plural first person we, second person you again and third person they. And then you have object
forms for we it's us and for they it's them. So we have this nice grid and the idea is supposed
to be that that is the way it is and that's the way it's supposed to stay and to the extent that
pronouns aren't used that way then we're taught that we're supposed to crack the whip. There is an
order that must be maintained. In other words we are supposed to be highly attendant to pronoun
trouble. Pronoun trouble reminds me of something else about Saturday morning which is the Looney
Toon Rabbit Seasoning 1952 and you'll all remember the exchange where Elmer Fudd keeps on shooting
Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny and Bugs Bunny says it's true doc I'm a rabbit all right would you like to
shoot me now wait till you get home and Daffy Duck is upset shoot him now shoot him now and Bugs says
you gotta keep out of this he doesn't have to shoot you now and Daffy Duck says he does so
have to shoot me now I demand that you shoot me now bam and then Daffy is all blown up and he
says let's run through that again Bugs Bunny says okay would you like to shoot me now wait till
you get home shoot him now shoot him now you keep out of this he doesn't have to shoot you now ha
that's it hold it right there and he has this pose pronoun trouble it's not he doesn't have to shoot
you now it's he doesn't have to shoot me now well I say he does have to shoot me now so shoot me now
bam so pronoun trouble but the fact of the matter is that in English as well as other languages
pronouns don't stay in their cages pronouns are fluid if you look at languages around the world if
you happen to describe a language that was hitherto unknown or even if you just look around in a
library on a Saturday afternoon you'll find that pronouns are fluid with their meanings they slip
from one box to another in terms of what their functions are and it doesn't interfere with clarity
and so we want to see language for what it is and so seeing language plain means seeing that these
pronouns heavily used are like all things in language that are heavily used subject to sound
changes and more importantly for this lecture they're subject to meaning changes language morphs
like a lava lamp and oh the pronouns always do that they never behave and so for example we saw
they and they is third-person plural at least in that default sense but then there are other things
that we find ourselves naturally saying such as tell each student to hand in their paper now I
think all of us know that there's an extent to which that feels natural we probably if we don't
say it there's a part of us that wants to say it or we certainly hear a great many people saying
it and yet we're taught that what one is supposed to say is tell each student to hand in his paper
or tell each student to hand in her paper or tell each student to hand in his or her paper the idea
being that tell each student to hand in their paper is wrong because they is supposed to refer to
plural entities but the fact of the matter is and you get a clue from this from how common it is for
people to use they in non-plural ways that another way of thinking of it is that they can be used
for singular entities when this entity is conceived of within a context in which a group is salient
and so for example if we were going to defend that proposition and obviously that's different from
what we're taught and so that's a proposition that has to be defended one defense might be that we
see this singular they not as a scourge that has happened over the past 20 years or even over the
past hundred years it doesn't come from television this is something you find way back in Middle
English so for example the Sir Amidace manuscript way back in the 15th century has a sentence like
each man in their degree and of course with the spelling it looks like it's a man in their degree
but that makes the people sound like they were crazy so just each man in their degree and that was
considered ordinary then now obviously we think well Middle English is almost a different language
but then what about Shakespeare which we do consider our language to be you can take something from
say the comedy of errors and this is Act 4 scene 3 there's not a man I meet but does salute me as
if I were there well acquainted friend and so here's one of these singular days so it's something
that goes way back and yet I've noticed that if you point this sort of thing out that a usage
that's now often considered barbaric goes way back then it doesn't seem to convince many people many
people feel that maybe people way back needed to shape up do and the development of the language
will mean making sure that the pronouns stay in their cages and that's completely understandable
but actually pronouns are a much wilder and more wonderful world than that both in English and in
other languages and that might help shed some light on how we feel about good old singular they
and so for example let's think about singular you what's that you say you was used in the singular
and the plural it is in modern English and that feels so utterly natural to us and so for example
we have our you you and then if you learn French in school then you learn that in the singular they
have do and then in the plural they have who little later if you came along then you probably learn
Spanish and you have to learn about who and vosotros and you think okay that's the way those
languages work they are kind of more finicky about dividing the second person up into singular
and plural than we are in good old normal English where you just have you and you but actually
that is a relatively new situation in English and in fact it used to be that your singular you
was thou in other words English is a European language it's what you would expect that there
would be a singular form and a plural form that were different and so thou gullest and there was
an ending for it that's what s is and then you and you didn't have to say you all because you
meant plural you go so you actually had a little little chart you're gonna talk about grammar so
in the subject you had thou and then in the genitive it was thy thy paper and then the object
was the so the you also use that with prepositions the Titanic is going down and the string quartet
reportedly we're not quite sure accounts differ but reportedly they were playing closer my Lord
to the that archaic language because it used to be that you're referring to one person with the
and then as far as you went actually it was a little more complex than we think the possessive
of course was your but then the subject was ye and the object was you so here ye here ye is not
just quaint what that was was all of you ie second person plural ye shall hear and then you was for
example I feed you so it was nice and Baroque and then time went by and things changed for reasons
that no one's exactly sure of actually history is fascinating sometimes in its obscurity but
after a while you started moving over from the plural and started being used in the singular and
it got to the point that in standard English at least thou no longer existed it's still quite
common in many for example rural dialects in Great Britain many of them dying out gradually but in
standard English not there now imagine this and if you think about it this is easy to imagine take
yourself back in time when this was a change that wasn't complete yet and so your sense is that
there's thou goest and you go and you're hearing a lot of people say you go talking to one little
boy and that sounds wrong it sounds like a mistake and there were many people who did think of it
as a mistake and so for example there was a guy 1660's name was George Fox and he actually got
rather I won't use an impolite word I'll just say he got Uranus about it he said is he not a
novice and unmanorly and an idiot and a fool I say idiot because he's still at IDEOT I doubt if
he pronounced it that way is he not a novice and unmanorly and an idiot and a fool that speaks you
to one which is not to be spoken to a singular but to many oh vulgar professors and teachers that
speak plural when they should singular now George Fox was making perfect sense because it must have
sounded quite wrong to him and in fact the situation that we have now in English is definitely a
little odd we're so used to it but imagine we have I and we and that's the first person then we
have he she and it and they and that's the third person then in the middle with the second person
just you you and that's all there is that's very peculiar as languages go that you don't have a
distinction between something that is so obvious as the one between one person who you're talking
to and three or four people who you're talking to the difference between you and y'all so to speak
is so clear that non-standard dialects try to make up for it and so you have y'all and use and
yuns all of that is because there's a part of us that feels that something is not quite right with
this wonderful language and you can see how odd it is if you look at some other ones for example
Papua New Guinea the island of New Guinea is about the size of your living room and there are about
800 languages spoken in New Guinea so it's it's a different language every two feet and that's
only a slight exaggeration one of the languages is called barrack barrack is interesting for various
reasons one of them is the gallbladder the way to say I'm doing fine is to say well my gallbladder
is warm that's just normal to them but another interesting thing about them is their pronouns
and so for example you have I and we and their word for I and I have never noticed this until
right now I swear their word for I is I I never thought about that their pronoun for I is I AI
is the way you would see it spelled on the page I then their pronoun for we is name so we think
okay normal right but then just like us you and y'all are the same word and then on top of that
he she it and they are the same word so for them the whole idea of pronouns having distinct
plural forms it's highly optional only when you're talking about you or you and somebody else other
than that you is on it and he she it and they are all just yeah that's the way barrack works now I
think if we look at a barrack we're thinking that that's a little odd but the truth of the matter
is that English is odd in that same way except just half is odd but still quite odd in not making a
difference between you and you in the plural and then imagine how Robert Loth would have felt
about the fact that people were using you as a subject rather than ye because of course that's
not the way it had been before so Robert Loth in all of his honesty and in all of his healthy and
brilliant anality said some writers have used ye as the objective case plural of the pronoun of
the second person very improperly and ungrammatically which true if you're talking about the way
English had been long before he was around but because of the printed page we think of earlier
stages as the ones but actually language keeps changing all of which is to say that what we now
think of as a perfectly ordinary usage of you is based on a catastrophic series of mistakes you
should not be being used in the singular and you should not be even being used as a subject all of
that is just a mistake there were people along the way who saw it as a mistake and time has passed
the situation with singular they is actually exactly the same thing and so the question is do
we feel that the pronoun shouldn't change more than they already have or do we think of pronouns as
just a kind of kaleidoscope I remember being given kaleidoscopes when I was a child never
understood the fun you would hold it up and you turn it and it would be kind of different and
kind of different kind of different but always quite ugly really the truth is that pronouns are
kind of like that too and just like kaleidoscopes like poverty and taxes and death will always be
with us so will the motile pronouns that can confuse us so much in the present tense so to
speak and if we understand that then we're going to dip our toe big toe but just we're going to
dip our toe for now into the most notorious of the pronoun problems and that is Billy and me went
to the store sorry I said it so Billy and me went to the store we did you're not supposed to say
that because there's this issue of subject pronoun and object pronoun and so if I say Billy and me
went to the store then I am a jack of ass because I am using me as a subject when me is an object
form so I've got my grammar wrong now Loth was very strict about this Robert Loth and so he told us
to say instead of it's me at the door in real life so who is it and you're supposed to say it is I
because me is an object form and there's nothing object-y about saying it's me and so you're
supposed to use the nominative like in Latin and say it is I and one might might not but one might
and in the same way you're supposed to look out the door and you're not supposed to say something
as vulgar as you're supposed to say it is he because that's the proper form because he is
a nominative and that's the way it's supposed to be but notice that it's hard to apply Lowe's rules
and so let's say that you get used to it is I you're not gonna say it if you think about it even
in a formal situation you would best be advised to just step around saying anything rather than it
is I but notice that it is they sounds like not an English sentence at all and so if there's more
than one person out there you know who is it out there oh it's them are you really supposed to
say oh it's they that actually sounds like somebody from Slovakia who is just learning English and
kind of looked at a table in a book or imagine being out there with more than one person even if
you've gotten used to saying you know it is I can you imagine saying it is we no it's just not
it's not English and yet nominative subject whatever you want to call it those sentences don't work
at all and so if those sentences don't work then right there we know something and this is quite
counterintuitive based on what we're often taught and the way we kind of wish it were because we
like to keep our food separate on our place or at least I do I don't even get the catch up in the
scrambled eggs so you want to keep things separate but the idea that English subject pronouns must
always be I he she we and they actually doesn't work not even in proper usage and if we understand
that then we can dip the toe in a little bit more let's go back to what Billy and me did me and
Billy went to the store notice that's not so bad so me and Billy went to the store many people who
will snack you with a pot holder if you say Billy and me went to the store say that me and Billy
went to the store is somehow okay but there you're using this object form as a subject but then
here's the kicker sentence this is one to really think about here's a sentence of English I and
Billy went to the store that notice that that's a complete train wreck but why when I is the subject
seems like we're dotting all of our eyes so to speak and crossing our T's I and Billy went to the
store so once again it couldn't be as simple as there are subject pronouns and object pronouns
because if you say I and Billy went to the store it seems that you either had a tm all seizure or
you're from Slovakia or you are a fearsome Lee pretentious child there's just something going on
because I and Billy went to the store is not a sentence of English and so that means that in the
logical sense we can't condemn this in the logical sense a sentence as wrong such as Billy and me
went to the store now we've gotten to that point and in my experience when trying to get across
that aspect of being a linguist there's a certain response that comes I remember once I was telling
someone about these sorts of things and she kept saying all I know is I was taught that the subject
saying all I know is that I was taught and you know we were all taught this but the fact of the
matter is that this is a case where what we were taught and the actual logical reality are not
perfectly in sync a lot of what we were taught was based on Robert Loth and his idea that English
pronouns should work like Latins which made perfect sense at the time but it's not how English
itself works and so there are many many things we were taught that were quite valuable this one
however there's an issue now what we were taught was valuable in that the world is not going to
change instantly such that it'll be okay to say Billy and me went to the store in public settings
except here where I'm talking about it as an example I'm talking about it but in terms of
expressing yourself that way we cannot help the fact that we have been taught certain things and
certainly one thing that's not going to change is that Billy and me went to the store is not seen as
formal that's important and a teacher has to point that out so in terms of all I know as I was taught
that is a very valuable part of it but to the extent that one was taught that that's a logical
error that is something that actually is more questionable than we ever had any reason to think
about when the teacher was teaching us these sorts of things and so we can get a better
perspective on this as always when we look at other languages just looking at it within English
it's hard to see beyond our own house so to speak we hear this language with subjective ears we all
do just like me but about other languages I said that when you look at languages around the world
then the pronouns are just these little kittens rolling all over the place what do I mean by
that well give you an example you've ever taken for example Italian then you'll remember that
lay is used both to mean she and also as the polite form of you if you are a Germanophile then
what does he mean and don't think about the capital versus the lower case just what does
he mean if you're talking well it can mean she and it can mean they and it can mean you formally
and so she does she speak German do you know gentlemen speak German or do they speak German
and so it does all of that obviously see has not stayed within its cage and yet everything is okay
in German Russian has a really wild thing I mean it's just it's it's it's it's a vodka-esque this
this Russian business it's about well the sense that I always think about is with wives and so if
you want to say and his wife then what you say is his and then wife you know so you know and his
wife so that's one part and his wife you know now if you want to say him and his wife then what you
put before it of course is a word that is a pronoun so before you know you put the pronoun
I mean so him and his wife I mean you know but that means him and his wife but I mean they
that sentence doesn't mean them and his wife it means him and his wife but there's a sense that
if he and his wife are together then that kind of means two people and there's a kind of a sense
of anticipation and so you say they and his wife I need you know same thing with me and my wife
and Russian to say me and my wife you have to say we and my wife and that doesn't mean my wife me
and Ivan it's just me and my wife walking together in the park and you say we and my wife move which
is we me you know that's standard Russian that's just the way Russian is doesn't make strict sense
you can kind of imagine why they say that it feels kind of like an idiom but that's what you get
taught in the books it's a darned mess but nobody writes into columns in Proctor or wherever you
would write in about how they don't like hearing it these days because that's just the way it goes
to say I and my wife or him and his wife literally is the other way of saying it and
considered a little bit off because pronouns are always just a mess and if you look at English
pronouns we think of our kidy little system the funny thing about English is that English is a
little crude as pronouns go there aren't really enough of them if you look at languages around the
world for example quio is a language of Melanesia quio is spoken by about negative seven people
tiny little language and it has got enough pronouns to sink a boat and so for example
you have a pronoun for you as in thou you have a pronoun for you as in to use then you have a
pronoun that's separate which means you bunch of people and then you have a pronoun that's separate
that means you good lord there a lot of you all of those are separate words or quio is a language
where you've got two kinds of we there's the we as in me and you standing there then there's the
we as in me and then somebody else so we as in why don't you and me fight and then there's we as in
we would love to have you for dinner me and my wife or we and my wife and the wife is off somewhere
else and you're talking to tom and talking about how we would like to have you for dinner
well in quio you have both of those kinds of we's but then for only you and one other person
then for you and maybe three or four people and then for you and a whole canoe full of people
completely different words so quio has got all of those pronouns and it's spoken on an island
about the size of a pt cruiser and it makes english's pronouns look kind of like barracks
pronouns look to us so pronouns can do many many many things in a language they move all around
the way they work in english is just one of many ways that a language can handle its pronouns
for some reason this tends to happen mostly in indonesia and in new guinea but there are languages
where actually there are only three pronouns one for first person that means i and we one
for second person that's like our clumsy little you and then one for third person that means he
she it they and everything else so for them pronouns is just ding ding ding like a stop sign
red yellow and green that happens so you go from there to quio then you've got english in between
and in all languages the pronouns are rolling around like the kittens that i was having fun with
on the day that elvis pressley died i remember i always associate elvis pressley with kittens
rolling around because of that now that i think of it they were puppies but the whole point of
this lecture is that in the grand scheme of things in terms of how pronouns work in a language the
idea that pronouns can be corralled into subject and object slots seems perfectly logical if you've
taken latin which nowadays many of us haven't but that was what the original idea was based on
it seems perfectly logical if it's proposed to you that that's the way it should go but the
fact of the matter is that the rules that that's based on are impossible to actually apply you
can't say i and billy went to the store you can't knock on someone's door and say it is we no matter
how formal you're trying to be and the reason that you can't apply them and then i'll add to that
the reason that there's no such thing as a child who grows up spontaneously knowing these things
is because these ideas aren't natural to the thoroughly awesome system that english nevertheless is
in all of the other ways that we have seen and we'll continue to see we're going to see in this
course what english grammar is actually like what kind of grammar linguists have actually tabulated
many of the things are fascinatingly counterintuitive they make you honored to speak our language
just like i'm sure that people who speak that cat language from the lecture before
are proud to speak their language when they notice that it's so hard for other people to pick up
but the billy and me went to the store kind of rule actually makes a lot less sense than we
might think and so once again we have to realize that there are certain forms that have to be
observed if you are making a formal speech in public or depending on where you are a relatively
informal speech or if you're saying something after a bar mitzvah or if you're giving a teaching
company course or any number of things those things are inevitable but we could think of them
as more like hemlines a matter of fashion than a matter of logic because the logic doesn't hold
when we both pull the camera in and pull it out and so now we're going to pull the camera out
until the next lecture when we're going to examine further what the nature of the rules of language
are and our relationship to following them
