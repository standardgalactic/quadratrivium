Lecture 16, Rousseau, The Confessions, Part 1
In this lecture, we'll begin to think about one of the greatest autobiographies ever written.
I myself think the most important and original.
It's The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a very rich and complex work.
And I'm going to argue in the next lecture that it develops ideas that have had an incredibly
profound influence, not just on subsequent autobiographies, many of which followed this
new path that Rousseau created, but really on our thinking more generally about how to
understand our lives.
In this lecture, we'll approach The Confessions by way of some of the most memorable incidents.
In order to see how Rousseau makes the search for meaning in those incidents, the very center
of his analysis of the self.
And these will serve as foundation for the more theoretical speculations in the lecture
that follows.
First, we need some context for the place of The Confessions in Rousseau's career.
He published his two discourses in 1751 and 1755.
In the years that followed, he was reading deeply and writing drafts of what turned out
to be three interrelated masterpieces, all of which were published in a very brief span
between 1761 and 1762.
One of these was Julie, or the new Eloise, which became the best-selling novel of the
entire 18th century.
Another was a book I mentioned in the last lecture, A Meal, a groundbreaking treatise
on education that's still studied and argued with today.
The third was the social contract, one of the most important works of political theory
ever written.
Up until then, Rousseau had been closely allied with the Paris Coterie of Philosophe, working
together to promote intellectual and social change in the movement that was becoming known
as the Enlightenment.
But just because his thinking was so amazingly original, he could never fit in with any group
or team, and before long, he found himself under attack from both sides.
Progressive thinkers felt he had sold out by denying that progress and civilization
was good for the human race.
Meanwhile, political and religious conservatives thought he was too critical of established
doctrines and practices.
And he made it hard on himself by openly printing his name on the title page of each of these
works.
A little custom, Voltaire always followed it, was to evade official censorship by publishing
anonymously with a foreign printer and letting the books be smuggled into France while the
authorities would look the other way.
Rousseau wanted to stand by his ideas openly, and he paid a big price.
Within a very few months of their publication, both A Meal and the social contract were officially
condemned by the government and the Catholic Church in France and by the Calvinist leadership
in Geneva where Rousseau had grown up.
In fact, both books were publicly burned.
And despite the protection of some very powerful friends, he was obliged to flee France, literally
leaving overnight to escape imprisonment, and for quite a few years lived a very insecure
life as a man without a country.
Now when his writings stirred up such a storm of protest, Rousseau tried to think through
the reasons why he saw things so differently from most people, and he came to understand
that his originality had everything to do with his unusual life.
He was born into an artisan's family, his father was a watchmaker in Geneva in 1712.
He was taught to read and write at home.
In fact, he never went to school a single day in his life, whereas the other Philisthus
had standard training.
In his early teens, he was apprenticed as an engraver, but he hated it and he hated
his master, and he ran away at 16.
He went all the way to Turin on the other side of the Alps in northern Italy, and he
spent the next 20 years of his life working at odd jobs when he had a job at all while
giving himself a highly independent self-education.
When his books came under attack in the 1760s, he began to see that his own personal integrity
was at issue, and so around 1765, he was in his 50s by then, he began to work on his autobiography,
which wasn't published until 1782 after his death, and he deliberately called it The Confessions
after the title used by St. Augustine, but whereas Augustine presented himself as a typical
sinner saved by divine grace, what Rousseau stressed was his uniqueness as an individual.
Right at the outset, he says, there will never be another person like him, because after
she made him, nature broke the mold.
In the 20th century, the humorist S.J. Perlman said, before they made me, they broke the
mold, but a humorist sees incongruities in multiple perspectives, the way Diderot always
did.
He was more like a prophet, he's not interested in humor, he wants to testify to the truth.
He wants each of us to see how we are unique in the way that he is, and in seeking to understand
how he became the person that he was, he placed an emphasis on early experience that was utterly
new.
It's hard to believe this, but I've looked a lot, and I think it's accurate to say,
the Confessions is the first sustained effort anyone ever made to recover and narrate the
full story of their first 20 years of life.
Previous writers of memoirs assume that each of us has a definite character, which anyway
is only in focus in adult life, and they would look for typical experiences to illustrate
it.
Rousseau is trying to understand the much more fluid kind of identity that we now call personality.
As I said before, the very concept didn't exist then.
He was fully aware of the elements of role-playing in his own life, but unlike the feel of self,
he regarded that as the problem, not the solution.
And his view was, tensions and contradictions in our inner experience come from roles that
don't fit.
So he wanted to get beneath them to find an inner core of authentic self, and this means
that instead of looking for typical characteristic moments in his life, he's interested in exactly
the opposite.
It's precisely the strangest, least understandable moments that he highlights because they yield
the deepest insights, and especially ones that have haunted his memory because he can
tell there's something troubling and mysterious about them.
And so the line from Rousseau's Confessions leads directly to the psychoanalytic theories
of the 20th century.
And I'll mention Freud several times in this lecture, not because he's necessarily right
in some absolute sense, I'm not taking a position on that, but because his kind of thinking
is especially useful for opening up the implications of what Rousseau is trying to figure out.
As I said, to get to the heart of Rousseau's achievement, I want to look at several episodes.
And I'll start with some that center on his relationships with other people, especially
women.
It looks clear and more confusing when he tries to talk about friendships with men.
This is something previous writers wouldn't have said much about, if anything, either
because they were being reticent the way Gibbon was, or because they thought it just didn't
matter.
Rousseau is totally different.
He sees his emotional and especially his erotic relationships as absolutely central to who
he is.
Here's the first example I want to quote.
This is something that happened when he was 11 years old.
His mother tragically died at his birth, something that happened all too often in those days,
and he felt deeply guilty for it.
Now his father, the watchmaker, got into a fight in the street with an aristocrat and
to avoid going to jail, skipped town for good.
So the young Jean Jacques suddenly has no parent left.
He and a cousin were sent to board with a country clergyman outside Geneva in a small
village.
His name was Lambertier, and he lived there with his unmarried sister, and one day the
boys had committed some minor offense for which Mlle Lambertier gave them a spanking,
and Rousseau says in the confessions, she had the affection of a mother for us, he badly
needed a mother, and to his surprise he enjoyed it, and he says, I found in the pain, in the
shame even, a mixture of sensuality that left me desiring more than fearing to experience
it again from the same hand.
All this yearning to be spanked again was gratified in due course, but the result was
discouraging.
The second time was also the last, for Mlle Lambertier doubtless perceived by some sign
that the punishment wasn't serving its purpose, and declared she would give it up, it was
too tiring.
Until then we'd slept in her room, in winter, sometimes even in her bed.
Two days later they made us sleep in another room, and from then on I had the honor which
I could well have done without, of being treated by her as a big boy.
What can we learn from this story?
Contemporary readers, when the confessions were published, found it ridiculous or embarrassing,
and wondered why on earth Rousseau told it, and in fact in some ways we can understand
today some aspects of it better than he could.
One modern critic invokes the French proverb, qui im bien chatibien, that is, he who loves
well, punishes well, and suggests that Rousseau, who was certainly too little loved by his
own family, must have painfully experienced it the other way around, and thought if she's
spanking me she must love me.
But one thing he certainly did understand, for the rest of his life he would seek a certain
kind of affectionate but stern reproof from women.
He's finding a pattern in his life, of a kind that earlier writers would never have looked
for or perhaps understood.
It's an episode in his teens, he's in Turin, and a pretty shopkeeper, his name is Madame
Bazile, catches him looking at her in a mirror when he thinks she doesn't know he's there,
and points imperiously, but without saying anything to the floor, I guess commanding
him to assume the position, and Rousseau says this in the confessions, to be at the knees
of an imperious mistress, to obey her commands, to have to beseech her pardon, have been for
me the sweetest of delights.
It would be banal to say he wanted to be literally spanked, if that was all he just figured out
easily enough how to purchase it, libertines at the time got it when they wanted it.
What he had learned from Monserlem Bercier was the thrill of being reproved without the
physical contact, it was an erotic charge more intense because it was taboo and withheld.
And in this strange story that he tells with Madame Bazile, the mirror is like a magical
go-between, it's the illusion of contact and yet not real contact, and what he remembers
above all is that stasis, that permanent freeze frame, he can endlessly replay this moment
of deferred desire without the humiliation that would have probably followed if he'd
actually tried to put it into action.
Finally there's another episode in Turin, he's still in his teens, it became notorious
when the confessions were published, he went out in the streets and exposed his posterior
to some astonished women and then got chased down an alleyway which unluckily turned out
to be a dead end by a big scary man with a sword, but this again was not conventional
exhibitionism, it wasn't giving him pleasure in itself, he was trying to provoke the women
to intuit the shameful wish that he could never bring himself to state explicitly as
he says in the confessions ever to an actual person who was close to him.
And when he does at last confess it in the confessions, it's to the anonymous reading
public that we're part of, it's like a winter a while back somebody said it was so cold
the exhibitionists in Central Park are only describing themselves and that's really in
a way what Rousseau is doing.
Now you can see I'm already invoking modern theorizing that wasn't available to him and
Jean Starabansky whom I've quoted before has a wonderful phrase, he says it took Freud
to think Rousseau's feelings, but it's also true that the line of inquiry that Rousseau
is very deliberately opening up is the one that leads to Freud, Jean Cocteau once put
it in a mischievous question he said, is Jean-Jacques posterior the rising son of Freud?
In a real sense Rousseau invented this way of thinking about the self, he's not describing
a stable character, he's looking for perplexing patterns that might provide a key to personality
and he says who would have believed after he describes that early spanking, who would
have believed this ordinary form of childhood punishment should have decided my tastes,
my desires, my passions, myself in French, moi literally me for the rest of my life.
Well however seldom the act itself may have been repeated what he's saying is the fantasy
of repeating it would be replayed over and over again.
So for Rousseau understanding the self is to search for strange even atypical moments
and highly personal and individual ones that may betray patterns the conscious mind doesn't
even suspect.
Boswell was certainly puzzled by his inconsistencies but he didn't know what to make of them.
Rousseau puts them at the very center of his attempt to understand himself.
He says one time I sometimes seem so little like myself that you could take me for another
man of completely opposite character and you could put it another way and say the traditional
concept of character which made perfect sense to Hume or Johnson is just not adequate to
explain what Rousseau is talking about which is really personality.
Here's another episode that illustrates this meaningful contradictoriness.
After he worked in Turin for a while as a servant he returned to Anisee in the Savoie
not far from Geneva the Savoie is part of France today but in those days it was part
of an independent small kingdom that actually was governed from Turin and in Anisee he seeks
out a woman he had very briefly met earlier whose name was Madame de Varon who was very
well known for giving assistance to young converts to Catholicism and Rousseau had indeed
converted really to get financial assistance when he ran away from Geneva.
Now the teenage Rousseau was absolutely smitten with Madame de Varon.
He had been told to look up this nice lady who was expecting some old pious person and
encountered a very pretty blonde in her 20s who was by then separated from her husband
she took him into her household she called him petit little one he called her maman
the mother he never had and eventually she initiated him sexually but although he adored
her he was very uncomfortable about that and wanted it to stop.
Now here's the remarkable incident which comes some years later.
He thought he had some serious problem with his heart and he was going on a very long
coach journey halfway across France to see a famous medical specialist who might help
him and on the trip he fell into company with another older woman he'd never met her name
was Madame de Larnage and he had a brief but unexpectedly satisfying liaison with her
on the road he even says in the confessions it's the only time in his whole life he ever
experienced full sexual enjoyment.
He says she gave me that confidence the lack of which almost always prevents me from being
myself what by the way his medical symptoms vanished completely well this is the bizarre
thing and the reason the episode is so fascinating this triumph of his real self is accomplished
by means of a preposterous deception on complete impulse he had identified himself to his fellow
travelers as an Englishman named Dudding and as he couldn't speak a word in English
he was terrified that somebody would find out so what's going on it's while he's impersonating
Dudding that he's able to experience immediate authentic pleasure and be his true self well
this is a case where he really is at a loss and he tells us as much as he can remember
about it and basically says you figure it out well using modern concepts I think you
can give an explanation he tells us elsewhere he was romantically attracted to ladies but
only achieved gratification with women he perceived as inferior and when we looked at
Boswell's London Journal we noted the relevance of an essay by Freud called the most prevalent
form of degradation in erotic life might not want to go all the way with Freud and accept
his explanation this inhibition with ladies is because of the incest to boo that is the
lady seems to re-embodied the man's mother but it's certainly true we so felt very uneasy
about sleeping with the woman he called my mom even though his own mother had died when
he was born he must be the one person who can't violate the incest to boo well with Madame
de Veyron it's surrogate incest this encouraging traveler Madame de Larnage on the other hand
can be seen as a woman of dubious virtue not a lady who should not be approached and because
Rousseau is acting like a helpless feeble invalid at the time he can make let her make all the
moves it's you know Venus with the wounded Adonis so here's an interpretation I think makes sense
a modern interpretation but drawing on what Rousseau gives us in his guise as dudding he's
liberated to be fully himself by putting aside his usual repressed and conflicted self he can't
formulate it like that the tools for that kind of analysis didn't exist but he's giving us enough
information in depth to make that interpretation possible and he's inventing the tools we're still
using now if we think about all these examples together we're struck by exactly what Rousseau's
theory of human behavior that we looked at in the last lecture took as its fundamental premise
everything we do or think is mirrored from other people you might imagine that sexual desire and
falling in love are the most true real human feelings but Rousseau sees his own experience has
shown him those feelings are totally mediated influenced by other people you're conditioned to
be attracted to certain kinds of people and to relate to them in certain ways something that
happened to him long after confirms this account and in the confessions he tells exactly how when
he was working on those great books I mentioned at the beginning he's back in France near Paris a
wealthy patron named Madame Dépiné provided him with a rural retreat near Paris called the
Hermitage and he lived peacefully there he would take long walks and do his writing and he assumed
he was in middle age and his time for love was passed though he bitterly regretted he says never
having tasted that intoxicating pleasure that he felt his soul was capable of and then these
pastoral groves he summoned up images in his head of all the women who had ever attracted him in
his life not emitting Madame de Basile and Madame de Larnage and he says my blood quickened and
caught fire my head turned despite it's already graying here and voila the grave citizen of Geneva
voila the austere Jean Jacques at almost 45 suddenly became again the extravagant shepherd soon
he was peopling his imagination with beings even more delicious and those real women he never got
next thing he knew he was unexpectedly writing his novel Julie in which an idealized version of
his youthful self becomes the lover of a very ideal young woman and right on cue and he sees this
and tells us it happened an actual woman came along and filled the role that was waiting for her
her name was Madame du Dutôt she was the sister-in-law of his current benefactor Madame
de Pinais it happened she was also the mistress of one of his friends who was a dashing army
officer named Saint Lambert and Rousseau is absolutely clear in the confessions about how
this worked his feeling of being passionately swept away was perfectly real but it was based
on a fantasy projection so he says she came I saw her I was intoxicated with love without
an object it fixed itself on her this intoxication enchanted my eyes I saw my Julie in Madame
du Dutôt and soon I saw only Madame du Dutôt but closed in all the perfections with which
I had been adorning the idol of my heart in short he imagined himself into his novel and then he
imagined his novel into his life with the added benefit for him that since Madame du Dutôt was
his friend's lover he didn't have to sleep with her but could experience the usual inhibitions
more nobly as the grandeur of renunciation with great relish he describes their self-denials
when they exchanged a single kiss under an acacia tree on a moonlit summer night what
intoxicating tears I shed into her lap how many tears I made her shed in spite of herself at last
in an involuntary transport she cried out never was a man so lovable and never did a lover love
like you but your friends and lumbaires listening to us and my heart could not love twice I fell
silent sighing I kissed her and what a kiss but that was all well scholars have been understandably
curious about this uplifting story and people who knew Rousseau at the time have given us some
more information to alter it a bit the scene under the acacia tree happened quite a few times
and Rousseau even sometimes spent the night in her bedroom so it seems clear they didn't sleep
with each other they made out pretty fiercely and so both Madame de Pinae the sister-in-law and
Sanlon there the lover had every reason to be indignant Rousseau had his cake and didn't eat
it but he fondled it a lot well up to this point we've been considering various versions of an
erotic pattern the Rousseau interprets as a key to self-understanding and I'll just say again
earlier writers wouldn't have dreamt of doing such a thing not just out of modesty but they
wouldn't have seen the point Rousseau sees he's attracted to ladies but inhibited from gratification
with them and also he needs to be reproved and resisted if not actually punished and certainly
use the term masochism let's turn to another kind of pattern he traces in the confessions and it
relates even more directly to his thinking about human life it's revealed in two episodes that
happened when he was very young in different places but he sees them as clearly parallel they
are the famous episodes as they've become of the broken comb and the stolen ribbon again they
would have seemed utterly trivial to most people at the time no previous autobiographer would have
mentioned them at all in the first incident he's back at the l'Ambestier's house some combs had
been left next to the chimney to dry when they came back to get them the teeth on one of them
were broken and the boy Rousseau seemed to be the only person who could have gone in the room he
denied it eventually they sent for his uncle to punish him for lying and here's what he tells us
in the confessions almost 50 years have passed since this incident and I'm not afraid today to be
punished all over again for the same crime I declare before the face of heaven that I was
innocent I neither broke nor touched the comb I never went near the chimney I didn't even think of
it he and his cousin sat up in bed after the uncle thrashed them and shouted carnifex carnifex
which is Latin for executioner Rousseau goes on to say in the confessions that this experience of
injustice would still be fresh in his mind if he were to live a thousand years so what he learned
was something very profound one's consciousness of inner goodness and innocence can be masked by
false appearances the very people he trusted condemned him as a liar and there was no way to
make them believe the truth what he longed for above all all his life was to be open to other
people transparent he calls it but he was learning transparency is impossible people have to be role
players they have to act out the image they want other people to have remember he said in the
inequality discourse to be and appear etra and power etra are two different things now the second
episode which he clearly sets up as a parallel to the broken comb when he was a servant in Turin
very low down and a rich lady's household she eventually died and her belongings were being
collected and sorted by her executors prior to breaking the household up and we so noticed a
little silver ribbon that kind of appealed to him and he pilfered it but they've been cataloging
everything and the ribbon was mixed missed and they searched all the servants belongings and there
it was among his things so he'd been caught red-handed maybe it's some kind of explanation and after
hesitating he said a pretty young cook the Marian had given it to him so there was a kind of public
inquisition in front of the whole household in front of the lord of the household they brought
all the servants in to find out the truth and he describes what happens when Marian came in they
showed her the ribbon I accused her shamelessly she was dumbfounded and said nothing she threw me a
glance that would have disarmed devils but my barbarous heart resisted it with an infernal
impudence I repeated my declaration and told her to her face that she had given me the ribbon the
poor girl began to cry and said only these words oh so I believed you were a good character you're
making me very unhappy but yet I wouldn't want to be in your place in the end it was Rousseau who
was believed precisely because he did seem to have a good character so his outward self playing the
role of the good servant convinced the audience of this little drama and he goes on to speculate
that poor Marian probably never got another good job and might well have come to a miserable end
and for 40 years he says he's been tormented by guilt for what he did and so much that he's never
been able to tell a single person the story until now you can see what a mirror image it is to the
story of the broken comb that time Rousseau was the accused innocent he told the truth but no one
believed it now he's the guilty person but he's so convincing he's the one that's believed instead
of the innocent girl and obviously her shock at being accused is so flustering that it probably
looks suspicious but for Rousseau it's not enough just to feel guilty and finally confess it what
he wants to understand is what happened and why and in retrospect he sees that episode of the ribbon
illustrates his theory of human behavior what drove him then was an emotion even stronger than guilt
which might have made him tell the truth he was driven by shame which means the fear of being
exposed to the scorn and contempt of other people it's really extraordinary how impressive his
self understanding is this minor episode from long ago lives on in his consciousness and he sees
clearly that because it won't go away it's got something to tell him even if he's not quite sure
what the most unconvincing thing in it is his explanation of why he named Marian the best he
can do is invoke the empiricist theory of memory that was common then and he calls it an association
of ideas that is he thought of giving the ribbon to Marian so Marian's name is in his head so he
gives her name surely what he needs but in his way he's trying to invent is the concept of the
unconscious that it's our hidden repressed impulses that drive us which has become such a
familiar idea in modern culture the example of dreams that in symbolic form betray repressed
desires the conscious ego doesn't want to know about or the so-called Freudian slips by miss
speaking the person reveals unconscious feelings in resource time nobody had anything like a concept
of the unconscious but his way of exploring psychological experiences crying out for it
i think in the Marian story you could well imagine something going on that he didn't suspect
or couldn't formulate there could have been some unconscious aggression toward this pretty girl
who perhaps wasn't responding to his interest in her but once again that kind of interpretation
is working with the material that he gives us and it's following the logic of the kind of
interpretation that he gives us and so that's why the confessions isn't just an interesting record
of a person's life as most autobiographies are it's an astonishingly original contribution to
the way we think about human behavior and try to interpret it and in the next lecture we'll look
more closely at the problems of interpretation that are raised by this new approach to understanding
the self
