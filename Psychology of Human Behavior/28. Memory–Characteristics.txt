Lecture 28 Memory, Characteristics
The last three lectures we talked about learning and what should naturally follow from learning
would be memory.
Then you have to assess what you learned and show it by recalling it or bringing it up from memory.
So that's what we're going to talk about today and in the next lecture as well is memory.
Today we're going to talk about ways of assessing memory.
How do we know what we've learned?
What are the various ways of assessing memory?
Then we're going to talk about some memory problems that people have.
And I don't want to be more specific about that because I have several demonstrations in there
and I don't want to give away what these demonstrations are about.
Then in the next lecture we're going to talk about some memory aids, mnemonics, ways of improving memory.
And we'll also talk some about some theories of forgetting in that second lecture.
So today we're going to talk about memory.
And first I would like to begin this by having you learn something so that I can assess your memory.
And I don't want you to write these things down but I'm going to read you a list of words
and what I would like for you to do is listen to these words and try to remember as many of them as you can
so that in five or six minutes when I ask you you can give me back as many words as you can remember.
So don't write these things down, just listen carefully as I read them
and try to remember as many of these words as you can.
Here's the list.
All right, now I'm just going to go on and so try to remember as many as you can.
Don't actively rehearse them but in a few minutes I'll ask you to try to recall those.
All right, when I talk about memory in my classes I usually have done a demonstration before that
in which my students have learned something.
And what I have done often is use a serial learning task and so they have learned a list of 12 words
and in this list of words usually I start it with an asterisk at the top
and then I have the list of words always in the same order
and I have them do it by anticipation where I say the asterisk, remember the first word,
then I tell them what the first word was, they have to come up with the second word and so forth.
So they've already previously learned this and over five or six trials they have generally learned it perfectly.
And so if we plot a learning function for them it's much like an acquisition curve
that we've already talked about in this course and they will have learned it,
learn it rather rapidly to begin with and then the function flattens off at about 12
and so everybody in the class has learned the list perfectly at that point.
And then in my next lecture I talk about memory
and that lecture may follow the first one by about four days or so
and so now I want to do some assessment of memory, what do they remember from that list?
And so the first thing I tell them is to get out a piece of paper
and to write down as many words in any order they like from this list
and so then I give them, it only takes about 20 seconds
because they don't remember typically more than about six of the words.
There's a distribution around it, some remember 10, some remember four words,
the ones who were asleep don't remember any words,
but on average they remember maybe six of the words that way after four days.
And so if we were to plot a forgetting function from this
where on the horizontal axis we have time from having learned the thing
and on the vertical axis we have the proportion of the amount that they remember
at time zero, since all of them had learned it perfectly
then they remember 100% of it, so we start out at 100% at time zero
and then for this class we could plot a function four days out
and typically that would be about six items.
Now if I did this in the laboratory where I had them after two days
and after four days and six days and ten days and so forth
I would discover that this function, that there would be a considerable drop off at the beginning
and then kind of in reverse of a learning curve it would tend to flatten out
and it would decrease so it would be 50% after four days
and maybe 40% after a week and 35% after three weeks, something like that.
So we get kind of a reverse learning curve which is the forgetting curve.
Now at this point I might be kind of discouraged
because after a year that would be essentially nothing that they remember
and I'm a teacher after all and I like to have people remember what I tell them in class
and that would be a very discouraging kind of thing
but fortunately that's not what I'm looking for is free recall.
I don't usually stop one of my students two years later and say
tell me everything you remember from my class and write it down please.
I mean if I did that I would be very embarrassed and so would the student
because they would say things like well let's see, hmm
I remember we talked about Freud didn't we? Yeah I think we talked about Freud.
What else did we do? Hmm let's see.
Oh I remember you played as tapes of crazy people in your class didn't you?
And say well yeah okay, is that all you remember out of this whole semester of taking my class?
Well fortunately there are other ways of assessing memory
and so even in this demonstration I would then go to a different way of assessing memory
and rather than saying write everything down that you remember
I might say okay now I'm going to read you a list of words
and some of these are old words and some of these are new words
and I want you to put a check mark next to the new words
and so I would say tree which would be a new word
money that was a word that was on the list
briefcase a new word
jewel a word that was on the list
village and so forth so I would read them twelve words
half of which were old words on the list
and half of these would be new words
now when I do that
students are a whole lot better
and on average they get them all right
they have check marks next to all six of them
and if I plot that on the same function
in terms of proportion that they remember after four days
its seldom drops below 90%
they're above 90% for this
whereas the other one showed that they were at 50%
so in using this different way of assessing memory
I've discovered that they remember a whole lot more
than they did
now the first way of assessing memory
is called free recall because I said
I want you to recall it with no
no particular cues and freely
meaning in any order you like
and in the second way that's recognition
so I'm saying recognize the old items
from the new items recognize what you've learned before
and people are considerably better at recognition
and that's a good thing
I give the kind of tests I do to my undergraduate students
because I give them tests that are multiple choice tests
where I ask them a question
there's an A, B, C and D alternative
and all they really have to do
if I wrote the question properly
is recognition
they have to recognize the correct alternative
which is very different from saying fill in the blank
or even worse write an essay on it
where they have to brute force call it up
without any kind of probes
that tell them how to do this kind of task
so they're fortunate that I ask them those kinds of questions
because it shows they remember a whole lot more
than if they were filling in the blank
but even there after a year or two
I might give them this recognition task
and they still might not be very good at that task
in fact it may show that they've forgotten everything
if that's the case have they forgotten everything
is there any way I could discover
whether there's anything left
well there is really
I could sit them down and say okay
let's pull out this list again and have you learn it
and I will start out the same way
show you the asterisk right down the first number and so forth
and I might find that even after two years
they can learn the list in three trials
instead of five trials
that would indicate that there's something left
that there's some savings by having learned it before
so relearning is a third way we could assess memory
and this might show some things there
even when everything else is gone
and this is good
because most of what my students are going to be doing
and what I expect them to do is relearning
more than anything else
I hope when my students are through with my course
that they can pick up Time Magazine
and look at the behavior section in an article say on autism
and they've learned something about autism before
they could not be able to give you a five minute lecture on autism
but in fact they could read this article
and they would remember enough about it
that they could read the article in a more informed way
so that's what I'm really trying to do in my class
is set people up for relearning
rather than for recall or recognition
so it depends upon how you assess memory
in order to know what exactly is left
when you're done with the task
so that's assessing memory
now I'd like to move on
and let's go to the list I gave you
and I want you if you have access to a piece of paper
or something like that
write down as many of the words from the list I read
right at the beginning of this lecture as you can
or if you're doing something else
don't have a piece of paper
at least say the words as many as you can
I'll wait just about ten seconds here
Alright, you've probably written down as many as you can remember
if I judge from my classes when I do this
people will remember four or five words from the list
typically
and what I often do is then walk around
and point to various people in the class
and say, well, read me what you remember
and they'll read off the list of words that they remember
I do this for five or six people
and then I go back to the front of the class
and I say, do you notice anything strange
about these lists that people have read us
and usually nobody comes up with anything strange
I said, well, I noticed something strange
the lists contain the words sleep
and I say, how many of you wrote down sleep
and about 60% of my students usually hold up their hands
and that's what the research shows too
the people wrote down the word sleep
and what's unusual is the word sleep was not in that list
and so people are giving me a false memory
they've remembered something that wasn't there
that's why at the beginning of this lecture I said a memory problem
and you probably thought that the memory problem was forgetting
not making something up to add to the memory
and you might wonder why people don't remember
and you might wonder why people would ever write down the word sleep
well, if you look at the construction of the list
you will discover that there are a lot of words
that are associates of the word sleep on this list
such as slumber, rest, dark, dream
those kinds of words are highly associated with sleep
and perhaps what we do when we try to remember what's on the list
is to figure out what's most activated in our memory
and if you picture your memory system as being a set of nodes
each of which perhaps that contains a word
or perhaps a concept from concept formation
and then these nodes are associated with each other with certain weights
so you have a certain activation weight
the word slumber and sleep have probably a pretty high activation weight
between them and dark and dream
all associated pretty nicely with sleep
with fairly high activation weights
as opposed to a word like robin let's say
which is probably has almost no association with the word sleep
and so for this list when I asked you to recall it
you probably went to this activation network
and said what's most activated
what's energized in my activation network
what's lit up and I'll pick those things that are most lit up
and recall those
well while sleep wasn't lit up from having been on the list
it was probably lit up by these other kinds of nodes that were activated
in a process that psychologists sometimes call spreading activation
where you have certain activation that spreads to other nodes near those nodes
and we lit up enough of the other nodes associated with sleep
the sleep ended up being activated as well
and that's probably how this occurred
now that sounds interesting to you
but I think the most important thing about this
is that it's a very different conception of memory from what most people have
most people think of memory as something like a snapshot
or a tape recording perhaps if it's over time
where you have an event happen
you put a high fidelity recording back in there
in your memory system somewhere in your brain
and at first it's very well remembered
if you ask me a minute later what it was
I could tell you mostly what it was
and then over time this thing gets degraded
and the picture the snapshot the recording over time gets degraded
until it starts to fade away a little bit
and then with a passage of enough time
or perhaps interfering material
we'll talk about that when we talk about theories of forgetting
over time this thing fades away a little bit
and you don't remember
well how does that explain how you put new things in
that were never there in the first place
and yet we now know that you do this
well apparently that's a wrong conception of what's going on
what apparently is going on is that as you remember something
certain cues in the situation that you pick up
and stick on these memory nodes in your memory system
and these cues kind of are associated with each other
occur in about the same time
and now at some later time I come up and say
tell me what the memory was
and you pick up these cues as best that you can
and try to construct a memory
very different it's not that you're pulling something whole cloth out of your memory system
but in fact what you're doing is taking these cues
and trying to construct something that's as close to the memory as you can
and sometimes these cues are wrong
sometimes you pick up the wrong cues
and you form memories that are wrong as well
let me give an example from my own experience
once when I was in my, I think I was about 13, 14 years old maybe
I was up in New Hampshire
had some friends up there and I used to go up
and spend a month on their farm in New Hampshire
up on the top of a mountain in the White Mountains
and this particular time my father had come out to visit as well
and there's a fellow named Larry who was the father in this family
where I was staying
we're all honest people
Larry in fact was a minister and my father was a
certainly an honest fellow and I think I was too
well we were standing on this mountain top
and this was shortly after satellites just came out
Sputnik and so forth
and we were standing there looking at the stars
and it was beautiful out there that night and we're looking at the stars
and then one of the stars was moving across the sky
and I said well look at that
look at that star moving
I said that must be a satellite up there
and the other said oh yeah I see it too
look at that, that must be a satellite
now that's the way it happened
I know because that's the way I remember it
alright
I heard my father tell this story
some years later
he said you remember when we were standing on the top of that mountain
and we were looking at the stars
and I saw this star moving
and I said to you all that's a satellite do you see it up there
and I said dad
now that's not what happened
I said I was there I saw the star moving
no no I remember distinctly
I saw it and pointed it out
then I heard Larry tell the story
also
and he said you know when I saw that
all three of us thought we had seen the satellite first
and I don't think any of us was lying
I think he could have put us all on a polygraph
and we had all passed
we all thought it was true
somehow we had stored this thing away
such that some changes occurred to it
and we were called a false memory
when you start telling stories like that
you maybe can believe why
people who are expert
or who are witnesses, eye witnesses
in court cases
could be lying up there
when in fact they're not lying in their own mind
they tell it like it is
but somehow their memories got changed
and so
let's look at somebody who actually studies
that process
of false memory
and see the kind of thing that she finds
when she studies this process
and again remember we're talking about here
a constructive process
of putting things together
and for which we get illusions
memory illusions just like you get visual illusions
we'll have a lecture or two later on in the course
where we talk about vision
and perception
and we'll have visual illusions
where you are seeing things
that you think are there that really aren't there
in this case you're remembering things
that really weren't there either
now the person who is most famous
for doing this kind of work
is Elizabeth Loftus
and Elizabeth originally was at
the University of Washington
after she got her PhD at Stanford
and while she was at Washington
became very interested in
eyewitness testimony
and false memories
and she has now moved on to University of California
at Irvine
is actually associated with three different departments there
cognitive science, psychology
and criminal
criminality and law
those departments
and she has become a very famous kind of psychologist
she recently made a list of the hundred
most famous psychologists
from the 20th century
she's the highest ranking woman
on that list in fact
and Loftus has done a lot of research
which has made her famous
but she's also become famous
because she's an expert
on eyewitness testimony
and they call her in
in many of the famous trials to try to
explain eyewitness testimony
when there seems to be
sort of a problem with eyewitness testimony
some of the trials that she's been involved in
the McMartin preschool molestation trial
you may remember that
it's a very famous trial
where there were kids
who claimed that they had been molested
in a preschool
and many, many of the kids were claiming this
and claiming it for many of the people
not just one person in the preschool
but almost everybody who was working in the preschool
with bizarre stories about
various ways they were molested
and aliens
and there are all sorts of things in these stories
and they testified in court
and people were sent away to jail
for long periods of time
it is now the case
that these folks have all been released
and it turns out that there is no real evidence
other than the children's memory
from the preschool
and it also turns out that these children
the way they were interrogated
was such that false memories
could be built for these children
and it turns out that the people
were likely all innocent
from the McMartin preschool
and she was a witness in that
some of the other trials that she has
been a witness in
the hillside strangler case
the abscam cases
Oliver North trial
the Rodney King beating trial
where she was testifying on behalf
of some of the officers involved
the Menendez brothers
the Oklahoma City bombing
the Michael Jackson case
so she's been around quite a bit
and established her credentials
not only scientifically
but in the real world as well
but what did she do to study these kinds of effects
she started out looking first
at the misinformation effect
that she calls it
and in this case
she would show people a tape
of an event, a staged event
like an accident
and then she would ask them various questions
about this accident
for example she might say
that she would ask them
well did you see any children
getting off the school bus
when you were watching this tape
they say no I don't recall seeing anybody
get off the school bus
amongst other questions
these were embedded in other questions
then a week later she would bring the folks back
and ask them another series of questions
and one of the questions would be
did you see a school bus on the tape
and 26% of the time
the people said yes I saw a school bus on the tape
if they had been asked the previous question
about did you see children getting off the school bus
but only 6% of the time
would they say that they had seen a school bus
when they had not been asked the previous question
and in fact there was not a school bus
on the tape
so in fact she implanted
the idea that there was a school bus on the tape
simply by the kind of question
she asked
and she's done that a number of
ways
she showed a particular crime
and then asked what color tie
the fellow was wearing
who was committing the crime
and they said I don't remember what color tie
and then a week later
they would ask the obvious question
was the fellow wearing a tie
well yes he was
at least again about a quarter of the time
they would say that
or you can
do things like use different words
they see an automobile accident
and she might ask
well how fast was the green car
going when it smashed
into the red car
and they would give a particular speed
versus how fast was the green car
going when it hit
or made contact with the red car
in which case
they estimate the speed
to be considerably less
and if you ask them then questions
about was there any flying glass
occurring
during this accident
if they had used the word smashed
yes there was flying glass
if they had used the word hit
no there was not flying glass
there were people to change from
saying that it was a stop sign
to a yield sign
by asking questions again
saying
and did you see the yield sign
that kind of question
so these are all cases where she feeds them
misinformation
and then ask them about
what they have seen
but she also
can create entire false memories
she can implant false memories
using certain procedures
and one of the famous things she did
she brought Alan Alda
into her laboratory
because he was going to do a show on memory
and he came to University of California
Irvine and interviewed
a number of memory experts there
this was a scientific American kind
of show that he was doing
he's interested in science
and so he came to interview Elizabeth Loftus
and he thought
that she was interested in people's memory
for eating events
and so she gave him a questionnaire
about some of his
what he
his experiences were in his childhood
he filled out this whole questionnaire
and then she said
well we took your questionnaire
and we put it into our computer
with a very sophisticated computer program
and we discovered
that in your
when you were a youth
that at one point
you were like on eating hard boiled eggs
and
so do you have any memory of getting
no? I really don't
well we know for sure
that in fact this happened
from the answers you gave us
on the questionnaire
and then they went about doing other kinds of things
and then that afternoon they had a picnic
for
the people in the laboratory including
Alan Alda
and he came to the picnic
with all sorts of different food stuffs for the picnic
including double eggs
and hard boiled eggs and that sort of thing
and he refused to eat any of the hard boiled eggs
at that point
and that apparently affected his behavior
by implanting this memory
of a hard boiled egg
sickness that he had
earlier in his life
and he was very much amazed about this
and you can see this on
a PBS show when they show
this particular show
and she's done other kinds of things too
one way that she often does
this is getting
biographical information
supposedly from the person's family
and so she'll get some real
incidents about things that happened in this person's
childhood
and put these together
and present them to somebody
but she'll include a false one
in there as well
one of the ones she likes to include
is do you remember the time
when you were in the shopping mall
and you wandered around
for a half an hour
after you got lost
and finally this elderly gentleman found you
and took you and we all got reunited
at that point
do you remember that incident
well no I really don't remember that
and in fact it never happened
this is a false one that they made up
that they put in amongst the other
kinds of memories
that were true memories
but later
in many cases
they will agree that that
really did happen to them
that in fact about a third of the cases
they are highly confident
that they indeed got lost in a shopping mall
she's done other kinds
of things as well
she has showed people
pictures of things that supposedly
happened when they were
when they were younger
like from a book that has
written it
and she'll construct false pictures
by taking for example
a hot air balloon
and taking another picture of Dad
and the kid
and cutting it out of the original picture
and sticking them in the hot air balloon
and showing them the picture of the hot air balloon
and sure enough this creates a memory
for the person
and they think they actually went up
in a hot air balloon with Dad
in many cases
they not only change people's memory a little bit
but create whole new
false memories for people
which they're fairly confident
happened to them
now I've told you about this
mainly because I want you to
consider this
different conception of memory
that in fact memory is not
this thing that we put in
as a high fidelity recording
and then we lose it
over time
and what we do with memory
is get cues when things happen to us
and we put those cues in there
and some of those cues it's possible
or false
and then when we're asked to
construct what happened
we take these cues and do the best that we can
in terms of constructing a memory
it's sort of like what we do with dreams
in some cases you have various stimuli
and you put these things together
and make up the best story that you can
about it
that's what we're doing too
so
if you conceive of memory this way
I think you'll have a lot less confidence
in your own memory
and also in other people's memory
when you ask people
to do this kind of thing
and it also does explain why you get
certain kinds of problems with eye witness testimony
in the courts as well
so that's the first part
of our memory lecture
what we tried to do today
was to talk about some ways of
assessing memory
we saw that it very much depended upon
what way you assess memory
whether it's by
relearning or by recognition
or by recall how those show different
effects of memory
we showed how you could come up with
illusory or false memories
and we discussed at some length
Elizabeth Loftus' work about
how you can actually create false memories
the next time we'll talk about some memory
aids and we'll also talk about some theories
of forgetting
thank you
