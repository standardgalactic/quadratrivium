Welcome back. In this lecture we are going to tackle one of the most important but most
neglected aspects of public speaking, talking about yourself. As a famous man in American
history Dale Carnegie who trained hundreds if not thousands of people in the art of public
speaking and he always said that the single besetting sin of most beginners was to talk
in abstractions and to talk in impersonal terms ignoring his mantra which was be yourself
and let your audience know who you are. I'd like you to think back to Patrick Henry standing
there in St. John's church and ending his fiery revolutionary speech with a message that
was from his heart and really very much about him. I know not what course others may take
but as for me give me liberty or give me death. He was separating himself apart from that
crowd. He was speaking from the heart, he was hoping others would follow but he was really
throwing down the gauntlet in the most personal way possible. We're going to be looking at
some great speakers today who give us examples of how you should bring yourself into your
words, how you should share your feelings, even your weaknesses and failures with the
audience if you want to make the deepest connection possible with them and our chief
guest professor today is Queen Elizabeth I of England. We're going to follow her in
her barge from her palace in London down the River Thames to Tilbury where her army
is assembling to try to fend off the most serious invasion threat her island has ever
known at least since the time of William the Conqueror half a millennium earlier the threat
of the Spanish Armada. The year is 1588. The King of Spain, King Philip has put together
one of the largest fleets that the medieval and Renaissance world has ever known with
the idea of supporting Catholics in the country and with a Duke, the Duke of Parma, an Italian
Duke who is in the service of the King of Spain pushing Elizabeth off her throne. It
looked hopeless for England. It was up to her to put some heart into those men and she
did it perhaps in the most surprising way possible. She did it by talking about herself.
Let's listen to her own words and let's imagine the scene. She apparently read this speech.
There's no reason to think that she didn't write it herself. It's very much of a piece
with all of her discourses to her people but she knew her voice was too weak to be heard
all around the battlefield. I'm sorry not battlefield the camp where they were all gathered.
So she had copies made and captains read it out to their troops in every part of the field
simultaneously. It was sort of an ancient PA system but it worked very well and it made
everyone feel that they were really hearing from the Queen herself.
My loving people. We have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety to take
heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes for fear of treachery. But I assure you I
do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear. I am
come amongst you as you see at this time not for my recreation and to sport but being resolved
in the midst and heat of the battle to live or die amongst you all to lay down for my
God and for my kingdom and for my people my honor and my blood even in the dust. I know
I have the body of a weak and feeble woman but I have the heart and stomach of a king
and of a king of England too and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain or any prince of
Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm to which rather than any dishonor
shall grow by me I myself will take up arms I myself will be your general judge and reward
or of every one of your virtues in the field I know already for your forwardness you have
deserved rewards and crowns and we do assure you in the word of a prince they shall be
duly paid you by your valor in the field we shall shortly have a famous victory over
these enemies of my God of my kingdom and of my people I want you to consider how strange
a speech this is coming from a commander in chief where the key moment is when she confesses her
sense of her own weakness I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman by taking that
tack Elizabeth has drawn them in drawn their sympathies to her opened herself up to them
admitted her weakness and I'm sure created feelings of courage and determination in that army
that she could have gotten in no other way so she is a model for us of how you tackle a very
difficult situation you are wanting to win sympathy you are wanting people to know you right away
you're wanting people to believe in the same cause that you believe in it's often not the right
thing to just talk about how strong and how great you are opening up to people in public speaking
as in private life is the way to establish a true relationship this may have been the first time
that a reigning queen of England had ever taken her forces into the field as commander in chief
she was in fact not going to go on board the ships along with Sir Francis Drake and her other
famous captains she would wait on shore but she doesn't let you see that in the speech she talks
about laying her own honor and life down in the dust dying with them if necessary and what she's
looking forward to is that dreaded moment when the enemy might come ashore she has pledged to them
she will not run away their danger is her danger because she opened up about something that they
must have all been wondering about the feeling of fighting for a woman a weak woman not a soldier king
as they were used to with her father and her grandfather she tackled what was on everyone's
mind and she made it a strength if you will open up about weaknesses if you will open up about
failures you too can create the feeling that out of these past failures and out of these inherent
weaknesses and your struggle to overcome them comes strength that you can share with your listeners
it's a great way to get a crowd on your side i remember hearing an incredibly inspiring sermon
of all the hundreds of sermons i've heard in my life in churches it's the one that certainly
sticks with me most it was by a reverend george mackey who was the minister at our church in new
albany indiana when i was small a man who had grown up it seems in an odor of sanctity of of
always doing the right thing he was sort of the the pillar of rectitude but one day he gave a sermon
about when he was bad when he had failed to be a loving person he'd been in the school where all
of the future ministers were being taught the seminary and he was part of a group of healthy
young fellows who like to throw the ball around and go on long hikes and there was one young man
in the group they picked on because he was weak he had no stamina he didn't join in their games
so they pushed him around they mocked him they made jokes about him one day they were crossing
the courtyard on a cold winter night snow on the ground and he was overtaken with a fit of
coughing as he seemed to often be and that somebody made a joke about it and mr mackey among others
laughed and then they saw that there were spatters of pink and red on the snow he was coughing blood
this young man had tuberculosis he would probably would not live long enough
to be the minister that he wanted to be but he was there putting up with all their abuse
putting up with their mockery because he felt that was whatever might happen his mission in life
well that was obviously a life changing experience for my minister
but hearing that story from someone i thought was perfect was a life changing experience for me
there are lots of ways in which you can talk to people about yourself it doesn't have to be just
weaknesses it can be personal things to you that help people understand you i want to take another
example of a great public speaker and another great woman in history sojourner truth she was a
slave in america freed before the civil war who when the civil war was over felt that the big war
still day ahead equal rights for women in 1867 she attended the national convention of american
equal rights association in the church of the puritans in new york city so she's talking to a
friendly audience and she opened up about herself and her past and her feelings about the future
i am above 80 years old it is about time for me to be going i have been 40 years a slave
and 40 years free and would be here 40 years more to have equal rights for all well she was
almost right if she could have lived all the way till 1920 she would have seen the equal rights for
women that she was hoping for i suppose i am kept here because something remains for me to do
that sense of incompleteness a job not yet done something that is a mission that she has
not yet succeeded in i suppose i am yet to help break the chain i have done a great deal of work
as much as a man but did not get so much pay i used to work in the field and buying grain
keeping up with the cradler but men doing no more got twice as much pay we do as much we eat as much
we want as much i suppose i am about the only colored woman that goes about to speak for the
rights of the colored women i want to keep the things stirring now that the ice is cracked
you can tell just from that short excerpt what a powerful public speaker she is she uses images
in a terrific way as we'll see in a later lecture when we follow the shawnee chief
takamsa on his speech making tours as he tries to unite all of the tribes
she has that gift talking about now that the ice is cracked or i want to stay here to help
break the chain of painting a picture in your mind so you remember things but you also remember her
she uses pictures from her past life to make it vivid to you and to me and the the phrase here
that just brings this little excerpt to life for me is when she's describing herself in the field
and what she's really emphasizing is the the half pay for the same amount of work
but she can't give give up on trying to to convey to us how proud she is that in that
drudgery in that hard labor under the southern sun where she would go along and gather up the grain
and bind it in sheaves she was following the man with the rake who as they say was the
cradler who brought it together in rows she kept up with him and that little phrase keeping up with
the cradler is that significant detail about herself about personal experience something that
probably nobody else in that new york church knew anything about that helps give this a feeling of
authenticity and that's something we always want to see in personal dialogues and personal
communications and confessions the feeling of authenticity it's something i think that public
speaking can do for you in fact i think public speaking can make people better because it gets
them in touch with who they are really it puts them in a forum where they can really say anything
about themselves and know that it will only add to the sense of authenticity of communication
of revelation and finally of communication with the audience nobody's perfect we all feel closer
to people who we know through and through and who have felt confident enough to share their weaknesses
and failures with us now we've got people who have used their public speaking
for statements of personal creed one of these we're going to be visiting later on
in our series of guest lectures and that is Mahatma Gandhi who in the 20th century
was on trial for his life and we're going to be visiting him for an entire spell an entire session
making him our our chief guide but i want to sort of prefigure his appearance with us later on
with just the opening of that speech which i think is so profoundly personal and not only
made an important statement for his judge his english judge there in india as he's on trial
for his life but also to the millions that he knew would be reading or listening to his words
non-violence is the first article of my faith it is the last article of my faith
but i had to make my choice with that short beginning he has said an essential thing
about the kind of person he is i also want you to notice the simplicity and plainness and
directness of his language something he shares with queen elizabeth and with sojourner truth
in trying to open himself up so that you will understand him you will understand what means
more to him than anything else on earth now as an example of the wrong way to present yourself
in a speech i would like to present the emperor napoleon who took leave of his old guard there in
france in 1814 after a series of defeats by a great army of allies had captured paris
and he was about to be sent away to the island of elba in exile he voluntarily surrendered
he did not fight to the death either for himself or for this old guard who certainly would have
followed him anywhere so let's hear napoleon standing there in paris the old guard drawn up
again for one last time in front of him as he explains to them his feelings at this moment
these are soldiers he has been with for decades he's bidding them farewell
soldiers of my old guard i bid you farewell for 20 years i have constantly accompanied you
on the road to honor and glory now i want to say to you right now this is a great start
that image of the the monarch the emperor the general accompanying the troops that they are
the real leaders and he is just following in their slipstream that is a tremendously powerful and
moving way for the man who was briefly the most powerful human being on earth to talk to the
soldiers who really made it all possible the focus is on them but they are getting the sense that
he's opening up his heart to them and through his own feelings his own vision of himself
really creates a feeling of pride in these men who have in fact suffered a very grievous defeat
but things start to go off the rails pretty quickly in these latter times as in the days
of our prosperity you have invariably been models of courage and loyalty with men such as you our
cause could not be lost but the war would have been interminable it would have been civil war
and that would have entailed deeper misfortunes on france we're getting a little tortuous here
in his effort to try to pay them a compliment to call them invincible when they have in fact
been beaten he is beginning to have to do mental gymnastics that are clouding the issue
clouding that straightforward emotion that he started with so very effectively
but now we really go the wrong way right after saying this would have entailed deeper
misfortunes on france napoleon goes on i have sacrificed all my interests for my country
where did that come from suddenly the emphasis and the focus is on the speaker in the wrong way
he's wanting pity he's wanting to be admired he's no longer thinking about them except as
an audience for his own revelations about how important he thinks he is and how wonderful
he thinks he's been doing i go but you my friends will continue to serve france her happiness was
my only thought it will still be the object of my wishes do not regret my fate i mean we're
on broadway shows here with don't cry for me argentina this is bathos that over the top
kind of emotionalism which starts to seem inappropriate and ridiculous
do not regret my fate if i have consented to survive it is to serve your glory
what well he explains what he means i intend to write the history of the great achievements we
have performed together adieu my friends would i could press you all to my heart it's good ending
from adieu my friends onward but again the idea that somebody has consented to survive
when he had all along been saying we will fight to the death and that he's doing it so he can go
off to a place of comparative safety and write a book about what they all did together this is
really descending from the sublime to the ridiculous he was a monomaniac there's no doubt about it
he's not in the category of those first three speakers we heard but as we consider that we've
got two absolute monarchs here elizabeth the first and napoleon we see how elizabeth expresses
through her own willingness to open up genuine feelings about herself and say nothing that's
not true about this problem that she has the body of a weak and feeble woman she gets the
sympathy of the crowd and the sympathy of posterity napoleon although this is printed and reprinted
as a great speech seems to me to say much more about himself than he does about the men that he
is supposed to be praising and exalting my own experience with talking about myself has been
that it transformed my lectures my pep talks as a coach my explanations of how to do things in
the field for students into something that they pay more attention to and that they see more clearly
and that at the end we feel like more of a team i can remember the class notes and evaluations that
i received in the semester that i finally decided i was going to stop simply turning the textbook
into lectures and use illustrations from my own fieldwork and that of other people i'd worked
with at the university of louisville to tell the students a sort of story about what they were
going to hear based on my own personal experiences immediately i found in the evaluations what i
most like was hearing about my professor's own experiences this gave me validity this was an
authentication of what made it valuable for them to be listening to me this is all was the question
you have to think about when you are trying to convince people that you're worth listening to
why me what can i bring to this topic now i admit i have it easy if i'm giving a pep talk as a rowing
coach i used to be a rower i can talk about those experiences if i'm talking about archaeology and a
lecture in a college classroom i can talk about my own fieldwork and my own discoveries but one
thing i try to do is follow elizabeth's example and talk about my mistakes and make it plain to them
that they're going to need to learn from their own mistakes i'm very interested in the fact that
we often want nothing but success the image that i like to use in class is that of a baby
learning to walk you cannot learn to walk from reading the books studying the manuals watching
other people do it you have to get out there and do it yourself and you have to fall down
nobody walks without falling down and that's true of most enter enterprises in life nobody
becomes an archaeologist without making mistakes so how do i illustrate this point about being
willing to make mistakes i talked to them about some of my own stupidities in the field i'll give
you an example the first time i was put in charge of a of a field team there in the Louisville area
i'd come back to town with my cambridge phd in hand very puffed up about myself i'd been given the
job simply because that particular survey required that the director be a phd i was the least
experienced person in the field if not in terms of all of the things necessary to do a dig certainly
in terms of that area i had never worked in jefferson county kentucky as an archaeologist
my field crew had been working there for years did i sit down humbly and talk to them about it no
when we were assigned areas to survey did i go around to the different farmhouses
say that i knew nothing about the area but i would be grateful for information no did i even take
the trouble to go back through the records of previous archaeologists and study what they had
found there no so i was set up for a fall and i got one there was a mound that we discovered
back in some woods now i had at that stage always the dream that the next thing that would happen
to me would be the time magazine cover because this extraordinary prehistoric mound had been found
and uh the team from the university of louisville would have would have excavated it and brought
to light these things that rewrote the history books that was my dream here was a big mound most
of the mounds in jefferson county were were destroyed a long time ago and so this seemed
like a chance to find something unique now i discovered that nobody else in the group was
very group was very excited about this they had seen similar things i was convinced this was
a real prehistoric mound it was sort of this biggest three haystacks piled on top of each other
and so i made them settle down for three days in over 100 degree heat and about 98 humidity we
stripped the uh shrubs and saplings off the top of that mound now there's no no shade to hide you
from the hot noonday sun we worked down in these textbook layers and after three days one of them
pulled up from the mound a bicycle chain and said was this the prehistoric artifact you were looking
for and one minute later we got a piece of plate glass and a brick i was shaken so i finally did
what i should have done at the beginning i went to the nearest farmhouse i could have seen the
roof the whole time knocked on the door and asked about the mound in the woods and i was told by
the farmer's wife well that's not a mound that's the big pile of dirt that my husband pulled up
out of the creek with his backhoe when he was trying to channelize the creek so it had flow
better and we wouldn't get floods in the fields that's just the stuff that he piled up well my name
was mud for a long time and they all enjoyed laughing at me about it but i learned a lot i
approach every field experience differently now i learned in a way that i could only have learned
from a failure from a mistake from making a fool of myself and i now have a story to tell to my
students about my own mistake that can help them be ready for the inevitable mistakes they will make
themselves i learned a lot from a series of speakers that we brought to the university of
louisville and the way that they would present themselves to our students to the community at
large we had figures like jane goodall who would come who would always begin by talking about her
own vision her own childhood how she got into the field her work with the chimpanzees what it meant
to her and by the end of hearing her talk about it there was nothing you wanted more than to join
with this seemingly frail woman who had braved the outback in africa who had done more to create a
brand new scientific field primatology than any other worker but had done it all with this spirit
of modesty this spirit of grace and quiet that was an entirely new thing in our lives
sure the the point she was making about the necessity for conservation are good points
but what moved us was her own personal vision her own story so i remember going to a second
lecturer a second visitor his name was bob ballard big man in my field of shipwreck studies
he's the man who had found the titanic how did he begin his speech did he talk about
the excitement of the day the heroic moment when the the titanic was discovered there two and a
half miles down in the north atlantic and all those mysteries were finally solved no he talked
about his childhood in kansas the most landlocked part of america how he yearned even as a child
to have something to do with the sea and how this titanic and its discovery was the fulfillment of
a dream that went all the way back to the time he was a little boy what we took away from it was
an image of a very human person for whom this discovery was a triumph the kind of triumph we
could all identify with so let's sum up what we've learned from queen elizabeth the first
from our other speakers today first a set of lessons about being yourself as dale carney
said first explain your personal connection to the subject of your speech you must have one
figure out what it is and let your audience know second share your own emotions beliefs and ideas
and don't shy away from revealing your weaknesses and failures third establish a personal link
with your listeners at the start of your speech think how elizabeth the first did that when she
said her advisors had told her don't go out in the crowd for fear of treason and she said i would
rather not live than distrust you there's a personal link fourth use plain direct language
but never even if you are a monarch talk down to your audience and finally a couple of
general points that we get from from elizabeth fifth don't hesitate to read your speech from
a script if necessary it can still be a very powerful experience for your audience and finally
always make sure that your audience will be able to hear you because believe me if you are opening
up yourselves to them they will want to hear every word
