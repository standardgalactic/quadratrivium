A treaty technically not inconsistent with Germany's alliance with Austria although in
spirit quite at odds with it.
Other scholars such as the great American diplomatic scholar William Langer see 1887
and this reinsurance treaty and these Mediterranean agreements as the apex of the Bismarckian
system of diplomacy.
And once again all those Mediterranean agreements and all that diplomatic activity helped to
press the Russians again into recommitting in some way because they didn't want to be
out in the cold either and they didn't want as yet to reach an agreement with Republican
France although that soon would come.
Langer says in 1887 by May 1887 France was completely hedged about had she attempted
to move she would have found herself entirely surrounded by the members of a coalition determined
to maintain the status quo and to prevent her from taking action.
Now one of the things you might do just for fun if you have the courage to attempt this
and I always do this on the board when I teach this material is diagram the Bismarckian alliance
system seeing is believing take out a map diagram the Bismarckian alliance system see
what you think it all means and then if you want to go further take a look at the suggested
readings in Ralph Menning's book the art of the possible if you're a hardcore diplomatic
historian go test your metal against some of those primary source documents that I'm
going to be suggesting that you look at for the remainder of our time together.
Be this as it may if Bismarck seemed temporarily able to manipulate most of his contemporaries
in the level of his genius and his state craft he was unable to do the same either with young
Kaiser Wilhelm II who sadly accepted with Bismarck's resignation in 1890 or of the opinions
of later historians concerning his system of diplomacy now you can't blame the young
Kaiser for being somewhat confused by what Bismarck had done but what you can blame him
for and he deserves blame the single worst immediate mistake he made and perhaps the
single worst mistake he made until he began his building of a large German Navy was letting
Russia hang loose Bismarck understood you can't have Russia hang loose if France is
hanging loose if Russia and France are hanging loose take a look at a map geostrategic self-preservation
and self-interest is bound to bring Russia and France together whether they like it or
not Bismarck understood that the Kaiser did not understand that to his lasting discredit
credit Bismarck with raw genius in his attempt to preserve what he had built by peaceful
means if possible and with war scares and economic blackmail if necessary or war and
while scholars recognize that he understood the balance the value of the balance of power
in all of Europe and also preferred peace to war when it was possible most also credit
his system of alliances as being one of the long-term preconditions or even causes of
World War one these alliances were far too complicated in nature leading more to a growth
in tension and fear than any profound sense of Concorde or concert sooner or later once
Germany chose Austria as her primary fixed ally France and Russia were likely to come
together unless somehow Bismarck could continue to reign Russia in with a demise of Bismarck's
rule it was sooner rather than later almost immediately between 1891 and 1894 the Franco
Russian alliance became a reality and what that meant was actually the reestablishment
of the balance of power in Europe which had been totally in Germany's favor prior to that
time so the Franco Russian alliance did not disrupt the balance of power it reestablished
the balance of power and it wasn't easy for the French and the Russians to agree on it.
