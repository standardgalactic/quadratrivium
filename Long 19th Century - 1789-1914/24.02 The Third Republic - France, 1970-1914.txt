In short order, between May the 21st and the 28th, Paris' most bloody week since the
June days of 1848 occurred as the provisional government's regular army reinforced by thousands
of new volunteers from German POW camps and from rural France, and rural peasant France
was only too glad to have a chance to teach urban Paris, urban radical Paris a lesson
seduced Paris and an orgy of mutual recrimination, terror and murder, mass murder hostages on
both sides without trial, including the killing of the Archbishop of Paris by the insurgents
and the killing of somewhere between 22 and 25,000 insurgents and the imprisonment of
another 7,500 of them, leaving a legacy of tremendous class hatred, this class hatred
that really became a prominent during the June days of 1848 and even intensified here,
although the working classes having really been beaten and subdued couldn't do much about
it in the immediate aftermath.
Following the quashing of the commune, Thierre and moderate Republican and Democratic allies
oversaw the installation of a conservative republic with two houses, two chambers and
an upper chamber which would be more conservative, and Thierre was elected president in 1871,
however in this case against the wishes of a variety of monarchist claimants supported
by upper clergy, senior military personnel, aristocrats and some wealthy members of the
bourgeoisie who would really have preferred a monarchy.
Over the early years, establishing the republic was touch and go since peasant France and
local notables first elected a majority of monarchists to both houses of parliament.
Fortunately for Republicans, the senior Bourbon claimant wanted to demand the full restoration
in a certain sense, he wouldn't accept the tricolor flag of the revolution, he wanted
the Bourbon flag, he wanted to reign as well as to rule and monarchists had to buy at his
time until he would die and the Orlanist claimant might soon get his chance and he was somewhat
more liberal so what the monarchists basically wanted to do is sit on the egg until they
could get their opportunity, however history moved forward.
By 1876, the Republicans had come to control the lower chamber of deputies as a result
of elections and at that point the monarchists fearing they would totally lose the opportunity
attempted a coup d'etat in May of 1877 known as the CÃ©sar May crisis, the 16th of May
crisis only to be bested by the aroused Republicans who campaigned together during the elections
despite rigging of elections and who soon came to control the upper house the senate as well.
They then began to introduce pieces of legislation that forced the monarchist president General
Ma'aul, he had helped lose the war of 1871 to resign in 1879 as he said, if I signed those
bills my children wouldn't kiss me.
Between 1879 and 1885 in a brief but productive stabilizing era the Republicans consolidated
their gains, attempted to heal some of the wounds from the Commune and also attempted
to punish or at least to emasculate their perceived enemies.
In 1880 Paris was made the capital of France, how about it?
Communards were amnestyed, July the 14th Bastille Day made a national holiday.
The Marseillaises made the national anthem, in other words the France that we know of
as being France became France and a series of wider civil liberties were enacted including
greater freedom of the press, more latitude for unions and local government reform.
