Simply by way of contrast, the war in Russia saw the increasingly personalized rule of
Tsar Nicholas II, increasingly influenced by his wife Alexandra, herself increasingly
under the control of faith healer Grigori Rasputin.
Rasputin's drawn out murder by a group of aristocratic monarchists loyal to the regime
in December of 1916 was a kind of forecast for the collapse of the Tsarist regime several
months later in March.
Things were so bad, with the Kaiser taking charge on the war front and the Tsarina behind
that these aristocrats realized it was get rid of Rasputin or the regime is going to
collapse and they should have done it years before.
Coming to Craig's second category, economic regimentation.
With respect to economic regimentation, Britain and France and Germany all saw a radical expansion
of government control over the economy, including some increased taxation, not enough, price
controls, rationing, constraints on unions, again we're thinking about the Jacobin period
in the French Revolution, this is a radicalization of all of that, made possible by a total revolution
in technology, transportation, communication, everything before the computers.
Significant however, were the appointments of munitions Tsars, socialist Albert Thomas
in France played the role of a very very effective munitions Tsar in France, liberal cabinet
member David Lloyd George in Britain before he became prime minister was munitions Tsar,
eminent Jewish industrialist, Walter Ratinal in Germany was munitions Tsar, I can still
remember the wonderful lecture that Professor Robert Kahn of the Enise Emigre to the United
States in the late 1930 gave on Walter Ratinal who was an economist and industrialist but
also a philosopher, not one with great humility, he was once asked who were the three greatest
people in world history and he replied Christ, Moses, and modesty forbids me from giving
you the third name, in 1922 Ratinal having really done as much to keep Germany in the
war as any other single individual, including the generals, in 1922 Ratinal became foreign
minister against the extreme wishes of his mother because it was a precarious circumstance
only to be shortly thereafter assassinated by right wing extremists with the cry, kill,
kill Ratinal, the goddamn Jewish sal and this is another metaphor of the radicalization
that took place during and after World War One.
In one form or another all three of these countries developed boards or departments that effectively
coordinated the production of munitions and other essential materials working with industrialists,
working with labor, enabling their countries to stay in the war.
Given the relatively effective Allied blockade which was easily as effective and then later
more so even than the German submarines of the land bound central powers, Ratinal's tasks
were the most difficult although superior German industrial and scientific capacity including
its first rate research universities accomplished miracles during the war.
Not only did Germany have to make up for the deficit it suffered compared with the power
of the British and the French empires and that's where empire counted but the United
States was not really quote-unquote neutral economically even before entering the war
because our trade expanded 10 times more with the Allied powers with Britain and France
than with the central powers including Germany.
Although falling between the stools of economic and political categories in December 1916
Germany actually passed a law that required either military or economic service from all
men between the ages of 16 and 65.
You could be drafted into some form of service.
This surely demonstrates not only the increased power of the state obviously but the willingness
of most Germans to defend their homeland to the hilt.
