I'd like to continue our discussion of math fundamentals today by taking a look at percents,
decimals, and fractions.
In all my years of teaching, I've noticed that many students struggle with converting
between percents, decimals, and fractions.
But it isn't something to worry about.
I'd like you to think of it this way.
It's about seeing things from different angles.
For example, you might watch the same movie at a theater and then on your laptop and maybe
later on a television.
It's the same movie, but a different experience because you're seeing it in different perspectives.
The same is true of percents, decimals, and fractions.
It's the same math information, but in different forms.
So today, let's take some time to refresh our memories on this important topic.
First, before we get to the actual mathematics, let me take a moment to talk about why this
topic is so important.
I want you to think about some examples in real life where percents, decimals, and fractions
arise.
For example, when you have to look at sales tax or similar taxes, they're often computed
as a percentage of the amount spent.
Or let's say you're saving for a new kind of cell phone and after months of working
a part-time job, you come up with the exact dollar amount for the phone.
You walk into the store with your money, you pick out the phone of your dreams, and you
find out that you need $18.34 more cents because of the sales tax on top of the cost.
Well, tips to waiters and waitresses at restaurants are given as a percent as well.
Sometimes 15%, 18%, 20%.
So being able to calculate or at least estimate these kinds of percentages is very important.
A lot of high school and college students earn their living waiting tables.
So you may be in a situation where you want to know what you could be earning.
Also, if you start off as a busboy or a dishwasher, you'll be getting about 5% of everyone's tips.
You'd need to know how to figure that out to set your fair share.
Lots of statistics are given as either percents, decimals, or fractions as well.
73% of the people surveyed said this or four-fifths of the dentist in the U.S. say, or the paper
pictures earned run averages 1.632.
So we need to be able to translate between percents, decimals, and fractions in order
to make sense of this kind of information.
Well let's get to the nuts and bolts of converting these three types of numerical representations
now.
Let's start with percents.
The word percent actually comes from a Latin phrase percentum, which means by the hundred.
So think of the word century, for example, which also starts with C-E-N-T, and it means
100.
In the case of century, it's 100 years.
So in a nutshell, a percent is just telling us what part of a hundred is represented.
For example, 75% means 75 per 100.
So if you put it as a fraction, it's 75 divided by 100.
You can read the line per if it makes better sense, but you can also think of it as division,
75 divided by 100.
Converting from percents to fractions is pretty straightforward, at least for some basic cases.
So what I'd like to do now is move into some examples where we convert percents to a fraction.
The process of converting from percents to fractions is this.
You use the percent amount that's given to you as the numerator or the top number of
your fraction, and then the denominator of your fraction is always 100.
Once you have your fraction written down, numerator over denominator, you simplify the
fraction if possible, and you're done.
So with these steps in mind, let's go to the following example.
Let's convert 25% to a fraction.
Well given the rule I just shared with you a moment ago, you're going to use the 25 as
the numerator of the fraction that you're going to get, and the denominator is going
to be 100.
Remember, the denominator is always going to be 100 when you convert from a percent
to a fraction.
So you have the fraction now, 25 over 100.
You could stop there, but you don't really want to stop there because you should always
reduce your fractions when you can.
So let's do that now with 25 over 100.
Notice for example that 25 has a factor of 5 in it, and 100 has a factor of 5 in it.
So you can factor the 25 as 5 times 5, and you can factor the 100 as 20 times 5, and
you can cancel one of the 5's from the top with one of the 5's from the bottom.
That's going to leave you with the fraction 5 over 20.
Now you could stop there, but again you're not in completely reduced form.
Notice that 5 also divides 20.
20 is equal to 5 times 4, and of course the numerator can be written as 5 times 1.
So you can cancel another 5 now from both the numerator and the denominator.
Once you've done that, you're going to be left with 1 over 4, and that means that the
percent 25 percent equals 1 fourth.
There you go.
You've just converted a percent to a fraction.
So let's look at a second example now where we convert a percent to a fraction.
Let's convert 40 percent to a fraction.
So the 40 has been given to us as a percent, and now we want to write it as a fraction.
Well, the rule says we take that 40 from the percent, and we make that the numerator of
our fraction, and what's the denominator?
It's always 100.
Now you now have the fraction 40 over 100.
Now some folks, when they see a fraction like that, will very quickly cancel the zero on
top or in the numerator with the last zero in the denominator, and that will give them
4 over 10.
That's actually correct mathematically, but I'd like to make sure we understand why that's
correct.
So let me walk you through why 40 over 100 is actually 4 tenths.
Well, 40 has a 10 in it, obviously, and 40 equals 4 times 10.
100 also has a 10 in it, and that's equal to 10 times 10.
Now notice the factor of 10 in both the numerator as well as the denominator.
Those two factors of 10, the one in the numerator, the one in the denominator, can be canceled.
What does that leave you?
It leaves you a 4 on top and a 10 on the bottom.
And that's why 40 over 100 equals 4 tenths.
Now we can stop there, but again, that fraction is not reduced.
First of all, I see that the 4 is even, and the 10 is even.
That means they both have a 2 as a factor, and therefore I want to factor a 2 out.
So 4 is 2 times 2, and 10 is 5 times 2.
And now I see the common 2s.
I cancel them out of the numerator and the denominator, and what am I left with?
2 over 5, 2 fifths.
2 fifths is reduced.
I can't cancel anything more, and so I know my final answer.
40% equals 2 fifths.
I'd like to look at one more example of converting a percent to a fraction.
And this example I actually do very importantly because I think students struggle with single
digit percentages, like 5%.
But if we follow the process that I've laid out for you, we'll be fine.
So here we go.
5% converted to a fraction means I take my numerator and make it 5.
That's exactly what the rule tells me, and the denominator has to be 100.
Again, that's exactly what the rule says.
If I follow the rules of mathematics, it'll all work out.
Now 5 over 100, is that in reduced form?
Well, not exactly, because 100 has a factor of 5 in it, and of course the numerator is
5.
So I need to factor out the 5 from the 100, and that's equal to 20 times 5.
And so here's what I have.
I have 5 times 1 on top.
I have 20 times 5 on the bottom.
I can cancel those 5s.
And when I do, I'm left with 1 divided by 20.
And of course that's in reduced form because of the 1 in the numerator.
And therefore, 5% is exactly 1 over 20.
Now some students will actually tell me, well, 5% they think is 1 half instead of 1 over
20.
And that's because they'll incorrectly write 5 over 10 instead of 5 over 100 in replacement
of 5%.
The key here is not to write 5 tenths, but to write 5 one hundredths, because that is
the process we were given.
As long as we follow that process, we won't make a mistake.
I want to look at one last example now of converting a percent to a fraction.
I think it's very important to see an example like this.
And I want us to make sure we follow our process.
So here it is.
I want to convert 100% to a fraction.
OK, now a percentage with three digits like that, a 100, that sometimes throws people
off.
Don't fret over it.
Let's just do what we're told to do with our process.
So here we go.
We take the number we were given in the percentage, that was 100.
We make that our numerator.
We then make our denominator 100, always 100.
That's the rule.
And so we have the fraction 100 divided by 100.
Of course, a fraction where the numerator and the denominator are exactly the same is
exactly 1.
In essence, I can cancel the 100s from the top and the bottom, and I'm left with 1.
So in this case, the fraction that I have left is 1.
If you want to see it as a fraction, you could write it as 1 over 1, but ultimately it's
just 1.
So 100% is exactly 1.
Let's talk about converting percentages to decimals now for just a moment.
This is actually even more straightforward than the process for converting percentages
to fractions.
So here's the rule now for converting a percent to a decimal.
You're going to take the percent amount that was given to you in the problem, and you want
to move the decimal point two places to the left and then remove or erase the percent
sign.
That's the whole rule.
So with that in mind, let's move to an example.
I'd like to convert 25% to a decimal number.
And the key here is to recognize where the decimal point is, given that it's not actually
in the original problem.
If you look at that problem carefully, you won't see a decimal point inside 25%.
Of course, where is the decimal point?
It's right after the 5.
So in order to follow my rule, 25% becomes 0.25, and the percent sign gets moved away.
Why is it 0.25?
As I started with the decimal point on the right of the 5, I moved it one place between
the 2 and the 5, and then a second place in front of the 2.
And by moving it in those two ways to the left, I convert 25% to 0.25.
So the decimal equivalent of 25% is 0.25.
Let's look at a second example of converting a percent to a decimal, which has a little
bit of complication to it, but we'll follow our rule and everything will be fine.
I want us to convert 8% to a decimal.
Now the complication here, which isn't too bad, is that 8% is just a single digit, 8.
There aren't two digits there like there was with 25%.
So the question is, where does the decimal point go when I do this conversion from percents
to decimals?
OK.
In 8%, the decimal is just to the right of the 8.
I now need to move it two decimal places to the left.
Well, I start that process.
I move the decimal place over once just in front of the 8, and now where does the decimal
point go if I need to move it a second time?
Well, the answer is I could have put a 0 in front of the 8.
That would have been perfectly legal.
And when I put that 0 in front of the 8, it gives the decimal point a second place to
go, if you will, once it's moved to the left.
And that means that 8% is equal to 0.08.
Remember that extra 0 to the left of the 8 is perfectly legal.
Now you might have thought the answer was going to be 0.8 when I started that example
of converting 8% to a decimal.
But if you think about the rule that we were given, we were told that we had to move the
decimal point two places to the left.
And of course, 0.8 just moves the decimal place one place.
And therefore, 8%, which is 8% or 8 out of 100, has to be 0.08.
Remember 0.08 is 800s.
And that's why that 8 needs to be in the 100th place.
So 8% is 0.08.
Keep in mind that 80% is 0.8.
Let's do another example now of converting a percent to a decimal.
And this time we'll go from having just one digit in the percent to having three digits
in the percent.
So here's the example.
Let's convert 243% to a decimal.
Now first of all, don't be thrown off by the fact that 243 is bigger than 100.
For some students, it feels a bit unnatural to have a percent larger than 100, but it
can happen.
For example, if you scored, say, 30 on your first algebra test, and then you scored 90
on your next algebra test, then the percentage increase in your course grade would actually
be bigger than 100%.
So it really is OK to have a percent bigger than 100.
Doesn't happen as often as you see other percents, but it does happen.
So I want us to get comfortable with that idea.
Now, back to the problem we were doing, 243% converted to a decimal.
Well, where's the decimal point in 243%?
It's just to the right of the three, just after the three.
So when you get ready to move your decimal point, you're going to move it one to the
left between the four and the three, and then once more to the left between the two and
the four, and that's moving your decimal place two places to the left.
What does that give us?
2.43.
So 243 as a percent, 243% is exactly 2.43.
OK, let's look at a quick word problem that involves percentages and decimals as well.
Let's say Michael takes the astronomy club, which has 10 people in it, to lunch one day.
Because of the size of their group, their tip percentage is required to be at least 18%.
If the total bill for the food was $120, what does Michael have to pay as the tip?
Well, the first thing to do is to convert 18% to a decimal, or a fraction, but I'm going
to do it as a decimal right now because that's actually easier to work with.
So let's start by converting 18% to a decimal.
Well, the first thing I have to do is take my decimal point and move it two places to
the left.
When I do that, 18% becomes 0.18.
OK, that's nice enough, but now what?
Well the tip would have to be 18% of 120.
Here's a question, what does the word of usually mean in word problems?
Well, the answer is, and it's going to be the answer almost the whole way through this course,
is that of means multiplication.
So what Michael has to do is multiply the $120 for the bill by 18%, which is the same
as multiplying 120 times 0.18.
Well that just leads us to a multiplication problem, which is going to need a few steps,
but we can walk through it pretty straightforwardly.
Let me do it with you this time, 120 times 0.18.
We're going to start with the 8, start on our right of that number, and we're going
to multiply the 8 into the 120, and that's going to give us 960.
Now we move away from that 8 and we move to the 1 that's in front of the 8.
When we do that, we have to remember that whatever we write down next below the 960
needs to be shifted to the left by one digit.
Now we multiply that 1 into the 120 or multiply it with the 120, and of course 120 times 1
is 120.
That 120 goes below the 960, but again shifted one unit to the left.
Of course multiplying by the 0 in front of the 0.18 does nothing.
So we're done with the multiplication part, and now we need to add the 960 and the 120,
which have been put in the appropriate columns.
When we do that we're going to get 2160.
Now don't lose this point.
The tip can't be $2,160.
The meal was only $120.
It doesn't make sense for the tip to be that large.
So what happened?
Well, we have to find where our decimal point goes.
Notice that the decimal point in 0.18 was 2 to the left.
And therefore in 2160 we need to move the decimal place over 2 to the left as well.
And in the process instead of $2,160 we're just going to have $21.60, and that makes
a lot better sense for a meal of $120.
Well let's shift gears a bit and talk about conversions between fractions and decimals.
First, the conversion from fractions to decimals is relatively straightforward.
You simply have to do long division by dividing the denominator into the numerator.
That's what I meant earlier when I said you can also read the fraction bar as a division
line.
So let's do the following example.
Let's convert 3 fourths to a decimal number.
Well, I just want to divide the 4 into the 3.
So I start by writing down a division symbol.
I'm going to write the 4 on the outside of it.
I'm going to put the 3 inside that division symbol.
And now I have to do something very important, which we really should do right now.
Once we've written in the 3 and the 4, we should explicitly note where the decimal point
is after that 3.
We write that in, and then we're actually allowed to add a few zeros after that.
3 is the same as 3.00 in this example.
So now what I should have is my division symbol.
I should have 4 written on the outside and something like 3.00, or maybe even 3.000 on
the inside of that division symbol.
Once I've done that, I want to now write the decimal point above that division symbol,
lining up with the decimal point inside the 3.00.
That's where the decimal point is going to be in my final answer.
So now I have a lone decimal point, if you will, by itself on top of my division symbol.
But that's very important.
It acts like an anchor almost to tell me where my answer is going to be.
That alignment of those two decimal points is critical.
We can't be careless with where we put that decimal point.
Now at this point, we can basically just divide as usual, divide the 4 into the 3.
Of course, 4 does not go into 3, 3 is too small.
So now we ask, can 4 go into 30?
Yes, 4 goes into 37 times, 7 times 4 is 28, 30 minus 28 is 2.
And now we drop the other 0 and make that 2 into a 20, 4 goes into 25 times.
And that means our answer is 0.75.
So 3 fourths is 0.75.
By the way, why did we stop with the 0.75?
Why didn't we go on?
Well, because the remainders were all 0 after that.
And it would have just been a waste of time to keep dividing 4 into 0.
So 3 fourths is 0.75.
Let's try a second example where we convert a fraction to a decimal number.
Let's convert 22 divided by 5, 22 over 5 to a decimal number.
Well, let's do the same process we did earlier.
We're going to take our division symbol, we're going to write the 5 on the outside, we're
going to write the 22 on the inside or underneath as some people like to say.
And I'm again going to put my decimal point at the end of the 22 and then I'm going to
add some 0's to the right.
And 22 is the same as 22.0, it's the same as 22.00, and so on.
There's no need to write 10 or 12 0's at the end, a couple will probably do here.
Once I have that decimal point 22.00, I make sure I write that decimal point above the
division symbol as well, vertically aligning them.
And now I start the division.
5 goes into 22, exactly 4 times, 5 times 4 is 20, and then 22 minus 20 is exactly 2.
I then drop another 0 and 5 goes into that 20 now, exactly 4 times.
No more remainder.
And therefore my answer is going to be 4.4.
Let me point out that I needed that answer to be 4.4 and not 44 or 0.44.
And the only way to ensure that that answer was right was to make sure my decimal points
lined up in the appropriate way from the beginning.
Make sure you're careful about where you put those decimal points when you do those conversions.
Now with that said, I want to show you another example of converting a fraction to a decimal
number.
This time I want to convert 2 thirds to a decimal number.
So we're going to walk through the same process again using 2 thirds as my fraction.
I'm going to draw my division symbol.
The 3 goes on the outside because it's the denominator.
The 2 goes on the inside or underneath the division symbol.
I'm going to write my decimal point after the 2.
I'm going to then write the decimal point just above that, above the division symbol.
Now let's start the division.
3 goes into 2, no times, 3 goes into 20, 6 times, 6 times 3 is 18, 20 minus 18 is 2.
I then drop a 0 and now I'm putting 3 into 20 again.
Of course, 3 goes into 20, 6 times again, 6 times 3 is 18, 20 minus 18 is 2, I drop
another 0.
3 goes into 20 again.
Oh my word, I'm caught in a vicious cycle.
I can't get out of this.
I just keep getting 6 after 6 after 6 after 6.
It turns out that that's actually correct though because the decimal equivalent of 2
thirds is 0.66666 repeating forever.
Some people would say it's just 0.6 repeating.
This is an example of an infinite repeating decimal number.
These it's written as 0.6 with a little bar over the 6 and that bar over the 6 means
that you just repeat the 6 over and over again.
So in fact, the conversion of 2 thirds to a decimal is exactly 0.6 with a bar over it
or 0.66666, etc.
You might say, well, why couldn't we just replace that 0.6 with a bar over the 6 with
something like 0.7?
I know about rounding.
Why isn't 2 thirds just 0.67?
Well 2 thirds is close to 0.67, but it's not equal to 0.67.
If you want equality, then you have to write 2 thirds equals 0.66666 forever.
And that's the only way you can get an equals.
Okay, what if we wanted to convert a decimal number to a fraction, which is the opposite
process of what we wanted to do before?
Well, let's do a few examples to demonstrate.
Let's convert 0.42 to a fraction in reduced terms.
Well, 0.42 is the same as 42 hundredths because the 2 is in the hundredths place.
Remember, tenths and hundreds and thousands and so on to the right of the decimal point.
So that means that 0.42 is the same as 42 divided by 100 or 42 hundredths.
Well, what that means is the conversion of 0.42 into a fraction must give us 42 over
100.
If we simplify 42 over 100 a bit, we'll actually get our answer.
Notice that 42 is even and 100 is even, so they must both have a 2 in them.
And if you divide out the 2 from 42 and divide out the 2 from 100, you'll be left with the
fraction 21 over 50.
And that's the answer, 0.42 equals 21 over 50.
Let's convert another decimal.
How about something like 5.6 to a fraction in reduced terms?
So let's begin by focusing our attention on the 0.6.
Notice that 0.6 is the same as 6 tenths because the 6 is in the tenths place.
And that means 0.6 is 6 tenths.
Then I can write 5.6 as 5 and 6 tenths as a mixed number.
And of course, 6 tenths is the same as 3 fifths.
So 5.6 is the same as 5 and 3 fifths, and that's the conversion, simple as that.
Now that mixed number could be written in another way, but for now I think we're going
to leave it there.
Then you might be thinking, how do I go from a fraction to a percent?
That's a great question, actually.
Well, in fact, it turns out you can do it pretty straightforwardly in two steps.
First, you take your fraction to a decimal.
We've talked about that earlier in the lesson.
And then you take that decimal to a percent.
And once you've done those two steps, you've taken your fraction to a percent.
Well, I know this review has been very brief, and I hope that it has reminded you of the
various procedures for converting between percents, decimals, and fractions.
The problems in your course guidebook will give you additional opportunity to perform
such conversions.
Throughout this course, you're going to have to do these kinds of things, so you'll want
to make sure you practice now.
This time we'll talk about variables and how to translate from word problems to algebraic
expressions.
