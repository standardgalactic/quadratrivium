Summary: We investigate the lateral van der Waals (vdW) force between an anisotropic polarizable
particle and a perfectly conducting plane with a hemispherical protuberance with radius R. We predict,
via an exact calculation, a sign inversion in the lateral vdW force, in the sense that, instead of pointing
to the protuberance, in certain situations this force points to the opposite direction. In the literature,
predictions of sign inversions in the lateral vdW force were based on perturbative solutions, valid when
the height of the protuberance is very small when compared to the distance z0 between the particle and
the plane. Here, taking into account exact formulas, we investigate how such nontrivial geometric eﬀect
depends on the ratio R/z0, and how the particle orientation and anisotropy aﬀect this sign inversion.
