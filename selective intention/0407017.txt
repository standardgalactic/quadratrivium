We propose the scheme implementing partial deterministic non-demolition Bell measurement.
When it is used in quantum teleportation the information about an unknown input state is optimally
distributed among three outgoing qubits. The optimality means that the output ﬁdelities saturate
the asymmetric cloning inequality. The ﬂow of information among the qubits is controlled by the
It is also demonstrated
preparation of a pair of ancillary qubits used in the Bell measurement.
that the measurement is optimal two-qubit operation in the sense of the trade-oﬀ between the state
disturbance and the information gain.

Quantum entanglement makes it possible to solve some
quantum communication tasks better. This situation is
encountered for instance in the teleportation of quantum
states. In this task, one party called Alice, is requested
to transmit an unknown pure state
A of a qubit A to
i
the second party called Bob without sending the qubit
itself. There are two ways how she can accomplish the
task. First, she can perform an optimal measurement on
the state and send the results to Bob. After receiving the
classical information from Alice Bob is able to estimate
the input state on another qubit B. Such a protocol,
sometimes called classical teleportation, however allows
Alice to transmit the input state only approximately. Us-
ing the mean ﬁdelity as a characterization of the quality
of the transfer the ﬁdelity FB of Bob’s estimated state
can be at most FB = 2/3 [1]. In addition, the measure-
ment on Alice’s side disturbs the original qubit A in such
a way that it does not carry any further information on
the input state and therefore the mean ﬁdelity of Alice’s
output state FA cannot exceed FA = 2/3 [2]. In what fol-
lows we denote the ﬁdelities FA and FB as operation and
teleportation ﬁdelity, respectively. It is possible to con-
sider a more general classical teleportation in which the
information on the input state
A is distributed asym-
i
metrically between the qubits A and B. This regime is
achieved if Alice performs less demolishing measurement
after which her qubit carries more information on the in-
put state and therefore FA > 2/3 while she gains less
information and therefore FB < 2/3. Quantum mechan-
ics imposes a fundamental constraint on the ﬁdelities FA
and FB in the partial classical teleportation (PCT) in the
form of the following inequality [2]:

quantum teleportation [3].
In this protocol, Alice and
Bob share a maximally entangled state of two qubits a
and B. Alice then performs a speciﬁc joint measure-
ment, called Bell measurement, on the input qubit A
whose state is to be transferred and on a qubit a. As
a result, Bob’s qubit B collapses into the state that can
be brought into the original state by an appropriate uni-
tary transformation. Thus, at the output of the quantum
teleportation the qubit B carries a perfect replica of the
original state and therefore the teleportation ﬁdelity is
FB = 1 while the qubit A has to carry no information
on the input state and therefore the operation ﬁdelity is
FA = 1/2.

Obviously, Bell measurement is the crucial ingredient
of quantum teleportation. This is the two-qubit projec-
tion measurement discriminating perfectly among four
orthogonal maximally entangled Bell states. Motivated
by the classical partial teleportation we can think about
a partial non-demolition Bell measurement that discrim-
inates only partially among the Bell states and simul-
taneously preserves all Bell states. Such a measurement

 
 
 
 
(cid:13)
(cid:13)
would realize just a partial quantum teleportation (PQT)
of an unknown input state onto qubit B while preserving
some information on the state in the input qubit A. In
addition, in the PQT one can expect a larger teleporta-
tion ﬁdelity FB for a given operation ﬁdelity FA than in
the PCT. Also for PQT quantum mechanics sets a non-
trivial bound between the ﬁdelities FA and FB in the
form of the cloning inequality [4]

where the equality corresponds to an optimal PQT in
the sense that a larger teleportation ﬁdelity FB cannot
be obtained for a given operation ﬁdelity FA. The bound
for the ﬁdelities is again given by the fragment of the el-
lipse (2) depicted by the solid curve in Fig. 1. The Fig. 1
reveals that the PQT really provides a larger teleporta-
tion ﬁdelity FB for a given operation ﬁdelity FA than the
PCT.

In this article we construct such a partial non-
demolition Bell measurement (PNBM) for qubits that al-
lows optimal PQT. The measurement rests on the scheme
for complete non-demolition Bell measurement proposed
in [5]. The novel point is that two qubits used as ancillas
in the measurement are prepared in a speciﬁc partially
entangled state depending on a single parameter whose
change allows to continuously control the degree of dis-
crimination of the Bell states. Further we show, that the
PNBM is also an optimal two-qubit operation providing

Note, that the PQT diﬀers from the telecloning or
cloning “at a distance” [6] as it realizes rather the “non-
local” cloning as the qubits carrying the information on
the input state emerge at diﬀerent possibly distant loca-
tions. Recently, a conditional scheme realizing optimal
PQT was proposed in [7] based on the partial discrimi-
nation of a singlet state the degree of which being con-
trolled by the splitting ratio of the beam splitter used for
the discrimination. Here, we concentrate on the deter-
ministic scheme. The performance of our scheme relies
on the measurement discriminating partially among all
four Bell states. In our scheme, the degree of discrimina-
tion is controlled by the preparation of the pair of qubits
used as ancillas in the measurement.

The paper is structured as follows.

In Section I a
PNBM for qubits is designed and an optimal PQT pro-
tocol is constructed. Section II contains interpretation
of the PNBM. Section III deals with continuous-variable
(CV) partial teleportation of coherent states. Section IV
contains conclusion.

Alice can perform the task via the teleportation scheme
depicted in Fig. 2. For this purpose she needs four CNOT
gates, four Hadamard gates, a pair of properly prepared
auxiliary qubits and a shared entangled state. Initially,
Alice and Bob share a pair of qubits a and B prepared in

perfectly discriminates among the Bell states, the input

i. e. for partially entangled ancillary qubits when PNBM
discriminates partially among the Bell states, the state

possibilities the probability amplitudes of which being
controlled by the choice of the parameter α in the state
(4). In other words, this intermediate case corresponds
to the partial teleportation of the qubit A. In what fol-
lows we show that the quantum teleportation scheme is
optimal in the sense of the inequality (2).

Since the inequality (2) becomes equality for the lat-

Viewed from the point of view of quantum cloning, our
scheme realizes a measurement induced and entangle-

tum cloning machine [4]. In particular, if the superposi-
tion in the state (4) is balanced with α = β = 1/√3, then
the information is distributed symmetrically between the
qubits A and B with the ﬁdelities FA = FB = 5/6. In
the language of quantum cloning this regime corresponds
to an optimal symmetric universal quantum cloning [8].
Moreover, the third qubit a leaves the teleportation in
the state ρa for which the ﬁdelity Fa⊥ = a

fore, our scheme also realizes deterministically the opti-

INTERPRETATION OF THE PARTIAL BELL

MEASUREMENT

As it was already mentioned the standard Bell mea-
surement is a projection measurement on a system of
two qubits A and a discriminating perfectly among four
orthogonal Bell states. Consequently, the measurement

6
6
F

provides maximum information on an unknown pure two-
qubit state and therefore the mean ﬁdelity of the esti-
B = 2/5 [10] while disturbing the input
mated state is
state in such a way that it does not carry any more in-
formation on the state and therefore the mean ﬁdelity of
the output state is also
A = 2/5 [2]. On the other hand,
the partial Bell measurement considered in the preced-
ing section discriminates among the Bell states only par-
tially thus providing less information on the input state
of qubits A and a while preserving larger information in
the outgoing qubits. As the degree of the Bell state dis-
crimination can be controlled by the parameter α in the
ancillary state (4), one can increase continuously the in-
formation gain at the expense of a larger disturbance of
the measured system.

F

To express this behaviour quantitatively let us as-
sume the ancillary qubits 1 and 2 to be again pre-
pared in the state (4). For such a state the measure-
ment scheme in the dashed box in Fig. 2 realizes a two-
qubit quantum operation on qubits A and a described
by the set of four operators Ak, k = 1, 2, . . . , 4 where
we have identiﬁed the indices 1, 2, 3 and 4 with the mea-
surement outcomes 00, 01, 10 and 11. In the Bell basis

A4 = diag(β/2, β/2, β/2, α + β/2).

Consequently, the PNBM preserves the Bell states and
therefore it really realizes a non-demolition measurement
of these states. Further, the operators (9) satisfy the
i=1 A†
i Ai = 11 due to the nor-
completeness relation
malization condition α2 + αβ + β2 = 1 and hence the
PNBM performs partial discrimination of the Bell states
deterministically. Restricting ourselves to pure two-qubit
input states, the information gain in the PNBM can be
characterized by the mean estimation ﬁdelity
B while
the disturbance of the state caused by the measurement
can be characterized by the mean operation ﬁdelity
A
[2]. The ﬁdelities can be calculated from the formulas [2]

saturate the inequality. Hence, the PNBM is an opti-
mal two-qubit quantum operation in the sense that for a
given operation ﬁdelity

cannot be obtained. Therefore, the measurement allows
an optimal PCT of two-qubit states. Moreover, as the
same optimal distribution of information can be achieved
in quantum teleportation with nonmaximally entangled
states [2], our scheme represents a local counterpart to
the quantum teleportation based on nonmaximally en-
tangled states.

III. PARTIAL TELEPORTATION FOR
CONTINUOUS VARIABLES

Let us now study the extension of the optimal PQT to
continuous-variables (CVs). In this case the ﬁve relevant
qubits are replaced with the ﬁve modes of electromag-
netic ﬁeld described by the quadrature operators xi, pi,
i = A, B, a, 1, 2 with the commutators [xj, pk] = iδjk.
The state of the mode A that is to be teleported is an
unknown coherent state
A. For CVs the optimal PQT
α
i
means that after the teleportation Alice and Bob hold im-
perfect copies ρA and ρB, respectively, of the original co-
i,

where γ is the asymmetry parameter [11].

The CV extension of the qubit protocol presented in
Sec. I is as follows.
Initially, Alice and Bob share a

duced in the non-degenerate optical parametric ampliﬁer

where λ = tanh r, r is the squeezing parameter. Alice
then performs the CV partial non-demolition Bell mea-
surement on the mode A whose state is to be teleported
and on the mode a of the NOPA state. Recently, the
measurement was used for partial reversion of the CV
cloning [12]. The measurement exploits two ancillary vac-
uum modes 1, 2 and a sequence of four CV CNOT gates
followed by the homodyne detections of the x quadrature
on mode 1 and p quadrature on mode 2 [12]. The CNOT
gates are realized by the quantum non-demolition (QND)

ﬁdelity FB is reduced in comparison with the optimal
value (12) due to the ﬁniteness of the shared entangle-
ment. Therefore, in contrast with the qubit protocol our
CV teleportation scheme realizes only approximately op-
timal PQT of coherent states. The teleportation ﬁdelity
FB can approach the optimum (12) arbitrarily closely
if suﬃciently large CV entanglement (suﬃciently large
squeezing r) is available.

The ﬁdelities FA and FB between the input coherent
state and the output states ρA and ρB can be calculated
from the formula Fi = 1/(1 +

In conclusion, we have explicitly constructed a joint
two-qubit non-demolition measurement allowing to par-
tially deterministically discriminate among all Bell
states. Moreover, this partial non-demolition Bell mea-
surement allows to continuously control the degree of the
discrimination by the preparation of the state of ancilla.
We have then proposed the teleportation scheme based
on the partial Bell measurement making it possible to
continuously control the ﬂow of information between the
output qubits and it was proved that such a distribution
of information is optimal in the sense that the teleporta-
tion and operation ﬁdelity saturate the cloning inequality
(2). Further, the measurement was shown to be optimal
two-qubit quantum operation from the point of view of
the trade-oﬀ between the gain of information and the
state disturbance. Analogic partial non-demolition Bell
measurement can be constructed for CVs. However, in
contrast with qubits the CV partial quantum teleporta-
tion based on the measurement does not distribute the
information optimally while the optimum is approached
with increasing shared entanglement.
