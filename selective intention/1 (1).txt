The  aim  of  Synthese  Library  is  to  provide  a  forum  for  the  best  current  work  in  the 
methodology  and  philosophy  of  science  and  in  epistemology,  all  broadly  under-
stood.  A  wide  variety  of  different  approaches  have  traditionally  been  represented  in 
the  Library,  and  every  effort  is  made  to  maintain  this  variety,  not  for  its  own  sake,  but 
because  we  believe  that  there  are  many  fruitful  and  illuminating  approaches  to  the 
philosophy  of  science  and  related  disciplines. 

Special  attention  is  paid  to  methodological  studies  which  illustrate  the  interplay  of 
empirical  and  philosophical  viewpoints  and  to  contributions  to  the  formal  (logical, 
set-theoretical,  mathematical, 
information-theoretical,  decision-theoretical,  etc.) 
methodology  of  empirical  sciences.  Likewise,  the  applications  of  logical  methods 
to  epistemology  as  well  as  philosophically  and  methodologically  relevant  studies  in 
logic  are  strongly  encouraged.  The  emphasis  on  logic  will  be  tempered  by  interest  in 
the  psychological,  historical,  and  sociological  aspects  of  science.  In  addition  to 
monographs  Synthese  Library  publishes  thematically  uniﬁed  anthologies  and  edited 
volumes  with  a  well-deﬁned  topical  focus  inside  the  aim  and  scope  of  the  book 
series.  The  contributions  in  the  volumes  are  expected  to  be  focused  and  structurally 
organized  in  accordance  with  the  central  theme(s),  and  should  be  tied  together  by  an 
extensive  editorial  introduction  or  set  of  introductions  if  the  volume  is  divided  into 
parts.  An  extensive  bibliography  and  index  are  mandatory.
