Abstract. The assumptions required for the derivation of Bell
inequalities are
not satisﬁed for random ﬁeld models in which there are any thermal or quantum
ﬂuctuations, in contrast to the general satisfaction of the assumptions for classical two
point particle models. Classical random ﬁeld models that explicitly include the eﬀects
of quantum ﬂuctuations on measurement are possible for experiments that violate Bell
inequalities.

1. Introduction

RA and

Bell [1, Chap. 7, originally 1976] shows that from a deﬁnition of local causality, we can
derive Bell inequalities for observable statistics associated with two space-like separated
regions
RB (see ﬁgure 1), and that quantum theory does not satisfy the same
inequalities. Bell’s derivation uses the language of “beables”, but the mathematics
requires only that random variables are associated with regions of space-time, prompting
us here to introduce random ﬁelds to remove the niceties of Bell’s concept of “beables”.
Bell introduces a distinction between ﬁelds that are “really supposed to be there”, the
“beable” ﬁelds, and ﬁelds that are not real, which is an ontological distinction that
is downplayed here (see Appendix A for a brief account of “beables”, including Bell’s
examples of ﬁelds that are and are not “beables”).

Almost all experiments that investigate physics at a small scale require the collection
of statistics; it is barely possible otherwise to identify any regularities. The mathematical
tool that we use as an idealization of statistics is the random variable. At its most
general, any indexed set of random variables is a random ﬁeld, but in the context of
physical descriptions that are placed in space-time, the simplest index set is a lattice of
points (see, for example, Vanmarcke [2]). This paper will focus, however, on continuous
random ﬁelds (see Appendix B and, for example, Rozanov [3]), for which the index set
is the Schwartz space of functions on Minkowski space. A continuous random ﬁeld can
be understood as a random variable-valued distribution. We will focus on continuous
random ﬁelds because they are very closely parallel to the operator-valued distributions
of quantum ﬁeld theory (see, for example, Haag [4, Chap. II]).

requirement is unreasonable, Bell calls it a “conspiracy” [1, Chap. 12, p. 103]. Bell’s
argument and Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s comments are brought together in a review
article by d’Espagnat [6].

The violation of Bell inequalities by experiment has imposed a moratorium on
the construction of classical models, because it is generally acknowledged that the
assumptions required to derive Bell inequalities are satisﬁed for classical two point
particle models (and the same is urged here). However, although Bell’s argument is
quite clear-cut for classical particles and for any classical systems that are separated
from measurement devices in a well-deﬁned way, the assumptions required to derive Bell
inequalities are not usually satisﬁed for random ﬁeld models if there are any thermal
or quantum ﬂuctuations
. The correlation that is called “conspiracy”, more than just
‡
being natural, is always present for random ﬁelds if there are any thermal or quantum
ﬂuctuations
, even though it is not at all natural for classical two-point particle models.
§
Even if this were all, we would not be able to derive Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds,
but section 3 shows that there are numerous other correlations, all of which must also
be assumed to be identically zero, whereas all of them are nontrivial for random ﬁelds
if there are any thermal or quantum ﬂuctuations.

The literature on Bell inequalities for “beables” is quite sparse, and has not changed
the general perception that Bell [1, Chap. 12] more-or-less closes the discussion. The
more general literature on Bell inequalities, for which the assumptions required to
derive Bell inequalities are discussed quite clearly by Valdenebro [9], has come to the
same conclusion. Appendix C discusses the relationship between Bell inequalities for
“beables” and the more general literature, in the light of Section 3. In a later paper,
Bell [1, Chap. 16, Originally 1981] claims to address the question of ﬁelds,

‘Finally you might suspect that the very notion of a particle, and particle orbit,
..., has somehow led us astray. Indeed did not Einstein think that ﬁelds rather
than particles are at the bottom of everything? So the following argument will
not mention particles, nor indeed ﬁelds, nor any other particular picture of
what goes on at the microscopic level’,

but the argument he then makes is almost exactly the same argument as is made in the
papers referred to above and described in detail below. It is perhaps just because of
the abstraction of his argument, with all mention of particles or ﬁelds removed, that he

A clear distinction between quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations, at least for free ﬁelds, is made in [7],

‡
and is brieﬂy described in Appendix B.

For random ﬁelds at thermal equilibrium, 2-point correlations at space-like separation are generally
§
non-zero. At thermal equilibrium, correlations decay more-or-less exponentially with increasing space-
like separation; for the trivial Gaussian model in three dimensions, for example, the 2-point connected
correlation function is proportional to e−mx/x as a function of space-like separation x [8,
8.1]. These
thermal equilibrium correlations at space-like separation already do not satisfy the assumptions required
to derive Bell inequalities. We can also construct non-equilibrium states of the Gaussian model in three
dimensions in which correlations decay more-or-less like the thermal equilibrium state outside a bounded
space-time region

does not identify the very diﬀerent nature of the necessary assumptions that numerous
correlations must be precisely zero for the substantially diﬀerent cases of two point
particles, of C∞ ﬁelds, and of random ﬁelds.

The fundamental deﬁnition required for the derivation of Bell inequalities when
random variables associated with space-time regions are the focus of our attention is of
local causality. The two competing deﬁnitions given by Bell and by Shimony, Horne,
and Clauser are described in section 2. Section 3 will reproduce Bell’s mathematical
argument in the form given by d’Espagnat [6] to allow the assumptions required for the
derivation to be highlighted. Sections 4 and 5 discuss in detail the various correlations
that have to be assumed to be precisely zero, then section 6 shows that the violation of
Bell inequalities alone does not justify preferring a quantum ﬁeld model over a random
ﬁeld model by considering the similarities between a quantum ﬁeld theoretic Wigner
quasi-probability description and a random ﬁeld probability description of a complete
experimental apparatus that violates a Bell inequality. A quantum ﬁeld model for
a complete experimental apparatus requires as much “conspiracy” as a random ﬁeld
model.

introduce random ﬁeld models for complete experimental apparatuses where classical
two point particle models for a measured system are not adequate and where previously
only quantum mechanical models have been thought adequate.

12] random variables, instrument settings that are observed and possibly controlled by
the experimenter, while λ, µ, and ν are “hidden” random variables, neither observed nor
controlled by the experimenter. As far as classical physics is concerned, the separation
of random variables into (a, λ), (b, µ), and (c, ν) is arbitrary, because anything that
is hidden today may be revealed tomorrow and whether we observe or record random
variables makes no diﬀerence, so any derivation of Bell inequalities must be robust under
diﬀerent choices of the separation. There is nothing about the mathematics of section 3
that will determine a separation of random variables into (a, λ), (b, µ), and (c, ν). The

−

only diﬀerence between non-hidden random variables and hidden random variables will
be that we will integrate over all values of hidden random variables and never integrate
over values of non-hidden random variables. It will be useful to consider three choices
in this paper: (1) all of a, b, c, λ, µ, and ν are non-null sets of random variables; (2)
ν is a complete set of random variables, so that c is null; and (3) c is a complete set of
random variables, so that ν is null.

(In an abuse of notation, we will write X for an event involving the random variable
X; where we discuss several events involving the same random variable, they will be
denoted X, X ′, etc. which may be thought of as shorthand for events EX , E′
X, etc. This
lets us keep close to the notation of the original papers [1, 5, 6].) This deﬁnition of local
causality is applied a number of times in Bell’s derivation of inequalities.

Shimony, Horne, and Clauser [5], in contrast, weaken the deﬁnition of a locally
causal theory, so that for X and Y as above, but for XP all of the random variables

The two deﬁnitions of a locally causal theory are the same if Xp happens to be all the

random variables in Past(
Past(
that Xp can even be any single random variable associated with Past(
RY ).
Equation (1) is presumably supposed to be satisﬁed for an arbitrary choice of random
variables as Xp, so it is X∩ that is characteristic of equation (1). Equation (1) combines
equation (2), which is a much more natural deﬁnition of local causality for a classical
ﬁeld theory, with a principle that correlations only arise because of common causes.
Equation (1) generalizes an idea that two point particles leave a central source at the
same time as a common cause of two events in regions
RB, entirely reasonable
for a classical two point particle model, to a much more tendentious idea that there must
be a common cause of the two events even in a random ﬁeld model for an experiment.
Equation (2), however, is not strong enough to allow Bell inequalities to be derived.
Some of the applications of equation (1) can be replaced by applications of equation (2),
but some cannot. As well as the well-known “no-conspiracy” assumption (discussed in
section 4), which prohibits correlations between instrument settings and hidden random
variables and is needed whether we adopt equation (1) or equation (2) as our deﬁnition
of a locally causal theory, section 3 further identiﬁes a “no-correlation” assumption
(discussed in section 5), which prohibits correlations between hidden random variables.

The “no-correlation” assumption is only needed if we adopt equation (2) as our deﬁnition
of a locally causal theory.

Although equation (2) is a natural deﬁnition of local causality, even it is not satisﬁed
by the signal local and Lorentz invariant but analytically nonlocal dynamics discussed
in [7]. With such a dynamics, p(X

of such a dynamics are restricted to heat-equation-like exponentially reducing tails and

The derivation of Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds also requires an assumption
that apparatus must be independent, which is innocuous if almost all random variables
are hidden, but is not innocuous if almost all random variables are non-hidden, when
signiﬁcant correlations should be expected.
Section 3 identiﬁes an “independent-
apparatus” assumption (discussed in section 4), and shows the “independent-apparatus”
assumption to be closely related to the “no-conspiracy” assumption. These three
assumptions cannot be considered independently. Indeed, which assumptions should be
considered to be unsatisﬁed in a model for an experiment that violates Bell inequalities
will depend on what separation there is of random variables into (a, λ), (b, µ), and (c, ν),
since the assumptions refer to correlations between non-hidden and non-hidden random
variables (“independent-apparatus”), between non-hidden and hidden random variables
(“no-conspiracy”), and between hidden and hidden random variables (“no-correlation”).

Additionally, if we cannot change a, b, and c independently, we cannot measure M(a, b, c)
and M(a, b′, c), for example, because we cannot keep a and c perfectly unchanged,
making both equations (17) and (19) experimentally unrealisable. All we could measure
would be M(a, b, c) and M(˚a, b′,˚c), where ˚a and ˚c are perhaps very close to a and c but
not identical.

It is well-known that classical local physics allows the maximum value of 4 to
be saturated [13, 14, 15], but the violation of Bell inequalities has been considered
to require unnatural correlations; this paper argues that the required correlations are
natural for a classical random ﬁeld. Classically, quantum mechanics is half-way between
the conditions for deriving Bell inequalities and the maximum violation, when equation
(19) is satisﬁed as an equality. There must, therefore, be principled constraints on
initial conditions in a random ﬁeld model to ensure the maximum violation is never
observed, as well as to allow some violation. It is an open problem to ﬁnd a plausible
axiom that restricts random ﬁeld models to the same 2√2 limit as quantum theory, but
there are models in the literature, such as those of Adler[11] and ’t Hooft[12], that are
approximately within the general structure of a random ﬁeld but have generally been
ignored summarily because of an over-zealous belief that violation of the Bell inequalities
rules out all classical models.

4. The no-conspiracy and independent-apparatus assumptions

The prohibition of correlations of a with c, and of b with c, the “independent-apparatus”
assumption, is closely related to the “no-conspiracy” assumption. If we suppose that ν
is a complete set of random variables, so that c is null, we can derive in place of equation
(13), supposing that equations (10), (11), and (12) are satisﬁed,

M(a, b) =

Bell argues [1, Chap.

12] that the dynamics of a mechanism to choose the
instrument settings can be made chaotic enough that, even if there are correlations
between (c, ν) and (a, b), the instrument settings may nonetheless be taken to be ‘at
least eﬀectively free for the purposes at hand’. From a classical point of view, this is a
remarkable claim. Either there are correlations in a model for an experiment or there
are not. Correlations that are easy to measure at one time are generally not as easy to
measure at other times, but the practicality of measuring correlations has no bearing on
whether there are correlations, which is in principle unaﬀected by whether the evolution
is chaotic or not.

In any case, a and b being ‘free for the purposes at hand’ does not
a, b) = p(ν). A correlation p(ν

imply
= p(ν) does not “determine” a and b (or ν),
p(ν
but only describes a statistical relationship between a, b, and ν. If there is a correlation
between a, b, and ν, and we arrange or observe particular statistics for a and b, it just
must have been the case that ν had statistics compatible with the correlation, even
though we did not control or measure ν. However, ν is not measured — by deﬁnition,
since it’s “hidden” — so we can only surmise whether there is in fact such a correlation
and whether the statistics of ν are compatible with the correlation. How measurements
are “determined” or “chosen” is independent of p(ν
a, b), because it is only a record of
how the unmeasured variables ν are correlated with the measurement settings; ν might
entirely “determine” or “choose” the measurement settings a and b or not “determine”
them at all, but have the same correlations with a and b in both cases. As Jaynes
puts it, rather forcefully, ‘Bell took it for granted that a conditional probability P (X
Y )
expresses a physical causal inﬂuence, exerted by Y on X’ [16].

Bell also argues [1, Chap. 12] ‘that the disagreement between locality and quantum
mechanics is large — up to a factor of √2 in a certain sense’, and that although
the assumptions identiﬁed here are not analytically satisﬁed, nonetheless they are
“nearly” satisﬁed. First of all, Bell’s argument is slightly weakened by the classical
limit being either 2 or 4 (Bell omits to mention the latter), depending on whether we
accept all the standard assumptions, with 2√2 as the intermediate quantum mechanical
limit. More critically, the standard assumptions discussed here are given as analytic
equalities, which are unable to elaborate Bell’s ‘certain sense’. A random ﬁeld model
is so general that it is unclear how the no-correlation, no-nonlocal-conspiracy, no-
conspiracy, and independent-apparatus assumptions could instead be given as physically
justiﬁable limits on inequality (note that the standard assumptions are problematic just

6

as analytic equalities between probability distributions, since such a relationship cannot
be supported by experimental statistics, nor, it seems, by analytic argument).

For a random ﬁeld model to be empirically adequate, there is no requirement
that the assumptions be violated by much, only that the totality of correlations be
such that the dynamical evolution will result in the violation of Bell inequalities at
the time of measurement. A correlation might be easily measurable at the time of a
measurement, but just because the same correlation is almost always not measurable in
practice at earlier times does not mean it is zero at earlier times. The chaotic behaviour
that Bell invokes to assert that instrument settings cannot be signiﬁcantly correlated
in fact operates rather against Bell’s overall argument, since then manifest measured
correlations between non-hidden random variables at the time of measurement are all
the more likely to correspond to unmeasurable correlations between hidden random
variables before the time of measurement.

Making slightly diﬀerent assumptions, suppose that instead of taking ν to be
complete information, we take c to be complete information, so that ν is null. Then
we can derive, in place of equation (13), again supposing that equations (10), (11), and
(12) are satisﬁed,

M(a, b, c) = A(a, c) B(b, c).

Now to derive equation (17), we have to make only the “independent-apparatus”
a′ without changing c (or b) and we can change
assumption, so that we can change a
b′ without changing c (or a), with the “no-conspiracy” assumption playing no rˆole.

In quantum ﬁeld theory, the Reeh-Schlieder theorem [4] is typically thought very
awkward, yet the apparatus-dependence it implies is not taken to rule out quantum
ﬁeld theory. Recall that as a consequence of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem we cannot
change a quantum ﬁeld state so that the expected value of a quantum ﬁeld observable
RB) changes without changing the expected value of
associated with Past(
RB) and
almost all quantum ﬁeld observables associated with both Past(
RA). Applied in the context of Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds,

If c is not complete information, the correlations of c with a and b should be expected
to lessen as c includes fewer and fewer random variables; the correlations should not

variables in Past(
RB). Whether we measure or do not measure random
variables in the past should not make any diﬀerence, in a classical model, to whether
violation of Bell inequalities can be observed, but will change the description we give of

It is unreasonable to expect the “independent-apparatus” and “no-conspiracy”
assumptions to be satisﬁed by a random ﬁeld model when we do not expect them
of quantum ﬁeld theory — to do so is to construct a straw man of a theory. If we insist
on a parallel of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem for random ﬁelds, we cannot derive Bell
inequalities for random ﬁelds.

5. The no-correlation assumption

Recall that the “no-correlation” assumption, equation (10), requires that there are no
correlations between the hidden random variables λ and the hidden random variables
µ (that are not screened oﬀ by ν, a, b, and c). There is no empirical way to justify
this assumption, simply because it is a condition imposed on random variables that are
by deﬁnition not measured. The preference against correlations between instrument
settings and hidden random variables is only tendentiously extensible to justify a
prohibition against correlations between hidden random variables.

Shimony, Horne, and Clauser [5] argue that

‘even though the space-time region in which λ is located extends to negative
inﬁnity in time, ν, a, c are all the beables other than λ itself in the backward
light cone of this region, and µ and b do refer to beables with space-like
separation from the λ region’ (their emphasis)

not with the whole backward light-cones, Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s argument fails
to justify deriving equations (10), (11), and (12) from equation (2).

Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s argument eﬀectively reintroduces common
causation, by requiring that there is no causation associated with the region
outside Past(
RB). As for the no-conspiracy and independent-apparatus
assumptions, there is no requirement that the no-correlation assumption be violated by
much, only that the totality of correlations of all three kinds be such that the dynamical
evolution will result in the violation of Bell inequalities at the time of measurement.

Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s argument is contrary to the intention behind

to distinguish between equation (1) and equation (2) as deﬁnitions of local causality,
we can’t argue for equations (10), (11), and (12) in a way that quietly negates the
distinction.

6. A quantum ﬁeld theory approach

We have become used to describing the outcome of Bell violating experiments using
in which many detailed degrees
a state in a complex 4-dimensional Hilbert space,
of freedom are integrated out.
If we agree, however, that non-relativistic quantum
mechanics is a reduction of quantum ﬁeld theory — as we almost always do — such a
state is a reduction of a quantum ﬁeld state in an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space,
which gives the values of quantum ﬁeld observables associated with the regions
RA
and
RB. If Bell inequalities are violated by observables of a quantum ﬁeld state, we
would certainly attribute the violation to the experimenters’ ingenuity in ensuring an
appropriate initial quantum ﬁeld state and making appropriate measurements. For a
quantum ﬁeld state describing an experimental apparatus that violates Bell inequalities,
the existence of strong correlations between observables at large space-like separations
is a large part of what singles out such states as special (Bell inequalities are violated
slightly even for the vacuum [17], but unmeasurably at large space-like separations).
A quantum ﬁeld state that describes experimental correlations that measurably violate
Bell inequalities at the time of measurement describes correlations in the remote past
diﬀerent from those of the vacuum state, but, as for a random ﬁeld model, diﬀerences
from the vacuum state may be diﬃcult to detect in the remote past. In quasi-probability
terms, we have to set up a Wigner quasi-distribution over phase space in the past that
evolves to a Wigner quasi-distribution over phase space at the time of measurement tM
that violates a Bell inequality in the regions

For an equilibrium state of a random ﬁeld model, correlations between random
variables that violate the assumption of statistical independence at space-like separation
generally decrease more-or-less exponentially fast with increasing distance, but strong
correlations at arbitrarily large distances are possible for non-equilibrium states. Indeed,
absolutely any correlations are allowed in a non-equilibrium initial condition — initial

RA and

RB.

Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds

13

conditions of low probability of course require greater free energy to set up, but we should
not forget how diﬃcult it is to construct an experiment that violates Bell inequalities
at large space-like separations. In a random ﬁeld model, we have to set up a probability
distribution over phase space in the past that evolves to a probability distribution over
phase space at time tM that violates a Bell inequality in the regions
RB, but
this is no greater “conspiracy” than is apparent in the full quantum ﬁeld state for
the experiment (to be explicit, note the parallel between the Wigner quasi-distribution
description and the classical probability description).

RA and

The statistics we observe for random variables in the region

RA ∪ RB are no more
than classical initial conditions. We cannot rule out any classical dynamics, whether
local or non-local, without Bell’s other assumptions, which amount to a claim that
unobserved initial conditions at earlier times cannot, for a priori reasons, be correlated
in such a way that the observed initial conditions at the time of measurement are as
we observe them. There are often signiﬁcant reasons for preferring a quantum ﬁeld
model over a random ﬁeld model, such as ease of computation, years of familiarity, and
the analytical power of the mathematics of Hilbert spaces, but the violation of Bell
inequalities is not conclusive.

The correlations we have discussed here commit us to very little, if we take an
equally empiricist approach to random ﬁelds as we take to quantum ﬁelds: correlations
just exist; we do not have to assume that they are caused by common (or any other
kind of) causes. Classical physics has generally taken initial conditions to be more-or-less
explained by earlier initial conditions, with no ﬁnal explanation being essential.

7. Discussion

We have described the previously identiﬁed diﬀerence between Bell’s deﬁnition of a
locally causal theory, which insists that correlations have to be the result of common
causes, and Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s deﬁnition, which does not. The assumption
that there is a common cause for separated events is an a priori constraint on
unmeasured initial conditions at earlier times. This is quite a natural assumption for
a classical two particle model, because the two particles are imagined to be emitted
from a single point in the past, but it is a strong and unjustiﬁable assumption for a
random ﬁeld model. We have described numerous assumptions that random variables
may not be correlated with other random variables, all of which are necessary for Bell
inequalities to be derived, but none of which are generally satisﬁed for a random ﬁeld
in the presence of thermal or quantum ﬂuctuations.

We have also seen that the opprobrium of “conspiracy” as much applies to quantum
ﬁelds as it does to random ﬁelds. We could argue from this that quantum ﬁeld models
should as much be rejected as random ﬁeld models, but it seems more appropriate
for physics to admit both. The long-standing moratorium on construction of classical
models loses most of its justiﬁcation if we allow ourselves to use the resources of random
ﬁelds.

Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds

14

To temper the localism of this paper, repeating the caution given in section 2,
a random ﬁeld model that reproduces the phenomenological success of a quantum
ﬁeld model has to have the same propagator as the given quantum ﬁeld model, which
in classical terms is nonlocal even while preserving signal locality and being Lorentz
invariant [7]. Thus the very ﬁrst assumption that is needed to derive Bell inequalities
for a random ﬁeld model, of locality in a classical dynamical sense, is not satisﬁed
in any realistic model, even though an assumption of signal locality is satisﬁed. It is
well known that quantum ﬁeld theory is nonlocal in the sense of Hegerfeldt [18], while
nonetheless preserving signal locality [19]. The violation of Bell inequalities can be
modelled by entirely local random ﬁelds, but leaves an awkward question of how the
nonlocal correlations might have been established in the ﬁrst place (that is, how did the
“conspiracy” arise?), which ﬁnds a relatively more natural answer if the propagator of
a random ﬁeld model is nonlocal.

Although the principal argument of this paper is that correlations in random ﬁeld
models generally do not satisfy the assumptions necessary to derive Bell inequalities,
empirically adequate random ﬁeld models will often have to include a detailed
description of the measurement apparatus, which may well not be easy to construct. If
thermal properties of a measurement apparatus have to be taken into account explicitly
in a quantum ﬁeld model to ensure empirical adequacy, however, then a random ﬁeld
model should be no more complex than the quantum ﬁeld model. A random ﬁeld
approach might also connect better with general relativity because of their shared
classicality, but in my investigations so far the connection seems to be as awkward as it
is for quantum ﬁeld theory. Quantum theory is of course generally more easily usable
than a random ﬁeld model whenever a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space is empirically
adequate.

I am indebted to most of the people in and who have passed through Oxford’s
Philosophy of Physics community, to Luca Porta Mana in Stockholm, and to Stephen
Adler in Princeton.

Appendix A. Beables

The distinction Bell makes between “beable” ﬁelds and non-“beable” ﬁelds, and the
ontology that Bell introduces, are not signiﬁcant for the approach of this paper. The
only aspect of Bell’s idea of “beables” that matters, both to his and to my mathematical
derivation, is the attachment of random variables to regions of space-time. Nonetheless,
Bell gives the name The theory of local beables to the paper that is the principal stem
of the literature [1, Chap. 7], so there should be a brief discussion here about beables.
As a ﬁrst example, Bell distinguishes between the electromagnetic ﬁelds E and
H as “physical” and the electromagnetic potentials φ and A as “non-physical”; Bell
emphasizes that the connection is just a mathematical convenience that is “not really
supposed to be there” (from a random ﬁeld perspective, the reason for discounting
the 4-potential Aµ is more mathematical than physical or ontological — a classical

Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds

15

connection Aµ cannot be averaged by integration over a region, so it cannot be extended
to a distribution that generates smeared observables, in contrast to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld). In the next paragraph Bell also denies that the wave function is a “beable” , for
a somewhat diﬀerent reason, the “ ‘collapse of the wave function’ on ‘measurement’ ”,
which he describes as “one of the apparent non-localities of quantum mechanics”. Bell
resolves his ontological diﬃculties by claiming that the “odd behaviour” of the wave
function is acceptable if we take the wave function also to be only a mathematical
convenience.
It’s not quite clear what we should take the common feature of these
examples to be, except perhaps the odd behaviour (the electromagnetic potential is
guilty only of “funny behaviour”), which is the signal for mathematics to be taken to
be only a convenience instead of real.

Finally, he gives a description of what is important both for his and my purposes,
“We will be particularly concerned with local beables, those which (unlike for example
the total energy) can be assigned to some bounded space-time region” (his emphasis). It
is manifest from the mathematics of section 3 that all that matters for the mathematics
is the association of random variables with bounded regions of space-time.

Appendix B. Continuous random ﬁelds

7→

For the purposes of this paper, continuous random ﬁelds can most appropriately
be understood either as random variable-valued distributions or, in a Koopman-von
Neumann type of approach, as a commutative quantum ﬁeld (but see also [3]). We
introduce either a random variable-valued linear map, χ : f
χf , or an operator-
valued linear map ˆχ : f
ˆχf , with the trivial commutator [ ˆχf , ˆχg] = 0 whatever the
space-time relationship between Schwartz space functions f and g (a Schwartz space
function f (x) is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable and decreases as well as its derivatives
faster than any power as x moves to inﬁnity in any direction [4,
II.1.2]). The diﬀerence
§
between these two approaches is mostly notational, but operator-valued distributions
are used in this appendix to emphasize the similarities to and diﬀerences from quantum
ﬁelds. In contrast to the random ﬁeld, for a quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, an operator-
valued linear map ˆφ : f
(f, g) is zero when

f and g have space-like separated supports.

function). Other sectors can be constructed by changing the right-hand side, which,
as well as thermal sectors, include “extra quantum ﬂuctuation” sectors [20],

2 λ2(f,f ).

(B.5)

For this random ﬁeld state, all joint probability densities over observables ˆχf1, ˆχf2, ..., ˆχfn
are identical to the equivalent joint probability densities for the quantized Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld, whenever the quantum ﬁeld observables are also compatible. Self-adjoint functions
of non-commuting observables of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld such as ˆφf ˆφg + ˆφg ˆφf
will of course generally have diﬀerent probability densities from their random ﬁeld
equivalents.

The algebras of observables are not the same, but the state over the classical algebra
is suﬃciently similar to the vacuum state over the quantum algebra to make it reasonable
to call the random ﬁeld state a presentation of “quantum ﬂuctuations”. Certainly the
amplitude of the ﬂuctuations of the random ﬁeld is controlled by ¯h and the ﬂuctuations
are distinct from the thermal ﬂuctuations of a classical Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, which can

This thermal state can be presented either with a trivial commutator [ ˆχf , ˆχg] = 0 or
(f, g)C, depending on whether we wish to
with the commutator [ ˆχf , ˆχg] = (g, f )C −
use models in which idealized measurements are always compatible or generally not
compatible at time-like separation because of thermal ﬂuctuations (see [20]).

The diﬀerence between quantum ﬁelds and random ﬁelds can be taken to be only
a diﬀerent attitude to idealized measurements; actual measurements can be described
in terms of either. The empirical principle that justiﬁes the implicit description of
quantum ﬂuctuations that underlies quantum theory is our apparent inability to reduce
the quantum ﬂuctuations of our measurement apparatuses, in contrast to the almost
universal minimization of thermal ﬂuctuations in precision experiments. Even if this
empirical principle is unbroken, however, we can still model quantum ﬂuctuations and
their eﬀects explicitly instead of implicitly, just as we model thermal ﬂuctuations and
It is perhaps a conceptual advantage that
their eﬀects explicitly when we have to.
classical random ﬁelds explicitly describe thermal and quantum ﬂuctuations in the same
way. A mathematical model is valuable as a mental image of the world, not necessarily

Bell inequalities for random ﬁelds

17

as how the world really is; we can imagine what the results of measurements might be
if we had classically ideal measurement devices, even if we don’t have any.

More mathematics and discussion can be found in refs. [7] and [20].

in which the assumptions required to derive equations (C.3) and (C.4) correspond to
Jarrett’s “completeness” and “locality” respectively [21] (or “outcome independence”
and “parameter independence” in Shimony’s terminology [22]). To allow Bell’s original
approach, it has to be assumed further that p(Λ
a, b) = p(Λ) (“no-conspiracy”). If we
take Λ to be the microstate of a measured system, as we typically do if we think we
are measuring the state of two classical point particles, correlation of Λ with a and b
represents contextuality of the measured system state, which is generally taken to be
anathema. In a random ﬁeld context, however, it is far more natural to take Λ to be the
microstate of the whole experimental apparatus, because for general random ﬁelds there
is no natural way to draw an exact boundary between what would usually be termed the
measurement device and the measured system, so that it seems that Λ, when considered
in the fullest possible detail, must be correlated with a and b (but this does not claim
that Λ causes or does not cause a and b).

is possible if we do not distinguish λ, µ, and ν, so we will not further pursue the limited
