Abstract. There are still no interacting models of the Wightman axioms, suggesting
that the axioms are too tightly drawn. Here a weakening of linearity for quantum
ﬁelds is proposed, with the algebra still linear but with the quantum ﬁelds no longer
required to be tempered distributions, allowing explicit interacting quantum ﬁeld
models.
Interacting quantum ﬁelds should be understood to be nonlinear quantum
ﬁelds in this sense, because a set of eﬀective ﬁeld theories encodes a dependence on
the energy scale of measurement — which is a nontrivial property of the test functions
— so that correlation functions are implicitly nonlinear functions of test functions in
the conventional formalism. In Local Quantum Physics terms, the algebraic models
constructed here do not satisfy the additivity property. Finite nonlinear deformations
of quantized electromagnetism are constructed as examples.

1. Introduction

7→

The free Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld is an operator valued linear map from a suitable
space of functions, ˆφ : f
ˆφf . We will take f to be from a Schwartz space of
II.1.2], so that f (x) is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable and decreases as well
functions[1,
§
as its derivatives faster than any power as x moves to inﬁnity in any direction. For
the free Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld, ˆφ is then a tempered distribution. This is the
linearity we will weaken: we will allow the operator valued map ˆφ : f
ˆφf to be
nonlinear, so that the linear operators ˆφf , ˆφg and ˆφf +g will in general not satisfy the
linear dependence ˆφf + ˆφg = ˆφf +g. With this weakening, we cannot take a quantum ﬁeld
to be an operator-valued distribution ˆφ(x), we will be concerned only with operators
ˆφf . Note, however, that allowing ˆφ to be nonlinear does not weaken the linearity of
the algebra generated by the operators ˆφf , and we will be able to construct a linear
Hilbert space representation of the algebra of observables. The construction here is thus
diﬀerent from the nonlinear relativistic approach of Kibble, for example, who introduces
a nonlinear Hamiltonian operator[2].

Locality and Lorentz covariance, however, will be preserved absolutely. The
algebraic structure of a free linear quantum ﬁeld is given by the hermitian inner product
corresponding to the commutator, [ˆag, ˆa†
f . A free linear
quantum ﬁeld is local just because [ ˆφf , ˆφg] = (g, f )
(f, g) is zero whenever the test
functions f and g have space-like separated supports. Nonlinearity will be introduced
in two ways, ﬁrstly by the simple expedient of taking the commutator to be a sum of a
number of inner products such as, for example, without worrying here about constants,

the ﬁeld and its derivatives such as f n(x) = [f (x)]n or ∂µf ∂µf have support contained
in Supp(f ).
ξ(f, g) is zero, as for the free ﬁeld, whenever the
test functions f and g have space-like separated supports. The constraints of locality,
positive semi-deﬁniteness and Lorentz invariance on the form of ξ(f, g) are satisﬁed by
many models, and it will turn out to be as easy to construct a vacuum state over this
algebra as over the linear free ﬁeld, allowing the GNS construction of a Hilbert space.

The energy scale of an experiment is essentially a pragmatic matter that is obvious
to an experimenter: an experiment deals with phonons on a lattice, with atomic
energy levels, with nuclear energy levels, etc., without an exact explicit discussion
being necessary, and we can choose the cutoﬀ appropriately for a given experiment
without too much detailed concern. From a quantum ﬁeld perspective, however, the
energy scale of an experiment is a very non-detailed measure of the structure of the test
functions involved in its description:
if a test function appropriate to a description of
an experiment determines an eﬀective real-space length scale, or if the fourier transform
of the same (or another) test function is concentrated at a particular energy scale, then
such scales pragmatically determine what eﬀective ﬁeld model we use. Hence, there
is a prima facie case that the correlation functions of a quantum ﬁeld are nonlinearly
determined by properties of the test functions that describe an experiment, because the
test functions are involved in an explicit description of correlation functions not only
by smearing, so that interacting quantum ﬁelds should be understood to be nonlinear
quantum ﬁelds. This signiﬁcantly reconceptualizes our understanding of interacting
quantum ﬁelds.

We will not here concern ourselves with the Hamiltonian operators of the theories
we discuss, because the Hamiltonian is a global (non)observable, so that any constraint
on it is essentially theoretical. Additionally, the Hamiltonian is inessential to the
algebraic constructions of quantum ﬁeld theories given here. Instead, we will take n-
measurement correlation functions to be the observables of the theory, with empirical
adequacy achieved if a theory can accurately model experimental correlations.

Section 2 ﬁrst discusses free quantum ﬁelds, then section 3 introduces a large class of
models that weaken the linearity of the quantum ﬁeld by the introduction of a nonlinear
inner product, and section 4 discusses the introduction of a nonlinear map between ˆφf
and creation and annihilation operators. Section 5 applies the methods of section 3
to an electromagnetic ﬁeld, leaving the application of the methods of section 4 to the
future.

2. Free ﬁeld preliminaries

A simple way to construct the free Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld [3] is to project ˆφf
into two parts, ˆφf = ˆaf + ˆa†

The imaginary parts of (fi, g) contribute to equation (7), which consequently may be not
positive semi-deﬁnite
. It is straightforward, but progressively more time-consuming,
§
to compute n-measurement joint quasiprobability densities for higher states, which
introduce increasing deviations from a Gaussian distribution. We can in principle also
compute probability densities straightforwardly for higher order observables such as
ˆφf1

ˆφf2 + ˆφf2
The intention of this rather lengthy elementary discussion of characteristic functions
and quasiprobabilities is to give some sense of how we can compute empirically relevant
results quite eﬀectively by only considering the relations between explicit measurement
and state descriptions without ever considering operator-valued distributions ˆφ(x). We
have exclusively used inner products between the functions fi and g that were used
above to construct measurements and states. Using test functions universally has the
useful eﬀect of ensuring manifest Poincar´e invariance of the resulting formalism very
straightforwardly. Note that we have used the term “n-measurement” correlations
instead of “n-point”, because we never measure anything at a point, and the idealization
of point-like measurements will become impossible when we introduce nonlinearity. All
calculations involve only Schwartz space functions, which are much easier to manipulate
than distributions, in particular because Schwartz space is closed under multiplication.
In a simple-minded way, it is arguable that the inﬁnities profusely generated by the
conventional perturbation of free quantum ﬁelds are caused by the introduction of higher
than quadratic products of distributions.

ω(f n, gn) is zero if f and g have space-like separated support. We can also introduce
invariant polynomials in derivatives of the ﬁeld, such as ∂µf ∂µf , which again have the
same support as f . Furthermore, we need not restrict ourselves to one inner product

invariant polynomials in the ﬁeld and its derivatives.
If the free quantum ﬁeld is a

We have eﬀectively constructed a class of quantum ﬁelds that is analogous to
the class of integrable systems in classical ﬁeld theory in that they are reducible to
a free quantum ﬁeld by nonlinear (and possibly microcausality preserving but otherwise
nonlocal) maps.
In other attempts to construct algebras of observables using the

nonlinear operator-valued map ˆφ : f
of Arik-Coons type[6] (which work nicely in the one-dimensional case), I have not so
far found it possible to construct quantum ﬁeld algebras that are both microcausal and
associative, which I have taken to be essential requirements.

5. Deformation of electromagnetism

The electromagnetic potential and Dirac spinors are not observable ﬁelds, so we will
here deform the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld. To avoid excessive complexity, we will
use only the method of section 3. The dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of
a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product on test functions is given by Menikoﬀ and Sharp[7,
equation (3.27)] (except for a missing factor of (2π)−3 that is present in their equation
(3.25)):

Note that f1 and f2 are not electromagnetic ﬁeld tensors, they are classical test
functions that contribute to a description of measurement and/or state preparation of
the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electromagnetic ﬁeld in an interacting theory
of the sort introduced here is not measurable at a point, so we always have to consider
ˆφf .

Supposing there is an observable 4-current ﬁeld, and that J1µ and J2µ are test

functions for it, we can introduce a massive free ﬁeld inner product

only components orthogonal to kµ signiﬁcant and σS = 0 makes only the component
parallel to kµ signiﬁcant. In terms of these free ﬁeld inner products, we can introduce
an interacting nonlinear inner product,

a contribution after we introduce a new term to a nonlinear inner product. Fourier
components of J1 that are not on mass-shell,
for example, so that they make no
contribution to (J1, J2)V , may contribute to the on mass-shell fourier components of

freedom as well.

Polynomial invariants in derivatives of both J and f can also be added, such as

All the nonlinear terms introduced above can result in correlations between
the current and the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In the noninteracting case, the inner
product between test functions (J1, 0) and (0, f2) will always be zero, so there is no
correlation in the vacuum state between 4-current observables and electromagnetic ﬁeld
observables, but with the introduction of the nonlinear terms above there will generally
be correlations between 4-current observables and electromagnetic ﬁeld observables in
the vacuum state. Such interactions between the 4-current and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
through the action of nonlinearity in this approach are not immediately comparable
to the description of correlations in conventional perturbation theory through the
annihilation and creation of photon and charge lines in Feynman diagrams.

The variance associated with the observable ˆφf in the vacuum state is (f, f ); if this is zero, then the

¶
observed value of ˆφf is always zero in the vacuum state (and indeed in every state).

If there is also an observable axial 4-vector, and S1µ and S2µ are test functions for
it, quite a few more terms become possible in a nonlinear inner product, even without
introducing derivatives,

In view of the number of parameters that are apparently possible in this approach,
even in the case of electromagnetism, in contrast to the relatively tight constraints
imposed by renormalizability, equation (24) presumably has to be regarded as only
(potentially) phenomenologically descriptive, not as a fundamental theory, unless a
theoretically natural constraint on admissible terms emerges. Note that this approach
or some extension or modiﬁcation of it might be empirically useful, for example if it can
describe electromagnetic ﬁelds in nonlinear materials eﬀectively, without it being at all
equivalent to QED.

6. Conclusion

With all computations being entirely ﬁnite, it may be possible to use these nonlinear
quantum ﬁeld models more easily and with less conceptual uncertainty than using
conventional perturbation theory. The universal use of Schwartz space test functions to
describe measurement and state preparation ensures that there are none of the inﬁnities
that usually emerge in perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory. Correlation functions for
measurements in a given state are straightforwardly computed in terms of the nonlinear
inner products between all the functions used to generate a state and to describe
measurements.

The mathematics allows a reasonable understanding of the nonlinearity that has
been introduced, and there seems to be no a priori reason to exclude this kind of
nonlinearity, in which the linearity of the algebra is preserved. Indeed, on the classical
precedent, nonlinearity ought to be expected. The apparent introduction of nonlinearity
by renormalization through the implicit nonlinear use of test functions gives a stronger
impetus to consider how empirically eﬀective the nonlinear models introduced here —
and perhaps more general models — can be.

The inﬁnite range of possibilities is at present a little uncontrolled, and the
mathematical analysis of the empirical consequences of particular terms in models of

the theory appear to be quite nontrivial — to my knowledge it is a novel mathematical
problem. Quantum theory has largely moved to supersymmetry and string theory
because of the apparent impossibility of putting interacting quantum ﬁeld theory on a
sound mathematical footing, but the form of interacting quantum ﬁeld theories presented
here is a mathematically reasonable alternative.

It will be interesting to see what range of physical situations can be modelled with
these nonlinear quantum ﬁelds. Free ﬁelds are already useful as a ﬁrst approximation
in quantum optics, so it’s possible that the methods of this paper might make a useful
second approximation as a way to construct phenomenological models for nonlinear
materials. These nonlinear quantum ﬁelds, however, are conceptually signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the interacting quantum ﬁelds of conventional perturbation theory, and
are manifestly diﬀerent from conventional constructive and axiomatic quantum ﬁelds.
