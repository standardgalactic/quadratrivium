Summary: In this article we consider resummed expressions for the heat-kernel’s (HK’s) trace of a Laplace
operator, the latter including a potential and imposing Dirichlet semitransparent boundary conditions
on a surface of codimension one in ﬂat space. We obtain resummed expressions that correspond to the
ﬁrst and second order expansion of the HK in powers of the potential. We show how to apply these
results to obtain the bulk and surface form factors of a scalar quantum ﬁeld theory in d = 4 with
a Yukawa coupling to a background. Additionally, we discuss a connection between HKs for Dirichlet
semitransparent, Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions.
