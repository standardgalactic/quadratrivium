A b s t r a ct 

One  of  the  m a j or  foci  of research  in  distributed 
artificial  intelligence  ( D A I)  is  the  design  of  au 
t o m a t ed  agents  which  can  interact  effectively 
in  order  to  cooperate  in  problem-solving.  Ne 
g o t i a t i on  is  recognized  as  an  i m p o r t a nt  means 
by  which  inter-agent  cooperation  is  achieved. 
In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  strategic  model  of 
negotiation  for  N  agents  (N  >  3),  t h at  takes 
the  passage  of t i me  d u r i ng  the  negotiation  pro 
cess  itself  i n to  consideration.  Changes  in  the 
agent's  preferences  over  t i me  w i ll  change  their 
strategies  in  the  negotiation  and,  as  a  result, 
the  agreements  they  are  w i l l i ng  to  reach.  We 
w i ll  show  t h at  in  this  model  the  delay  in  reach 
ing  such  agreements  can  be  shortened  and  in 
some  cases  avoided  altogether.

I n t r o d u c t i on 

One  of  the  m a j or  foci  of  research  in  d i s t r i b u t ed  a r t i f i 
cial  intelligence  ( D A I)  is  the  design  of  a u t o m a t ed  agents 
which  can  interact  effectively  in  order  to  cooperate  in 
problem-solving.  Negotiation  is  recognized  as  an  impor 
t a nt  means  by  which  inter-agent  cooperation  is  achieved. 
T h at  is,  D AI  is  concerned  w i th  the  design  of agents  which 
are  able  to  communicate  in  such  a  way  as  to  enhance  the 
possibility  of  reaching  m u t u a l ly  beneficial  agreements 
concerning  problems  such  as  a  division  of  labor  or  re 
sources  among  the  agents. 

Negotiation  has  always  been  a  central  theme  in  D AI 
research  [Davis  and  S m i t h,  1983;  Georgeff,  1983;  M a l-
one  et  al.,  1988;  Durfee,  1988;  Durfee  and  Lesser,  1989; 
Rosenschein  and  Genesereth,  1985;  Sathi  and  Fox,  1989; 
Conry  et  a/.,  1988;  Z l o t k in  and  Rosenschein,  1990]. 
T h is  research  has  focused  on  strategies 
for  designing 
agents  capable  of  reaching  m u t u a l ly  beneficial  agree 
ments.  Sycara  ([Sycara,  1987]),  using  case-based  rea 
soning,  and  Kraus  et  a l.  ([Kraus  et  al.,  1991J)  modeled 
negotiations  f r om  a  cognitive  standpoint.

Dept.  of Computer  Science,  University  of  Maryland,  College

Yet  it  is  also  recognized  t h at  although  negotiations  are 
necessary  for  reaching  such  agreements,  the  negotiation 
process  is  b o th  costly  and  time-consuming,  and  thus  may 
increase  the  overhead  of  the  operation  in  question  (see 
[Bond  and  Gasser,  1988]).  In  negotiations  on  such  issues 
as  job-sharing  or  resource  allocation,  it  is  i m p o r t a nt  to 
minimize  the  amount  of  t i me  spent  on  negotiating  m u 
t u a l ly  beneficial  agreements  so  as  not  to  detract  f r om 
t i me  spent  on  the  task  itself.  T h u s,  in  the  presence  of 
t i me  constraints,  negotiation  t i me  should  be  taken  into 
consideration. 

In  [Kraus  and  W i l k e n f e l d,  1991a]  we  propose  a  strate 
gic  model  of  negotiation  t h at  takes  the  passage  of  t i me 
d u r i ng  the  negotiation  process  itself  into  consideration. 
T h at  study  focused  exclusively  on  a  two-agent  model. 
T he  present  study  generalizes  this  process  by  consider 
ing  the  N-agent  environment. 

Following  [Rosenschein  and  Genesereth,  1985;  Z l o t k in 
and  Rosenschein,  1990;  Kraus  and  W i l k e n f e l d,  1990; 
Kraus  and  W i l k e n f e l d,  1991a]  we  examine  negotiation 
using  game  theory  techniques  w i th  appropriate  modifica 
tions  to  fit  artificial  intelligence  situations.  We  w i ll  focus 
p r i m a r i ly  on  works  in  game  theory  and  economics  that 
have  studied  the  effect  of t i me  preferences  on  the  negoti 
ation  process,  f o l l o w i ng  the  classic  paper  by  Rubinstein 
([Rubinstein,  1982]).  Unlike  the  work  of  Z l o t k in  and 
Rosenchein,  [ Z l o t k in  and  Rosenschein,  1990]  we  investi 
gate  multi-agent  environments  (more  t h an  two  agents) 
and  our  approach  makes  no  assumptions  about  the  pro 
tocol  for  negotiations.  Also,  our  model  takes  the  pas 
sage  of  t i me  d u r i ng  the  negotiation  process  itself  into 
consideration.  Furthermore,  by  t a k i ng  the  passage  of 
t i me  d u r i ng  the  negotiation  process  i n to  consideration, 
our  approach  is  able  to  influence  the  outcome  of  the  ne 
g o t i a t i on  so  as  to  avoid  delays  in  reaching  agreements.

I n i t i al  S e t t i ng 

N  autonomous  agents  A\,  A 2,...,As  have  a  c o m m on  goal 
they  want  to  satisfy  as  soon  as  possible.  In  order  to  sat 
isfy  a  goal,  costly  actions  must  be  taken  and  an  agent 
cannot  satisfy  the  goal  w i t h o ut  reaching  an  agreement 
w i th  one  of  the  other  agents.  Each  of  the  agents  wants 
to  m i n i m i ze  its  costs,  i.e.,  prefers  to  do  as  l i t t le  as  possi 
ble,  if  it  can  assume  t h at  the  goal  w i ll  be  fulfilled  prop 
erly  w i t h o ut  a d d i t i o n al  effort  on  its  p a r t.  We  note  t h at 

even  t h o u gh  the  agents  have  the  same  goal  (under  our 
simplified  assumptions),  there  is  actually  a  conflict  of in 
terests.  T he  agents  have  different  preferences  concerning 
goal satisfaction  and  for  the  different  possible  agreements 
which  can  be  reached. 

We  make  the  f o l l o w i ng  assumptions: 
1.  Full  i n f o r m a t i on  -  each  agent  knows  all  relevant 
i n f o r m a t i on  i n c l u d i ng  the  other  agents'  preferences  for 
the  different  outcomes  over  t i m e. 

2.  T he  agents  are  r a t i o n al -  they  w i ll  behave  according 

to  their  preferences. 

3.  C o m m i t m e n ts  are  enforced  -  if  an  agreement  is 

reached  b o th  sides  are  forced  to  follow  i t. 

4.  Assumptions  ( l ) - ( 3)  are  common  knowledge. 
We  demonstrate  the  cases  we  are  interested  in  w i th 

the  following  example.

E x a m p le  2 .1  Three  robots,  A,  B  and  C,  stationed  on 
a  satellite,  are  instructed  to  move  an  expensive  telescope 
from  one 
to  another  as  soon  as  possible.  Delay 
in  moving  the  telescope  will  reduce  the  number  of pictures 
sent  back  to  scientists  on  earth.  Any  two  of  the  robots 
can  move  the  telescope,  but  the  tools  essential  to  perform 
three  agents.  Any  of 
the 
the  agents  can  opt  out  of  the  negotiation,  choosing  not  to 
satisfy  the  goal. 
the  remaining  two  cannot

T he  S t r u c t u re  of  N e g o t i a t i o ns 

Our  strategic  model  of  negotiations  is  a  model  of  Alter-
native  Offers. 1 

For  reasons  of  s i m p l i f i c a t i on  and  clarity,  we  w i ll  con 
centrate  on  the  case  of  three  agents,  but  our  results  can 
be  easily  extended  to  N  agents  where  an  agent  can  sat 
isfy  a goal  by  reaching  an  agreement  w i th  another  agent 2. 
So,  in  our  case,  three  agents,  A,  B  and  C  have  a  com 
m on  goal  they  want  to  satisfy  as  soon  as  possible.  Each 
of  t h em  has  a  set  of  capabilities,  PA,PB  and  Pc  and 
a  set  of  tools  TA ,  TB  and  Tc  respectively.  T he  agents' 
capabilities  influence  their  a b i l i ty  and  their  ways  of satis 
fying  the  goal,  and  all  the  tools  are  needed  to  satisfy  the 
goal.  We  now  present  f o r m al  definitions  of  agreements 
and  strategies. 

3.1 

A g r e e m e n ts  a nd  S t r a t e g i es 

We first  define  the  set  of possible  agreements.  We  assume 
t h at  there  exists  a  set  of  possible  agreements  between 
any  two  agents.  We  denote  by  A  the  set  of  agents. 

1See  [Osborne  and  Rubinstein,  1990]  for  a detailed  review 

of  the  bargaining  game  of  Alternating  Offers. 

2 In  the  case  in  which  the  agents  may  divide  the  labor  be 
tween  all of them,  i.e.,  agreement  may  be reached  only  among 
all  the  agents,  the  model  of Alternative  Offers  is  usually  dis-

useful  when  the  agents  have  specific  types  of utility  functions 
(see  [Stahl,  1977]). 

3 A  similar  definition  can  be given  concerning  a division  of 

resources.

B u i l d i ng  A u t o n o m o us  A g e n ts 

One  of the  main  questions  is  how  one  can  use  the  above 
theoretical  results  in  building  agents  capable  of  acting 
and  negotiating  under  time  constraints. 

We  note  that  in  each  of the  cases  we  have  investigated, 
either  in  this  paper  or  in  [Kraus  and  Wilkenfeld,  1991a], 
where  we  presented  a  strategic  model  of negotiations  for 
only  two  agents,  the  perfect-equilibrium  strategies  are 
determined  by  parameters  of  the  situation. 

So,  one  can  supply  agents  w i th  the  appropriate  strate 
gies  for  each  of  the  cases  we  have  dealt  w i t h.  When  an 
agent  participates  in  one  of those  situations,  it  will  need 
to  recognize  which  type  of  situation  it  is  in.  Assum-
ing  the  agent  is  given  the  appropriate  arguments  about 
the  situation  it  is  involved  in  it  can  construct  the  exact 
strategy  for  its  specific  case  and  use  it  in  the  negotia 
tions.  Since  we  provide  the  agents  w i th  unique  perfect 
if  we  announce  it  to  the  other 
equilibrium  strategies, 
agents  in  the  environment,  the  other  agents  can  not  do 
better  than  to  use  their  similar  strategies. 

7  C o n c l u s i on  a nd  F u t u re  W o rk 

In  this  paper  we  demonstrate  how  the  incorporation 
of  time  into  the  negotiation  procedure  contributes  to  a 
more efficient  negotiation  process  where  there  are at  least 
three  agents  in  the  environment.  We  show  that  in  differ 
ent  cases  this  model,  together  w i th  the  assumption  that 
the  agents'  strategies  induce  an  equilibrium  in  any  stage 
of the  negotiation,  may  result  in  the  agent  being  able  to 
use  negotiation  strategies  t h at  w i ll  end  the  negotiation 
w i th  only  a small delay.  We suggest  that  these  results  are 
useful  in  particular  in  situations  w i th  time  constraints. 
We  are  in  the  process  of  using  this  model  in  develop 
ing  agents  that  w i ll  participate  in  crisis  situations  where 
time  is  an  i m p o r t a nt  issue. 

The  most  obvious  outstanding  question  concerns  the 
relaxation  of  the  assumption  of  complete  information.

In  many  situations  the  agents  do  not  have  full  infor 
m a t i on  concerning  the  other  agents.  Several  works  in 
game  theory  and  economics  have  considered  different 
versions  of  the  model  of  A l t e r n a t i ve  Offers  w i th  incom 
plete  i n f o r m a t i on  (see  for  example,  [Rubinstein,  1985; 
Osborne  and  Rubinstein,  1990;  Chatterjee  and  Samuel-
son,  1987]).  We  are  in  the  process  of  m o d i f y i ng  those 
results  for  use  in  D AI  environments.
