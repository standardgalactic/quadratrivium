Characteristics of Queueing Systems

• Key elements of queueing systems

• Customer: refers to anything that arrives at a facility and requires 
service, e.g., people, machines, trucks, emails, packets, frames.
• Server: refers to any resource that provides the requested service, 
e.g., repairpersons, machines, runways at airport, host, switch, 
router, disk drive, algorithm.

Calling Population

• Calling population: the population of potential customers, may 

be assumed to be finite or infinite.
• Finite population model: if arrival rate depends on the number of 
customers being served and waiting, e.g., model of one corporate 
jet, if it is being repaired, the repair arrival rate becomes zero.

System Capacity

• System Capacity: a limit on the number of customers that 

may be in the waiting line or system.
• Limited capacity, e.g., an automatic car wash only has room for 10 

cars to wait in line to enter the mechanism.
If system is full no customers are accepted anymore
• If system is full no customers are accepted anymore

Waiting line

Server

• Unlimited capacity, e.g., concert ticket sales with no limit on the 

number of people allowed to wait to purchase tickets.

Arrival Process

• For infinite-population models: 

• In terms of interarrival times of successive customers.

• Arrival types:

• Random arrivals: interarrival times usually characterized by a 

probability distribution.
probability distribution.
• Most important model: Poisson arrival process (with rate λ), where 
a time represents the interarrival time between customer n-1 and 
customer n, and is exponentially distributed (with mean 1/λ).
)
• Scheduled arrivals: interarrival times can be constant or

(

constant plus or minus a small random amount to represent 
early or late arrivals.
• Example: patients to a physician or scheduled airline flight arrivals 

y

to an airport

• At least one customer is assumed to always be present, 
At least one customer is assumed to always be present, 
so the server is never idle, e.g., sufficient raw material for 
a machine.

when it is operating, it becomes “not pending” the instant it

• Runtime of a customer is the length of time from departure from 

the queueing system until that customer’s next arrival to the 
queue, e.g., machine-repair problem, machines are customers

Queue Behavior and Queue Discipline

• Queue behavior: the actions of customers while in a 
queue waiting for service to begin, for example:
• Balk: leave when they see that the line is too long
• Renege: leave after being in the line when its moving too slowly
• Jockey: move from one line to a shorter line
• Jockey: move from one line to a shorter line

Fi

• Queue discipline: the logical ordering of customers in a 
Queue discipline: the logical ordering of customers in a 
queue that determines which customer is chosen for 
service when a server becomes free, for example:
• First-in-first-out (FIFO)
t (FIFO)
t
• Last-in-first-out (LIFO)
)
• Service in random order (SIRO)
• Shortest processing time first (SPT)
• Service according to priority (PR)

Service Times and Service Mechanism

• Service times of successive arrivals are denoted by S1, S2, S3.

• May be constant or random.
• {S1, S2, S3, …} is usually characterized as a sequence of independent 

and identically distributed (IID) random variables, e.g., 
• Exponential, Weibull, Gamma, Lognormal, and Truncated normal 

distribution.

• A queueing system consists of a number of service centers and 
• A queueing system consists of a number of service centers and 

interconnected queues.
• Each service center consists of some number of servers (c) working 

in parallel, upon getting to the head of the line, a customer takes the 
in parallel  upon getting to the head of the line  a customer takes the 
1st available server.

Prof. Dr. Mesut Güneş ▪ Ch. 8 Queueing Models

8.12

Queuing System: Example 1

• Example: consider a discount warehouse where customers may
• serve themselves before paying at the cashier (service center 1) or 
• served by a clerk (service center 2)

Prof. Dr. Mesut Güneş ▪ Ch. 8 Queueing Models

8.13

Queuing System: Example 1

• Wait for one of the three clerks:

• Batch service (a server serving several customers 
• Batch service (a server serving several customers 

simultaneously), or customer requires several servers 
simultaneously.

• Although working faster on average, Able’s greater service variability results 

in an average queue length about 30% greater than Baker’s.

M/M/1 Queues

• Suppose the service times in an M/G/1 queue are exponentially 

distributed with mean 1/μ, then the variance is σ 2 = 1/μ2. 
• M/M/1 queue is a useful approximate model when service times 
have standard deviation approximately equal to their means.

reduced by decreasing server utilization (ρ) or by decreasing

Networks of Queues

• Many systems are modeled as networks of single queues
• Customers departing from one queue may be routed to 

another

calling population and no limit on system capacity:
• Provided that no customers are created or destroyed in the queue, 

then the departure rate out of a queue is the same as the arrival rate
into the queue, over the long run.

• If customers arrive to queue i at rate λi, and a fraction 0 ≤ pij ≤ 1 of 
them are routed to queue j upon departure, then the arrival rate 
from queue i to queue j is λj =λi pij over the long run.

• All customers must see the cashier at service center 3, the overall rate to 

service center 3 is λ3 = λ1 + λ2 = 80 per hour.
• If μ3 = 90 per hour, then the utilization of the cashier is:

ρ3 = 80/90 = 0.89

Summary 

• Introduced basic concepts of queueing models.
• Showed how simulation, and sometimes mathematical analysis, can be 

used to estimate the performance measures of a system.

• Commonly used performance measures: L, LQ, w, wQ, ρ, and λe.
• When simulating any system that evolves over time, analyst must 
decide whether to study transient or steady-state behavior.
• Simple formulas exist for the steady-state behavior of some queues.
• Simple models can be solved mathematically, and can be useful in
