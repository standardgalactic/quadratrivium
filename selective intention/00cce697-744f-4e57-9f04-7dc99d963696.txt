Abstract 

Complex socio-scientific issues surrounding health or the environment, among others, are 

becoming increasingly controversial as the urgency for action increases. Learning and thinking 

critically about these issues requires epistemic cognition, i.e., thoughts and beliefs about the 

nature of knowledge, who holds knowledge, and how knowledge is justified. A review of the 

literature on epistemic cognition shows that epistemic cognition is a multifaceted phenomenon, 

including elements such as epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic 

emotions, yet many of these facets remain underexplored. The review also indicates that using 

more diverse and sophisticated methodologies is instrumental to advancing our understanding of 

epistemic cognition, as is the investigation of variables that may mediate relations between 

epistemic cognition and learning outcomes. Epistemic emotions are identified as one promising 

mediational mechanism that may explain how epistemic cognition relates to important outcomes. 

On the basis of this review, two manuscripts are proposed that address these issues. The first 

manuscript reports on two studies where a think-aloud methodology was employed to assess 

instances of epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-regulated learning during complex 

learning. Verbal data were used to examine the types of appraisals that serve as antecedents to 

epistemic emotions and to explore the immediate consequences of epistemic emotions for self-

regulated learning. A path analysis using self-report and verbal data provided support for a 

model of epistemic emotions as mediators between epistemic cognition and learning processes 

and outcomes. The second study tested the generalizability of this model by examining the 

mediational role of epistemic emotions in the relationship between epistemic cognition and 

critical thinking. Theoretical contributions, implications, limitations, and future directions are 

discussed.

Résumé 

Les problématiques socio-scientifiques complexes, liées par exemple à la santé ou à 

l'environnement, sont devenues aussi urgentes que controversées. Apprendre et avoir une pensée 

critique au sujet de ces questions nécessite une pensée épistémique adaptée, c’est-à-dire d’avoir 

une réflexion et d’adopter des croyances productives au sujet de la nature de la connaissance, à 

savoir qui la détient et comment elle est justifiée. Une recension des écrits sur la cognition 

épistémique montre que celle-ci est multiple, incluant des éléments tels que les croyances 

épistémiques, les objectifs épistémiques, les stratégies épistémiques et les émotions 

épistémiques, tout en indiquant que plusieurs de ces facettes demeurent empiriquement peu 

explorées. Les conclusions de cette recension indiquent également que pour améliorer notre 

compréhension de la cognition épistémique, il est essentiel d’utiliser des méthodologies plus 

diverses et sophistiquées, ainsi que d’investiguer les variables médiatrices susceptibles 

d’intervenir dans la relation entre la cognition épistémique et l’apprentissage. Les émotions 

épistémiques sont identifiées comme un mécanisme médiateur prometteur qui pourrait expliquer 

l’influence de la cognition épistémique sur des résultats importants. Ces lacunes font l’objet de 

deux articles présentés ici. Le premier article décrit deux études empiriques où la cognition 

épistémique, les émotions épistémiques et l'apprentissage autorégulé sont mesurés à l’aide d’un 

protocole de réflexion à voix haute au cours d'un épisode d’apprentissage complexe. Ces données 

ont été utilisées pour examiner les types d’évaluations cognitives qui servent d’antécédents aux 

émotions épistémiques, ainsi qu’afin d’explorer les conséquences immédiates des émotions 

épistémiques sur l’apprentissage autorégulé. Une analyse de trajectoire appuie un modèle 

prédictif où les émotions épistémiques constituent un médiateur entre la cognition épistémique et 

les divers processus et résultats d'apprentissage. Le deuxième article présente une deuxième

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 2 

The digital age is changing how we relate to knowledge. The advent of the web, social 

media, algorithmic filtering, and the proliferation of massive amounts of data is creating a 

situation where knowledge is increasingly dispersed across networks, resulting in inescapable 

echo chambers and the deinstitutionalization of learning. Indeed, the way individuals search, vet, 

build, and use knowledge today is by accessing a variety of sources of information that vary in 

credibility and trustworthiness. The multiplicity of voices is replacing the monolithic 

authoritative sources of knowledge that once illuminated minds, revealing the fundamentally 

complex and uncertain nature of knowledge, and the challenges of knowing. 

Still, traditional and mainstream educational systems, by relying on prescribed 

knowledge representations and enforcing an answer-oriented assessment culture, promote an 

understanding of knowledge as objective and factual. As a result, transitioning from learning in 

the “safe” educational environment into the “wild,” uncertain world can pose a challenge for 

many. Successfully managing that transition requires epistemic cognition. Epistemic cognition 

refers to the process by which learners think about the forms of knowledge, its criteria and limits, 

to decide what to do or what to believe (Greene, Sandoval, & Bråten, 2016). 

For those who are unprepared, being faced with the world’s uncertainty and complexity is 

an experience that is likely to leave individuals feeling anxious, confused, or frustrated, among 

others. Throughout this dissertation, these knowledge- and knowing-related emotions are termed 

epistemic emotions. Despite long-standing calls to explore the affective facet of epistemic 

cognition (e.g., Mansfield and Clinchy, 2002; Pintrich, 2000), little research to date has been 

dedicated to addressing this matter and important questions remain unanswered. How do 

epistemic emotions relate to epistemic cognition? What epistemic emotions are experienced by 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 3 

individuals in different contexts? What role do epistemic emotions play in learning processes? 

And how can these emotions be leveraged to improve important educational outcomes? 

The purpose of this dissertation is to theoretically and empirically address these questions 

by investigating the nature and function of epistemic emotions in the context of complex 

learning. What I intend to demonstrate with this thesis is that contending with complex and 

controversial knowledge elicits knowledge- and knowing-related beliefs, cognitions, and 

emotions that relate to learning and higher-order thinking processes such as critical thinking. In 

Chapter 3, I demonstrate that epistemic cognition is a significant predictor of epistemic 

emotions, and that epistemic emotions significantly mediate relations between epistemic 

cognition and self-regulated learning. Further, I demonstrate that predictable sequences of 

occurrences exist between epistemic emotions and learning strategies. In Chapter 4, I 

demonstrate that relations between epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions can be 

generalized to other higher-order thinking processes, namely critical thinking.  

Additional themes are explored throughout this dissertation that link together the three 

manuscripts contained herein: (1) controversial socio-scientific issues (2) a broadened 

conceptualization of epistemic cognition, and (3) novel research methodologies. First, epistemic 

cognition is likely to be most relevant in situations where knowledge is at issue, such as when 

conflicting claims of varied levels of credibility exist on the same issue, or when phenomena are 

represented by opposing perspectives that propose seemingly irreconcilable explanations. This is 

the case of the topics of focus in Chapter 3 (i.e., climate change) and Chapter 4 (i.e., genetically 

modified foods). Second, whereas most research on epistemic cognition to date has focused 

solely on individuals’ epistemic beliefs (Greene, Cartiff & Duke, 2018; Muis & Singh, 2018), in 

this dissertation, I adopt a broadened conceptualization of epistemic cognition that is better 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 4 

aligned with recent frameworks and which considers epistemic cognition as multifaceted, 

comprised not only of epistemic beliefs, but also of epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and 

epistemic experiences, including epistemic emotions (Muis & Singh, 2018). This decision was 

made as the result of a review of the literature on the subject (see Chapter 2) which guided the 

experimental design and analyses of the studies contained herein. Third, I identify limitations 

associated with traditional research methodologies used in epistemic cognition research (Chapter 

2) and adopt methodologies that are aligned with a broadened conceptualization of epistemic 

cognition, namely in the form of a think-aloud protocol that allowed me to operationalize 

distinctions between epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, and epistemic strategies (Chapter 3). I 

also present an analytic technique seldom used in emotion research, namely a state-transition 

analysis, that allowed me to study relations between epistemic emotions and learning processes 

on a small timescale (Chapter 3). 

Overall, the manuscripts contained in the dissertation address the following 

complimentary research questions: 

1)  What is epistemic cognition and how can it be measured? (Chapter 2) 

2)  What epistemic emotions are experienced during learning of complex and controversial 

socio-scientific topics, and what are the antecedents of these epistemic emotions? 

(Chapters 3 and 4)  

3)  What are the immediate and general consequences of epistemic emotions on processes of 

self-regulated learning? (Chapter 3) And do these consequences generalize to other high-

order thinking processes, such as critical thinking? (Chapter 4) 

4)  What role do epistemic emotions play in mediating the relationship between epistemic 

cognition and learning processes and outcomes? (Chapters 3 and 4) 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 5 

In addressing these questions, this dissertation contributes new knowledge in 

understanding the role of epistemic cognition in complex learning and thinking situations, and 

further contributes to understanding the nature and role of epistemic emotions in these contexts. 

As a result, this dissertation adds information that can be used to elaborate guidelines for 

teachers and science communicators to better leverage individuals’ beliefs, cognitions, and 

emotions to promote greater learning and critical thinking in a complex and uncertain world. 

Overview of the Chapters  

To address the above-mentioned questions, Chapter 2 presents a critical and 

comprehensive review of the literature on epistemic cognition. The review addresses the 

following questions: How can epistemic cognition be conceptualized, and how can it be 

measured? I also highlight unresolved issues in theories of epistemic cognition and identify 

elements contained in current conceptualizations that are likely to form fruitful avenues to 

advance knowledge on epistemic cognition. These avenues for future work include the study of 

epistemic emotions as one mediational mechanism to explain how epistemic cognition relates to 

learning processes and outcomes. Further, this review provides the basis on which I critique 

methods typically employed to measure epistemic cognition, which guided methodological 

choices throughout the dissertation.  

Chapter 3 presents two empirical studies that employed self-report instruments and a 

think-aloud protocol to gather data on the antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions. 

This data collection was conducted in the context of a complex learning situation that involved 

learning about a controversial socio-scientific topic across multiple conflicting documents. Study 

1 presents an exploration of three antecedents of epistemic emotions and the identification of 

sequences of transitions between epistemic emotions and learning and epistemic strategies. 

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 6 

Further, I empirically explore relations between offline epistemic beliefs and online epistemic 

cognition, which constitutes one of the unique contributions of this study. In Study 2, I use self-

report and verbal data to test a predictive model of epistemic emotions as mediators between 

epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning processes and outcomes.  

Chapter 4 further tests the generalizability of this model by examining the mediational 

role of epistemic emotions in the relationship between epistemic cognition and one important 

higher-order thinking process: critical thinking. Results from this study provide further support 

for the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition and adds substantial nuances to our 

understanding of the role of several epistemic emotions.  

Lastly, Chapter 5 concludes this dissertation with a summary of the theoretical and 

methodological contributions to the advancement of knowledge, along with a discussion of the 

limitations and future directions for research.

The 21st century, marked by unprecedented access to information and the explosion of self-

authored, unregulated content, poses the challenge of educating individuals who can discern 

useful and trustworthy contributions to knowledge from fraudulent, dogmatic, or otherwise fake 

claims (Sandoval, Greene, & Bråten, 2016). Thinking deeply and critically about matters of 

knowledge is not something that comes easily or naturally, and teaching students to think in such 

ways is challenging (Sinatra, Kienhues, & Hofer, 2014). As will be addressed in this chapter, 

there exists a growing body of literature that indicates that epistemic cognition “matters” (Kuhn 

& Weinstock, 2002). Broadly stated, epistemic cognition refers to how people understand, 

construct, and reason about knowledge, its sources and justification. Individuals engage in 

epistemic cognition when they are required to determine who or what to believe, problem solve, 

or make decisions about knowledge or information problems (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; Greene, 

Sandoval, & Bråten, 2016a; Sinatra, 2016).  

Empirically, epistemic cognition has been related to competent self-regulated learning, 

motivation, and learning achievement (Muis, 2004; 2007). However, a recent meta-analysis 

shows that the effect of epistemic cognition on learning achievement is significant but 

surprisingly small (Greene, Cartiff, & Duke, 2018). Understanding the conceptual and 

methodological challenges inherent to the field of epistemic cognition can help interpret this 

finding and illuminate paths forward to advance knowledge on epistemic cognition. As such, the 

goal of the present chapter is to construct a knowledge foundation that can be used to advance 

this promising line of research. Specifically, I ask the following questions: 1- How is epistemic 

cognition conceptualized? And 2- What methods can be used to examine epistemic cognition?  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 10 

To answer these questions, I first review traditional and contemporary frameworks of 

epistemic cognition and underline their unique contributions and shortcomings. Second, I outline 

the challenges inherent to epistemic cognition measurement, and explore solutions.  

Part 1: What is Epistemic Cognition and How Is It Conceptualized? 

The study of epistemic cognition can be situated at the crossroads of psychology (e.g., 

Piaget’s [1950] genetic epistemology), sociology (e.g., Thomas Kuhn’s [1962] structures of 

scientific revolutions) and philosophy, reaching as far back as the works of Plato and Aristotle. 

In educational psychology, the interest for epistemic cognition is in understanding the nature and 

functions of individuals’ thoughts and beliefs about how knowledge is acquired, justified and 

used. Throughout this chapter, I use the term epistemic cognition (e.g., Chinn, Buckland, & 

Samarapungavan, 2011; Greene et al., 2016a) to refer to this broad area of research. Other 

scholars have used the terms personal epistemology (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997), epistemic beliefs 

(e.g., Muis, Bendixen, & Haerle, 2006), and epistemic thinking (e.g. Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; 

Muis & Singh, 2018). The aim of this section is to review the frameworks that populate the field 

of epistemic cognition through a presentation of different perspectives’ components, 

assumptions, contributions, and limitations. Against this backdrop, current trends and issues are 

discussed. 

Given their conceptual importance and prominence in this chapter, it is crucial to 

differentiate between various “epistemic” terms. As mentioned above, I choose the term 

epistemic cognition to refer to both the field of investigation and the phenomenon of individuals’ 

thoughts, beliefs, and processes that relate to the nature of knowledge and knowing. Further, 

epistemological beliefs (e.g., Schommer, 1990) or epistemic beliefs (e.g., Muis et al., 2006; Muis, 

2007) are used to refer to individuals’ tacit beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing. 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 11 

Greene, Azevedo, and Torney-Purta (2008) aptly argued that the term “epistemological” refers to 

the study of epistemology, whereas the term “epistemic” evokes more accurately what is 

concerned with knowledge and knowing per se. As such, students are much more likely to hold 

“epistemic beliefs” (beliefs about knowledge and knowing) than “epistemological beliefs” 

(beliefs about the study of epistemology). Epistemic cognition, on the other hand, can be seen as 

a situated, dynamic process of thinking, used to reason, problem solve, or make decisions about 

information problems (Hofer, 2016; Sinatra, 2016). The content of epistemic cognition draws 

upon more stable cognitive and metacognitive structures such as knowledge, beliefs, and 

strategies. In the ensuing pages, I respect and use the terminology employed by authors when 

discussing their work. 

Perspectives in Epistemic Cognition 

The field of epistemic cognition comprises various frameworks that have frequently been 

grouped into three distinct perspectives (e.g., Hofer, 2001): the developmental, 

multidimensional, and epistemological resources perspectives. For the purpose of this review, 

recent frameworks have been grouped into a fourth perspective that I call “new 

conceptualizations.” 

The developmental perspective. The major tenet of the developmental perspective is 

that epistemic cognition develops throughout the lifespan, and that epistemic development is a 

crucial part of education. The developmental perspective is largely derived from the work of 

Perry (1970), who proposed a sequence of stages of epistemic growth that characterize the 

intellectual development of university students during their college years. Many scholars have 

endeavored to refine and extend Perry’s developmental sequence. Each framework introduces a 

sequence of developmental phases that reflect qualitative changes in epistemic cognition.

 12 

Notable frameworks that have adopted a developmental perspective include Belenky and 

colleagues’ (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, & Tarule, 1986) “ways of knowing” framework, 

Baxter Magolda’s (1992; 2004) epistemological reflection framework, King and Kitchener’s 

(1994; 2004) reflective judgment framework, and Kuhn and colleagues’ framework of 

epistemological understanding, more aptly labelled argumentative reasoning (Kuhn, 1991; Kuhn, 

Cheney & Weinstock, 2000; Kuhn, & Park, 2005; Kuhn & Weinstock, 2002). I next elaborate on 

Kuhn and colleagues’ framework, as the developmental sequence they proposed consolidates 

previous conceptual efforts, and as such, has gained prominence that still holds to date.  

Kuhn et al. (2000) proposed a sequence of three developmental phases that reflect a 

progressive integration and coordination of the objective and subjective dimensions of knowing. 

These levels of development include (1) absolutism, (2) multiplism, and (3) evaluativism. 

Individuals who embrace an absolutist view believe that assertions are either correct or incorrect, 

and that facts represent reality, such that knowledge is objective and certain. This form of 

thinking often characterizes thinking in childhood but can be observed in older persons. 

Individuals who adopt a multiplist perspective view knowledge as subjective, uncertain, and 

idiosyncratic. This epistemic orientation is often characteristic of adolescents, who tend to view 

assertions as freely chosen opinions. Lastly, evaluativists reconcile the objective and subjective 

aspects of knowledge and knowing. Evaluativists acknowledge that certain opinions are more 

justified than others, based on the evaluation of arguments and evidence via norms of inquiry. 

This perspective is more likely to develop in late adolescence or adulthood, if ever.  

Taken together, the developmental frameworks include a number of assumptions. The 

central assumption of this perspective is that the development of epistemic cognition is 

characterized by a sequence of one-dimensional, qualitatively different stages, and consists of 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 13 

fully abandoning one stage to enter a more advanced one. This assumption has been challenged 

by Schommer (1990), among others, who proposed that epistemic development should instead be 

conceived as multidimensional, where different dimensions develop at various rates. A second 

important assumption of the developmental frameworks is that individuals’ stages of 

development are not specific to a particular field or domain of knowledge. This assumption has 

been challenged namely by Hofer (2000), and later by Muis et al. (2006), who showed that 

patterns in epistemic development vary across domains. A last key assumption is that the 

development of epistemic cognition beyond the initial positions (e.g., absolutist stage) does not 

begin until learners reach college. This assumption has been challenged by results obtained by 

others (see Chandler, Hallett & Sokol, 2002; Kuhn et al., 2000, Mason & Scirica, 2006), who 

found that younger students are capable of displaying more advanced epistemic cognition.  

Aside from the challenged assumptions mentioned above, the developmental frameworks 

have been criticized for their lack of consideration for the cultural specificity of epistemic 

cognition and its development. For instance, do children adopt an absolutist view of knowledge 

as a result of an inevitable developmental pattern, or due to the influence of beliefs conveyed in 

the home environment? To this point, Muis et al. (2006) suggested that epistemic beliefs are 

socially constructed and context-bound, and that epistemic beliefs conveyed at home are likely to 

influence the beliefs a child adopts before entering the educational system.  

In sum, the epistemic developmental theories have made important contributions to the 

epistemic cognition literature, first by proposing a developmental sequence of personal 

epistemology that is still widely referred to these days. Another notable contribution has been to 

establish the importance of epistemic cognition in educational psychology by connecting facets 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 14 

of epistemic cognition to other skills such as argumentation (Kuhn, 1991; 1993), critical thinking 

(Kuhn, 1999), self-reflection, and justification (King & Kitchener, 1994; 2004).  

The multidimensional perspective. Researchers who assume a multidimensional 

perspective have focused on identifying the underlying dimensions of epistemic cognition, as 

well as identifying how variations on these dimensions can be more or less availing for learning 

processes and outcomes. The central assumption is that epistemic cognition draws from 

epistemic beliefs, and that the way learners apprehend and contend with knowledge is influenced 

by these beliefs (Hofer, 2001). This line of research was initiated by Schommer (1990), who 

questioned the assumption that epistemic cognition is one-dimensional. Schommer proposed a 

multidimensional framework of epistemological beliefs that includes five independent but related 

dimensions to epistemic beliefs. She stipulated that beliefs develop alongside each dimension 

from a basic or “naïve” position to a more mature or “sophisticated” position (Schommer, 1994).  

Building from Schommer’s framework, Hofer and Pintrich (1997) later proposed a four-

dimensional framework of epistemic beliefs. The first dimension, the certainty of knowledge, 

refers to beliefs about the nature of knowledge, from the belief that truths are fixed and 

unchanging to the belief that knowledge is tentative and evolving. The simplicity of knowledge 

also concerns the nature of knowledge, ranging from the belief that knowledge is best described 

as an accumulation of independent and concrete facts, to the belief that knowledge consists of a 

complex structure of interrelated propositions. The source of knowledge concerns the process of 

knowing and refers to the role of the self and others as sources of knowledge. A less 

constructivist view is that knowledge originates outside of the self and resides in experts or other 

authorities. A more constructivist view conceptualizes the self as a knower who has the ability to 

generate knowledge via active construction. The last dimension, the justification for knowing 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 15 

concerns how individuals evaluate knowledge claims, from an unquestioning reliance on 

authorities (e.g., experts, teachers, textbook authors) to the examination, evaluation, and 

integration of evidence, reasons, and arguments from various perspectives. Presumably, as 

epistemic beliefs develop into more constructivist forms, individuals become better able to detect 

and address incongruent knowledge representations, questionable sources, and unjustified 

knowledge claims. 

The multidimensional frameworks first assumed the domain generality of epistemic 

beliefs. Later, at the outcome of an extensive review of theoretical and empirical literature, Muis 

et al. (2006) proposed that epistemic beliefs are both domain-general and domain-specific. Muis 

et al. proposed the Theory of Integrated Domain in Epistemology (the TIDE framework) which 

stipulates that individuals first develop general epistemic beliefs, then academic epistemic 

beliefs, and later, domain-specific epistemic beliefs, as individuals deepen their understanding of 

certain academic or professional domains. Muis and colleagues explained that these beliefs are 

mutually influential. 

In terms of assumptions, the multidimensional frameworks assume that epistemic beliefs 

do not develop homogeneously, indicating that a learner can simultaneously espouse more and 

less constructivist beliefs on different dimensions. It is also assumed that epistemic beliefs 

develop from a “naïve” to a “sophisticated” view of knowledge. Although the terms “naïve” and 

“sophisticated” have been criticized for insinuating that researchers know what is best to believe 

(Schommer-Aikins, 2002; Muis, 2004), the terms continue to be widely used in the literature to 

date. Alternatively, the terms “availing and non-availing” (Muis, 2004) as well as “less and more 

constructivist” (e.g., Muis, 2007) have been suggested. However, the assumption that mature 

beliefs always align with a constructivist epistemology has been challenged by Chinn et al., 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 16 

(2011), and more recently by Greene and Yu (2014). In their philosophically anchored 

framework, Chinn et al. (2011) argued that individuals may choose to take the stance of certainty 

towards claims that appear to be extremely well justified. Indeed, Greene and Yu (2014) found 

that experts sometimes adopt the view that some form of knowledge (such as “bedrock” 

historical knowledge) is simple and certain, which is a belief typically associated with a naïve or 

less constructivist view. 

Lastly, an assumption that is prevalent in multidimensional frameworks is that epistemic 

beliefs are amenable to change. Whereas epistemic development is viewed as the result of a 

maturation process, epistemic change is better described as variations in epistemic cognition that 

result from interactions with various contexts (Muis, Trevors, & Chevrier, 2016). Indeed, several 

researchers have been successful at obtaining lasting change in beliefs with short text-based 

interventions (Bromme, Pieschl, & Stahl, 2010; Ferguson & Bråten, 2013; Porsch & Bromme, 

2011), as well as longer-term instructional interventions (Muis & Duffy, 2013). However, others 

have observed that text-based interventions can lead to regression towards less constructivist 

beliefs (Kienhues, Bromme & Stahl, 2008). Overall, empirical evidence suggests that epistemic 

change is arduous and unlikely to happen spontaneously without specifically targeted 

interventions (Sinatra, 2016).  

Taken together, the multidimensional frameworks have made key contributions that still 

shape the field of epistemic cognition today. First, these frameworks have introduced the notion 

of epistemic beliefs as a system of more or less independent dimensions. Second, they brought 

greater emphasis to the relation between epistemic beliefs and other facets of learning, such as 

academic performance (Schommer, 1990), learning strategies (Schommer, Crouse & Rhodes, 

1992), and motivation (Muis, 2004). Another important contribution has been to adopt a more 

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 17 

quantitative approach to epistemic beliefs research than theretofore, triggered by the need to 

statistically test the multidimensionality proposed in frameworks.  

The multidimensional frameworks, however, are not without limitations. These include a 

lack of consideration for the context specificity of epistemic cognition, a lack of integration of 

philosophical considerations in epistemic cognition, as well as a narrow focus on epistemic 

beliefs as a unique component of epistemic cognition. These limitations have been taken on by 

researchers who proposed alternative frameworks, which are presented next. 

The epistemological resources perspective. Hammer and Elby (2002; 2003) proposed 

that epistemic cognition operates on the basis of fine-grained and context-specific cognitive 

resources that they call epistemological resources. The authors observed that individuals, from a 

very young age on, draw from a multitude of epistemological resources to apprehend knowledge 

and knowing. Epistemological resources refer to believed propositions about the nature of 

knowledge (e.g., “knowledge as direct perception”), as well as the resources used to understand 

epistemological activities (e.g., “accumulation” of knowledge), epistemological forms (e.g., 

“categories”), or epistemological stances (e.g., “doubting”). This framework challenges the idea 

that epistemic beliefs are stable across contexts. The authors argue that the activation of 

epistemological resources is context- and content-dependent, and as such, is likely to vary 

throughout a single learning task.  

The epistemological resources perspective has contributed a greater emphasis on the 

context specificity of epistemic cognition, as well as the dynamic nature of belief activation. 

However, this perspective has limited potential for empirical research as it does not offer well-

fleshed predictions with regard to relations between epistemological resources and other learning 

processes and outcomes and is missing a clear perspective on epistemic development.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

New conceptualizations: Beyond epistemic beliefs. A broader perspective on epistemic 

cognition has recently emerged, one that goes beyond the sole focus on individuals’ beliefs about 

knowledge and knowing. New frameworks take into account a wider variety of epistemic 

phenomena, including components borrowed from psychology and philosophy (e.g., epistemic 

emotions [Muis et al., 2015]), epistemic vice and virtues [Chinn et al., 2011], and ontological 

dimensions [Greene et al., 2008]).  

Epistemic and ontological cognition. Greene, Azevedo and Torney-Purta (2008) 

borrowed from developmental and multidimensional frameworks to propose a framework of 

epistemic and ontological cognition that emphasizes not only individuals’ beliefs about 

knowledge and knowing, but also the process by which beliefs are acquired and used. Greene et 

al. (2008) argued that given its centrality, the justification dimension of epistemic cognition 

should be better elaborated, and assigned a focal role in epistemic research, namely by exploring 

how and when individuals rely on various means of justification (i.e., justification by authority, 

personal justification, multiple sources). Greene et al. further argued that the justification 

dimension is the only one that is rightfully epistemic. The certainty and simplicity dimensions, 

they argued, tap into individuals’ views about the nature of reality and, as such, should be 

labelled ontological cognition.  

In terms of development, Greene et al. (2008) stipulated that individuals first develop 

absolutist beliefs that later morph into multiplicist beliefs, and that may later turn into 

evaluativistic beliefs. To address the fact that not all adults reach evaluativism, the authors 

proposed that there exist two paths for multiplicists: Individuals either adopt a dogmatic position, 

wherein they turn to authoritative sources to know what to believe, or else they adopt a skeptical 

stance, wherein they choose to view all knowledge as subjective and personal. Depending on 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 19 

experiences and circumstances, individuals may finally move into evaluativism, wherein they 

acknowledge the need for justification, and rely on a variety of means of justification that they 

use discriminately, depending on the context. 

New dimensions to epistemic cognition. Building from the work of Greene et al. (2008), 

Chinn, Buckland, and Samarapungavan (2011) presented a philosophically anchored framework 

that included substantial additions and extensions to previous frameworks that focused only on 

epistemic beliefs. The authors introduced an array of novel components: Epistemic aims refer to 

a subset of learning goals adopted by learners that relate to inquiry, and include attaining 

knowledge, understanding, or true beliefs. Epistemic virtues and vices refer to dispositions that 

facilitate or hinder the achievement or epistemic aims. Epistemic virtues are dispositions that 

assist individuals in accomplishing epistemic aims, and include for instance intellectual courage 

and open-mindedness. On the other hand, epistemic vices are another type of disposition that 

impedes the accomplishment of epistemic aims, such as close-mindedness and dogmatism. 

Further, reliable and unreliable processes refer to individuals’ theories or beliefs about whether 

the cognitive and metacognitive processes, and methods put in place to achieve epistemic aims 

are reliable or unreliable under the conditions in which they are used.  

Three facets of epistemic cognition. One persistent debate in the literature has been over 

the boundaries between cognitive and metacognitive aspects of personal epistemology. Barzilai 

and Zohar (2014) tackled that issue by proposing a framework that considers epistemic thinking 

(the term they employ) through the lens of metacognition. They proposed that epistemic thinking 

is multifaceted; specifically, that it includes three epistemic facets: a metacognitive, a cognitive, 

and an experiential facet. They define epistemic metacognition as the reflective level of personal 

epistemology. It includes epistemic metacognitive knowledge about persons as knowers 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 20 

(themselves as much as others), as well as about tasks and strategies that lead to knowledge. 

Epistemic metacognitive knowledge includes individuals’ epistemic beliefs about knowledge and 

knowing. Additionally, individuals develop epistemic metacognitive skills, which Barzilai and 

Zohar define as processes of regulation and control that involve planning, monitoring, and 

evaluation of individuals’ epistemic thinking. 

Epistemic cognition, in turn, is conceptualized by Barzilai and Zohar as the operational or 

strategic level of personal epistemology. It involves thinking about the knowledge- and knowing-

related characteristics of information, as well as engaging in epistemic strategies to evaluate 

knowledge claims. They define epistemic cognition as an inherently dynamic process that can 

manifest in the form of cognitive enactments. Barzilai and Zohar (2014) drew from the work of 

Richter and colleagues (Richter & Schmid, 2010; Schroeder, Richter, & Hoever, 2008) to define 

epistemic strategies as strategic cognitive activities that consider the epistemic status of 

information, and that are aimed at achieving reliable knowledge by evaluating knowledge claims 

and sources, considering multiple perspectives, and more. Epistemic strategies include, for 

instance, sourcing strategies (i.e., evaluating the trustworthiness of sources [Strømsø, Bråten & 

Britt, 2010]), knowledge validation strategies (i.e., evaluating whether knowledge claims are 

well justified [Richter & Schmid, 2010]), and integration strategies (i.e., providing explanations 

to account for differences between various perspectives [Barzilai & Zohar, 2012]).  

Lastly, Barzilai and Zohar (2014) proposed an experiential facet to personal 

epistemology. Epistemic experiences refer to cognitive or affective experiences that can arise in 

the face of uncertainty or ambiguity. Muis, Chevrier, and Singh (2018) have elaborated upon this 

third facet by proposing an integrated framework that incorporates the role of epistemic emotions 

in epistemic cognition.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 21 

The role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition. Muis et al. (2018) proposed a 

model of epistemic cognition anchored in a self-regulated learning perspective. The model’s 

main contribution has been to integrate the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition. 

Epistemic emotions are defined as affective experiences that arise out of information-oriented 

appraisals related to the alignment or misalignment between incoming information and existing 

beliefs or knowledge structures, or when inconsistencies or other discrepancies in processing the 

information cause cognitive disequilibrium (D’Mello, Lehman, Pekrun, & Graesser, 2014). 

Epistemic emotions include, for instance, surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, 

frustration, and boredom (Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017).  

In their model, Muis and colleagues proposed that epistemic beliefs, epistemic values, 

and self-efficacy are activated as a task definition is produced. In turn, appraisals related to these 

beliefs and values predict the epistemic emotions that will arise during learning. They further 

suggested that epistemic emotions predict epistemic aims and other learning goals, and in turn 

predict learning processes and outcomes. Overall, they proposed that epistemic emotions mediate 

relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. In other words, epistemic emotions 

explain in part how epistemic cognition relates to self-regulated learning (Muis et al., 2015; 

Trevors et al., 2016). 

Taken together, the recent frameworks of epistemic cognition presented above make 

substantial contributions to the literature. Greene et al. (2008) contributed a framework that 

draws from philosophical epistemology and emphasizes the notion of epistemic cognition, as 

opposed to the sole notion of epistemic beliefs. One major contribution of Chinn et al.’s (2011) 

work has been to identify caveats in epistemic research that had not been addressed heretofore: 

They called upon researchers to examine how individuals’ conceptions of reliable processes may 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 22 

vary in different contexts, and to examine how epistemic cognition may vary across various 

types of knowledge (e.g., declarative, procedural, principled knowledge). Barzilai and Zohar’s 

(2014) metacognitive framework offered clear distinctions between epistemic metacognition and 

epistemic cognition that invite researchers to reconsider and clarify definitions. Lastly, Muis and 

colleagues’ (2018) model has responded to a long-standing call to integrate emotions into 

epistemic cognition research (see Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993; Sinatra, 2005) and have 

proposed epistemic emotions as one important mediator in the relationship between epistemic 

cognition and self-regulated learning. Taken together, the recent conceptual frameworks 

reviewed here provide the grounds on which new research questions and hypotheses can be 

proposed.  

Conceptual Issues 

The literature review presented above has led to the identification of underlying 

conceptual issues that are still unresolved to date. These include: the proliferation of new terms, 

the specificity of epistemic cognition, the nature of advanced or sophisticated epistemic 

cognition, and the nature and role of justification. These issues are discussed in turn. 

The proliferation of new terms. In the conclusion to their recent Handbook of epistemic 

cognition, Greene and colleagues (2016b) documented what they called “the proliferation of 

terms with some form of the adjective ‘epistemic’ attached” (p. 496). The underlying question is 

that of the value or usefulness of differentiating the “epistemic” version of a construct from its 

“non-epistemic” version. Alexander (2016) and Greene et al. (2016c) have warned against an 

explosion of terminology that may hurt the important principle of parsimony. Alexander (2016) 

called for more coherence and consistency in the language employed, and implored researchers 

to consider whether new terms add any explanatory power to the field before introducing them. 

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 23 

In order to achieve a balance between parsimony and explanatory power, I argue that a 

criterion or criteria should be used to differentiate what is epistemic from what is not. 

Traditionally, authors have defined what is epistemic by emphasizing the knowledge- or 

knowing-related focus of a construct. Further, Chinn and colleagues (Chinn et al., 2011; Chinn & 

Reinhart, 2016) proposed to consider whether epistemic aims are present in order to determine 

whether a cognition or enactment is epistemic in nature. Finally, Muis et al. (2015) proposed that 

emotions such as frustration or anxiety can be considered epistemic when the object focus of the 

emotion is related to knowledge, knowing, and the processing of information. These latter 

criteria suggest an empirical avenue to explore whether various constructs are indeed connected 

to individuals’ epistemic cognition. 

Overall, I argue that the introduction of well-defined “epistemic” terms can be beneficial, 

first to advance our fundamental understanding of epistemic cognition, and second, to draw 

attention on this important facet of learning. Indeed, in spite of 40 years of empirical efforts that 

demonstrate that epistemic cognition “matters” (Kuhn & Weinstock, 2002), very few educational 

curricula take students’ (and teachers’) epistemic cognition into account when designing 

educational environments or devising instructional interventions (Hofer, 2016; Muis et al., 

2016).  

It is important to note that epistemic cognition researchers are not arguing that there exist 

epistemic constructs that are conceptually and empirically different from other cognitive and 

metacognitive aspects of thinking. Rather, epistemic cognition is situated within existing 

structures, and can be interpreted within existing frameworks (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; Bromme 

et al., 2010; Greene, Yu, & Copeland, 2014; Hofer, 2004a; Muis, 2007). In other words, what 

makes a construct “epistemic” is its concern, rather than its form. Distinguishing “epistemic” 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 24 

constructs from other motivational or contextual forces (i.e., distinguishing epistemic anxiety in 

the face of uncertain knowledge versus performance anxiety in the face of a test) may lead to the 

identification of undue conflations or unearth hidden mediators. In sum, more research will be 

needed to determine which epistemic mechanisms are actually in place, and to determine which 

terms should be retained in our common vocabulary.  

It is further important to note that epistemic cognition researchers are not arguing that all 

learning is epistemic, nor that all learning tasks should be designed to elicit epistemic cognition. 

For instance, memorizing the order of the planets in the solar system is certainly an activity that 

requires less epistemic cognition than building an argument after having consulted multiple 

sources. However, by positing the existence of epistemic cognition, epistemic aims, epistemic 

strategies, or epistemic emotions, researchers can better explore the specific mechanisms by 

which epistemic cognition occurs. Ultimately, such an endeavor may help researchers, educators, 

and policy makers to produce more specific instructional guidelines and curricula that foster the 

development of deeper learning, greater disciplinary integration, as well as high-order thinking.  

The specificity of epistemic cognition. The question of the contextual specificity of 

epistemic cognition has received much attention in recent years. One question concerns whether 

or not different epistemic belief dimensions should be taken into account across domains. 

Indeed, researchers who assume the domain-specificity of epistemic cognition also posit that 

underlying dimensions (i.e., simplicity, complexity, source, justification) are valid across all 

domains – that there are no dimensions that are unique to a particular domain. However, recent 

findings by Greene and Yu (2014) challenge this assumption: After having interviewed 

university professors in various disciplines, Greene et al. concluded to obvious similarities in less 

advanced, or “naïve,” beliefs across disciplines (e.g., the belief that knowledge corresponds to a 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 25 

list of facts) but found that advanced beliefs were much more differentiated across disciplines. 

For instance, biology professors referred to the importance of connected knowledge, whereas 

history professors focused on interpretations. In Greene and Yu’s (2014) words, “it is difficult to 

imagine a domain-general definition of the nature of knowledge factors that could capture 

advanced experimentation skills in biology, as well as historical empathy skills in history” (p. 

20).  

The nature of sophistication. Beyond the question of the suitability of epithets such as 

“naïve” or “less constructivist” to qualify less developed epistemic beliefs, the question of the 

nature of sophistication remains a current debate. One issue concerns the assumption that mature 

epistemic cognition (understood as the beliefs, sources evaluations and means of justification 

espoused by experts) is “more constructivist”. Indeed, evidence obtained by Greene and Yu 

(2014) indicates that experts at times espouse the belief that types of knowledge are rather simple 

and certain. This is the case, for example, of declarative knowledge in history, or of procedural 

knowledge in chemistry.  

A related issue is the problematic assumption that more constructivist beliefs are superior 

in all situations (see Bromme, Kienhues, & Stahl, 2008, Bromme et al., 2010; Greene, Muis, & 

Pieschl, 2010). Indeed, in instances where prior knowledge and epistemic aims are low (i.e., 

where basic understanding is sufficient), it may be more adaptive to assume that knowledge is 

simple and that experts are trustworthy sources. Alexander and colleagues (Alexander, 2016; 

Alexander, Winters, Loughlin, & Grossnickle, 2012; Maggioni, Fox, & Alexander, 2010) 

proposed the term epistemic competence to refer to an adaptive and flexible form of epistemic 

cognition. By this definition, competent learners recognize the potential unreliability of sources 

and the contestable nature of knowledge, but also consider content and context when determining 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 26 

the level of certainty and justification that may be required to accept a knowledge claim or 

source as acceptable. As such, the notion of “competent belief” appears to be a more accurate 

way of qualifying experts’ beliefs than the label “more constructivist.” 

The nature and role of justification. As Greene et al. (2008) have pointed out, 

philosophical epistemology has been concerned with the justification of knowledge as a primary 

focus. In multidimensional frameworks of epistemic cognition, “naïve” justification has been 

construed as the reliance on authorities and experts, whereas the reliance on one’s own means of 

justification, such as rational evaluation, has been deemed “sophisticated” (Schommer, 1990; 

Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). However, Greene et al. (2008) argued that the way justification is 

defined in multidimensional frameworks fails to consider the many means of justification that 

are valid and acknowledged in the philosophical literature. For example, Chinn et al. (2011) 

pointed out that philosophers regard knowledge claimed by experts as justified, provided that 

those experts are properly vetted. Chinn et al. proposed to refer to this type of justification as 

justification by testimony, where testimony is defined as all social forms of sharing information 

and knowledge with others. The authors further argued that most of what is known is learned 

from others, and that no one can actually evaluate all of what is learned through their own 

means. 

Another issue related to justification is that individuals do not always enact the 

evaluations that would be in accordance with their beliefs. Chinn and Brewer (1993) found that 

many scientists report that anomalous data should lead to model revision, yet many ignore 

anomalous data in their research. It might be the case that individuals’ espoused beliefs may have 

little to do with how they actually go about justifying knowledge claims in context. Overall, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 27 

more research is needed to investigate how individuals go about evaluating and justifying 

knowledge claims in different domains and contexts, and with different types of problems.  

Conclusion 

The above review provided a review of the existing theories of epistemic cognition. To 

this day, research on epistemic cognition continues to become richer, more diversified, and better 

integrated with other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, psychology). Nonetheless, the field still 

struggles to unify its various traditions, frameworks, and terms under a consolidated framework. 

Integrated theoretical frameworks like those proposed by Barzilai and Zohar (2014) or Muis and 

Singh (2018) appear to be a promising avenue, as future research on epistemic cognition will 

require rich frameworks from which to derive sophisticated research questions and hypotheses.  

The above review also shows that there exist several issues left to be resolved, as well as 

gaps that should be addressed. For instance, despite positive associations between epistemic 

cognition and several educational processes and outcomes, the correlation between epistemic 

cognition and learning achievement tends to be small (Greene et al., 2018). As was illustrated in 

this review, some possible explanations for this include the need to broaden conceptual horizons 

to include not only tacit and stable epistemic beliefs, but more dynamic and contextually-

anchored processes such as epistemic aims and epistemic strategies that may provide a fuller 

picture of epistemic cognition as it occurs in learning settings. Further, as argued by Bråten et al. 

(2011), there is a need to investigate mediational mechanisms that account for relations between 

epistemic cognition and important educational processes and outcomes. As exposed above, Muis 

and colleagues (Muis et al., 2018; Muis & Singh, 2018) advanced epistemic emotions as one 

such mediational mechanism; however, to date, little empirical work has been done to uncover 

the role that epistemic emotions may play in epistemic cognition.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 28 

One last possible explanation to the observed small effect of epistemic cognition on 

achievement is methodological in nature. As will be discussed in the next section, research on 

epistemic cognition to date has heavily relied on decontextualized self-report instruments to 

collect evidence of epistemic cognition. However, as the field moves towards conceptualizations 

where the situated and dynamic nature of epistemic cognition is taken into consideration, equally 

situated and dynamic research methods will be needed to further our understanding of the nature 

and role of epistemic cognition in learning. The next section offers a critical examination of the 

various methods that can be used to measure epistemic cognition.   

Part 2. What Methods Can Be Used to Measure Epistemic Cognition? 

Accurate measurement of epistemic cognition is crucial for many reasons. Undoubtedly, 

sound measurement is key to bolstering theoretical frameworks and advancing the field. But 

more importantly perhaps is that quick and accurate measurement is key to realizing the full 

educational implications of epistemic cognition, such as supporting the development and 

enactment of higher-order thinking skills. However, despite a number of publications dedicated 

to this issue, the measurement of epistemic cognition continues to be a challenge (Clarebout, 

Elen, Luyten, & Bamps, 2001; DeBacker, Crowson, Beesley, Thoma, & Hestevold, 2008; Wood 

& Kardash, 2002). Measuring epistemic cognition is arduous mainly because it is a complex and 

multifaceted construct. In this section, I first review how researchers from various theoretical 

perspectives have employed diverse methods to assess epistemic cognition and to advance 

knowledge in the field. Next, I identify the limitations of these methods, and offer suggestions to 

overcome them.  

Methods Used Within Perspectives  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 29 

The developmental perspective. As discussed above, developmental frameworks 

proposed a continuum of positions moving from absolutism, to multiplicism, to evaluativism. 

Historically, researchers interested in the development of personal epistemology have used 

qualitative methods to assign individuals a developmental position or epistemic stance. 

Following Perry (1970), researchers with a developmental focus have predominantly used semi-

structured interviews to understand individuals’ epistemic cognition. Often committing to a 

phenomenological approach to elicit respondents’ voices, interviews have allowed researchers to 

obtain rich data about learners’ worldviews, rapport to authority (Perry, 1970), decision-making 

processes (Baxter Magolda, 1992; 2004), and reasoning about ill-structured (King & Kitchener, 

1994; 2004) or moral (Belenky et al., 1986) problems. Interviews have been used in longitudinal 

studies (Baxter Magolda, 1992; 2004; King & Kitchener, 1994; 2004; Perry, 1970) or 

complimented with paper-and-pencil surveys (Baxter Magolda, 1992; 2004). Given the resource-

intensive nature of interviews, developmental researchers have later focused on developing 

scenario-based paper-and-pencil instruments (see Barzilai & Weinstock, 2015; Kuhn et al., 2000; 

Wood & Kardash, 2002). Vignettes with text and images have also been used with interviews to 

investigate children’s level of epistemic development (Mansfield & Clinchy, 2002). 

The multidimensional perspective. Multidimensional frameworks have conceptualized 

epistemic cognition as a system of more or less independent beliefs or theories that develop 

asynchronously. To test whether individuals espouse more or less sophisticated or constructivist 

beliefs on a number of dimensions, scholars have developed questionnaires where respondents 

self-report their level of agreement with numerous statements on Likert scales.  

Early epistemic beliefs questionnaires (i.e., Epistemological Questionnaire [EBQ; 

Schommer, 1990]; Epistemic Beliefs Inventory [EBI; Schraw, Bendixen, & Dunkle, 2002]), 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 30 

Epistemological Beliefs Survey [EBS; Wood & Kardash, 2002]) assessed domain-general 

beliefs, with statements that referred to knowledge in general. As the debate over the domain 

generality of epistemic beliefs unfolded, Muis et al. (2006) called upon researchers to measure 

individuals’ epistemic beliefs about a specific domain. Muis et al. (2006) argued that respondents 

presented with broadly stated items might be influenced by their domain of study or of expertise, 

which would compromise comparability across respondents. At first, domain-general 

questionnaires were turned into domain-specific versions by substituting domains of focus in 

items that otherwise remained the same (e.g., “Mathematics relates to day-to-day life” versus 

“Economics relate to day-to-day life”; Buehl, Alexander, & Murphy, 2002; see also Greene, 

Torney-Purta, & Azevedo, 2010; Hofer, 2000). Later, proper domain-specific questionnaires 

were developed, as well as topic-specific questionnaires (e.g., Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs 

Questionnaire [TSEBQ; Bråten, Gil, Strømsø, & Vidal-Abarca, 2009]). Researchers who 

adopted the multidimensional perspective have also used semantic differential measures (e.g., the 

Connotative Aspects of Epistemic Beliefs scale [CAEB; Stahl & Bromme, 2007]). Items in 

semantic differential instruments capture the evaluative judgments that individuals attribute to 

words to pairs of conflicting adjectives (e.g., “exact-vague”; “dynamic-static”).  

As will be discussed below, Likert-type instruments have received abundant criticism 

with regard to their poor psychometric properties. As a result, researchers from the 

multidimensional tradition have continually sought to develop alternative measures, turning to 

methodologies used, for instance, in self-regulated learning research. Think-aloud protocols, 

among others, have been successfully employed to assess epistemic cognition, including 

dimensions of epistemic beliefs, epistemic strategies, and epistemic aims (Chevrier et al., 2015; 

2016; Hofer, 2004a; Ferguson, Bråten, & Strømsø, 2012; Greene et al., 2014; Mason, Ariasi, & 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 31 

Boldrin, 2011; Mason, Boldrin, & Ariasi, (2010). Lastly, Greene et al. (2010) proposed 

computer-based learning environments to collect trace data (e.g., time logs, highlighting patterns, 

recorded notes) to infer epistemic cognition from learning behaviors.   

The epistemological resources perspective. Hammer and colleagues (2002; 2003) 

proposed that epistemic cognition can be conceptualized as epistemological resources that 

individuals activate as a function of contextual demands. Interviews (Hammer & Elby, 2002; 

2003) and direct observation (Louca, Elby, Hammer, & Kagey, 2004) have been the privileged 

methods of measurement used in this perspective. As no stability in epistemological resources is 

assumed across situations, contexts, or domain, only immersive measurement approaches 

sensitive to sociocultural variables are adequate here. 

New conceptualizations. The notion that epistemic cognition encompasses much more 

than epistemic beliefs is common across the recent frameworks reviewed above (e.g., Barzilai & 

Zohar, 2014; Chinn et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2008; Muis & Singh, 2018). Models such as 

Greene et al.’s (2008) and Muis and Singh’s (2018) assume that epistemic cognition 

encompasses relatively stable epistemic beliefs as well as more dynamic and context-specific 

components such as epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic emotions. As such, these 

researchers have combined quantitative and qualitative methods to test their models. For 

instance, Muis and colleagues’ (2018) integrated model has been tested with a combination of 

self-report questionnaires to capture learners’ epistemic beliefs and think-aloud protocols to 

capture learners’ epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic emotions (see Chevrier et 

al., under review; Muis et al., 2015). Likewise, Greene and colleagues tested their 2008 model 

with a self-report instrument (Greene et al., 2010), as well as with think-aloud protocols 

(Ferguson et al., 2012; Greene et al., 2014).  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 32 

As exposed above, the alignment between a framework’s assumptions and the 

measurement methods used to test them is paramount. While these methods have participated to 

the elaboration of each framework and to the advancement of the field in general, each method 

comports limitations that force researchers to keep innovating. I next examine the affordances 

and limitations of each method. 

Affordances and Limitations of Employed Methods 

Likert-type self-report instruments. Likert scales are prevalent in epistemic cognition 

research, as in many branches of educational psychology, due to their manageable and 

inexpensive modes of administration. The chief advantage of these instruments is allowing 

individuals to report on constructs that are inherently personal and that can be hard to reveal. 

However, thorough examination of the psychometric properties of the most common self-report 

instruments used in epistemic cognition research has revealed issues of validity, reliability, and 

inaccuracy. In terms of validity, DeBacker et al.’s (2008) analysis of the factor structure of the 

Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ; Schommer, 1990), the Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI; 

Schraw et al., 2002), and the Epistemic Beliefs Scale (EBS; Wood & Kardash, 2002) failed to 

provide support for the number of proposed epistemic belief dimensions. This is consistent with 

work by Hofer (2004a), who reported that certainty and simplicity did not emerge as separate 

factors in her Discipline-Focused Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (DFEBQ; Hofer, 2000). Hofer 

(2000) concluded that epistemic beliefs may not be as multifaceted as hypothesized, or else, be 

too multifaceted to be captured with Likert-scale questionnaires. 

The validity of Likert-scale questionnaires has also been problematic for developmental 

research. As pointed by Muis et al. (2006), it is difficult to determine what should constitute the 

breaking point in a continuum between a belief in authorities as true sources of knowledge (an 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 33 

absolutist or less constructivist belief), and a belief in the active construction of knowledge (an 

evaluatist or more constructivist belief). Indeed, disagreeing with a less constructivist statement 

is not a reliable indication of espousing a more constructivist belief (Greene et al., 2008; Greene 

& Yu, 2014; Hofer, 2004a; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Mason, 2016; Schommer, 1990). In other 

words, Likert scales create false dichotomizations in what should be a continuum in belief.  

The low reliability of Likert-scale questionnaires is another problematic issue in 

epistemic cognition measurement. DeBacker et al. (2008) found that the internal consistency of 

the EBQ was poor, whereas that of the EBS and the EBI were lower than desirable. Poor internal 

consistency is problematic as it indicates great proportions of measurement error, which 

constitutes an important threat to the reliability of instruments as well as to the replicability of 

results (Muis et al., 2006). A related issue is the overwhelming reliance on homogeneous 

samples, often composed of white, urban, undergraduate students, which threatens the reliability 

of self-report epistemic belief questionnaire (Greene & Yu, 2014; Mason, 2016). 

Lastly, using Likert-type questionnaires for the assessment of epistemic beliefs has been 

criticized for its potential inaccuracy. Greene et al. (2008) pointed out that completing an 

epistemic belief inventories requires a level of metacognitive engagement that participants may 

not be willing to deploy in an experimental context. This may compromise the accuracy of their 

responses. Similarly, researchers have raised concerns that there may be interpretability issues 

with items that are too broadly stated or worded with unspecific knowledge-related words 

(Greene & Yu, 2014; Muis et al., 2006). For instance, the item “I am most confident that I know 

something when I know what the experts think” (Hofer, 2000, p. 251) can be interpreted as 

asking whether sole reliance on experts is sufficient justification, or whether experts are a 

legitimate source of knowledge. Despite these limitations, Likert-scale questionnaires continue to 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 34 

be prevalent in epistemic cognition research. As Greene et al. (2008) argued, self-report 

instruments can be adequate when used with large, heterogeneous samples, and when multiple 

items are used to capture one dimension from different angles.  

Scholars have proposed several solutions to address these measurement issues. In 

response to the identification of problems with psychometric factorial structures and internal 

consistency of instruments (e.g., Clarebout et al., 2001; DeBacker et al., 2008; Wood & Kardash, 

2002), as well as to the issue of wording in relation to domain-specificity, new instruments have 

been developed, such as the TSEBQ (Bråten et al., 2009) or the CAEB (Stahl & Bromme, 2007). 

Others have conducted qualitative investigations to assess whether there might be inherent 

conceptual problems with the frameworks from which self-report instruments are derived. 

Notably, as noted above, Greene and Yu (2014) interviewed novices and experts about their 

epistemic beliefs and identified various conceptual issues that might be problematic for 

measurement. Lastly, scholars have questioned whether self-report instruments may simply be 

inadequate to capture epistemic cognition (Alexander et al., 2012; Greene et al., 2010; Muis et 

al., 2006). This hypothesis has led to consider alternative methods, which are discussed next. 

Think-aloud protocols. One methodological approach that has gained traction over the 

past decades is think-aloud protocols (Ericsson & Simon, 1993). Think-aloud protocols involve 

asking participants to verbalize their thinking as they learn or study, thus allowing researchers to 

capture processes that are concurrent with learning without relying on participants’ memory. 

These verbal data are then categorized for a range of cognitive processes using coding schemes, 

which allows to quantify these processes. Given these characteristics, think-aloud protocols may 

be considered a quantitative methodology. Researchers have used think-aloud protocols to 

capture “epistemic beliefs in action” (e.g., Hofer, 2004a; Mason et al., 2010; 2011) as well as 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 35 

other contextualized aspects of epistemic cognition such as epistemic strategies and epistemic 

aims (e.g., Barzilai & Zohar, 2012; Chevrier et al., 2016; Greene et al., 2015).. 

Contrary to Likert-type self-report questionnaires, which are completed before or after a 

cognitive task (i.e., offline measure), think-aloud protocols are another type of self-report 

measurement but offer online measurement, meaning that measures are taken as cognitive 

activity unfolds. Veenman, Van Hout-Wolters, and Afferbach (2006) have argued that in the 

context of measuring cognitive and metacognitive processes, online methods render data that are 

more predictive of learning achievement than offline methods. However, an important limitation 

to think-aloud protocols is that they may disrupt participants’ thinking process by imposing an 

additional cognitive demand (Veenman et al., 2006). Another issue is the resource intensiveness 

of think-aloud protocols, which require large investments of time (e.g., development of coding 

schemes, transcription and coding) and money (e.g., research assistants’ salary; participant 

compensation). Lastly, think-aloud is a self-report methodology and is subject to the same biases 

are other self-report methodologies, namely in that they are limited by how much participants are 

aware of their own mental processes.  

Qualitative methods. Qualitative methods used in epistemic cognition research have 

included, among others, phenomenological interviews (e.g., Baxter Magolda, 1992; Belenky et 

al., 1986; King and Kitchener, 1994; 2004; Perry, 1970), direct observation of classroom 

practices (e.g., Rosenberg, Hammer, & Phelan, 2006), multiple case study (e.g., Greene & Yu, 

2014), and the analysis of artifacts (e.g., Alexander et al., 2012). Cognitive interviews have also 

been used to elicit respondents’ interpretations of self-report items (e.g., Greene et al., 2010; 

Mason, 2016; Muis, Duffy, Trevors, Ranellucci, & Foy, 2014). Lastly, qualitative methods have 

been used to challenge some of the field’s conceptual assumptions. To this end, open-ended, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 36 

inductive, and exploratory work has been used to broaden the scope of dimensions, the types of 

justification, and the nature of sophisticated or expert epistemic cognition (Greene & Yu, 2014).  

Qualitative methods, however, are not without limitations. King and Kitchener (2002) 

argued that their own semi-structured interview (i.e., the Reflective Judgment Interview) might 

have resulted in an underestimation of respondents’ cognitive abilities, since it asked of students 

to respond to difficult questions with very little time to reflect. Another limitation comes from 

the fact that interview protocols are time-consuming, costly, and require specific training for 

research assistants, which explains why their use is typically limited to smaller samples. Lastly, 

when discussing the usefulness of artifacts (e.g., drawings, cognitive maps), Alexander et al. 

(2012) acknowledged that there is no way of knowing whether these artifacts reliably reflect 

students’ tacit beliefs. The authors also questioned the generalizability of findings derived from 

qualitative analyses by concluding that, “we simply cannot divorce these data from the context in 

which they were generated” (Alexander et al., 2012, p. 13). 

Future Directions and Conclusions 

As the field of epistemic cognition moves towards new methodologies, a few 

considerations must be taken into account. A first consideration consists of weighing 

participants’ lack of motivation to respond to questionnaires against maladaptive epistemic 

competence. If we accept the notion that epistemically competent individuals are flexible and 

take contextual demands into account, we can question the extent to which epistemically 

competent respondents would be motivated to deploy their “best” epistemic cognitive processes 

under experimental conditions. For instance, Hyytinen et al. (2014) found that among students 

who espoused more constructivist epistemic beliefs, many did not engage in thorough and 

effortful thinking on a reasoning task performed in an experimental context.  

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 37 

A second issue concerns sampling. We can wonder whether the field of epistemic 

cognition might have grown on the basis of evidence provided by samples that were overall too 

homogeneous. This concern dates back to Perry’s (1970) seminal work, which was based on a 

sample of all-white males from an elite institution. Since, samples used in epistemic cognition 

research have been overwhelmingly composed of white urban female university students. 

Despite the well-documented influence of the socio-cultural context on epistemic cognition 

(Bromme et al., 2008; Hammer & Elby, 2002; Muis et al., 2016) and its development (Hofer, 

2008; Muis et al., 2006), too little multicultural or socially diverse samples are used in epistemic 

cognition research. In addition, Hofer (2008) warns that the research conducted on cross-cultural 

samples has generally neglected to reconsider the assumptions, conceptualizations, and 

operational definitions of theories and methods used to apprehend these samples, which might 

not stand across cultures. 

Lastly, there is a need for instruments that can assess the epistemic climate of learning 

environments. Drawing from Muis et al. (2016), such a tool would capture and characterize the 

pedagogy, authoritative style, curriculum, evaluative practices, and support styles of a learning 

environment. Further, if researchers are to fulfill Bromme et al.’s (2010) call for a “double-track 

approach” (p. 23) to epistemic cognition research, artefact analysis with coding schemes should 

be used to analyze the knowledge representations to which learners are exposed. 

To conclude, it appears that the advancement of the quality of epistemic cognition 

measurement lies both in the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods (Mason, 2016), 

as well as in the development of new technologies (Greene et al., 2010). As new 

conceptualizations shed light on the many underlying facets of epistemic cognition, it is 

becoming increasingly important for researchers to clearly identify what is being measured, and 

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 38 

to select methods accordingly. Indeed, instruments that have attempted to capture both the static 

and dynamic aspects of epistemic cognition might explain why these instruments have seldom 

correlated with each other (see DeBacker et al., 2008). Another promising avenue comes from 

technological advances, which bear the possibility of the stealth implementation of multi-modal 

measurement. Software such as nStudy (Winne, 2014) is promising in this regard: nStudy, is an 

online environment and research tool developed that allows researchers to gather traces of 

learners’ epistemic, affective,  and self-regulated processes as they occur in real time. However, 

as new technologies become the new center of interest, the resource intensivity of these 

sophisticated methods must be taken into consideration. As long as the field does not suggest 

methods that are non-invasive, inexpensive, and rapid to use, self-report instruments stand little 

chance of being replaced.  

In sum, accurate measurement of epistemic cognition is crucial for many reasons. 

Crucially, quick and non-invasive measurement of the components of epistemic cognition is key 

to realizing its full educational implications. On the other hand, precise measurement is key to 

advancing the field by relating epistemic cognition to other psychological and educational 

constructs, such construct is epistemic emotions.  

General Conclusion 

In a context of proliferating information and viewpoints, competent epistemic cognition 

is becoming a necessity for citizens of all ages. In the first section of this chapter, I have shown 

that the field of epistemic cognition has proposed frameworks that are increasingly specific, 

expansive, interdisciplinary, and integrated with other learning processes and outcomes, offering 

a fruitful avenue to better understand the nature and role of epistemic cognition for important 

educational processes and outcomes. Specifically, I have articulated conceptual distinctions 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 39 

between various epistemic terms (e.g., epistemic cognition, epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, 

epistemic strategies, epistemic emotions) that hold the promise of providing a fuller account of 

epistemic cognition if duly taken into account. In the second portion of this chapter, I have 

further shown that the field of epistemic cognition still suffers from methodological challenges 

and have identified the limitations but also the affordances of methods that can guide future 

research on epistemic cognition.  

Promising avenues for future work were also identified, including the investigation of 

mediation mechanisms that intervene in the relationship between epistemic cognition and 

important educational outcomes, as well as the use of multi-modal and dynamic measurement 

methods to properly operationalize the aforementioned conceptual distinctions. Overall, I have 

made the argument that with careful consideration for conceptual and methodological 

shortcomings, future research will help us understand how epistemic cognition can be profitably 

leveraged to educate individuals who can effectively sift through today’s complex informational 

landscape and make adequate decisions about what to believe or what to do.

Bridging Text 

Chapter 2 presented a comprehensive and critical review of the literature on epistemic 

cognition. The objectives that guided that review were (1) to identify contemporary and 

integrated conceptualizations of epistemic cognition that best describe the phenomenon of 

epistemic cognition in complex informational situations, and (2) to identify affordances and 

limitations of methods employed to measure epistemic cognition that can best guide future 

research in advancing knowledge on epistemic cognition. On the basis of this review, it was 

identified that epistemic cognition is multifaceted and includes, in addition to epistemic beliefs, 

underexplored facets such as epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic experiences, 

including epistemic emotions. Further, to advance research on epistemic cognition, two 

promising avenues were suggested. These included the investigation of mediation mechanisms to 

explain how epistemic cognition relates to important educational outcomes, and the use of 

sophisticated measurement methods to properly operationalize the aforementioned conceptual 

distinctions. 

The following chapter presents two empirical investigations that follow these avenues. 

For these studies, a think-aloud protocol was used to collect verbal data on epistemic cognition, 

epistemic emotions, and learning strategies. These verbal data were used to assess a novel set of 

cognitive appraisals that are proposed to serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions (Study 1), 

and to assess the immediate (Study 1) and general (Study 2) consequences of epistemic emotions 

on self-regulated learning strategies. In doing so, I sought to address the conceptual and 

methodological limitations identified above, namely in operationalizing the distinction between 

the different facets of epistemic cognition, thus making it possible to empirically examine the 

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

relationship between epistemic beliefs and epistemic cognition, which constitutes one of the 

unique contributions of this chapter.

Abstract 

Across two studies, we evaluated a model that proposed relations between epistemic cognition, 

epistemic emotions, self-regulatory strategies, and learning of complex contradictory content. 

For Study 1, to capture epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-regulatory strategies, 

114 undergraduate students thought out loud while reading conflicting texts about climate 

change. Protocol analysis revealed that epistemic aims, epistemic congruity, and appraisals of 

novelty and complexity of information served as antecedents to epistemic emotions. State-

transition analyses revealed that curiosity increased the likelihood of metacognitive self-

regulation, and that surprise decreased the likelihood of rehearsal and increased the likelihood of 

critical thinking. For Study 2, participants reported epistemic beliefs, read contradictory texts 

about climate change, reported emotions experienced while reading, and completed a knowledge 

assessment task. Path analyses revealed full mediation between epistemic beliefs, epistemic 

emotions, learning strategies and learning achievement. More constructivist beliefs about the 

complexity, uncertainty and justification of knowledge predicted more curiosity, less surprise, 

and less boredom. Curiosity, in turn, predicted critical thinking, knowledge elaboration and 

rehearsal strategies. Finally, critical thinking and rehearsal positively predicted learning 

achievement. Implications for research on epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-

regulated learning are discussed.  

Keywords: epistemic emotions, epistemic cognition, learning strategies, learning achievement.

1. Introduction 

Understanding the socio-scientific issues we face today is of critical importance, as 

citizens are called upon to make decisions about these increasingly pressing matters. Issues such 

as the benefits of genetically modified organisms, the risks associated with childhood vaccines, 

or the causes and consequences of climate change have emerged as some of the most complex 

and controversial topics (Funk & Kennedy, 2016; Hulme, 2009; Kata, 2012; Weber & Stern, 

2011). In educational settings, students’ understanding of socio-scientific topics is complicated 

by a set of social and psychological factors. First, such topics are often challenging to understand 

given their complex nature (e.g., Weber & Stern, 2011). To successfully learn about socio-

scientific topics, learners need to engage in skilled self-regulated learning, which includes 

setting learning goals, using strategies, and closely monitoring progress towards learning goals. 

Second, the falsely balanced media coverage of socio-scientific topics (Boykoff & Boykoff, 

2004) can result in erroneous conceptions about these topics, like the belief that there exists a 

connection between vaccination and autism (Kata, 2012) or the belief that climate change is not 

caused by mankind’s activities (Corbett & Durfee, 2004). As such, individuals need to engage in 

epistemic cognition to evaluate and select reliable sources of information, judge knowledge 

claims, and integrate divergent perspectives.  

Third, socio-scientific topics are often rife with emotions, especially when students are 

confronted with learning content that exposes uncertainty and controversy about these topics 

(Broughton, Pekrun, & Sinatra, 2012; Heddy, Danielson, Sinatra, & Graham, 2017). Previous 

research has shown that when learning about a topic such as climate change, students can be 

driven more by affect and values than by evidence (Slovic, 1987) and respond to uncertainty in 

ways that are more emotional than analytic (Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001). An 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 58 

emerging body of literature suggests that emotions are a critical component of learning about 

controversial socio-scientific topics (Muis et al., 2015; Muis & Singh, 2018). Recently, Muis et 

al. (2015) put forth a framework of epistemic emotions where they propose that individuals’ 

epistemic beliefs, i.e., beliefs about knowledge and knowing, predict the kinds of epistemic 

emotions (emotions that arise as a function of the cognitive qualities of information and the 

processing of that information [Pekrun & Stephens, 2012]) experienced during complex learning. 

For example, learners who espouse epistemic beliefs that are different from the epistemology of 

science (e.g., who believe that knowledge is simple and certain) may experience confusion, 

anxiety, or frustration when they encounter complex and conflicting scientific knowledge. In 

contrast, those who believe that knowledge is complex and evolving may experience curiosity 

and enjoyment. These epistemic emotions may then facilitate or constrain self-regulated 

learning. Given these implications, there are pressing questions with regard to the impact of 

epistemic emotions when learning about complex socio-scientific topics, particularly when 

knowledge is presented as controversial or contradictory. 

Bieg, Goetz, and Hubbard (2013) argued that one productive way to advance this line of 

research is by investigating the antecedents of emotions, as they can inform the development of 

interventions designed to foster positive emotions in the classroom. Further, to fully understand 

the role of epistemic emotions in self-regulated learning, Muis and colleagues (2015) 

recommended examining how learners immediately attend and respond to emotions as learning 

unfolds. As such, the primary purpose of this research was to respond to these calls and extend 

Muis et al.’s (2015) framework by investigating the antecedents and consequences of epistemic 

emotions on learning processes and outcomes during complex learning. In the following section, 

we review relevant theoretical and empirical work that guided the hypotheses of the current 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 59 

study.  

2.1. Epistemic Cognition 

2. Theoretical Frameworks 

Individuals’ thoughts and beliefs about knowledge and knowing have been a popular line 

of inquiry among educational psychologists. Research in this field has largely focused on 

individuals’ beliefs about knowledge and knowing, i.e., epistemic beliefs. Epistemic beliefs are 

typically described as multidimensional and ranging from a less constructivist viewpoint to a 

more constructivist viewpoint along four dimensions. Hofer and Pintrich (1997) defined four 

dimensions of epistemic beliefs: (1) the certainty of knowledge, ranging from the belief that 

knowledge is certain to the belief that knowledge is tentative; (2) the simplicity of knowledge, 

ranging from the belief that knowledge is as simple as a list of facts, to the belief that knowledge 

is more like a complex network of interrelated propositions; (3) the source of knowledge, 

ranging from the belief that knowledge is handed down by authority, to the belief that knowledge 

is actively constructed through reason and logic; and, (4) the justification for knowing, ranging 

from the belief that knowledge is unquestionably justified through authoritative or expert 

sources, to the belief that knowledge is justified by rules of inquiry, including the critical 

evaluation of claims and the integration of multiple perspectives. Typically, more constructivist 

epistemic beliefs have been empirically linked to greater academic performance compared to less 

constructivist epistemic beliefs (Schommer, Crouse, & Rhodes, 1992) via use of learning 

strategies (Schommer, 1990). Specifically, learners who espouse more constructivist epistemic 

beliefs are more likely to use deep learning strategies, such as knowledge elaboration and critical 

thinking, whereas those who espouse less constructivist epistemic beliefs are more likely to 

resort to shallow learning strategies, such as rehearsal (Muis, 2007). 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

A growing body of literature emphasizes a wider set of cognitive processes associated 

with the nature of knowledge and the process of knowing that help to deal with controversial 

information. These include processes such as setting epistemic aims for learning, as well as using 

epistemic strategies to evaluate and integrate sources of information or establish justification for 

knowing. Together with epistemic beliefs, these processes constitute facets of epistemic 

cognition (Greene, Azevedo, & Torney-Purta, 2008; Greene, Sandoval, & Bråten, 2016; 

Kitchener, 1983; Muis & Singh, 2018). Specifically, Chinn, Buckland and Samarapungavan 

(2011) define epistemic aims as learning goals related to knowledge construction or problem 

solving that range from the aim to obtain simple and certain answers to the aim to acquire 

justified beliefs. Epistemic aims are attained via the use of epistemic strategies. Similar to 

learning strategies described in models of self-regulated learning (Greene & Azevedo, 2009; 

Winne & Hadwin, 1998), epistemic strategies are a subcategory of learning strategies that draw 

on epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge to address knowledge- and knowing-related issues 

(Richter & Schmid, 2010). Epistemic strategies include, for instance, sourcing strategies (i.e., 

evaluating the trustworthiness of sources [Barzilai & Zohar, 2012; Strømsø, Bråten, & Britt, 

2010]), justification strategies (i.e., evaluating whether knowledge claims are well justified; 

providing reasons for evidence [Greene et al., 2014; Richter & Schmid, 2010]), and integration 

strategies (i.e., comparing and contrasting multiple sources; providing explanation for 

differences between various perspectives [Barzilai & Zohar, 2012; Bråten, Britt, Strømsø, & 

Rouet, 2011; Kienhues, Stadler, & Bromme, 2011]). As such, epistemic cognition draws on 

epistemic beliefs to deploy epistemic strategies directed at epistemic aims. 

There is a growing body of evidence attesting to the importance of adaptive epistemic 

cognition for learning outcomes, including multiple-text comprehension (Bråten, Britt, Strømsø, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 61 

& Rouet, 2011), digital literacy (Strømsø & Kammerer, 2016), and critical thinking (Greene & 

Yu, 2016), among others. However, a recent meta-analysis by Greene, Cartiff and Duke (2018) 

has shown that the effect of epistemic cognition (measured predominantly as epistemic beliefs) 

on learning achievement is significant but small, r = .162. One possible explanation for this small 

effect may be the existence of mediators that intervene in the relationship between epistemic 

cognition and learning. Indeed, as Bråten et al. (2011) argued, much more research is needed to 

understand the mediational mechanisms by which epistemic cognition relates to learning 

processes and outcomes. They further note that emotions may be one such mediator. If 

researchers are to expand conceptualizations of epistemic cognition to include a broader range of 

epistemic processes, it is imperative that we also consider the emotions that directly relate to 

knowledge and knowing, such as curiosity or confusion (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993). As 

such, Muis et al. (2015) proposed that epistemic emotions may mediate relations between 

epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning. We next delineate the construct of epistemic 

emotions. 

2.2. Epistemic Emotions 

Emotions are pervasive in academic contexts and are posited to affect individuals’ 

learning and achievement (Op’t Eynde, De Corte, & Verschaffel, 2007; Perkun & Perry, 2014). 

In his control-value theory of achievement emotions, Pekrun (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Perry, 

2014) proposed that appraisals of perceived control and subjective task value serve as 

antecedents to emotions in academic contexts. Within this framework, emotions are categorized 

according to their valence and level of activation. In terms of valence, positive (i.e., pleasant) 

emotions such as enjoyment or pride can be distinguished from negative (i.e., unpleasant) 

emotions such as anxiety or frustration. Further, the level of activation generated by emotions 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 62 

also serves as an important distinction, which contrasts activating emotions, such as anxiety and 

anger, with deactivating emotions, such as contentment or boredom. Academic emotions can 

further be grouped according to their object focus (Pekrun, 2006): achievement emotions relate 

to success or failure of an achievement task; topic emotions relate to the content of what is being 

learned; social emotions are turned towards others and include, for instance, envy and 

admiration. Recently, educational psychologists have taken interest in a fourth category of 

academic emotions, that is, epistemic emotions. We define epistemic emotions as emotions that 

have, as an object focus, the knowledge-generating aspects of learning that arise as a result of 

cognitive and epistemic qualities of information and the processing of that information (Brun & 

Kuenzle, 2008; Morton, 2010; Muis, Chevrier, & Singh, 2018; Muis et al., 2015; Pekrun & 

Stephens, 2012). In the context of complex and conflicting knowledge, epistemic emotions may 

include surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, frustration, anxiety, and boredom (Muis et al. 

2015; Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017). 

Surprise involves the perception of a discrepancy between incoming information and 

prior knowledge, expectations, or beliefs (Scheffler, 1977). Discrepancies are events that cause 

cognitive disequilibrium, which D’Mello and Graesser (2012) define as a state of uncertainty that 

occurs when individuals are confronted with impasses, contradictions, anomalous events, 

dissonance or incongruities. Individuals may experience surprise when they encounter 

information that they did not expect (Meyer, Reisenzein, & Schützwhol, 1997; Reisenzein & 

Studtmann, 2007) or that they cannot explain (Foster & Keane, 2015). According to Munnich 

and Ranney (2018), surprise serves as a metacognitive signal of the level of difficulty of 

integrating surprising information to an existing mental representation. They suggest that when 

surprise has a low intensity, individuals may readily assimilate new information into current 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 63 

mental structures. However, when surprise is high, discrepant information may be treated as an 

anomaly or regarded as implausible, possibly resulting in a rejection of the information. Low-

intensity surprise may be experienced as pleasant whereas high-intensity surprise may be 

experienced as unpleasant; as such, surprise is considered a neutral emotion. 

Curiosity, on the other hand, arises out of an information gap or a discrepancy between 

what one knows and what one wants to know, and may motivate individuals to seek, obtain, and 

make use of new knowledge (Berlyne, 1954; Litman, 2005; Loewenstein, 1994). Silvia (2010) 

proposed that curiosity arises when discrepant information is perceived as highly novel and 

complex, yet comprehensible. Litman and colleagues (Litman, 2005; 2008; Lauriola, Litman et 

al., 2015) describe two types of dispositional tendencies to experience and express epistemic 

curiosity: an interest type and a deprivation type. Interest-type curiosity is described as a desire 

for new information that is expected to increase pleasant feelings of situational interest, whereas 

deprivation-type curiosity is defined as a motive to reduce the unpleasant experience of 

uncertainty or knowledge deprivation. As such, curiosity can be experienced as either pleasant or 

unpleasant and therefore, like surprise, can be considered a neutral emotion. Empirical studies 

have systematically found that curiosity positively relates to learning, including exploratory 

behaviors and greater learning (Berlyne, 1954; Litman, 2005; Loewenstein, 1994; Lowry & 

Johnson, 1981), with deprivation-type curiosity leading to even higher levels of exploration than 

interest-type curiosity (Litman, Hutchins & Russon, 2004). While calls have been made to 

include and distinguish both interest-type and deprivation-type curiosity in emotion research 

(e.g., Jirout & Klahr, 2012), for the current study, we conceptualize and measure the interest type 

of curiosity.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 64 

Confusion is conceived as resulting from appraisals of uncertainty stemming from 

novelty, complexity, conflict, or unfamiliarity (Ellsworth, 2003). When discrepant information is 

highly novel and complex, and also highly incomprehensible, confusion may arise (Silvia, 2010). 

D’Mello and Graesser (2012) argue that confusion is central to complex learning activities such 

as problem-solving and generating cohesive arguments. Confusion is expected to be beneficial to 

learning because it can help individuals focus attention on the anomaly or discrepancy, and 

motivate learners to effortfully deliberate, problem solve, and restructure their cognitive 

structures to resolve the confusion.  

When confusion is resolved, epistemic enjoyment may ensue (D’Mello & Graesser, 

2012). Enjoyment is a positive emotion that can further be experienced when curiosity is 

satisfied (Litman & Jimerson, 2004), problems are solved, or inductively formed hypotheses are 

successfully validated (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008). When problems cannot be solved, lasting 

confusion may transition into epistemic frustration if the focus is on the lack of resolution 

(D’Mello & Graesser, 2012). Similar to confusion, frustration is a negative activating emotion, 

but is unlikely to yield any of the learning benefits associated with confusion (D’Mello & 

Graesser, 2012). Indeed, frustration is an intense emotion that can overtake the cognitive system 

(Rosenberg, 1998), leaving learners with little cognitive energy for deep or creative problem 

solving. Another negative activating emotion is anxiety. Epistemic anxiety can arise when new 

information is highly inconsistent with prior knowledge or with one’s beliefs. When individuals 

begin to doubt their beliefs, epistemic anxiety may ensue. High anxiety can be detrimental to 

learning, but philosophers argue that doubt about one’s propositions is necessary to motivate 

learners to “struggle after belief” and into inquiry (Pierce, 1992, p. 115; see also Hookway, 

2008). Lastly, boredom is a negative deactivating emotion related to low arousal, low 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 65 

motivation, and a desire to escape the situation (Hubbard, 2019). Different types of boredom are 

described by Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, Nett, Pekrun, and Lipnevich (2014), including indifferent, 

calibrating, searching, reactant, and apathetic boredom, which reflect not only different 

intensities of boredom, but also a different motivational experience associated with coping with 

boredom. Epistemic boredom, specifically, is likely to arise when unsuccessful attempts at 

problem-solving turn persistent frustration into disengagement (D’Mello & Graesser, 2012).  

Epistemic emotions represent a type of emotion that is understudied relative to other 

academic emotions such as test anxiety (Zeidner, 1998). However, epistemic emotions are 

posited to serve important functions in learning, as delineated above. Given these implications, it 

is crucial to better understand the role that epistemic emotions may play in facilitating or 

constraining learning, and how these emotions relate to other facets of epistemic cognition, such 

as epistemic beliefs. Muis and colleagues (2015) proposed a model that threads together theories 

of self-regulated learning, epistemic beliefs, and epistemic emotions. We next present Muis et 

al.’s (2015) integrated model. 

2.3. Muis et al.’s (2015) Cognitive Incongruity Model 

To explain the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition and self-regulated 

learning, Muis et al. (2015) proposed a theoretical model that situates epistemic emotions as a 

mediational mechanism between epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning. The model 

described by Muis et al. (2015) applies to complex learning situations, that is, situations that 

require a complex coordination of cognitive, metacognitive, affective and motivational processes 

to reason, problem solve, integrate information, or draw reasonable conclusions. Adding to 

perceived control and task value as antecedents to emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Perry, 

2014), Muis and colleagues (2015) proposed that epistemic beliefs may be a logical antecedent 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 66 

to epistemic emotions given the focus of these emotions on knowledge and knowing. Broadly, 

Muis and colleagues’ model embeds two chief hypotheses: first, that epistemic beliefs, serve as 

one antecedent to epistemic emotions; and second, that epistemic beliefs predict self-regulated 

learning via epistemic emotions. Muis et al.’s (2015) predictive model is illustrated in Figure 1.  

Muis et al. (2015) proposed that learning about a complex and controversial socio-scientific topic 

that presents conflicting claims is a context that can make salient the complex and uncertain 

nature of scientific knowledge. Engaging in such a context activates learners’ epistemic beliefs 

(Muis, 2007) and triggers appraisals of epistemic congruity whereby learners evaluate the 

characteristics of information against the backdrop of their epistemic beliefs. For example, a 

learner who believes that knowledge is complex, tentative, actively constructed, and justified via 

critical thinking (i.e., more constructivist epistemic beliefs) should experience epistemic 

congruity1 when presented with multiple or seemingly divergent perspectives on an issue. Muis 

et al. (2015) proposed that epistemic congruity contributes to the arousal of positive epistemic 

emotions like interest-type curiosity and enjoyment. Inversely, an individual who believes that 

knowledge is simple, certain, passively constructed and justified via personal experience or 

unevaluated evidence (i.e., less constructivist epistemic beliefs) should experience epistemic 

incongruity when encountering conflicting claims and perspectives. Epistemic incongruity is a 

state of dissonance that may pose a threat to a learner’s epistemic identity (Bendixen & Rule, 

2004) and trigger surprise and negative emotions like confusion, anxiety, frustration, or 

boredom. To illustrate, a learner who believes that knowledge is simple and certain, and that 

knowledge claims are justified via direct observation or handed down from authorities may be 

surprised or confused when presented with complex and conflicting scientific claims on a 

scientific topic. The incongruence between beliefs and context may be ignored at first; however, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 67 

if the learner is repeatedly exposed to discrepant information, the learner’s beliefs may be shaken 

and anxiety may arise (Bendixen & Rule, 2004). Frustration may occur when an epistemic 

perspective is perceived as unacceptable, and boredom may ensue when prolonged frustration 

turns into disengagement (D’Mello et al., 2014). Inversely, an individual who believes that 

knowledge is complex and tentative, and that knowledge claims are formed of multiple 

perspectives and justified via an inquiry process, is likely to experience epistemic congruence 

when reading complex and conflicting scientific information. They may feel curious when 

encountering new information or experience joy when epistemic aims are achieved. 

Muis et al. (2015) proposed that epistemic emotions predict learning strategies and, in 

turn, learning achievement. On the basis of prominent models of self-regulated learning (Winne, 

2001; Muis, 2007) and empirical research on learners’ self-regulated learning strategies during 

complex learning (Azevedo, Cromley, & Seibert, 2004; Greene & Azevedo, 2009), we consider 

deep learning strategies as those that involve learners’ attempts to integrate new ideas with prior 

knowledge (i.e., knowledge elaboration), evaluate and integrate ideas (i.e., critical thinking), or 

metacognitively engage (e.g., self-questioning, making judgments of learning, monitoring 

strategy use) in flexible and creative ways. In contrast, we consider shallow learning strategies as 

more rigid strategies that lead to superficial processing of information, like simple rehearsal for 

memorization. This classification is consistent with Muis et al.’s (2015) work and other 

empirical work on self-regulated learning and conceptual change (e.g., Dole & Sinatra, 1998; 

Franco et al., 2012; Pintrich et al., 1991; Stathopoulou & Vosniadou, 2007). For relations 

between epistemic emotions and learning strategies, Muis et al. (2015) proposed that curiosity 

and enjoyment facilitate the use of deep learning strategies, whereas negative activating 

emotions such as anxiety and frustration lead to shallow learning strategies (see Pekrun & 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 68 

Stephens, 2012 for a review of supporting evidence). Further, surprise and confusion should 

relate to metacognitive self-regulation, and a deactivating emotion like boredom should impair 

the use of any learning strategies. Finally, for relations between learning strategies and learning 

achievement, following previous research (Franco et al., 2012; Greene & Azevedo, 2009), Muis 

et al. (2015) proposed that deep learning strategies are more likely to positively predict learning 

outcomes, whereas shallow learning strategies are more likely to negatively predict learning 

outcomes.  

Muis et al. (2015) conducted an empirical study to test their theoretical framework. Four 

hundred thirty-nine undergraduate students from large universities across three countries first 

took a prior knowledge test on climate change, reported their epistemic beliefs about climate 

change on the Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (TSEBQ; Bråten & Strømsø, 

2009), then read four conflicting texts on the topic of climate change. After reading each text, 

learners reported emotions experienced during reading on the Epistemic Emotions Scales (EES; 

Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017). After studying all texts, participants reported learning 

strategies used on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ: Pintrich, Smith, 

Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993), and then completed a knowledge verification task to measure 

learning achievement. Results showed that a belief in complex knowledge predicted lower levels 

of confusion, anxiety, and boredom, and a belief in tentative knowledge predicted lower levels of 

anxiety and frustration. Further, a belief in the active construction of knowledge predicted lower 

levels of confusion. Lastly, a belief in the justification for knowing via critical evaluation 

predicted higher levels of enjoyment and curiosity, and lower levels of boredom. Counter to their 

hypotheses, surprise was not predicted by any belief dimension. For relations between epistemic 

emotions and learning strategies, results showed that curiosity and enjoyment predicted critical 

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 69 

thinking, knowledge elaboration, and metacognitive self-regulation, and anxiety and frustration 

predicted simple rehearsal. Boredom was negatively related to all learning strategies.  

However, a few counter-hypothetical results were observed, namely that confusion 

positively predicted metacognitive self-regulation and that surprise negatively predicted critical 

thinking. In terms of relations between learning strategies and learning achievement, both critical 

thinking and knowledge elaboration positively predicted learning achievement. Counter to 

predictions, metacognitive self-regulation negatively predicted learning achievement. Overall, 

results showed that epistemic beliefs served as antecedents to epistemic emotions and these, in 

turn, mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. Moreover, 

unexpectedly, results showed that curiosity, enjoyment, and confusion predicted lower learning 

achievement via metacognitive self-regulation. Given a number of unexpected results, further 

empirical investigation into Muis et al.’s (2015) model is warranted.  

2.3.1 Proposed extensions to Muis et al.’s (2015) model 

2.3.1.1. Antecedents of epistemic emotions. Emotion appraisal theorists (Ellsworth & 

Scherer, 2003; Lazarus, 1991; Moors, Ellsworth, Scherer, & Frijda, 2013) proposed that 

cognitive appraisals about how events in the world relate to one’s beliefs, goals, values or 

knowledge constitute the cause of an emotion. These appraisals are often quick and unconscious, 

but can also be less automated (Moors et al., 2013), and explain why individuals may experience 

very different emotions in response to similar stimuli (Ellsworth, 2013). Muis et al. (2015) 

proposed that appraisals of epistemic (in)congruity serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions. 

Drawing from the literature on knowledge-related emotions, we propose two additional types of 

appraisals that may serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions: appraisals of information novelty 

and complexity and appraisals of achievement of epistemic aims (see Muis et al., 2018). First, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 70 

when they encounter information that is discrepant with prior knowledge or recently processed 

information, learners may appraise the extent to which new information fits with what they know 

or expect (i.e., appraisal of novelty). Further, individuals may appraise the extent to which they 

can understand new information (i.e., appraisals of complexity). When incoming information is 

deemed unexpected or unexplainable, surprise may arise (Foster & Keane, 2015; Meyer et al., 

1997). If learners judge that incoming information is not too complex and that they have the 

cognitive and metacognitive resources to resolve the discrepancy, curiosity may arise; however, 

if they judge that the information or task is too complex to be resolved, confusion may arise 

(D’Mello et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2009; Silvia, 2010). Second, following Muis (2007) and Chinn 

et al. (2011), individuals may set epistemic aims to apprehend to-be-learned knowledge and 

conduct appraisals of achievement of epistemic aims as learning unfolds. When epistemic aims 

are attained, enjoyment may arise (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008; Muis et al., 2018). However, if 

epistemic aims are blocked, individuals may experience surprise, confusion, frustration, anxiety, 

or boredom (D’Mello et al., 2014; Silvia, 2010). Although these mechanisms for emotional 

arousal have been proposed in the literature, we are the first to empirically examine whether 

appraisals of epistemic congruence, appraisals of information novelty and complexity, and 

appraisals of the attainment of epistemic aims serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions. 

2.3.2.2. Consequences of epistemic emotions. Muis et al.’s (2015) model can be tested at 

a number of levels of granularity. Muis and colleagues tested whether epistemic beliefs reported 

before learning related to various epistemic emotions during learning, and to various learning 

strategies used over a learning session. It can be argued that this analysis constitutes a coarse 

level of granularity. At a finer level of granularity, the model predicts that specific cognitive 

appraisals serve as antecedents to specific epistemic emotions, and further predicts that these 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 71 

emotions have proximal consequences for the enactment of specific learning strategies. To test 

the model at this level, methods have to be used that allow the measurement of processes that are 

dynamic and changing at a fine level of granularity, such as online measures. 

According to Schraw (2010), online measures are measurements taken during learning, 

and can be contrasted with offline measures, which are measurements taken before or after 

learning. Online measures can gather data unobtrusively (e.g., reading times, trace logs) or 

require learners’ conscious attention (e.g., think-aloud protocols, inserted quiz). On the other 

hand, common offline measures include self-report questionnaires that use Likert-type scales to 

measure beliefs or behaviors. When it comes to epistemic beliefs, self-report instruments have 

been criticized for their low internal consistency (see DeBacker, Crowson, Beesley, Thoma, & 

Hestevold, 2008; Greene et al., 2008). The same can be said of self-regulated learning self-report 

instruments. Specifically, prior work has shown that learners are poor at reporting the actual 

frequency with which they use particular self-regulatory strategies (Kitchener, 1983; Winne, 

Jamieson-Noel, & Muis, 2002). To address these issues, researchers have suggested using trace 

methodologies such as think-aloud methods to capture traces of epistemic cognition and self-

regulated learning (Greene et al., 2010; Winne et al., 2002). Think-aloud protocols are said to 

provide rich information about online processes and further reveal the temporal deployment of 

processes as they unfold, one after the other (Charter, 2003; Schraw, 2010; Winne et al., 2002).  

There certainly exists another finer level of granularity at which Muis et al.’s (2015) 

model could be tested, namely by manipulating epistemic cognition and emotions to trigger the 

predicted transitions. However, before more systematic manipulations of antecedents can be 

tested, there is a need to clearly identify the antecedents of epistemic emotions and to explore 

transitions between emotions and cognition/metacognition as they spontaneously emerge. To fill 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 72 

this gap in the literature, we conducted research that we present as two studies: The first study 

explores the incidence of epistemic emotions as they naturally arise during learning of complex 

and conflicting knowledge, and the consequences of epistemic emotions for learning. The second 

study tests Muis et al.’s (2015) model using think-aloud data that reflects enacted self-regulatory 

processes during learning. We next present the research questions and hypotheses that guided our 

investigations.  

3. The Current Studies 

The purpose of the present research was to evaluate and extend Muis et al.’s (2015) 

integrated framework across two studies. The purpose of Study 1 was to explore the antecedents 

and consequences of epistemic emotions during learning of complex and conflicting knowledge. 

A first objective was to explore the role and relative importance of three proposed antecedents of 

epistemic emotions, and to assess whether variability in antecedents resulted in differential 

consequences for learning. A second objective was to explore the moment-to-moment 

consequences of epistemic emotions on learning processes by calculating the likelihood of state 

transitions. 

3.1. Study 1 Research Questions and Hypotheses 

For Study 1, we asked the following research questions: (1) What proportion of epistemic 

emotions are related to epistemic (in)congruity compared to information novelty and complexity, 

and the blockage or attainment of epistemic aims? (2) Do epistemic emotions increase the 

likelihood of a transition into subsequent learning strategies during learning? (3) Are there 

variations in these relations as a function of epistemic emotion antecedent?  

For Research Question 1, on the basis of reviewed literature, we hypothesized that 

appraisals of epistemic congruity, appraisals of information novelty and complexity, and 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 73 

appraisals of the attainment of epistemic aims are antecedent to epistemic emotions. Given that 

no prior research has examined multiple antecedents of epistemic emotions in a single study, we 

did not have a specific hypothesis for the proportions in which these various antecedents may 

trigger epistemic emotions in the context of learning complex and conflicting knowledge. For 

Research Question 2, drawing from Muis et al.’s (2015) model, we hypothesized the following 

transitions (see Figure 1): curiosity and enjoyment will increase the likelihood of a transition into 

knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, or metacognitive self-regulation; frustration and anxiety 

will increase the likelihood of a transition into rehearsal; surprise and confusion will increase the 

likelihood of a transition into metacognitive self-regulation; and boredom will decrease the 

likelihood of a transition into any learning strategy. 

For transitions between epistemic emotions and epistemic cognition, previous theoretical 

and empirical work suggests that epistemic cognition may occur before and after epistemic 

emotions (see Muis et al., 2018). Recall that we define epistemic cognition as the activation of 

epistemic beliefs, the setting of epistemic aims and the use of epistemic strategies. According to 

Muis’s (2007) framework on the role of epistemic beliefs in self-regulated learning, epistemic 

beliefs are activated in the very first phase of self-regulated learning, as learners generate a task 

definition; epistemic beliefs are thus expected to arise temporally before epistemic emotions. 

Epistemic aims, like other learning goals, are set during the second phase of self-regulated 

learning, but can temporally occur at any point during learning, as phases are loosely sequenced 

(Muis, 2007). Given that no prior work has been conducted to examine whether epistemic 

emotions arise before or after epistemic aims are set, we did not have a hypothesis with regard to 

the temporal sequencing between epistemic aims and epistemic emotions. Lastly, like learning 

strategies, epistemic strategies arise during the enactment phase (third phrase) of Muis’s (2007) 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 74 

model of self-regulated learning. By analogy, we hypothesized that epistemic emotions may have 

consequences for the use of epistemic strategies. For instance, a learner who has activated the 

belief that scientific knowledge is complex, who then encounters conflicting claims may feel 

curious, set the epistemic aim to form justified knowledge on the topic, and use justification 

strategies to generate integrated knowledge. In sum, drawing from Muis’s (2007) model of 

epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning, and on the basis of the reasoning elaborated above, 

we hypothesized that epistemic cognition would increase the likelihood of a transition into 

epistemic emotions, and that epistemic emotions would increase the likelihood of a transition 

into epistemic cognition.  

Finally, for Research Question 3, we did not have a specific hypothesis, but sought to 

explore whether differences in subsequent states occurred as a function of epistemic emotion 

antecedent. This question was exploratory in nature as no prior work to date has empirically 

examined the relations between antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions.  

3.2 Study 2 Research Questions and Hypotheses 

In Study 2, we sought to verify whether results obtained by Muis et al. (2015) could be 

replicated by conducting a path analysis to test relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic 

emotions, learning strategies and learning achievement, using verbalized learning strategies 

instead of self-reported data. We formulated Research Question 4 as follows: What are the 

predictive relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, self-regulatory learning 

strategies, and learning achievement? Figure 1 presents Muis et al.’s (2015) hypothesized model, 

with prior knowledge included as a covariate.

 75 

4.1.1. Participants  

One hundred fourteen undergraduate students from multiple disciplines (mathematics, 

science, engineering, psychology, education, business, among others) participated in this 

research. Participants were recruited from a large university in Canada through a classified 

advertisement system. They participated on a voluntary basis and received $15 as compensation. 

The sample was predominantly female (66.7 %, n = 76), white (54.4 %, n = 62), and English-

speaking (63.2 %, n = 72). Participants were 21.3 years of age (SD = 2.9) on average. 

4.1.2. Text materials 

To create a complex learning situation where issues of knowledge are at stake, we 

presented learners with four conflicting texts on the causes and consequences of climate change, 

in conflicting pairs. The four texts were adapted from Strømsø et al. (2010; see Appendix A). 

The first text presented climate change as manmade and was written by an academic researcher. 

The text contained 314 words and had a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level2 equivalent to grade 12. 

The second text presented climate change as caused by astronomical conditions and was written 

by a professor in astrophysics. It contained 324 words and had a Flesch-Kincaid reading level 

equivalent to grade 10. The third text presented negative consequences of climate change with a 

geopolitical perspective and was written by a scientific journalist. It contained 356 words and 

had a Flesch-Kincaid reading level equivalent to grade 11. Finally, the fourth text presented 

positive consequences of climate change from an economical perspective and was written by a 

newspaper journalist. It contained 272 words and had a Flesch-Kincaid reading level equivalent 

to grade 12. The four texts were presented in a fixed linear order, as to make salient the 

conflicting nature of the texts. A pilot study was conducted with a sample of over 200 lay adults 

(no university students participated). The pilot was conducted online using a popular survey 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 76 

platform and was administered in part. Pilot data analysis revealed no effect of text order on 

outcomes variables of interest. 

4.1.3. Data sources 

4.1.3.1. Epistemic emotions. A think-aloud procedure was used to capture learners’ 

epistemic emotions in real time. Protocols were first transcribed verbatim, which resulted in 803 

pages (8687 lines) of text. The first author segmented each transcript into meaningful units of 

analysis, which consisted of a clause or sentence that enclosed a thought or idea. Each segment 

was then assigned a code, according to a coding scheme developed by the first three authors. The 

coding scheme was tested by the first three authors using three transcripts, and inter-rater 

reliability for the first round was established at 83%. All disagreements were resolved through 

discussion and were used to update the coding scheme. The first author then coded the remainder 

of the protocols. The third author then independently coded 15% of the remaining protocols 

coded by the first author, and final inter-rater reliability based on these protocols was established 

at 92%.  

The development of the coding scheme for epistemic emotions was based on the EES 

 (Pekrun et al., 2017) and, as such, focused on surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, 

frustration, anxiety, and boredom (see Table 1 for the complete coding scheme, including 

definitions and examples for each code). Emotions were further coded according to their object 

focus: Each emotion was classified as an epistemic, topic, achievement, or social emotion, 

according to Pekrun and Linnenbrink-Garcia’s (2012) classification. Words and sentences 

uttered before or after an emotion were considered to determine an emotion’s object focus. For 

instance, “The oil and gas deposits that are concealed there are estimated to amount to 30 per 

cent of the earth's deposits… Great! Now we can screw over the environment even more” was 

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 77 

coded as topic frustration. In contrast, “This is pretty absurd, trying to find the positives in global 

warming by saying we’ll have access to more gas which we’ll then burn which will contribute 

further to global warming. This is a stupid article. It’s just kind of a strange view” was coded as 

epistemic frustration, where the learner is frustrated that the author presents such a perspective 

about climate change. 

Epistemic emotions were further classified according to their antecedents. Table 2 

includes descriptors and examples of epistemic emotions related to each antecedent. Words or 

sentences uttered before or after an emotion were taken into consideration to determine the type 

of appraisal that led to emotion arousal. For instance, “When particles that originate from 

previously exploded stars penetrate the atmosphere, they could affect the formation of low 

clouds. That’s kind of cool to know!” was coded as enjoyment related to information novelty. In 

contrast, “I mean, I like to learn about a different viewpoint,” was coded as enjoyment related to 

epistemic congruity.  

4.1.3.2. Learning strategies. Learning strategies were captured through a think-aloud 

procedure. Protocols were then coded for learning strategies, using a coding scheme developed 

for this purpose. The coding scheme incorporated the four macro-level learning strategies 

proposed in the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich, Smith, 

Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993), which Muis et al. (2015) had used to measure learning strategies in 

their original study: rehearsal, knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, and metacognitive self-

regulation. We also drew from Greene and Azevedo’s (2009) coding scheme for self-regulatory 

processes to generate more detailed descriptions for each learning strategy. For instance, the 

following micro-level processes were used to describe the macro-level code “metacognitive self-

regulation”: making judgments of learning, emitting feelings of knowledge, monitoring progress 

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 78 

towards goal, and monitoring use of strategy. Lastly, we included “prior knowledge activation” 

and “re-reading” from Greene and Azevedo’s coding scheme as they were deemed relevant to 

the present learning task. The final coding scheme comprised six learning strategies, including: 

prior knowledge activation, rereading, rehearsal, knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, and 

metacognitive self-regulation (see Table 1 for the complete coding scheme, including definitions 

and examples for each learning strategy). For analyses, following others (e.g., Dole & Sinatra, 

1998; Pintrich et al., 1993; Stathopoulou & Vosniadou, 2007; Franco, et al., 2012) we grouped 

together learning strategies that required little cognitive manipulation (i.e., prior knowledge 

activation, rereading, rehearsal) as shallow learning strategies, and learning strategies that 

required more extensive cognitive manipulation (i.e., knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, 

metacognitive self-regulation) as deep learning strategies. 

4.1.3.3. Epistemic cognition. Epistemic cognition was captured via a think-aloud 

procedure. Protocols were coded for epistemic cognition using a coding scheme developed for 

this purpose. The development of the coding scheme was based on Greene et al.’s (2014) coding 

scheme for epistemic cognition (see Table 1 for a complete list of codes, definitions, and 

examples). Final categories included epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, as well as epistemic 

strategies. Three classes of epistemic strategies were included: sourcing strategies, integration 

strategies, and justification strategies.  

4.1.4. Procedure 

This research was conducted in a laboratory setting, with the assistance of a trained 

experimenter. Participants first signed a consent form that included a statement of the purpose of 

research. Participants next completed a demographics questionnaire, a prior knowledge test (used 

as a covariate in Study 2; see section 4.3.1), and the Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs 

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 79 

Questionnaire (TSEBQ; Bråten & Strømsø, 2009) to capture learners’ epistemic beliefs (see 

section 4.3.2). Next, participants received instructions for the think-aloud protocol, as per 

Ericsson and Simon’s (1993) recommendations: Participants were asked to think out loud while 

reading and studying, that is, to say everything that they were thinking and doing. If participants 

remained silent for more than three seconds, they were prompted by the experimenter to keep 

talking. We did not specifically instruct participants to express their emotions out loud.  

A think-aloud practice was conducted prior to reading the experimental texts using two unrelated 

texts (approximately 150 words). After the practice texts, participants proceeded to reading the 

experimental texts. A blank space on the computer screen was reserved for note-taking while 

studying; however, participants were told they would not have access to their notes during the 

post-test. Participants were alerted to the conflicting nature of the task contained in the texts with 

the following information: “Two of the texts discuss the causes of climate change and were 

written by science experts. One expert claims that humans are responsible for climate change, 

whereas the other expert claims that changes to the climate are natural. The other two texts, 

written by journalists, focus on the pros and cons of climate change. Whereas one journalist 

reports on the pros of climate change, the other journalist reports on the cons of climate change.”  

After having read each of the first three texts, participants completed a short version of the EES 

(Pekrun et al., 2017). Participants then completed the full EES after having read the fourth 

experimental text and completed a post-test to measure learning achievement. When the study 

was over, participants were thanked and received compensation. Debriefing information was 

offered to all participants: The experimenter provided verbal definitions for epistemic beliefs and 

epistemic emotions as well as explanations as to the choices of text and their order of 

presentation. In total, the experiment lasted approximately one hour. Instructions were scripted to 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 80 

ensure consistency in instructions across participants. For the purpose of Study 1, self-reported 

emotions and epistemic beliefs were not included in any analyses but were used for Study 2.  

4.1.5. Analytical approach 

To examine the consequences of epistemic emotions on cognitive and metacognitive 

learning processes, we conducted state-transition analysis to test for the likelihood of 

transitioning from a given emotional state to a subsequent learning strategy. State-transition 

analyses have been used in quantitative research to capture the temporal deployment of affective, 

cognitive and metacognitive states during learning (see Azevedo et al., 2010; D’Mello & 

Graesser, 2012; Poitras & Trevors, 2012; Witherspoon, Azevedo, & D'Mello, 2008). State-

transition analysis is performed by creating a matrix of all the possible states (here, we 

considered emotions, epistemic cognition, and learning strategies) and entering the number of 

times learners transitioned from one state to the next based on coded trace data, such as data 

from think-aloud protocols. This results in a state-transition table that can be used to calculate the 

probability of transitioning from one emotion to a subsequent state.  

The underlying assumption to our investigation is that emotions have consequences for 

learning processes and that this can be observed immediately after an epistemic emotion arises. 

We assumed that emotions and follow-up learning strategies were not independent from each 

other, such that the frequency with which a specific learning strategy followed a specific 

epistemic emotion would be greater than chance (i.e., if distributed randomly). To test whether a 

given transition occurred at a rate higher than chance, we created 2 x 2 contingency tables to 

compare the frequency distribution of specific transitions against a prior distribution of variables. 

We then conducted chi-squared tests to determine whether the likelihood of transitions was 

significantly greater than chance. For instance, suppose that across all participants, critical 

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 81 

thinking was coded 100 times whereas other learning strategies were coded 900 times (for a total 

of 1000 learning strategies). Let us further suppose that frustration was followed by critical 

thinking 10 times across all participants, whereas frustration was followed by another learning 

strategy 90 times overall (for a total of 100 instances of frustration). The likelihood of critical 

thinking following frustration would then be equal to chance, given the prior distribution of 

frustration in the overall sample. However, for the same distribution of critical thinking, if 

frustration was followed by critical thinking 50 times and followed by another emotion 50 times, 

a transition from frustration to critical thinking would then by significantly greater than chance, 

as would be reflected by a significant chi-squared test.   

 4.2. Results 

4.2.1. Antecedents of epistemic emotions  

Prior to addressing Research Question 1, which concerned the antecedents of epistemic 

emotions, we first identified segments that represented meaningful emotions, epistemic 

cognition, or learning strategies, which resulted in 3301 coded segments. We then examined the 

object focus of each emotion to determine its type (i.e., achievement, social, epistemic, or topic). 

As shown in Table 3, think-aloud protocols contained a total of 267 instances of emotions: 

77.53 % (n = 207) were epistemic emotions, 19.48 % (n = 52) were topic emotions, and 3 % (n = 

8) were achievement emotions. Emotions with an epistemic focus included surprise (n = 86; 

41.55 %), curiosity (n = 92; 44.44 %), enjoyment (n = 7; 3.38 %), confusion (n = 16; 7.73 %), 

and frustration (n = 6; 2.89 %). No instances of epistemic anxiety or epistemic boredom were 

identified; all instances of anxiety were topic anxiety, and all instances of boredom were 

achievement boredom.  

 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 82 

We further classified epistemic emotions according to their antecedents (i.e., type of 

appraisal) and calculated the proportions in which each type of appraisal related to epistemic 

emotions. Table 4 shows that across 207 instances of epistemic emotions, 22.22 % (n = 46) were 

related to appraisals of epistemic (in)congruity, 76.81 % (n = 159) were related to appraisals of 

information novelty and complexity, and .97 % (n = 2) were related to the attainment of 

epistemic aims. Specifically, 10.46 % (n = 9) of instances of surprise related to epistemic 

(in)congruity, as did 31.52 % (n = 29) of instances of curiosity, 12.50 % (n = 2) of instances of 

confusion, and 100 % (n = 6) of instances of epistemic frustration. Moreover, 89.53 % (n = 77) 

of instances of surprise were related to information novelty and complexity, as were 68.48% 

(n = 63) of instances of curiosity and 87.50% (n = 14) of instances of confusion. Lastly, 28.57 % 

(n = 2) of instances of enjoyment related to epistemic aims. In response to our first research 

question, results showed that a greater proportion of epistemic emotions related to information 

novelty and complexity than to epistemic (in)congruity, and only a small proportion of epistemic 

emotions related to epistemic aims.  

4.2.2. Transitions between epistemic emotions and learning strategies 

To address Research Question 2, which concerned the sequential dynamics between 

epistemic emotions and other cognitive and metacognitive learning processes, we conducted 

state-transition analyses on the basis of the distribution of epistemic emotions, learning 

strategies, and epistemic cognition across think-aloud protocols. Table 5 presents the frequency 

of epistemic emotions, learning strategies, and epistemic cognition in think-aloud protocols. 

Table 6 presents the frequency of transitions from an epistemic emotion to all possible follow-up 

states. We considered learners’ continued engagement with the learning material as a valid 

subsequent state (“continues to read”). To examine transitions from epistemic emotions to a 

 
 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 83 

subsequent learning strategy, we created multiple 2 x 2 contingency tables (Tables 7, 8, and 9) to 

test for statistical differences between observed frequencies and expected frequencies (see 

Section 4.1.5). Because chi-squared tests assume at least five cases in each cell, we could only 

test the statistical significance of transitions from curiosity and surprise to subsequent learning 

strategies. For transitions from curiosity to a subsequent learning strategy, we identified a trend 

that was approaching statistical significance that showed that curiosity was followed by 

metacognitive self-regulation more often than statistically expected, c2(1) = 3.62, p = .057, as 

displayed in Table 7. Examples of this sequence included: “That’s interesting [curiosity]. I didn’t 

know that temperature dropping was a concern of global warming [metacognitive self-

regulation]”, and “I find this really interesting [curiosity], because I never really hear about 

positive effects of global warming, I always hear about the negative effects [metacognitive self-

regulation]”. These results are aligned with our hypothesis.  

For transitions from surprise to a subsequent learning strategy, results showed that 

surprise was followed by rehearsal significantly less often than statistically expected, c2(1) = 

4.54, p = .033, as displayed in Table 8. Further, results showed that surprise was followed by 

critical thinking significantly more often than statistically expected, c2(1) = 14.56, p < .001, as 

displayed in Table 9. An example of this sequence included: “Wow… [surprise] It’s putting 

people in danger basically more… And it’s probably going to keep rising as we go along if 

nothing really changes [critical thinking]” and “[A number of oceanographers fear highly 

uncomfortable side effects due to global warming…] What? Haha! [surprise] I think ‘highly 

uncomfortable’ is an understatement. People are going to die and like entire places where people 

live are going to be like under the ocean soon. I think that’s more than uncomfortable [critical 

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 84 

thinking].” Although this finding was unexpected, it is consistent with previous research, as will 

be discussed later.  

4.2.3. Transitions between epistemic emotions and epistemic cognition 

As part of Research Question 2, we explored how epistemic emotions sequentially related 

to epistemic cognition during learning. Epistemic cognition was meaningfully related to 

epistemic emotions in 13 cases, out of the 366 instances of epistemic emotions. For all 13 

instances, epistemic cognition followed epistemic emotions. Two recurrent patterns were 

identified: an epistemic emotion was followed by a source evaluation (e.g., “Oh wow [surprise], 

another journalist [source evaluation]”), and an epistemic emotion was followed by an epistemic 

aim (e.g., “I find this very surprising [surprise] and I say I want to learn a lot more about it 

[epistemic aim]”). As will be elaborated in the discussion, this result suggests that epistemic 

strategies may be consequences of epistemic emotions, whereas epistemic beliefs and epistemic 

aims may be better construed as antecedents of epistemic emotions. 

4.2.4. Variations in subsequent state as a function of epistemic emotion antecedent 

To address Research Question 3, we explored whether the consequences of epistemic 

emotions on learning strategies varied as a function of antecedent. For curiosity to metacognitive 

self-regulation transitions, we identified 11 occurrences. Of the 11 instances, curiosity related to 

appraisals of information novelty and complexity nine times, versus two instances where 

curiosity related to appraisals of epistemic (in)congruity. In total, curiosity was related to 

information novelty and complexity 68.48 % (n = 63) of the time, whereas it was related to 

epistemic (in)congruity 31.52 % (n = 29) of the time. This difference was non-significant, c2(1) 

= .91, p = .340. For surprise to rehearsal strategies transitions, we identified six occurrences. Of 

these six instances, surprise related to appraisals of information novelty and complexity five 

 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 85 

times whereas surprise was related epistemic (in)congruity only once. In total, surprise was 

related to information novelty and complexity 89.53 % (n = 77) of the time, whereas surprise 

related to epistemic (in)congruity 10.47 % (n = 9) of the time. This difference was non-

significant, c2(1) = 2.46, p = .620. For surprise to critical thinking transitions, we identified 18 

occurrences. Of the 18 instances, surprise was related to appraisals of information novelty and 

complexity 14 times, whereas surprise was related to epistemic (in)congruity four times. This 

difference was also non-significant, c2(1) = 2.67, p = .102, based on the distribution of surprise 

per antecedent in total. In light of these results, we inferred that the consequences of epistemic 

emotions on learning strategies were not a function of the type of appraisal that served as 

antecedent. These results are discussed in detail in the Discussion section. 

5. Study 2    

5.1. Method 

5.1.1. Participants 

The same sample was used for Study 2 as from Study 1 (see section 4.1.1.). 

5.1.2. Text materials 

All text materials were identical to Study 1 (see section 4.1.2.). 

5.1.3. Data sources 

5.1.3.1. Prior knowledge. Given established relations between prior knowledge and 

topic-specific epistemic beliefs (Bråten & Strømsø, 2009), we assessed learners’ prior 

knowledge about climate change to use as a covariate. A 15-item multiple-choice test was 

adapted from Bråten, Strømsø, and Samuelstuen (2008) to assess participants’ knowledge of 

content covered in the texts (see Appendix B). An example item was: “The greenhouse effect is 

due to (a) holes in the ozone layer, (b) increased use of nuclear energy, (c) increased occurrence 

 
 
 
 
 
EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 

 86 

of acidic precipitation, (d) streams of heat that do not get out of the atmosphere, or (d) the 

pollution of the oceans.” One point was awarded for each correct answer. The final score 

consisted of a sum out of a maximum of 15. Given that the prior knowledge test covered a range 

of topics, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the 15 items. Byrne (2005) 

recommends using EFA when researchers have no prior knowledge of the underlying factor 

structure of a measure, as opposed to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which is appropriate 

to use when a factor structure is hypothesized a priori on theoretical grounds. Maximum 

likelihood with varimax rotation was conducted. Four dimensions were identified, which 

accounted for 42.89% of the variance. The four dimensions resulted in Cronbach’s alphas of .63 

(two items), .71 (four items), .73 (four items) and .76 (five items). Correlations between each of 

the four dimensions of prior knowledge and the variables in the model were very similar (i.e., 

within one one-hundredth). As such, to simplify tables and figures, only one coefficient is 

reported but note that all four dimensions were used in the analyses as covariates. 

5.1.3.2. Epistemic beliefs. The TSEBQ was used to measure learners’ epistemic beliefs 

about climate change (see Appendix C). Six items assessed beliefs about the 

simplicity/complexity of climate change knowledge (e.g., “Knowledge about climate change 

consists of highly interrelated concepts rather than an accumulation of facts”); six items assessed 

beliefs about the certainty/uncertainty of climate change knowledge (e.g., “The results of climate 

research are preliminary”); five items assessed beliefs about the source of knowing about climate 

change  (e.g., “When I read about climate problems, I only stick to what the text expresses” 

[reversed]); and seven items assess beliefs about the justification for knowing about climate 

change (e.g., “To be able to trust knowledge claims in texts about issues concerning climate, one 

has to check various knowledge sources”). Participants rated items on a 10-point Likert scale,
