Introduction

Let X be a nice topological space (for example, a CW complex). One goal of algebraic topology is to study
the topology of X by means of algebraic invariants, such as the singular cohomology groups Hn(X; G) of X
with coeﬃcients in an abelian group G. These cohomology groups have proven to be an extremely useful
tool, due largely to the fact that they enjoy excellent formal properties (which have been axiomatized by
Eilenberg and Steenrod, see [26]), and the fact that they tend to be very computable. However, the usual
deﬁnition of Hn(X; G) in terms of singular G-valued cochains on X is perhaps somewhat unenlightening.
This raises the following question: can we understand the cohomology group Hn(X; G) in more conceptual
terms?

As a ﬁrst step toward answering this question, we observe that Hn(X; G) is a representable functor
of X. That is, there exists an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(G, n) and a universal cohomology class η ∈
Hn(K(G, n); G) such that, for any nice topological space X, pullback of η determines a bijection

[X, K(G, n)] → Hn(X; G).

Here [X, K(G, n)] denotes the set of homotopy classes of maps from X to K(G, n). The space K(G, n) can
be characterized up to homotopy equivalence by the above property, or by the the formula

πkK(G, n) ≃

if k 6= n
∗
G if k = n.

(

In the case n = 1, we can be more concrete. An Eilenberg MacLane space K(G, 1) is called a classifying
space for G, and is typically denoted by BG. The universal cover of BG is a contractible space EG, which
carries a free action of the group G by covering transformations. We have a quotient map π : EG → BG.
Each ﬁber of π is a discrete topological space, on which the group G acts simply transitively. We can
summarize the situation by saying that EG is a G-torsor over the classifying space BG. For every continuous
X : EG ×BG X has the structure of a G-torsor on X: that is, it is a space
map X → BG, the ﬁber product
endowed with a free action of G and a homeomorphism
X/G ≃ X. This construction determines a map
from [X, BG] to the set of isomorphism classes of G-torsors on X. If X is a well-behaved space (such as a
CW complex), then this map is a bijection. We therefore have (at least) three diﬀerent ways of thinking
about a cohomology class η ∈ H1(X; G):

e

e

(1) As a G-valued singular cocycle on X, which is well-deﬁned up to coboundaries.

(2) As a continuous map X → BG, which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy.

(3) As a G-torsor on X, which is well-deﬁned up to isomorphism.

These three points of view are equivalent if the space X is suﬃciently nice. However, they are generally quite
diﬀerent from one another. The singular cohomology of a space X is constructed using continuous maps
from simplices ∆k into X. If there are not many maps into X (for example if every path in X is constant),
then we cannot expect singular cohomology to tell us very much about X. The second deﬁnition uses maps
from X into the classifying space BG, which (ultimately) relies on the existence of continuous real-valued
functions on X. If X does not admit many real-valued functions, then the set of homotopy classes [X, BG]
is also not a very useful invariant. For such spaces, the third approach is the most powerful: there is a good
theory of G-torsors on an arbitrary topological space X.

There is another reason for thinking about H1(X; G) in the language of G-torsors: it continues to make
X is a G-torsor on a topological
sense in situations where the traditional ideas of topology break down. If
X with a
space X, then the projection map
X determines an action of G on F. The sheaf F (with its G-action)
sheaf of sets F on X. The action of G on
and the space
X (with its G-action) determine each other, up to canonical isomorphism. Consequently, we
can formulate the deﬁnition of a G-torsor in terms of the category ShvSet(X) of sheaves of sets on X, without

X → X is a local homeomorphism; we may therefore identify

ever mentioning the topological space X itself. The same deﬁnition makes sense in any category which bears
for example, in any
a suﬃciently strong resemblance to the category of sheaves on a topological space:
Grothendieck topos. This observation allows us to construct a theory of torsors in a variety of nonstandard
contexts, such as the ´etale topology of algebraic varieties (see [2]).

Describing the cohomology of X in terms of the sheaf theory of X has still another advantage, which comes
into play even when the space X is assumed to be a CW complex. For a general space X, isomorphism classes
of G-torsors on X are classiﬁed not by the singular cohomology H1
sing(X; G), but by the sheaf cohomology
H1
sheaf(X; G) of X with coeﬃcients in the constant sheaf G associated to G. This sheaf cohomology is deﬁned
more generally for any sheaf of groups G on X. Moreover, we have a conceptual interpretation of H1
sheaf(X; G)
in general: it classiﬁes G-torsors on X (that is, sheaves F on X which carry an action of G and locally admit
a G-equivariant isomorphism F ≃ G) up to isomorphism. The general formalism of sheaf cohomology is
extremely useful, even if we are interested only in the case where X is a nice topological space: it includes,
for example, the theory of cohomology with coeﬃcients in a local system on X.

Let us now attempt to obtain a similar interpretation for cohomology classes η ∈ H2(X; G). What should
play the role of a G-torsor in this case? To answer this question, we return to the situation where X is a CW
complex, so that η can be identiﬁed with a continuous map X → K(G, 2). We can think of K(G, 2) as the
classifying space of a group: not the discrete group G, but instead the classifying space BG (which, if built
in a suﬃciently careful way, comes equipped with the structure of a topological abelian group). Namely, we
can identify K(G, 2) with the quotient E/BG, where E is a contractible space with a free action of BG. Any
cohomology class η ∈ H2(X; G) determines a map X → K(G, 2) (which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy),
and we can form the pullback
X as a torsor over X: not for the discrete
group G, but instead for its classifying space BG.

X = E ×BG X. We now think of

e

To complete the analogy with our analysis in the case n = 1, we would like to interpret the ﬁbration
X → X as deﬁning some kind of sheaf F on the space X. This sheaf F should have the property that for
each x ∈ X, the stalk Fx can be identiﬁed with the ﬁber
Xx ≃ BG. Since the space BG is not discrete (or
homotopy equivalent to a discrete space), the situation cannot be adequately described in the usual language
e
of set-valued sheaves. However, the classifying space BG is almost discrete: since the homotopy groups πiBG
vanish for i > 1, we can recover BG (up to homotopy equivalence) from its fundamental groupoid. This
suggests that we might try to think about F as a “groupoid-valued sheaf” on X, or a stack (in groupoids)
on X.

e

e

Remark. The condition that each stalk Fx be equivalent to a classifying space BG can be summarized by
saying that F is a gerbe on X: more precisely, it is a gerbe banded by the constant sheaf G associated to G.
We refer the reader to [31] for an explanation of this terminology, and a proof that such gerbes are indeed
classiﬁed by the sheaf cohomology group H2

sheaf(X; G).

For larger values of n, even the language of stacks is not suﬃcient to describe the nature of the sheaf F
associated to the ﬁbration
X → X. To address the situation, Grothendieck proposed (in his infamous letter
to Quillen; see [35]) that there should be a theory of n-stacks on X, for every integer n ≥ 0. Moreover, for
every sheaf of abelian groups G on X, the cohomology group Hn+1
sheaf(X; G) should have an interpreation as
classifying a special type of n-stack: namely, the class of n-gerbes banded by G (for a discussion in the case
n = 2, we refer the reader to [13]; we will discuss the general case in §7.2.2). In the special case where the
space X is a point (and where we restrict our attention to n-stacks in groupoids), the theory of n-stacks on
X should recover the classical homotopy theory of n-types: that is, CW complexes Z such that the homotopy
groups πi(Z, z) vanish for i > n (and every base point z ∈ Z). More generally, we should think of an n-stack
(in groupoids) on a general space X as a “sheaf of n-types” on X.

e

When n = 0, an n-stack on a topological space X simply means a sheaf of sets on X. The collection of
all such sheaves can be organized into a category ShvSet(X), and this category is a prototypical example of
a Grothendieck topos. The main goal of this book is to obtain an analogous understanding of the situation
for n > 0. More precisely, we would like answers to the following questions:

(Q1) Given a topological space X, what should we mean by a “sheaf of n-types” on X?

2

(Q2) Let Shv≤n(X) denote the collection of all sheaves of n-types on X. What sort of a mathematical object

is Shv≤n(X)?

(Q3) What special features (if any) does Shv≤n(X) possess?

Our answers to questions (Q2) and (Q3) may be summarized as follows (our answer to (Q1) is more

diﬃcult to summarize, and we will avoid discussing it for the moment):

(A2) The collection Shv≤n(X) has the structure of an ∞-category.

(A3) The ∞-category Shv≤n(X) is an example of an (n + 1)-topos: that is, an ∞-category which satisﬁes
higher categorical analogues of Giraud’s axioms for Grothendieck topoi (see Theorem 6.4.1.5).

Remark. Grothendieck’s vision has been realized in various ways, thanks to the work of a number of
mathematicians (most notably Brown, Joyal, and Jardine: see for example [41]), and their work can also
be used to provide answers to questions (Q1) and (Q2) (for more details, we refer the reader to §6.5.2).
Question (Q3) has also been addressed (at least in limiting case n = ∞) by To¨en and Vezzosi (see [78]) and
in published work of Rezk.

To provide more complete versions of the answers (A2) and (A3), we will need to develop the language
of higher category theory. This is generally regarded as a technical and forbidding subject, but fortunately
we will only need a small fragment of it. More precisely, we will need a theory of (∞, 1)-categories: higher
categories C for which the k-morphisms of C are required to be invertible for k > 1. In §1, we will present
such a theory: namely, one can deﬁne an ∞-category to be a simplicial set satisfying a weakened version of
the Kan extension condition (see Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4; simplicial sets satisfying this condition are also called
weak Kan complexes or quasicategories in the literature). Our intention is that §1 can be used as a short
“user’s guide” to ∞-categories: it contains many of the basic deﬁnitions, and explains how many ideas from
classical category theory can be extended to the ∞-categorical context. To simplify the exposition, we have
deferred many proofs until later chapters, which contain a more thorough account of the theory. The hope
is that §1 will be useful to readers who want to get the ﬂavor of the subject, without becoming overwhelmed
by technical details.

In §2 we will shift our focus slightly: rather than study individual examples of ∞-categories, we consider
families of ∞-categories {CD}D∈D parametrized by the objects of another ∞-category D. We might expect
such a family to be given by a map of ∞-categories p : C → D: given such a map, we can then deﬁne each
CD to be the ﬁber product C ×D{D}. This deﬁnition behaves poorly in general (for example, the ﬁbers CD
need not be ∞-categories), but it behaves well if we make suitable assumptions on the map p. Our goal in
§2 is to study some of these assumptions in detail, and show that they lead to a good relative version of
higher category theory.

One motivation for the theory of ∞-categories is that it arises naturally in addressing questions like (Q2)
above. More precisely, given a collection of mathematical objects {Fα} whose deﬁnition has a homotopy-
theoretic ﬂavor (like n-stacks on a topological space X), we can often organize the collection {Fα} into an
∞-category (in other words, we can ﬁnd an ∞-category C whose vertices correspond to the objects Fα).
Another important example is provided by higher category theory itself: the collection of all ∞-categories
can itself be organized into a (very large) ∞-category, which we will denote by Cat∞. Our goal in §3 is to
study Cat∞ and to show that it can be characterized by a universal property: namely, functors χ : D → Cat∞
are classiﬁed, up to equivalence, by certain kinds of ﬁbrations C → D (see Theorem 3.2.0.1 for a more precise
statement). Roughly speaking, this correspondence assigns to a ﬁbration C → D the functor χ given by the
formula χ(D) = C ×D{D}.

Classically, category theory is a useful tool not so much because of the light it sheds on any particular
mathematical discipline, but instead because categories are so ubiquitous: mathematical objects in many
diﬀerent settings (sets, groups, smooth manifolds, etcetera) can be organized into categories. Moreover,
many elementary mathematical concepts can be described in purely categorical terms, and therefore make
sense in each of these settings. For example, we can form products of sets, groups, and smooth manifolds:

3

each of these notions can simply be described as a Cartesian product in the relevant category. Cartesian
products are a special case of the more general notion of limit, which plays a central role in classical category
theory. In §4, we will make a systematic study of limits (and the dual theory of colimits) in the ∞-categorical
setting. We will also introduce the more general theory of Kan extensions, in both absolute and relative
versions; this theory plays a key technical role throughout the later parts of the book.

In some sense, the material of §1 through §4 of this book should be regarded as purely formal. Our main
results can be summarized as follows: there exists a reasonable theory of ∞-categories, and it behaves in
more or less the same way as the theory of ordinary categories. Many of the ideas that we introduce are
straightforward generalizations of their ordinary counterparts (though proofs in the ∞-categorical setting
often require a bit of dexterity in manipulating simplicial sets), which will be familiar to mathematicians
who are acquainted with ordinary category theory (as presented, for example, in [52]). In §5, we introduce
∞-categorical analogues of more sophisticated concepts from classical category theory: presheaves, Pro and
Ind-categories, accessible and presentable categories, and localizations. The main theme is that most of the
∞-categories which appear “in nature” are large, but are determined by small subcategories. Taking careful
advantage of this fact will allow us to deduce a number of pleasant results, such as an ∞-categorical version
of the adjoint functor theorem (Corollary 5.5.2.9).

In §6 we come to the heart of the book: the study of ∞-topoi, the ∞-categorical analogues of Grothendieck
topoi. The theory of ∞-topoi is our answer to the question (Q3) in the limiting case n = ∞ (we will also
study the analogous notion for ﬁnite values of n). Our main result is an analogue of Giraud’s theorem, which
asserts the equivalence of “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” approaches to the subject (Theorem 6.1.0.6). Roughly
speaking, an ∞-topos is an ∞-category which “looks like” the ∞-category of all homotopy types. We will
show that this intuition is justiﬁed in the sense that it is possible to reconstruct a large portion of classical
homotopy theory inside an arbitrary ∞-topos. In other words, an ∞-topos is a world in which one can “do”
homotopy theory (much as an ordinary topos can be regarded as a world in which one can “do” other types
of mathematics).

In §7 we will discuss the relationship between our theory of ∞-topoi and ideas from classical topology.
We will show that, if X is a paracompact space, then the ∞-topos of “sheaves of homotopy types” on X
can be interpreted in terms of the classical homotopy theory of spaces over X. Another main theme is
that various ideas from geometric topology (such as dimension theory and shape theory) can be described
naturally in the language of ∞-topoi. We will also formulate and prove “nonabelian” generalizations of
classical cohomological results, such as Grothendieck’s vanishing theorem for the cohomology of Noetherian
topological spaces, and the proper base change theorem.

Prerequisites and Suggested Reading

We have made an eﬀort to keep this book as self-contained as possible. The main prerequisite is familiarity
with the classical homotopy theory of simplicial sets (good references include [56] and [32]; we have also
provided a very brief review in §A.2.7). The remaining material that we need is either described in the
appendix, or developed in the body of the text. However, our exposition of this background material is often
somewhat terse, and the reader might beneﬁt from consulting other treatments of the same ideas. Some
suggestions for further reading are listed below.

Warning. The list of references below is woefully incomplete. We have not attempted, either here or in
the body of the text, to give a comprehensive survey of the literature on higher category theory. We have
also not attempted to trace all of the ideas presented to their origins, or to present a detailed history of the
subject. Many of the topics presented in this book have appeared elsewhere, or belong to the mathematical
folklore; it should not be assumed that uncredited results are due to the author.

• Classical Category Theory: Large portions of this book are devoted to providing ∞-categorical
generalizations of the basic notions of category theory. A good reference for many of the concepts we
use is MacLane’s book [52] (see also [1] and [54] for some of the more advanced material of §5).

4

• Classical Topos Theory: Our main goal in this book is to describe an ∞-categorical version of
topos theory. Familiarity with classical topos theory is not strictly necessary (we will deﬁne all of the
relevant concepts as we need them), but will certainly be helpful. Good references include [2] and [53].

• Model Categories: Quillen’s theory of model categories provides a useful tool for studying speciﬁc
examples of ∞-categories, including the theory of ∞-categories itself. We will summarize the theory
of model categories in §A.2; more complete references include [40], [38], and [32].

• Higher Category Theory: There are many approaches to the theory of higher categories, some
of which look quite diﬀerent from the theory presented in this book. Several other possibilities are
presented in the survey article [48]. More detailed accounts can be found in [49], [71], and [75].

In this book, we consider only (∞, 1)-categories: that is, higher categories in which all k-morphisms
are assumed to be invertible for k > 1. There are a number of convenient ways to formalize this idea:
via simplicial categories (see for example [21] and [7]), via Segal categories ([71]), via complete Segal
spaces ([64]), or via the theory of ∞-categories presented in this book (other references include [43],
[44], [60], and [10]). The relationship between these various approaches is described in [8], and an
axiomatic framework which encompasses all of them is described in [76].

• Higher Topos Theory: The idea of studying a topological space X via the theory of sheaves of
n-types (or n-stacks) on X goes back at least to Grothendieck ([35]), and has been taken up a number
of times in recent years. For small values of n, we refer the reader to [31], [74], [13], [45], and [61]. For
the case n = ∞, we refer the reader to [14], [41], [39], and [77]. A very readable introduction to some
of these ideas can be found in [4].

Higher topos theory itself can be considered an abstraction of this idea: rather than studying sheaves
of n-types on a particular topological space X, we instead study general n-categories with the same
formal properties. This idea has been implemented in the work of To¨en and Vezzosi (see [78] and
[79]), resulting in a theory which is essentially equivalent to the one presented in this book. (A rather
diﬀerent variation on this idea in the case n = 2 can be also be found in [11].) The subject has also
been greatly inﬂuenced by the unpublished ideas of Charles Rezk.

Terminology

A few comments on some of the terminology which appears in this book:

• The word topos will always mean Grothendieck topos.

• We let Set∆ denote the category of simplicial sets. If J is a linearly ordered set, we let ∆J denote
the simplicial set given by the nerve of J, so that the collection of n-simplices of ∆J can be identiﬁed
with the collection of all nondecreasing maps {0, . . . , n} → J. We will frequently apply this notation
when J is a subset of {0, . . . , n}; in this case, we can identify ∆J with a subsimplex of the standard
n-simplex ∆n (at least if J 6= ∅; if J = ∅ then ∆J is empty).

• We will refer to a category C as accessible or presentable if it is locally accessible or locally presentable

in the terminology of [54].

• Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the term ∞-category will be used to indicate a higher category in which all

n-morphisms are invertible for n > 1.

• We will study higher category theory in Joyal’s setting of quasicategories. However, we do not always
follow Joyal’s terminology. In particular, we will use the term ∞-category to refer to what Joyal calls a
quasicategory (which are, in turn, the same as the weak Kan complex of Boardman and Vogt); we will
use the terms inner ﬁbration and inner anodyne map where Joyal uses mid-ﬁbration and mid-anodyne
map.

5

• Let n ≥ 0. We will say that a homotopy type X (described by either a topological space or a Kan
complex) is n-truncated if the homotopy groups πi(X, x) vanish for every point x ∈ X and every i > n.
By convention, we say that X is (−1)-truncated if it is either empty or (weakly) contractible, and
(−2)-truncated if X is (weakly) contractible.

• Let n ≥ 0. We will say that a homotopy type X (described either by a topological space or a Kan
complex) is n-connective if X is nonempty and the homotopy groups πi(X, x) vanish for every point
x ∈ X and every integer i < n. By convention, we will agree that every homotopy type X is (−1)-
connective.

• More generally, we will say that a map of homotopy types f : X → Y is n-truncated (n-connective) if

the homotopy ﬁbers of f are n-truncated (n-connective).

Remark. For n ≥ 1, a homotopy type X is n-connective if and only if it is (n − 1)-connected (in the usual
terminology). In particular, X is 1-connective if and only if it is path connected.

Warning. In this book, we will often be concerned with sheaves on a topological space X (or some
Grothendieck site) that take values in an ∞-category C. The most “universal” case is that in which C
is the ∞-category of S of spaces. Consequently, the term “sheaf on X” without any other qualiﬁers will
typically refer to a sheaf of spaces on X, rather than a sheaf of sets on X. We will see that the collection of
all S-valued sheaves on X can be organized into an ∞-category, which we denote by Shv(X). In particular,
Shv(X) will not denote the ordinary category of set-valued sheaves on X; if we need to consider this latter
object, we will denote it by ShvSet(X).

Chapter 1

An Overview of Higher Category
Theory

This chapter is intended as a general introduction to higher category theory. We begin with what we feel
is the most intuitive approach to the subject, based on topological categories. This approach is easy to
understand, but diﬃcult to work with when one wishes to perform even simple categorical constructions.
As a remedy, we will introduce the more suitable formalism of ∞-categories (called weak Kan complexes in
[10] and quasi-categories in [43]), which provides a more convenient setting for adaptations of sophisticated
category-theoretic ideas. Our goal in §1.1.1 is to introduce both approaches and to explain why they are
equivalent to one another. The proof of this equivalence will rely on a crucial result (Theorem 1.1.5.13)
which we will prove in §2.2.

Our second objective in this chapter is to give the reader an idea of how to work with the formalism of
∞-categories. In §1.2 we will establish a vocabulary which includes ∞-categorical analogues (often direct
generalizations) of most of the important concepts from ordinary category theory. To keep the exposition
brisk, we will postpone the more diﬃcult proofs until later chapters of this book. Our hope is that, after
reading this chapter, a reader who does not wish to be burdened with the details will be able to understand
(at least in outline) some of the more conceptual ideas described in §5 and beyond.

1.1 Foundations for Higher Category Theory

1.1.1 Goals and Obstacles

Recall that a category C consists of the following data:

(1) A collection {X, Y, Z, . . .} whose members are the objects of C. We typically write X ∈ C to indicate

that X is an object of C.

(2) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, a set HomC(X, Y ) of morphisms from X to Y . We will typically
write f : X → Y to indicate that f ∈ HomC(X, Y ), and say that f is a morphism from X to Y .

(3) For every object X ∈ C, an identity morphism idX ∈ HomC(X, X).

(4) For every triple of objects X, Y, Z ∈ C, a composition map

HomC(X, Y ) × HomC(Y, Z) → HomC(X, Z).

Given morphisms f : X → Y and g : Y → Z, we will usually denote the image of the pair (f, g) under
the composition map by gf or g ◦ f .

These data are furthermore required to satisfy the following conditions, which guarantee that composition

is unital and associative:

(5) For every morphism f : X → Y , we have idY ◦f = f = f ◦ idX in HomC(X, Y ).

(6) For every triple of composable morphisms

we have an equality h ◦ (g ◦ f ) = (h ◦ g) ◦ f in HomC(W, Z).

The theory of categories has proven to be a valuable organization tool in many areas of mathematics.
Mathematical structures of virtually any type can be viewed as the objects of a suitable category C, where the
morphisms in C are given by structure-preserving maps. There is a veritable legion of examples of categories
which ﬁt this paradigm:

• The category Set whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are maps of sets.

• The category Grp whose objects are groups and whose morphisms are group homomorphisms.

• The category Top whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are continuous maps.

• The category Cat whose objects are (small) categories and whose morphisms are functors. (Recall that
a functor F from C to D is a map which assigns to each object C ∈ C another object F C ∈ D and
to each morphism f : C → C′ in C a morphism F (f ) : F C → F C′ in D, so that F (idC) = idF C and
F (g ◦ f ) = F (g) ◦ F (f ).)

• . . .

In general, the existence of a morphism f : X → Y in a category C reﬂects some relationship that exists
between the objects X, Y ∈ C. In some contexts, these relationships themselves become basic objects of
study, and can themselves be fruitfully organized into categories:

13

Example 1.1.1.1. Let Grp be the category whose objects are groups and whose morphisms are group
homomorphisms. In the theory of groups, one is often concerned only with group homomorphisms up to
for every pair of groups G, H ∈ Grp,
conjugacy. The relation of conjugacy can be encoded as follows:
there is a category Map(G, H) whose objects are group homomorphisms from G to H (that is, elements
of HomGrp(G, H)), where a morphism from f : G → H to f ′ : G → H is an element h ∈ H such that
hf (g)h−1 = f ′(g) for all g ∈ G. Note that two group homomorphisms f, f ′ : G → H are conjugate if and
only if they are isomorphic when viewed as objects of Map(G, H).

Example 1.1.1.2. Let X and Y be topological spaces, and let f0, f1 : X → Y be continuous maps. Recall
that a homotopy from f0 to f1 is a continuous map f : X × [0, 1] → Y such that f |X × {0} coincides with
f0 and f |X × {1} coincides with f1. In algebraic topology, one is often concerned not with the category Top
of topological spaces, but with its homotopy category: that is, the category obtained by identifying those
pairs of morphisms f0, f1 : X → Y which are homotopic to one another. For many purposes, it is better to
do something a little bit more sophisticated: namely, one can form a category Map(X, Y ) whose objects are
continuous maps f : X → Y and whose morphisms are given by (homotopy classes of) homotopies.

Example 1.1.1.3. Given a pair of categories C and D, the collection of all functors from C to D is itself
naturally organized into a category Fun(C, D), where the morphisms are given by natural transformations.
(Recall that, given a pair of functors F, G : C → D, a natural transformation α : F → G is a collection of
morphisms {αC : F (C) → G(C)}C∈C which satisfy the following condition: for every morphism f : C → C′
in C, the diagram

F (C)

F (f )

F (C′)

αC

αC′

G(C)

G(f )

/ G(C′)

commutes in D.)

In each of these examples, the objects of interest can naturally be organized into what is called a 2-
category (or bicategory): we have not only a collection of objects and a notion of morphisms between objects,
but also a notion of morphisms between morphisms, which are called 2-morphisms. The vision of higher
category theory is that there should exist a good notion of n-category for all n ≥ 0, in which we have not
only objects, morphisms, and 2-morphisms, but also k-morphisms for all k ≤ n. Finally, in some sort of
limit we might hope to obtain a theory of ∞-categories, where there are morphisms of all orders.

Example 1.1.1.4. Let X be a topological space, and 0 ≤ n ≤ ∞. We can extract an n-category π≤nX
(roughly) as follows. The objects of π≤nX are the points of X. If x, y ∈ X, then the morphisms from x to
y in π≤nX are given by continuous paths [0, 1] → X starting at x and ending at y. The 2-morphisms are
given by homotopies of paths, the 3-morphisms by homotopies between homotopies, and so forth. Finally,
if n < ∞, then two n-morphisms of π≤nX are considered to be the same if and only if they are homotopic
to one another.

If n = 0, then π≤nX can be identiﬁed with the set π0X of path components of X. If n = 1, then our
deﬁnition of π≤nX agrees with usual deﬁnition for the fundamental groupoid of X. For this reason, π≤nX is
often called the fundamental n-groupoid of X. It is an n-groupoid (rather than a mere n-category) because
every k-morphism of π≤kX has an inverse (at least “up to homotopy”).

There are many approaches to realizing the theory of higher categories. We might begin by deﬁning
a 2-category to be a “category enriched over Cat.” In other words, we consider a collection of objects
together with a category of morphisms Hom(A, B) for any two objects A and B, and composition functors
cABC : Hom(A, B)× Hom(B, C) → Hom(A, C) (to simplify the discussion, we will ignore identity morphisms
for a moment). These functors are required to satisfy an associative law, which asserts that for any quadruple

14

(A, B, C, D) of objects, the diagram

Hom(A, B) × Hom(B, C) × Hom(C, D)

/ Hom(A, C) × Hom(C, D)

Hom(A, B) × Hom(B, D)

/ Hom(A, D)

commutes; in other words, one has an equality of functors

cACD ◦ (cABC × 1) = cABD ◦ (1 × cBCD)

from Hom(A, B) × Hom(B, C) × Hom(C, D) to Hom(A, D). This leads to the deﬁnition of a strict 2-category.
At this point, we should object that the deﬁnition of a strict 2-category violates one of the basic philo-
sophical principles of category theory: one should never demand that two functors F and F ′ be equal to
one another. Instead one should postulate the existence of a natural isomorphism between F and F ′. This
means that the associative law should not take the form of an equation, but of additional structure: a col-
lection of isomorphisms γABCD : cACD ◦ (cABC × 1) ≃ cABD ◦ (1 × cBCD). We should further demand that
the isomorphisms γABCD be functorial in the quadruple (A, B, C, D) and satisfy certain higher associativity
conditions, which generalize the “Pentagon axiom” described in §A.1.3. After formulating the appropriate
conditions, we arrive at the deﬁnition of a weak 2-category.

Let us contrast the notions of “strict 2-category” and “weak 2-category.” The former is easier to deﬁne,
since we do not have to worry about the higher associativity conditions satisﬁed by the transformations
γABCD. On the other hand, the latter notion seems more natural if we take the philosophy of category
theory seriously.
In this case, we happen to be lucky: the notions of “strict 2-category” and “weak 2-
category” turn out to be equivalent. More precisely, any weak 2-category is equivalent (in the relevant sense)
to a strict 2-category. The choice of deﬁnition can therefore be regarded as a question of aesthetics.

We now plunge onward to 3-categories. Following the above program, we might deﬁne a strict 3-category
to consist of a collection of objects together with strict 2-categories Hom(A, B) for any pair of objects A
and B, together with a strictly associative composition law. Alternatively, we could seek a deﬁnition of weak
3-category by allowing Hom(A, B) to be only a weak 2-category, requiring associativity only up to natural
2-isomorphisms, which satisfy higher associativity laws up to natural 3-isomorphisms, which in turn satisfy
still higher associativity laws of their own. Unfortunately, it turns out that these notions are not equivalent.
Both of these approaches have serious drawbacks. The obvious problem with weak 3-categories is that
an explicit deﬁnition is extremely complicated (see [33], where a deﬁnition is given along these lines), to
the point where it is essentially unusable. On the other hand, strict 3-categories have the problem of not
being the correct notion: most of the weak 3-categories which occur in nature are not equivalent to strict
3-categories. For example, the fundamental 3-groupoid of the 2-sphere S2 cannot be described using the
language of strict 3-categories. The situation only gets worse (from either point of view) as we pass to
4-categories and beyond.

Fortunately, it turns out that major simpliﬁcations can be introduced if we are willing to restrict our
attention to ∞-categories in which most of the higher morphisms are invertible. Let us henceforth use
the term (∞, n)-category to refer to ∞-categories in which all k-morphisms are invertible for k > n. The
∞-categories described in Example 1.1.1.4 (when n = ∞) are all (∞, 0)-categories. The converse, which
asserts that every (∞, 0)-category has the form π≤∞X for some topological space X, is a generally accepted
principle of higher category theory. Moreover, the ∞-groupoid π≤∞X encodes the entire homotopy type of
X. In other words, (∞, 0)-categories (that is, ∞-categories in which all morphisms are invertible) have been
extensively studied from another point of view: they are essentially the same thing as “spaces” in the sense
of homotopy theory, and there are many equivalent ways to describe them (for example, we can use CW
complexes or simplicial sets).

Convention 1.1.1.5. We will often refer to (∞, 0)-categories as ∞-groupoids and (∞, 2)-categories as ∞-
bicategories. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the generic term ∞-category will mean (∞, 1)-category.

In this book, we will restrict our attention almost entirely to the theory of ∞-categories (in which we

have only invertible n-morphisms for n ≥ 2). Our reasons are threefold:

(1) Allowing noninvertible n-morphisms for n > 1 introduces a number of additional complications to the
theory, at both technical and conceptual levels. As we will see throughout this book, many ideas from
category theory generalize to the ∞-categorical setting in a natural way. However, these generalizations
are not so straightforward if we allow noninvertible 2-morphisms. For example, one must distinguish
between strict and lax ﬁber products, even in the setting of “classical” 2-categories.

(2) For the applications studied in this book, we will not need to consider (∞, n)-categories for n > 2. The
case n = 2 is of some relevance, because the collection of (small) ∞-categories can naturally be viewed
as a (large) ∞-bicategory. However, we will generally be able to exploit this structure in an ad-hoc
manner, without developing any general theory of ∞-bicategories.

(3) For n > 1, the theory of (∞, n)-categories is most naturally viewed as a special case of enriched
(higher) category theory. Roughly speaking, an n-category can be viewed as a category enriched over
(n − 1)-categories. As we explained above, this point of view is inadequate because it requires that
composition satisﬁes an associative law up to equality, while in practice the associativity only holds up
to isomorphism or some weaker notion of equivalence. In other words, to obtain the correct deﬁnition
we need to view the collection of (n − 1)-categories as an n-category, not as an ordinary category.
Consequently, the naive approach is circular: though it does lead to the correct theory of n-categories,
we can only make sense of it if the theory of n-categories is already in place.

Thinking along similar lines, we can view an (∞, n)-category as an ∞-category which is enriched over
(∞, n − 1)-categories. The collection of (∞, n − 1)-categories is itself organized into an (∞, n)-category
Cat(∞,n−1), so at a ﬁrst glance this deﬁnition suﬀers from the same problem of circularity. However,
because the associativity properties of composition are required to hold up to equivalence, rather than
up to arbitrary natural transformation, the noninvertible k-morphisms in Cat(∞,n−1) are irrelevant for
k > 1. We may therefore view an (∞, n)-category as a category enriched over Cat(∞,n−1), where the
latter is regarded as an ∞-category by discarding noninvertible k-morphisms for 2 ≤ k ≤ n. In other
words, the naive inductive deﬁnition of higher category theory is reasonable, provided that we work in
the ∞-categorical setting from the outset. We refer the reader to [75] for a deﬁnition of n-categories
which follows this line of thought.

The theory of enriched ∞-categories is a useful and important one, but will not be treated in this
book. Instead we refer the reader to [50] for an introduction using the same language and formalism
we employ here.

Though we will not need a theory of (∞, n)-categories for n > 1, the case n = 1 is the main subject matter
of this book. Fortunately, the above discussion suggests a deﬁnition. Namely, an ∞-category C should be
consist of a collection of objects, and an ∞-groupoid MapC(X, Y ) for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C. These
∞-groupoids can be identiﬁed with “spaces”, and should be equipped with an associative composition law.
As before, we are faced with two choices as to how to make this precise: do we require associativity on
the nose, or only up to (coherent) homotopy? Fortunately, the answer turns out to be irrelevant: as in the
theory of 2-categories, any ∞-category with a coherently associative multiplication can be replaced by an
equivalent ∞-category with a strictly associative multiplication. We are led to the following:

Deﬁnition 1.1.1.6. A topological category is a category which is enriched over CG, the category of compactly
generated (and weakly Hausdorﬀ) topological spaces. The category of topological categories will be denoted
by Cattop.

More explicitly, a topological category C consists of a collection of objects, together with a (compactly
generated) topological space MapC(X, Y ) for any pair of objects X, Y ∈ C. These mapping spaces must be
equipped with an associative composition law, given by continuous maps

MapC(X0, X1) × MapC(X1, X2) × . . . MapC(Xn−1, Xn) → MapC(X0, Xn)

16

(deﬁned for all n ≥ 0). Here the product is taken in the category of compactly generated topological spaces.

Remark 1.1.1.7. The decision to work with compactly generated topological spaces, rather than arbitrary
spaces, is made in order to facilitate the comparison with more combinatorial approaches to homotopy theory.
This is a purely technical point which the reader may safely ignore.

It is possible to use Deﬁnition 1.1.1.6 as a foundation for higher category theory: that is, to deﬁne an
∞-category to be a topological category. However, this approach has a number of technical disadvantages.
We will describe an alternative (though equivalent) formalism in the next section.

1.1.2 ∞-Categories

Of the numerous formalizations of higher category theory, Deﬁnition 1.1.1.6 is the quickest and most trans-
parent. However, it is one of the most diﬃcult to actually work with: many of the basic constructions of
higher category theory give rise most naturally to (∞, 1)-categories for which the composition of morphisms
is associative only up to (coherent) homotopy (for several examples of this phenomenon, we refer the reader
to §1.2). In order to remain in the world of topological categories, it is necessary to combine these construc-
tions with a “straightening” procedure which produces a strictly associative composition law. Although it
is always possible to do this (see Theorem 2.2.5.1), it is much more technically convenient to work from
the outset within a more ﬂexible theory of (∞, 1)-categories. Fortunately, there are many candidates for
such a theory, including the theory of Segal categories ([71]), the theory of complete Segal spaces ([64]),
and the theory of model categories ([40], [38]). To review all of these notions and their interrelationships
would involve too great a digression from the main purpose of this book. However, the frequency with which
we will encounter sophisticated categorical constructions necessitates the use of one of these more eﬃcient
approaches. We will employ the theory of weak Kan complexes, which goes back to Boardman-Vogt ([10]).
These objects have subsequently been studied more extensively by Joyal ([43] and [44]), who calls them
quasicategories. We will simply call them ∞-categories.

To get a feeling for what an ∞-category C should be, it is useful to consider two extreme cases. If every
morphism in C is invertible, then C is equivalent to the fundamental ∞-groupoid of a topological space X.
In this case, higher category theory reduces to classical homotopy theory. On the other hand, if C has no
nontrivial n-morphisms for n > 1, then C is equivalent to an ordinary category. A general formalism must
capture the features of both of these examples. In other words, we need a class of mathematical objects
which can behave both like categories and like topological spaces. In §1.1.1, we achieved this by “brute
force”: namely, we directly amalgamated the theory of topological spaces and the theory of categories, by
considering topological categories. However, it is possible to approach the problem more directly using the
theory of simplicial sets. We will assume that the reader has some familiarity with the theory of simplicial
sets; a brief review of this theory is included in §A.2.7, and a more extensive introduction can be found in
[32].

The theory of simplicial sets originated as a combinatorial approach to homotopy theory. Given any
topological space X, one can associate a simplicial set Sing X, whose n-simplices are precisely the continuous
maps |∆n| → X, where |∆n| = {(x0, . . . , xn) ∈ [0, 1]n+1|x0 + . . . + xn = 1} is the standard n-simplex.
Moreover, the topological space X is determined, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by Sing X. More
precisely, the singular complex functor X 7→ Sing X admits a left adjoint, which carries every simplicial set
K to its geometric realization |K|. For every topological space X, the counit map | Sing X| → X is a weak
homotopy equivalence. Consequently, if one is only interested in studying topological spaces up to weak
homotopy equivalence, one might as well work simplicial sets instead.

If X is a topological space, then the simplicial set Sing X has an important property, which is captured

by the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. Let K be a simplicial set. We say that K is a Kan complex if, for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n and

there exists a dotted arrow as indicated rendering the diagram commutative. Here Λn

i ⊆ ∆n denotes the ith

The singular complex of any topological space X is a Kan complex: this follows from the fact that the
i | is a retract of the simplex |∆n| in the category of topological spaces. Conversely, any Kan complex
horn |Λn
K “behaves like” a space: for example, there are simple combinatorial recipes for extracting homotopy groups
from K (which turn out be isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the topological space |K|). According to
a theorem of Quillen (see [32] for a proof), the singular complex and geometric realization provide mutually
inverse equivalences between the homotopy category of CW complexes and the homotopy category of Kan
complexes.

The formalism of simplicial sets is also closely related to category theory. To any category C, we can
associate a simplicial set N(C), called the nerve of C. For each n ≥ 0, we let N(C)n = MapSet∆(∆n, N(C))
denote the set of all functors [n] → C. Here [n] denotes the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, regarded as a
category in the obvious way. More concretely, N(C)n is the set of all composable sequences of morphisms

C0

f1→ C1 . . .

fn→ Cn

having length n. In this description, the face map di carries the above sequence to

C0

f1→ C1 . . .

fi−1→ Ci−1

fn→ Cn

while the degeneracy si carries it to

C0

f1→ C1 . . .

fi→ Ci

fi+1→ Ci+1

fi+2→ . . .

fn→ Cn.

It is more or less clear from this description that the simplicial set N(C) is just a fancy way of encoding
the structure of C as a category. More precisely, we note that the category C can be recovered (up to
isomorphism) from its nerve N(C). The objects of C are simply the vertices of N(C); that is, the elements
of N(C)0. A morphism from C0 to C1 is given by an edge φ ∈ N(C)1 with d1(φ) = C0 and d0(φ) = C1.
The identity morphism from an object C to itself is given by the degenerate simplex s0(C). Finally, given a
ψ
→ C2, the edge of N(C) corresponding to ψ ◦ φ may be uniquely characterized by the fact
diagram C0
that there exists a 2-simplex σ ∈ N(C)2 with d2(σ) = φ, d0(σ) = ψ, and d1(σ) = ψ ◦ φ.

φ
→ C1

It is not diﬃcult to characterize those simplicial sets which arise as the nerve of a category:

Proposition 1.1.2.2. Let K be a simplicial set. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a small category C and an isomorphism K ≃ N(C).

(2) For each 0 < i < n and each diagram

Proof. We ﬁrst show that (1) ⇒ (2). Let K be the nerve of a small category C, and let f0 : Λn
i → K be a map
of simplicial sets where 0 < i < n. We wish to show that f0 can be extended uniquely to a map f : ∆n → K.
For 0 ≤ k ≤ n, let Xi ∈ C be the image of the vertex {k} ⊆ Λn
i . For 0 < k ≤ n, let gk : Xk−1 → Xk be the
morphism in C determined by the restriction f0|∆{k−1,k}. The composable chain of morphisms

X0

g2→ . . .

gn→ Xn

determines an n-simplex f : ∆n → K. We will show that f is the desired solution to our extension problem
i = f0, then f ′ must
(the uniqueness of this solution is evident: if f ′ : ∆n → K is any other map with f ′|Λn
correspond to the same chain of morphisms in C, so that f ′ = f ). It will suﬃce to prove the following, for
every 0 ≤ j ≤ n:

(∗j) If j 6= i, then

f |∆{0,...,j−1,j+1,...,n} = f0|∆{0,...,j−1,j+1,...,n}.

To prove (∗j), it will suﬃce to show that f and f0 have the same restriction to ∆{k,k′}, where k and k′
adjacent elements of the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , j − 1, j + 1, . . . , n} ⊆ [n]. If k and k′ are adjacent in
[n], then this follows by construction. In particular, (∗) is automatically satisﬁed if j = 0 or j = n. Suppose
instead that k = j − 1 and k′ = j + 1, where 0 < j < n.
If n = 2, then j = 1 = i and we obtain a
contradiction. We may therefore assume that n > 2, so that either j − 1 > 0 or j + 1 < n. Without loss of
generality, j − 1 > 0, so that ∆{j−1,j+1} ⊆ ∆{1,...,n}. The desired conclusion now follows from (∗0).

We now prove the converse. Suppose that the simplicial set K satisﬁes (2); we claim that K is isomorphic

to the nerve of a small category C. We construct the category C as follows:

(i) The objects of C are the vertices of K.

(ii) Given a pair of objects x, y ∈ C, we let HomC(x, y) denote the collection of all edges e : ∆1 → K such

that e|{0} = x and e|{1} = y.

(iii) Let x be an object of C, Then the identity morphism idx is the edge of K deﬁned by the composition

∆1 → ∆0 e→ K.

(iv) Let f : x → y and g : y → z be morphisms in C. Then f and g together determine a map σ0 : Λ2

1 → K.
In view of condition (2), the map σ0 can be extended uniquely to a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K. We deﬁne
the composition g ◦ f to be the morphism from x to z in C corresponding to the edge given by the
composition

∆1 ≃ ∆{0,2} ⊆ ∆2 σ→ K.

We ﬁrst claim that C is a category. To prove this, we must verify the following axioms:

(a) For every object y ∈ C, the identity idy is a unit with respect to composition. In other words, for every
morphism f : x → y in C and every morphism g : y → z in C, we have idy ◦f = f and g ◦ idy = g.
These equations are “witnessed” by the 2-simplices s1(f ), s0(g) ∈ HomSet∆(∆2, K).

(b) Composition is associative. That is, for every sequence of composable morphisms

we have h ◦ (g ◦ f ) = (h ◦ g) ◦ f . To prove this, let us ﬁrst choose 2-simplices σ012 and σ123 as indicated
below:

It follows that C is a well-deﬁned category. By construction, we have a canonical map of simplicial sets
φ : K → N C. To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that φ is an isomorphism. We will prove,
by induction on n ≥ 0, that φ induces a bijection HomSet∆ (∆n, K) → HomSet∆(∆n, N C). For n = 0 and
n = 1, this is obvious from the construction. Assume therefore that n ≥ 2, and choose an integer i such that
0 < i < n. We have a commutative diagram

HomSet∆ (∆n, K)

HomSet∆(∆n, N C)

HomSet∆(Λn

i , K)

/ HomSet∆(Λn

i , N C).

Since K and N C both satisfy (2) (for N C, this follows from the ﬁrst part of the proof), the vertical maps
are bijective. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the lower horizontal map is bijective, which follows from
the inductive hypothesis.

We note that condition (2) of Proposition 1.1.2.2 is very similar to Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. However, it is
i with
i → K extend

diﬀerent in two important respects. First, it requires the extension condition only for inner horns Λn
0 < i < n. Second, the asserted condition is stronger in this case: not only does any map Λn
to the simplex ∆n, but the extension is unique.

Remark 1.1.2.3. It is easy to see that it is not reasonable to expect condition (2) of Proposition 1.1.2.2 to
hold for “outer” horns Λn
i , i ∈ {0, n}. Consider, for example, the case where i = n = 2, and where K is the
nerve of a category C. Giving a map Λ2

2 → K corresponds to supplying the solid arrows in the diagram

and the extension condition would amount to the assertion that one could always ﬁnd a dotted arrow
rendering the diagram commutative. This is true in general only when the category C is a groupoid.

We now see that the notion of a simplicial set is a ﬂexible one: a simplicial set K can be a good model
for an ∞-groupoid (if K is a Kan complex), or for an ordinary category (if it satisﬁes the hypotheses of
Proposition 1.1.2.2). Based on these observations, we might expect that some more general class of simplicial
sets could serve as models for ∞-categories in general.

Consider ﬁrst an arbitrary simplicial set K. We can try to envision K as a generalized category, whose
objects are the vertices of K (that is, the elements of K0), and whose morphisms are the edges of K (that
is, the elements of K1). A 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K should be thought of as a diagram

φ

>~~~~~~~

Y

θ

(cid:31)@@@@@@@

/ Z

together with an identiﬁcation (or homotopy) between θ and ψ◦φ which renders the diagram “commutative”.
(Note that, in higher category theory, this is not merely a condition: the homotopy θ ≃ ψ ◦ φ is an additional
datum.) Simplices of larger dimension may be thought of as verifying the commutativity of certain higher-
dimensional diagrams.

Unfortunately, for a general simplicial set K, the analogy outlined above is not very strong. The essence
of the problem is that, though we may refer to the 1-simplices of K as “morphisms”, there is in general no
way to compose them. Taking our cue from the example of N(C), we might say that a morphism θ : X → Z
is a composition of morphisms φ : X → Y and ψ : Y → Z if there exists a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K as in the
diagram indicated above. We must now consider two potential diﬃculties: the 2-simplex σ may not exist,
and if it does it exist it may not be unique, so that we have more than one choice for the composition θ.

The existence of σ can be formulated as an extension condition on the simplicial set K. We note that a
1 → K. Thus, the assertion that
1 → K can

composable pair of morphisms (ψ, φ) determines a map of simplicial sets Λ2

The uniqueness of θ is another matter. It turns out to be unnecessary (and unnatural) to require that θ
be uniquely determined. To understand this point, let us return to the example of the fundamental groupoid
of a topological space X. This is a category whose objects are the points x ∈ X. The morphisms between
a point x ∈ X and a point y ∈ X are given by continuous paths p : [0, 1] → X such that p(0) = x and
p(1) = y. Two such paths are considered to be equivalent if there is a homotopy between them. Composition
in the fundamental groupoid is given by concatenation of paths. Given paths p, q : [0, 1] → X with p(0) = x,
p(1) = q(0) = y, and q(1) = z, the composite of p and q should be a path joining x to z. There are many
ways of obtaining such a path from p and q. One of the simplest is to deﬁne

r(t) =

p(2t)
q(2t − 1)

(

if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
2
if 1
2 ≤ t ≤ 1.

However, we could just as well use the formula

r′(t) =

p(3t)
q( 3t−1
2 )

(

if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
3
if 1
3 ≤ t ≤ 1

to deﬁne the composite path. Because the paths r and r′ are homotopic to one another, it does not matter
which one we choose.

The situation becomes more complicated if we try to think 2-categorically. We can capture more infor-
mation about the space X by considering its fundamental 2-groupoid. This is a 2-category whose objects are
the points of X, whose morphisms are paths between points, and whose 2-morphisms are given by homo-
topies between paths (which are themselves considered modulo homotopy). In order to have composition of
morphisms unambiguously deﬁned, we would have to choose some formula once and for all. Moreover, there
is no particularly compelling choice; for example, neither of the formulas written above leads to a strictly
associative composition law.

The lesson to learn from this is that in higher-categorical situations, we should not necessarily ask for
a uniquely determined composition of two morphisms.
In the fundamental groupoid example, there are
many choices for a composite path but all of them are homotopic to one another. Moreover, in keeping
with the philosophy of higher category theory, any path which is homotopic to the composite should be just
as good as the composite itself. From this point of view, it is perhaps more natural to view composition
as a relation than as a function, and this is very eﬃciently encoded in the formalism of simplicial sets: a
2-simplex σ : ∆2 → K should be viewed as “evidence” that d0(σ) ◦ d2(σ) is homotopic to d1(σ).

Exactly what conditions on a simplicial set K will guarantee that it behaves like a higher category?
Based on the above argument, it seems reasonable to require that K satisfy an extension condition with
respect to certain horn inclusions Λn
i , as in Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. However, as we observed in Remark 1.1.2.3,
this is reasonable only for the inner horns where 0 < i < n, which appear in the statement of Proposition
1.1.2.2.

Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4. An ∞-category is a simplicial set K which has the following property: for any 0 < i < n,
any map f0 : Λn

i → K admits an extension f : ∆n → K.

Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4 was ﬁrst formulated by Boardman and Vogt ([10]). They referred to ∞-catgories as
weak Kan complexes, motivated by the obvious analogy with Deﬁnition 1.1.2.1. Our terminology places more
emphasis on the analogy with the characterization of ordinary categories given in Proposition 1.1.2.2: we
require the same extension conditions, but drop the uniqueness assumption.

Example 1.1.2.5. Any Kan complex is an ∞-category. In particular, if X is a topological space, then
we may view its singular complex Sing X as an ∞-category: this is one way of deﬁning the fundamental
∞-groupoid π≤∞X of X, introduced informally in Example 1.1.1.4.

Example 1.1.2.6. The nerve of any category is an ∞-category. We will occasionally abuse terminology by
identifying a category C with its nerve N(C); by means of this identiﬁcation, we may view ordinary category
theory as a special case of the study of ∞-categories.

The weak Kan condition of Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4 leads to a very elegant and powerful version of higher
category theory. This theory has been developed by Joyal in the papers [43] and [44] (where simplicial sets
satisfying the condition of Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4 are called quasi-categories), and will be used throughout this
book.

Notation 1.1.2.7. Depending on the context, we will use two diﬀerent notations in connection with simpli-
cial sets. When emphasizing their role as ∞-categories, we will often denote them by calligraphic letters such
as C, D, and so forth. When casting simplicial sets in their diﬀerent (though related) role of representing
homotopy types, we will employ capital Roman letters. To avoid confusion, we will also employ the latter
notation when we wish to contrast the theory of ∞-categories with some other other approach to higher
category theory, such as the theory of topological categories.

1.1.3 Equivalences of Topological Categories

We have now introduced two approaches to higher category theory: one based on topological categories,
and one based on simplicial sets. These two approaches turn out to be equivalent to one another. However,
the equivalence itself needs to be understood in a higher-categorical sense. We take our cue from classical
homotopy theory, in which we can take the basic objects to be either topological spaces or simplicial sets.

22

It is not true that every Kan complex is isomorphic to the singular complex of a topological space, or that
every CW complex is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a simplicial set. However, both of these
statements become true if we replace the words “isomorphic to” by “homotopy equivalent to”. We would like
to formulate a similar statement regarding our approaches to higher category theory. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd
a concept which replaces “homotopy equivalence”. If F : C → D is a functor between topological categories,
under what circumstances should we regard F as an “equivalence” (so that C and D really represent the
same higher category)?

The most naive answer is that F should be regarded as an equivalence if it is an isomorphism of topological
categories. This means that F induces a bijection between the objects of C and the objects of D, and a
homeomorphism MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F (X), F (Y )) for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C. However, it is
immediately obvious that this condition is far too strong; for example, in the case where C and D are
ordinary categories (which we may view also as topological categories, where all morphism sets are endowed
with the discrete topology), we recover the notion of an isomorphism between categories. This notion does
not play an important role in category theory. One rarely asks whether or not two categories are isomorphic;
instead, one asks whether or not they are equivalent. This suggests the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.1. A functor F : C → D between topological categories is a strong equivalence if it is an
equivalence in the sense of enriched category theory. In other words, F is a strong equivalence if it induces
homeomorphisms MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F (X), F (Y )) for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, and every object
of D is isomorphic (in D) to F (X) for some X ∈ C.

The notion of strong equivalence between topological categories has the virtue that, when restricted to
ordinary categories, it reduces to the usual notion of equivalence. However, it is still not the right deﬁnition:
for a pair of objects X and Y of a higher category C, the morphism space MapC(X, Y ) should itself only be
well-deﬁned up to homotopy equivalence.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.2. Let C be a topological category. The homotopy category hC is deﬁned as follows:

• The objects of hC are the objects of C.

• If X, Y ∈ C, then we deﬁne HomhC(X, Y ) = π0 MapC(X, Y ).

• Composition of morphisms in hC is induced from the composition of morphisms in C by applying the

functor π0.

Example 1.1.3.3. Let C be the topological category whose objects are CW-complexes, where MapC(X, Y )
is the set of continuous maps from X to Y , equipped with the (compactly generated version of the) compact-
open topology. We will denote the homotopy category of C by H, and refer to H as the homotopy category
of spaces.

There is a second construction of the homotopy category H, which will play an important role in what

follows. First, we must recall a bit of terminology from classical homotopy theory.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.4. A map f : X → Y between topological spaces is said to be a weak homotopy equivalence
if it induces a bijection π0X → π0Y , and if for every point x ∈ X and every i ≥ 1, the induced map of
homotopy groups

πi(X, x) → πi(Y, f (x))

is an isomorphism.

Given a space X ∈ CG, classical homotopy theory ensures the existence of a CW-complex X ′ equipped
with a weak homotopy equivalence φ : X ′ → X. Of course, X ′ is not uniquely determined; however, it is
unique up to canonical homotopy equivalence, so that the assignment

X 7→ [X] = X ′

23

determines a functor θ : CG → H. By construction, θ carries weak homotopy equivalences in CG to isomor-
phisms in H. In fact, θ is universal with respect to this property. In other words, we may describe H as
the category obtained from CG by formally inverting all weak homotopy equivalences. This is one version
of Whitehead’s theorem, which is usually stated as follows: every weak homotopy equivalence between CW
complexes admits a homotopy inverse.

We can now improve upon Deﬁnition 1.1.3.2 slightly. We ﬁrst observe that the functor θ : CG →
H preserves products. Consequently, we can apply the construction of Remark A.1.4.3 to convert any
topological category C into a category enriched over H. We will denote this H-enriched category by hC, and
refer to it as the homotopy category of C. More concretely, the homotopy category hC may be described as
follows:

(1) The objects of hC are the objects of C.

(2) For X, Y ∈ C, we have

MaphC(X, Y ) = [MapC(X, Y )].

(3) The composition law on hC is obtained from the composition law on C by applying the functor θ :

CG → H.

Remark 1.1.3.5. If C is a topological category, we have now deﬁned hC in two diﬀerent ways: ﬁrst as an
ordinary category, and then as a category enriched over H. These two deﬁnitions are compatible with one
another, in the sense that hC (as an ordinary category) is the underlying category of hC (as an H-enriched
category). This follows immediately from the observation that for every topological space X, there is a
canonical bijection π0X ≃ MapH(∗, [X]).

If C is a topological category, we may imagine that hC is the object which is obtained by forgetting
the topological morphism spaces of C and remembering only their (weak) homotopy types. The following
deﬁnition codiﬁes the idea that these homotopy types should be “all that really matter”.

Deﬁnition 1.1.3.6. Let F : C → D be a functor between topological categories. We will say that F is a
weak equivalence, or simply an equivalence, if the induced functor hC → hD is an equivalence of H-enriched
categories.

More concretely, a functor F is an equivalence if and only if:

• For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map

MapC(X, Y ) → MapD(F (X), F (Y ))

is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces.

• Every object of D is isomorphic in hD to F (X), for some X ∈ C.

Remark 1.1.3.7. A morphism f : X → Y in D is said to be an equivalence if the induced morphism in hD
is an isomorphism. In general, this is much weaker than the condition that f be an isomorphism in D; see
Proposition 1.2.4.1.

It is Deﬁnition 1.1.3.6 which gives the correct notion of equivalence between topological categories (at
least, when one is using them to describe higher category theory). We will agree that all relevant properties of
topological categories are invariant under this notion of equivalence. We say that two topological categories
are equivalent if there is an equivalence between them, or more generally if there is a chain of equivalences
joining them. Equivalent topological categories should be regarded as “the same” for all relevant purposes.

24

Remark 1.1.3.8. According to Deﬁnition 1.1.3.6, a functor F : C → D is an equivalence if and only if
the induced functor hC → hD is an equivalence. In other words, the homotopy category hC (regarded as a
category which is enriched over H) is an invariant of C which is suﬃciently powerful to detect equivalences
between ∞-categories. This should be regarded as analogous to the more classical fact that the homotopy
groups πi(X, x) of a CW complex X are homotopy invariants which detect homotopy equivalences between
CW complexes (by Whitehead’s theorem). However, it is important to remember that hC does not determine
C up to equivalence, just as the homotopy type of a CW complex is not determined by its homotopy groups.

1.1.4 Simplicial Categories

In the previous sections we introduced two very diﬀerent approaches to the foundations of higher category
theory: one based on topological categories, the other on simplicial sets. In order to prove that they are
equivalent to one another, we will introduce a third approach, which is closely related to the ﬁrst but shares
the combinatorial ﬂavor of the second.

Deﬁnition 1.1.4.1. A simplicial category is a category which is enriched over the category Set∆ of simplicial
sets. The category of simplicial categories (where morphisms are given by simplicially enriched functors)
will be denoted by Cat∆.

Remark 1.1.4.2. Every simplicial category can be regarded as a simplicial object in the category Cat.
Conversely, a simplicial object of Cat arises from a simplicial category if and only if the underlying simplicial
set of objects is constant.

Like topological categories, simplicial categories can be used as models of higher category theory. If C is a
simplicial category, then we will generally think of the simplicial sets MapC(X, Y ) as “spaces”, or homotopy
types.

Remark 1.1.4.3. If C is a simplicial category with the property that each of the simplicial sets MapC(X, Y )
is an ∞-category, then we may view C itself as a kind of ∞-bicategory. We will not use this interpretation
of simplicial categories in this book. Usually we will consider only ﬁbrant simplicial categories: that is,
simplicial categories for which the mapping objects MapC(X, Y ) are Kan complexes.

The relationship between simplicial categories and topological categories is easy to describe. Let Set∆
denote the category of simplicial sets and CG the category of compactly generated Hausdorﬀ spaces. We
recall that there exists a pair of adjoint functors

Set∆

||

Sing

/ CG

which are called the geometric realization and singular complex functors, respectively. Both of these functors
commute with ﬁnite products. Consequently, if C is a simplicial category, we may deﬁne a topological
category | C | in the following way:

• The objects of | C | are the objects of C.

• If X, Y ∈ C, then Map| C |(X, Y ) = | MapC(X, Y )|.

• The composition law for morphisms in | C | is obtained from the composition law on C by applying the

geometric realization functor.

Similarly, if C is a topological category, we may obtain a simplicial category Sing C by applying the
singular complex functor to each of the morphism spaces individually. The singular complex and geometric
realization functors determine an adjunction between Cat∆ and Cattop. This adjunction should be understood
as determining an “equivalence” between the theory of simplicial categories and the theory of topological

25

/
o
o
categories. This is essentially a formal consequence of the fact that the geometric realization and singular
complex functors determine an equivalence between the homotopy theory of topological spaces and the
homotopy theory of simplicial sets. More precisely, we recall that a map f : S → T of simplicial sets is said
to be a weak homotopy equivalence if the induced map |S| → |T | of topological spaces is a weak homotopy
equivalence. A theorem of Quillen (see [32] for a proof) asserts that the unit and counit morphisms

S → Sing |S|

| Sing X| → X

are weak homotopy equivalences, for every (compactly generated) topological space X and every simplicial
set S. It follows that the category obtained from CG by inverting weak homotopy equivalences (of spaces) is
equivalent to the category obtained from Set∆ by inverting weak homotopy equivalences. We use the symbol
H to denote either of these (equivalent) categories.

If C is a simplicial category, we let hC denote the H-enriched category obtained by applying the functor
Set∆ → H to each of the morphism spaces of C. We will refer to hC as the homotopy category of C. We
note that this is the same notation that was introduced in §1.1.3 for the homotopy category of a topological
category. However, there is little risk of confusion: the above remarks imply the existence of canonical
isomorphisms

hC ≃ h| C |

hD ≃ hSing D

for every simplicial category C and every topological category D.

Deﬁnition 1.1.4.4. A functor C → C′ between simplicial categories is an equivalence if the induced functor
hC → hC′ is an equivalence of H-enriched categories.

In other words, a functor C → C′ between simplicial categories is an equivalence if and only if the
geometric realization | C | → | C′ | is an equivalence of topological categories. In fact, one can say more. It
follows easily from the preceding remarks that the unit and counit maps

C → Sing | C |

| Sing D | → D

induce isomorphisms between homotopy categories. Consequently, if we are working with topological or
simplicial categories up to equivalence, we are always free to replace a simplicial category C by | C |, or
a topological category D by Sing D. In this sense, the notions of topological and simplicial category are
equivalent and either can be used as a foundation for higher category theory.

1.1.5 Comparing ∞-Categories with Simplicial Categories

In §1.1.4, we introduced the theory of simplicial categories and explained why (for our purposes) it is
equivalent to the theory of topological categories. In this section, we will show that the theory of simplicial
categories is also closely related to the theory of ∞-categories. Our discussion requires somewhat more
elaborate constructions than were needed in the previous sections; a reader who does not wish to become
bogged down in details is urged to skip ahead to §1.2.1.

We will relate simplicial categories with simplicial sets by means of the simplicial nerve functor

N : Cat∆ → Set∆,

originally introduced by Cordier (see [16]). The nerve of an ordinary category C is characterized by the
formula

HomSet∆(∆n, N(C)) = HomCat([n], C);

26

here [n] denotes the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, regarded as a category. This deﬁnition makes sense also
when C is a simplicial category, but is clearly not very interesting: it makes no use of the simplicial structure
on C. In order to obtain a more interesting construction, we need to replace the ordinary category [n] by a
suitable “thickening”, a simplicial category which we will denote by C[∆n].

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.1. Let J be a ﬁnite nonempty linearly ordered set. The simplicial category C[∆J ] is
deﬁned as follows:

• The objects of C[∆J ] are the elements of J.

• If i, j ∈ J, then

MapC[∆J ](i, j) =

∅
N(Pi,j )

(

if j < i
if i ≤ j.

Here Pi,j denotes the partially ordered set {I ⊆ J : (i, j ∈ I) ∧ (∀k ∈ I)[i ≤ k ≤ j])}.

• If i0 ≤ i1 ≤ . . . ≤ in, then the composition

MapC[∆J ](i0, i1) × . . . × MapC[∆J ](in−1, in) → MapC[∆J ](i0, in)

is induced by the map of partially ordered sets

Pi0,i1 × . . . × Pin−1,in → Pi0,in

(I1, . . . , In) 7→ I1 ∪ . . . ∪ In.

In order to help digest Deﬁnition 1.1.5.1, let us analyze the structure of the topological category | C[∆n]|.
The objects of this category are elements of the set [n] = {0, . . . , n}. For each 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, the
topological space Map| C[∆n]|(i, j) is homeomorphic to a cube; it may be identiﬁed with the set of all functions
p : {k ∈ [n] : i ≤ k ≤ j} → [0, 1] which satisfy p(i) = p(j) = 1. The morphism space Map| C[∆n]|(i, j) is
empty when j < i, and composition of morphisms is given by concatenation of functions.

Remark 1.1.5.2. Let us try to understand better the simplicial category C[∆n] and its relationship to the
ordinary category [n]. These categories have the same objects, namely the elements of {0, . . . , n}. In the
category [n], there is a unique morphism qij : i → j whenever i ≤ j. In virtue of the uniqueness, these
elements satisfy qjk ◦ qij = qik for i ≤ j ≤ k.

In the simplicial category C[∆n], there is a vertex pij ∈ MapC[∆n](i, j), given by the element {i, j} ∈ Pij .
We note that pjk ◦ pij 6= pik (unless we are in one of the degenerate cases where i = j or j = k). Instead,
the collection of all compositions

pinin−1 ◦ pin−1in−2 ◦ . . . ◦ pi1i0 ,

where i = i0 < i1 < . . . < in−1 < in = j constitute all of the diﬀerent vertices of the cube MapC[∆n](i, j). The
weak contractibility of MapC[∆n](i, j) expresses the idea that although these compositions do not coincide,
they are all canonically homotopic to one another. We observe that there is a (unique) functor C[∆n] → [n]
which is the identity on objects, and that this functor is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We can
summarize the situation informally as follows: the simplicial category C[∆n] is a “thickened version” of [n],
where we have dropped the strict associativity condition

qjk ◦ qij = qik

and instead have imposed associativity only up to (coherent) homotopy. (We can formulate this idea more
precisely by saying that C[∆•] is a coﬁbrant replacement for [•] with respect to a suitable model structure
on the category of cosimplicial objects of Cat∆.)

The construction J 7→ C[∆J ] is functorial in J, as we now explain.

27

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.3. Let f : J → J ′ be a monotone map between linearly ordered sets. The simplicial
functor C[f ] : C[∆J ] → C[∆J ′

] is deﬁned as follows:

• For each object i ∈ C[∆J ], C[f ](i) = f (i) ∈ C[∆J ′

].

• If i ≤ j in J, then the map MapC[∆J ](i, j) → MapC[∆J′ ](f (i), f (j)) induced by f is the nerve of the

map

Pi,j → Pf (i),f (j)

I 7→ f (I).

Remark 1.1.5.4. Using the notation of Remark 1.1.5.2, we note that Deﬁnition 1.1.5.3 has been rigged so
that the functor C[f ] carries the vertex pij ∈ MapC[∆J ](i, j) to the vertex pf (i)f (j) ∈ MapC[∆J′ ](f (i), f (j)).

It is not diﬃcult to check that the construction described in Deﬁnition 1.1.5.3 is well-deﬁned, and com-

patible with composition in f . Consequently, we deduce that C determines a functor

∆ → Cat∆

∆n 7→ C[∆n],

which we may view as a cosimplicial object of Cat∆.

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.5. Let C be a simplicial category. The simplicial nerve N(C) is the simplicial set described
by the formula

HomSet∆ (∆n, N(C)) = HomCat∆ (C[∆n], C).

If C is a topological category, we deﬁne the topological nerve N(C) of C to be the simplicial nerve of Sing C.

Remark 1.1.5.6. If C is a simplicial (topological) category, we will often abuse terminology by referring to
the simplicial (topological) nerve of C simply as the nerve of C.

Warning 1.1.5.7. Let C be a simplicial category. Then C can be regarded as an ordinary category, by
ignoring all simplices of positive dimension in the mapping spaces of C. The simplicial nerve of C does not
coincide with the nerve of this underlying ordinary category. Our notation is therefore potentially ambiguous.
We will adopt the following convention: whenever C is a simplicial category, N(C) will denote the simplicial
nerve of C, unless we specify otherwise. Similarly, if C is a topological category, then the topological nerve
of C does not generally coincide with the nerve of the underlying category; the notation N(C) will be used
to indicate the topological nerve, unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Example 1.1.5.8. Any ordinary category C may be considered as a simplicial category, by taking each of
the simplicial sets HomC(X, Y ) to be constant. In this case, the set of simplicial functors C[∆n] → C may
be identiﬁed with the set of functors from [n] into C. Consequently, the simplicial nerve of C agrees with
the ordinary nerve of C, as deﬁned in §1.1.2. Similarly, the ordinary nerve of C can be identiﬁed with the
topological nerve of C, where C is regarded as a topological category with discrete morphism spaces.

In order to get a feel for what the nerve of a topological category C looks like, let us explicitly describe

its low-dimensional simplices:

• The 0-simplices of N(C) may be identiﬁed with the objects of C.

• The 1-simplices of N(C) may be identiﬁed with the morphisms of C.

commutative)

/ Z.

To give a 2-simplex of N(C) having this speciﬁed boundary is equivalent to giving a path from fXZ to
fY Z ◦ fXY in MapC(X, Z).

The category Cat∆ of simplicial categories admits (small) colimits. Consequently, by formal nonsense,
the functor C : ∆ → Cat∆ extends uniquely (up to unique isomorphism) to a colimit-preserving functor
Set∆ → Cat∆, which we will denote also by C. By construction, the functor C is left adjoint to the simplicial
nerve functor N. For each simplicial set S, we can view C[S] as the simplicial category “freely generated” by
S: every n-simplex σ : ∆n → S determines a functor C[∆n] → C[S], which we can think of as a homotopy
coherent diagram [n] → C[S].

Example 1.1.5.9. Let A be a partially ordered set. The simplicial category C[N A] can be constructed
using the following generalization of Deﬁnition 1.1.5.1:

• The objects of C[N A] are the elements of A.

• Given a pair of elements a, b ∈ A, the simplicial set MapC[N A](a, b) can be identiﬁed with N Pa,b, where
Pa,b denotes the collection of linearly ordered subsets S ⊆ A with least element a and largest element
b, partially ordered by inclusion.

• Given a sequence of elements a0, . . . , an ∈ A, the composition map

MapC[N A](a0, a1) × . . . × MapC[N A](an−1, an) → MapC[N A](a0, an)

is induced by the map of partially ordered sets

Pa0,a1 × . . . × Pan−1,an → Pa0,an

(S1, . . . , Sn) 7→ S1 ∪ . . . ∪ Sn.

Proposition 1.1.5.10. Let C be a simplicial category having the property that, for every pair of objects
X, Y ∈ C, the simplicial set MapC(X, Y ) is a Kan complex. Then the simplicial nerve N(C) is an ∞-
category.

Proof. We must show that if 0 < i < n, then N(C) has the right extension property with respect to the
i ⊆ ∆n. Rephrasing this in the language of simplicial categories, we must show that C has the
inclusion Λn
right extension property with respect to the simplicial functor C[Λn
i ] → C[∆n]. To prove this, we make use
of the following observations concerning C[Λn

i ], which we view as a simplicial subcategory of C[∆n]:

• The objects of C[Λn

i ] are the objects of C[∆n]: that is, elements of the set [n].

• For 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, the simplicial set MapC[Λn

i ](j, k) coincides with MapC[∆n](j, k) unless j = 0 and

k = n (note that this condition fails if i = 0 or i = n).

MapC[∆n](0, n)

Since the simplicial set on the right is a Kan complex by assumption, it suﬃces to verify that the left vertical
map is anodyne. This follows by inspection: the simplicial set MapC[∆n](0, n) can be identiﬁed with the
cube (∆1){1,...,n−1}, and MapC[Λn
i ](0, n) can be identiﬁed with the simplicial subset obtained by removing
the interior of the cube together with one of its faces.

Remark 1.1.5.11. The proof of Proposition 1.1.5.10 yields a slightly stronger result:
functor between simplicial categories which induces Kan ﬁbrations MapC(C, C′) → MapD(F (C), F (C′)) for
every pair of objects C, C′ ∈ C, then the associated map N(C) → N(D) is an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets
(see Deﬁnition 2.0.0.3).

Corollary 1.1.5.12. Let C be a topological category. Then the topological nerve N(C) is an ∞-category.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 1.1.5.10, since the singular complex of any topological
space is a Kan complex.

We now cite the following theorem, which will be proven in §2.2.4 and reﬁned in §2.2.5:

Theorem 1.1.5.13. Let C be a topological category, and let X, Y ∈ C be objects. Then the counit map

is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces.

| MapC[N(C)](X, Y )| → MapC(X, Y )

Assuming Theorem 1.1.5.13, we can now explain why the theory of ∞-categories is equivalent to the
theory of topological categories (or, equivalently, simplicial categories). The adjoint functors N and | C[•]|
are not mutually inverse equivalences of categories. However, they are homotopy inverse to one another. To
make this precise, we need to introduce a deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.1.5.14. Let S be a simplicial set. The homotopy category hS is deﬁned to be the homotopy
category hC[S ] of the simplicial category C[S]. We will often view hS as a category enriched over the
homotopy category H of spaces via the construction of §1.1.4: that is, for every pair of vertices x, y ∈ S, we
have MaphS (x, y) = [MapC[S](x, y)]. A map f : S → T of simplicial sets is a categorical equivalence if the
induced map hS → hT is an equivalence of H-enriched categories.

Remark 1.1.5.15. In [44], Joyal uses the term “weak categorical equivalence” for what we have called a
“categorical equivalence”, and reserves the term “categorical equivalence” for a stronger notion of equivalence.

Remark 1.1.5.16. We have introduced the term “categorical equivalence”, rather than simply “equivalence”
or “weak equivalence”, in order to avoid confusing the notion of categorical equivalence of simplicial sets
with the (more classical) notion of weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

Remark 1.1.5.17. It is immediate from the deﬁnition that f : S → T is a categorical equivalence if and
only if C[S] → C[T ] is an equivalence (of simplicial categories), if and only if | C[S]| → | C[T ]| is an equivalence
(of topological categories).

We now observe that the adjoint functors (| C[•]|, N) determine an equivalence between the theory of
simplicial sets (up to categorical equivalence) and that of topological categories (up to equivalence).
In
other words, for any topological category C the counit map | C[N(C)]| → C is an equivalence of topological
categories, and for any simplicial set S the unit map S → N | C[S]| is a categorical equivalence of simplicial
sets. In view of Remark 1.1.5.17, the second assertion is a formal consequence of the ﬁrst. Moreover, the
ﬁrst assertion is merely a reformulation of Theorem 1.1.5.13.

Remark 1.1.5.18. The reader may at this point object that we have achieved a comparison between the
theory of topological categories with the theory of simplicial sets, but that not every simplicial set is an
∞-category. However, every simplicial set is categorically equivalent to an ∞-category. In fact, Theorem
1.1.5.13 implies that every simplicial set S is categorically equivalent to the nerve of the topological category
| C[S]|, which is an ∞-category (Corollary 1.1.5.12).

1.2 The Language of Higher Category Theory

One of the main goals of this book is to demonstrate that many ideas from classical category theory can be
adapted to the setting of higher categories. In this section, we will survey some of the simplest examples.

1.2.1 The Opposite of an ∞-Category
If C is an ordinary category, then the opposite category Cop is deﬁned in the following way:

• The objects of Cop are the objects of C.

• For X, Y ∈ C, we have HomCop(X, Y ) = HomC(Y, X). Identity morphisms and composition are deﬁned

in the obvious way.

This deﬁnition generalizes without change to the setting of topological or simplicial categories. Adapting
this deﬁnition to the setting of ∞-categories requires a few additional words. We may deﬁne more generally
the opposite of a simplicial set S as follows: For any ﬁnite, nonempty, linearly ordered set J, we set Sop(J) =
S(J op), where J op denotes the same set J endowed with the opposite ordering. More concretely, we have
n = Sn, but the face and degeneracy maps on Sop are given by the formulas
Sop

(di : Sop

n → Sop

n−1) = (dn−i : Sn → Sn−1)

(si : Sop

n → Sop

n+1) = (sn−i : Sn → Sn+1).

The formation of opposite categories is fully compatible with all of the constructions we have introduced

for passing back and forth between diﬀerent models of higher category theory.

It is clear from the deﬁnition that a simplicial set S is an ∞-category if and only if its opposite Sop is an
i ⊆ ∆n if and

∞-category: for 0 < i < n, S has the extension property with respect to the horn inclusion Λn
only if Sop has the extension property with respect to the horn inclusion Λn

n−i ⊆ ∆n.

The construction S 7→ Sop determines an automorphism of the ∞-category of ∞-categories. We will

later see that this is (essentially) the only nontrivial automorphism (see Theorem 5.2.9.1).

1.2.2 Mapping Spaces in Higher Category Theory

If X and Y are objects of an ordinary category C, then one has a well-deﬁned set HomC(X, Y ) of morphisms
from X to Y . In higher category theory, one has instead a morphism space MapC(X, Y ). In the setting of
topological or simplicial categories, this morphism space (either a topological space or a simplicial set) is
an inherent feature of the formalism. In the setting of ∞-categories, it is not so obvious how MapC(X, Y )
should be deﬁned. However, it is at least clear what to do on the level of the homotopy category.

Deﬁnition 1.2.2.1. Let S be a simplicial set containing vertices x and y, and let H denote the homotopy
category of spaces. We deﬁne MapS(x, y) = MaphS (x, y) ∈ H to be the object of H representing the space
of maps from x to y in S. Here hS denotes the homotopy category of S, regarded as a H-enriched category
(Deﬁnition 1.1.5.14).

Warning 1.2.2.2. Let S be a simplicial set. The notation MapS(X, Y ) has two very diﬀerent meanings.
When X and Y are vertices of S, then our notation should be interpreted in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2.2.1,
so that MapS(X, Y ) is an object of H. If X and Y are objects of (Set∆)/S, then we instead let MapS(X, Y )
denote the simplicial mapping object

Y X ×SX {φ} ∈ Set∆,

where φ denotes the structural morphism X → S. We trust that it will be clear in context which of these
two deﬁnitions applies in a given situation.

32

We now consider the following question: given a simplicial set S containing a pair of vertices x and y, how
can we compute MapS(x, y)? We have deﬁned MapS(x, y) as an object of the homotopy category H, but for
many purposes it is important to choose a simplicial set M which represents MapS(x, y). The most obvious
candidate for M is the simplicial set MapC[S](x, y). The advantages of this deﬁnition are that it works in all
cases (that is, S does not need to be an ∞-category), and comes equipped with an associative composition law.
However, the construction of the simplicial set MapC[S](x, y) is quite complicated. Furthermore, MapC[S](x, y)
is usually not a Kan complex, so it can be diﬃcult to extract algebraic invariants like homotopy groups, even
when a concrete description of its simplices is known.

In order to address these shortcomings, we will introduce another simplicial set which represents the
homotopy type MapS(x, y) ∈ H, at least when S is an ∞-category. We deﬁne a new simplicial set HomR
S (x, y),
the space of right morphisms from x to y, by letting HomSet∆ (∆n, HomR
S (x, y)) denote the set of all z :
∆n+1 → S such that z|∆{n+1} = y and z|∆{0,...,n} is a constant simplex at the vertex x. The face and
degeneracy operations on HomR

S (x, y)n are deﬁned to coincide with corresponding operations on Sn+1.

We ﬁrst observe that when S is an ∞-category, HomR

S (x, y) really is a “space”:

Proposition 1.2.2.3. Let C be an ∞-category containing a pair of objects x and y. The simplicial set
HomR

C (x, y) is a Kan complex.

Proof. It is immediate from the deﬁnition that if C is a ∞-category, then M = HomR
extension condition for every horn inclusion Λn
complex (Proposition 1.2.5.1).

C (x, y) satisﬁes the Kan
i ⊆ ∆n where 0 < i ≤ n. This implies that M is a Kan

Remark 1.2.2.4. If S is a simplicial set and x, y, z ∈ S0, then there is no obvious composition law

HomR

S (x, y) × HomR

S (y, z) → HomR

S (x, z).

We will later see that if S is an ∞-category, then there is a composition law which is well-deﬁned up to a
contractible space of choices. The absence of a canonical choice for a composition law is the main drawback of
HomR
S (x, y), in comparison with MapC[S](x, y). The main goal of §2.2 is to show that, if S is an ∞-category,
then there is a (canonical) isomorphism between HomR
S (x, y) and MapC[S](x, y) in the homotopy category
H. In particular, we will conclude that HomR

S (x, y) represents MapS(x, y), whenever S is an ∞-category.

Remark 1.2.2.5. The deﬁnition of HomR
general. Instead we deﬁne HomL
that z|∆{0} = x and z|∆{1,...,n+1} is the constant simplex at the vertex y.

Sop(y, x)op, so that HomL

S (x, y) is not self-dual: that is, HomR

S(x, y) = HomR

Sop(x, y) 6= HomR
S (y, x) in
S(x, y)n is the set of all z ∈ Sn+1 such

Although the simplicial sets HomL

S (x, y) are generally not isomorphic to one another,
they are homotopy equivalent whenever S is an ∞-category. To prove this, it is convenient to deﬁne a third,
self-dual, space of morphisms: let HomS(x, y) = {x} ×S S∆1
×S {y}. In other words, to give an n-simplex of
HomS(x, y), one must give a map f : ∆n × ∆1 → S, such that f |∆n × {0} is constant at x and f |∆n × {1}
is constant at y. We observe that there exist natural inclusions

S(x, y) and HomR

HomR

S (x, y) ֒→ HomS(x, y) ←֓ HomL

S(x, y),

which are induced by retracting the cylinder ∆n × ∆1 onto certain maximal dimensional simplices. We
will later show (Corollary 4.2.1.8) that these inclusions are homotopy equivalences, provided that S is an
∞-category.

1.2.3 The Homotopy Category

For every ordinary category C, the nerve N(C) is an ∞-category. Informally, we can describe the situation as
follows: the nerve functor is a fully faithful inclusion from the bicategory of categories to the ∞-bicategory
of ∞-categories. Moreover, this inclusion has a left adjoint:

33

Proposition 1.2.3.1. The nerve functor Cat → Set∆ is right adjoint to the functor h: Set∆ → Cat, which
associates to every simplicial set S its homotopy category hS (here we ignore the H-enrichment of hS ).

Proof. Let us temporarily distinguish between the nerve functor N : Cat → Set∆ and the simplicial nerve
functor N′ : Cat∆ → Set∆. These two functors are related by the fact that N can be written as a composition

The functor π0 : Set∆ → Set is a left adjoint to the inclusion functor Set → Set∆, so the functor

Cat

i
⊆ Cat∆

N′
→ Set∆ .

Cat∆ → Cat

C 7→ hC

is left adjoint to i. It follows that N = N′ ◦i has a left adjoint, given by the composition

Set∆

C[•]
→ Cat∆

h→ Cat,

which coincides with the homotopy category functor h : Set∆ → Cat by deﬁnition.

Remark 1.2.3.2. The formation of the homotopy category is literally left adjoint to the inclusion Cat ⊆
Cat∆. The analogous assertion is not quite true in the setting of topological categories, since the functor
π0 : CG → Set is a left adjoint only when restricted to locally path connected spaces.

Warning 1.2.3.3. If C is a simplicial category, then we do not necessarily expect that hC ≃ hN(C). However,
this is always the case when C is ﬁbrant, in the sense that every simplicial set MapC(X, Y ) is a Kan complex.

Remark 1.2.3.4. If S is a simplicial set, Joyal ([44]) refers to the category hS as the fundamental category
of S. This is motivated by the observation that if S is a Kan complex, then hS is the fundamental groupoid
of S in the usual sense.

Our objective, for the remainder of this section, is to obtain a more explicit understanding of the homotopy
category hS of a simplicial set S. Proposition 1.2.3.1 implies that hS admits the following presentation by
generators and relations:

• The objects of hS are the vertices of S.

• For every edge φ : ∆1 → S, there is a morphism φ from φ(0) to φ(1).

• For each σ : ∆2 → S, we have d0(σ) ◦ d2(σ) = d1(σ).

• For each vertex x of S, the morphism s0x is the identity idx.

If S is an ∞-category, there is a much more satisfying construction of the category hS . We will describe
this construction in detail, since it nicely illustrates the utility of the weak Kan condition of Deﬁnition 1.1.2.4.
Let C be an ∞-category. We will construct a category π(C) (which we will eventually show to be equivalent
to the homotopy category hC). The objects of π(C) are the vertices of C. Given an edge φ : ∆1 → C, we
shall say that φ has source C = φ(0) and target C′ = φ(1), and write φ : C → C′. For each object C of C,
we let idC denote the degenerate edge s0(C) : C → C.

Let φ : C → C′ and φ′ : C → C′ be a pair of edges of C having the same source and target. We will say

that φ and φ′ are homotopic if there is a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → C, which we depict as follows:

In this case, we say that σ is a homotopy between φ and φ′.

Proposition 1.2.3.5. Let C be an ∞-category, and let C and C′ be objects of π(C). Then the relation of
homotopy is an equivalence relation on the edges joining C to C′.

Proof. Let φ : ∆1 → C be an edge. Then s1(φ) is a homotopy from φ to itself. Thus homotopy is a reﬂexive
relation.

Suppose next that φ, φ′, φ′′ : C → C′ are edges with the same source and target. Let σ be a homotopy
from φ to φ′ and σ′ a homotopy from φ to φ′′. Let σ′′ : ∆2 → C denote the constant map at the vertex C′.
We have a commutative diagram

∆3.

Since C is an ∞-category, there exists a 3-simplex τ : ∆3 → C as indicated by the dotted arrow in the
diagram. It is easy to see that d1(τ ) is a homotopy from φ′ to φ′′.

As a special case, we may take φ = φ′′; we then deduce that the relation of homotopy is symmetric. It

then follows immediately from the above that the relation of homotopy is also transitive.

Remark 1.2.3.6. The deﬁnition of homotopy that we have given is not evidently self-dual; in other words,
it is not immediately obvious a homotopic pair of edges φ, φ′ : C → C′ of an ∞-category C remain homotopic
when regarded as edges in the opposite ∞-category Cop. To prove this, let σ be a homotopy from φ to φ′,
and consider the commutative diagram

/ C

Λ3
2(cid:127)

∆3.

The assumption that C is an ∞-category guarantees a 3-simplex τ rendering the diagram commutative. The
face d2τ may be regarded as a homotopy from φ′ to φ in Cop.

We can now deﬁne the morphism sets of the category π(C): given vertices X and Y of C, we let
Homπ(C)(X, Y ) denote the set of homotopy classes of edges φ : X → Y in C. For each edge φ : ∆1 → C, we
let [φ] denote the corresponding morphism in π(C).

We deﬁne a composition law on π(C) as follows. Suppose that X, Y , and Z are vertices of C, and that
1 → C. Since C is an

we are given edges φ : X → Y , ψ : Y → Z. The pair (φ, ψ) determines a map Λ2
∞-category, this map extends to a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → C. We now deﬁne [ψ] ◦ [φ] = [d1σ].

Proposition 1.2.3.7. Let C be an ∞-category. The composition law on π(C) is well-deﬁned. In other words,
the homotopy class [ψ] ◦ [φ] does not depend on the choice of ψ representing [ψ], the choice of φ representing
[φ], or the choice of the the 2-simplex σ.

Proof. We begin by verifying the independence of the choice of σ. Suppose that we are given two 2-simplices
σ, σ′ : ∆2 → C, satisfying

Since C is an ∞-category, there exists a 3-simplex τ as indicated by the dotted arrow. It follows that d1τ is
a homotopy from d1σ to d1σ′.

We now show that [ψ] ◦ [φ] depends only on ψ and φ only up to homotopy. In view of Remark 1.2.3.6, the
assertion is symmetric with respect to ψ and φ; it will therefore suﬃce to show that [ψ] ◦ [φ] does not change
if we replace φ by a morphism φ′ which is homotopic to φ. Let σ be a 2-simplex with d0σ = ψ, d2σ = φ,
and let σ′ be a homotopy from φ to φ′. Consider the diagram

Again, the hypothesis that C is an ∞-category guarantees the existence of a 3-simplex τ as indicated in the
diagram. Let σ′′ = d1τ . Then [ψ] ◦ [φ′] = [d1σ′]. But d1σ = d1σ′ by construction, so that [ψ] ◦ [φ] = [ψ] ◦ [φ′]
as desired.

Proposition 1.2.3.8. If C is an ∞-category, then π(C) is a category.

Proof. Let C be a vertex of C. We ﬁrst verify that [idC ] is an identity with respect to the composition law
on π(C). For every edge φ : C′ → C in C, the 2-simplex s1(φ) veriﬁes the equation

This proves that idC is a left identity; the dual argument (Remark 1.2.3.6) shows that [idC] is a right identity.
The only other thing we need to check is the associative law for composition in π(C). Suppose given a

Since C is an ∞-category, there exists a 3-simplex τ rendering the diagram commutative. Then d2(τ ) veriﬁes
the equation [ψ′] ◦ [φ] = [θ], so that

([φ′′] ◦ [φ′]) ◦ [φ] = [θ] = [φ′′] ◦ [ψ] = [φ′′] ◦ ([φ′] ◦ [φ])

as desired.

We now show that if C is an ∞-category, then π(C) is naturally equivalent (in fact isomorphic) to hC.

Proposition 1.2.3.9. Let C be an ∞-category. There exists a unique functor F : hC → π(C) with the
following properties:

(1) On objects, F is the identity map.

(2) For every edge φ of C, F (φ) = [φ].

Moreover, F is an isomorphism of categories.

Proof. The existence and uniqueness of F follows immediately from our presentation of hC by generators
and relations. It is obvious that F is bijective on objects and surjective on morphisms. To complete the
proof, it will suﬃce to show that F is faithful.

We ﬁrst show that every morphism f : x → y in hC may be written as φ for some φ ∈ C. Since the
morphisms in hC are generated by morphisms having the form φ under composition, it suﬃces to show
that the set of such morphisms contains all identity morphisms and is stable under composition. The ﬁrst
assertion is clear, since s0x = idx. For the second, we note that if φ : x → y and φ′ : y → z are composable
edges, then there exists a 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → C, which we may depict as follows:

φ

 @@@@@@@@

/ z.

Thus φ′ ◦ φ = ψ.

Now suppose that φ, φ′ : x → y are such that [φ] = [φ′]; we wish to show that φ = φ′. By deﬁnition,

there exists a homotopy σ : ∆2 → C joining φ and φ′. The existence of σ entails the relation

idy ◦φ = φ′

in the homotopy category hS , so that φ = φ′ as desired.

1.2.4 Objects, Morphisms and Equivalences

As in ordinary category theory, we may speak of objects and morphisms in a higher category C. If C is a
topological (or simplicial) category, these should be understood literally as the objects and morphisms in
the underlying category of C. We may also apply this terminology to ∞-categories (or even more general
simplicial sets): if S is a simplicial set, then the objects of S are the vertices ∆0 → S, and the morphisms of
S are edges ∆1 → S. A morphism φ : ∆1 → S is said to have source X = φ(0) and target Y = φ(1); we will
often denote this by writing φ : X → Y . If X : ∆0 → S is an object of S, we will write idX = s0(X) : X → X
and refer to this as the identity morphism of X.

If f, g : X → Y are two morphisms in a higher category C, then f and g are homotopic if they determine
the same morphism in the homotopy category hC. In the setting of ∞-categories, this coincides with the
notion of homotopy introduced in the previous section. In the setting of topological categories, this simply
means that f and g lie in the same path component of MapC(X, Y ).
In either case, we will sometimes
indicate this relationship between f and g by writing f ≃ g.

A morphism f : X → Y in an ∞-category C is said to be an equivalence if it determines an isomorphism
in the homotopy category hC. We say that X and Y are equivalent if there is an equivalence between them
(in other words, if they are isomorphic as objects of hC).

If C is a topological category, then the requirement that a morphism f : X → Y be an equivalence is

quite a bit weaker than the requirement that f be an isomorphism. In fact, we have the following:

Proposition 1.2.4.1. Let f : X → Y be a morphism in a topological category. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) The morphism f is an equivalence.

(2) The morphism f has a homotopy inverse g : Y → X; that is, a morphism g such that f ◦ g ≃ idY and

g ◦ f ≃ idX .

(3) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Z, X) → MapC(Z, Y ) is a homotopy equivalence.

(4) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Z, X) → MapC(Z, Y ) is a weak homotopy equivalence.

(5) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Y, Z) → MapC(X, Z) is a homotopy equivalence.

(6) For every object Z ∈ C, the induced map MapC(Y, Z) → MapC(X, Z) is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Proof. It is clear that (2) is merely a reformulation of (1). We will show that (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4) ⇒ (1); the
implications (2) ⇒ (5) ⇒ (6) ⇒ (1) follow using the same argument.

To see that (2) implies (3), we note that if g is a homotopy inverse to f , then composition with g gives
a map MapC(Z, Y ) → MapC(Z, X) which is homotopy inverse to composition with f . It is clear that (3)
implies (4). Finally, if (4) holds, then we note that X and Y represent the same functor on hC so that f
induces an isomorphism between X and Y in hC.

Example 1.2.4.2. Let C be the category of CW-complexes, considered as a topological category by endowing
each of the sets HomC(X, Y ) with the (compactly generated) compact open topology. A pair of objects
X, Y ∈ C are equivalent (in the sense deﬁned above) if and only if they are homotopy equivalent (in the
sense of classical topology).

If C is an ∞-category (topological category, simplicial category), then we shall write X ∈ C to mean that
X is an object of C. We will generally understand that all meaningful properties of objects are invariant
under equivalence. Similarly, all meaningful properties of morphisms are invariant under homotopy and
under composition with equivalences.

In the setting of ∞-categories, there is a very useful characterization of equivalences which is due to

Joyal.

Proposition 1.2.4.3 (Joyal [44]). Let C be an ∞-category, and φ : ∆1 → C a morphism of C. Then φ is an
0 → C such that f0|∆{0,1} = φ, there exists
equivalence if and only if, for every n ≥ 2 and every map f0 : Λn
an extension of f0 to ∆n.

The proof requires some ideas which we have not yet introduced, and will be given in §2.1.2.

1.2.5 ∞-Groupoids and Classical Homotopy Theory

Let C be an ∞-category. We will say that C is an ∞-groupoid if the homotopy category hC is a groupoid: in
other words, if every morphism in C is an equivalence. In §1.1.1, we asserted that the theory of ∞-groupoids
is equivalent to classical homotopy theory. We can now formulate this idea in a very precise way:

Proposition 1.2.5.1 (Joyal [43]). Let C be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The simplicial set C is an ∞-category and its homotopy category hC is a groupoid.

38

(2) The simplicial set C satisﬁes the extension condition for all horn inclusions Λn

(3) The simplicial set C satisﬁes the extension condition for all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n for 0 ≤ i < n.
i ⊆ ∆n for 0 < i ≤ n.

(4) The simplicial set C is a Kan complex; in other words, it satisﬁes the extension condition for all horn

inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

Proof. The equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) follows immediately from Proposition 1.2.4.3. Similarly, the equivalence
(1) ⇔ (3) follows by applying Proposition 1.2.4.3 to Cop. We conclude by observing that (4) ⇔ (2) ∧ (3).

Remark 1.2.5.2. The assertion that we can identify ∞-groupoids with spaces is less obvious in other for-
mulations of higher category theory. For example, suppose that C is a topological category whose homotopy
category hC is a groupoid. For simplicity, we will assume furthermore that C has a single object X. We
may then identify C with the topological monoid M = HomC(X, X). The assumption that hC is a groupoid
is equivalent to the assumption that the discrete monoid π0M is a group. In this case, one can show that
the unit map M → ΩBM is a weak homotopy equivalence, where BM denotes the classifying space of
the topological monoid M . In other words, up to equivalence, specifying C (together with the object X) is
equivalent to specifying the space BM (together with its base point).

Informally, we might say that the inclusion functor i from Kan complexes to ∞-categories exhibits
the ∞-category of (small) ∞-groupoids as a full subcategory of the ∞-bicategory of (small) ∞-categories.
Conversely, every ∞-category C has an “underlying” ∞-groupoid, which is obtained by discarding the non-
invertible morphisms of C:

Proposition 1.2.5.3 ([44]). Let C be an ∞-category. Let C′ ⊆ C be the largest simplicial subset of C having
the property that every edge of C′ is an equivalence in C. Then C′ is a Kan complex. It may be characterized by
the following universal property: for any Kan complex K, the induced map HomSet∆(K, C′) → HomSet∆ (K, C)
is a bijection.

Proof. It is straightforward to check that C′ is an ∞-category. Moreover, if f is a morphism in C′, then f
has a homotopy inverse g ∈ C. Since g is itself an equivalence in C, we conclude that g belongs to C′ and is
therefore a homotopy inverse to f in C′. In other words, every morphism in C′ is an equivalence, so that C′
is a Kan complex by Proposition 1.2.5.1. To prove the last assertion, we observe that if K is an ∞-category,
then any map of simplicial sets φ : K → C carries equivalences in K to equivalences in C. In particular, if K
is a Kan complex, then φ factors (uniquely) through C′.

It follows from Proposition 1.2.5.3 that the functor C 7→ C′ is right adjoint to the inclusion functor from
Kan complexes to ∞-categories. It is easy to see that this right adjoint is an invariant notion: that is, a
categorical equivalence of ∞-categories C → D induces a homotopy equivalence C′ → D′ of Kan complexes.

Remark 1.2.5.4. It is easy to give analogous constructions in the case of topological or simplicial categories.
For example, if C is a topological category, then we can deﬁne C′ to be another topological category with
the same objects as C, where MapC′(X, Y ) ⊆ MapC(X, Y ) is the subspace consisting of equivalences in
MapC(X, Y ), equipped with the subspace topology.

Remark 1.2.5.5. We will later introduce a relative version of the construction described in Proposition
1.2.5.3, which applies to certain families of ∞-categories (Corollary 2.4.2.5).

Although the inclusion functor from Kan complexes to ∞-categories does not literally have a left adjoint,
it does have a left adjoint in a higher-categorical sense. This left adjoint is computed by any “ﬁbrant
replacement” functor (for the usual model structure) from Set∆ to itself, for example the functor S 7→ Sing |S|.
The unit map u : S → Sing |S| is always a weak homotopy equivalence, but generally not a categorical
equivalence. For example, if S is an ∞-category, then u is a categorical equivalence if and only if S is a
Kan complex. In general, Sing |S| may be regarded as the ∞-groupoid obtained from S by freely adjoining
inverses to all the morphisms in S.

39

Remark 1.2.5.6. The inclusion functor i and its homotopy-theoretic left adjoint may also be understood
using the formalism of localizations of model categories. In addition to its usual model category structure,
the category Set∆ of simplicial sets may be endowed with the Joyal model structure which we will deﬁne
in §2.2.5. These model structures have the same coﬁbrations (in both cases, the coﬁbrations are simply
the monomorphisms of simplicial sets). However, the Joyal model structure has fewer weak equivalences
(categorical equivalences, rather than weak homotopy equivalences) and consequently more ﬁbrant objects
(all ∞-categories, rather than only Kan complexes). It follows that the usual homotopy theory of simplicial
sets is a localization of the homotopy theory of ∞-categories. The identity functor from Set∆ to itself
determines a Quillen adjunction between these two homotopy theories, which plays the role of i and its left
adjoint.

1.2.6 Homotopy Commutativity versus Homotopy Coherence

Let C be an ∞-category (topological category, simplicial category). To a ﬁrst approximation, working in C is
like working in its homotopy category hC: up to equivalence, C and hC have the same objects and morphisms.
The main diﬀerence between hC and C is that in C, one must not ask whether or not morphisms are equal;
instead one should ask whether or not they are homotopic. If so, the homotopy itself is an additional datum
which we will need to consider. Consequently, the notion of a commutative diagram in hC, which corresponds
to a homotopy commutative diagram in C, is quite unnatural and usually needs to be replaced by the more
reﬁned notion of a homotopy coherent diagram in C.

To understand the problem, let us suppose that F : I → H is a functor from an ordinary category I into
the homotopy category of spaces H. In other words, F assigns to each object X ∈ I a space (say, a CW
complex) F (X), and to each morphism φ : X → Y in I a continuous map of spaces F (φ) : F (X) → F (Y )
(well-deﬁned up to homotopy), such that F (φ ◦ ψ) is homotopic to F (φ) ◦ F (ψ) for any pair of composable
morphisms φ, ψ in I. In this situation, it may or may not be possible to lift F to an actual functor
F from
F induces a functor I → H which is naturally
I to the ordinary category of topological spaces, such that
F ,
isomorphic to F . In general there are obstructions to both the existence and the uniqueness of the lifting
even up to homotopy. To see this, let us suppose for a moment that
F exists, so that there exist homotopies
kφ :
F (φ) ≃ F (φ). These homotopies determine additional data on F : namely, one obtains a canonical
e
homotopy hφ,ψ from F (φ ◦ ψ) to F (φ) ◦ F (ψ) by composing

e

e

e

e

F (φ ◦ ψ) ≃

F (φ ◦ ψ) =

F (φ) ◦

F (ψ) ≃ F (φ) ◦ F (ψ).

e

e

e

The functor F to the homotopy category H should be viewed as a ﬁrst approximation to
F ; we obtain a
second approximation when we take into account the homotopies hφ,ψ. These homotopies are not arbitrary:
the associativity of composition gives a relationship between hφ,ψ, hψ,θ, hφ,ψ◦θ and hφ◦ψ,θ, for a composable
triple of morphisms (φ, ψ, θ) in I. This relationship may be formulated in terms of the existence of a certain
higher homotopy, which is once again canonically determined by
F (and the homotopies kφ). To obtain
the next approximation to
F , we should take these higher homotopies into account, and formulate the
associativity properties that they enjoy, and so on. Roughly speaking, a homotopy coherent diagram in C is
e
a functor F : I → hC, together with all of the extra data that would be available if we were able to lift F to
a functor

F : I → C.

e

e

The distinction between homotopy commutativity and homotopy coherence is arguably the main diﬃculty
in working with higher categories. The idea of homotopy coherence is simple enough, and can be made precise
in the setting of a general topological category. However, the amount of data required to specify a homotopy
coherent diagram is considerable, so the concept is quite diﬃcult to employ in practical situations.

e

Remark 1.2.6.1. Let I be an ordinary category and C a topological category. Any functor F : I → C
determines a homotopy coherent diagram in C (with all of the homotopies involved being constant). For
many topological categories C, the converse fails: not every homotopy-coherent diagram in C can be obtained
in this way, even up to equivalence. In these cases, it is the notion of homotopy coherent diagram which is
fundamental; a homotopy coherent diagram should be regarded as “just as good” as a strictly commutative

40

diagram, for ∞-categorical purposes. As evidence for this, we remark that given an equivalence C′ → C, a
strictly commutative diagram F : I → C cannot always be lifted to a strictly commutative diagram in C′;
however it can always be lifted (up to equivalence) to a homotopy coherent diagram in C′.

One of the advantages of working with ∞-categories is that the deﬁnition of a homotopy coherent diagram
is easy to formulate. We can simply deﬁne a homotopy coherent diagram in an ∞-category C to be a map
of simplicial sets f : N(I) → C. The restriction of f to simplices of low dimension encodes the induced map
on homotopy categories. Specifying f on higher-dimensional simplices gives precisely the “coherence data”
that the above discussion calls for.

Remark 1.2.6.2. Another possible approach to the problem of homotopy coherence is to restrict our
attention to simplicial (or topological) categories C in which every homotopy coherent diagram is equivalent
to a strictly commutative diagram. For example, this is always true when C arises from a simplicial model
category (Proposition 4.2.4.4). Consequently, in the framework of model categories it is possible to ignore
the theory of homotopy coherent diagrams, and work with strictly commutative diagrams instead. This
approach is quite powerful, particularly when combined with the observation that every simplicial category
C admits a fully faithful embedding into a simplicial model category (for example, one can use a simplicially
enriched version of the Yoneda embedding). This idea can be used to show that every homotopy coherent
diagram in C can be “straightened” to a commutative diagram, possibly after replacing C by an equivalent
simplicial category (for a more precise version of this statement, we refer the reader to Corollary 4.2.4.7).

1.2.7 Functors between Higher Categories

The notion of a homotopy coherent diagram in an higher category C is a special case of the more general
notion of a functor F : I → C between higher categories (speciﬁcally, it is the special case in which I is
assumed to be an ordinary category). Just as the collection of all ordinary categories forms a bicategory
(with functors as morphisms and natural transformations as 2-morphisms), the collection of all ∞-categories
can be organized into an ∞-bicategory. In particular, for any ∞-categories C and C′, we expect to be able
to construct an ∞-category Fun(C, C′) of functors from C to C′.

In the setting of topological categories, the construction of an appropriate mapping object Fun(C, C′) is
quite diﬃcult. The naive guess is that Fun(C, C′) should be a category of topological functors from C to C′:
that is, functors which induce continuous maps between morphism spaces. However, we saw in §1.2.6 that
this notion is generally too rigid, even in the special case where C is an ordinary category.

Remark 1.2.7.1. Using the language of model categories, one might say that the problem is that not every
topological category is coﬁbrant. If C is a “coﬁbrant” topological category (for example, if C = | C[S]| where
S is a simplicial set), then the collection of topological functors from C to C′ is large enough to contain
representatives for every ∞-categorical functor from C to C′. Most ordinary categories are not coﬁbrant
when viewed as topological categories. More importantly, the property of being coﬁbrant is not stable under
products, so that naive attempts to construct a mapping object Fun(C, C′) need not give the correct answer
even when C itself is assumed coﬁbrant (if C is coﬁbrant, then we are guaranteed to have “enough” topological
functors C → C′ to represent all functors between the underlying ∞-categories, but not necessarily enough
natural transformations between them; note that the product C ×[1] is usually not coﬁbrant, even in the
simplest nontrivial case where C = [1].) This is arguably the most important technical disadvantage of the
theory of topological (or simplicial) categories as an approach to higher category theory.

The construction of functor categories is much easier to describe in the framework of ∞-categories. If
C and D are ∞-categories, then we can simply deﬁne a functor from C to D to be a map p : C → D of
simplicial sets.

Notation 1.2.7.2. Let C and D be simplicial sets. We let Fun(C, D) denote the simplicial set MapSet∆ (C, D)
parametrizing maps from C to D. We will use this notation only when D is an ∞-category (the simplicial
set C will often, but not always, be an ∞-category as well). We will refer to Fun(C, D) as the ∞-category

41

of functors from C to D (see Proposition 1.2.7.3 below). We will refer to morphisms in Fun(C, D) as natural
transformations of functors, and equivalences in Fun(C, D) as natural equivalences.

Proposition 1.2.7.3. Let K be an arbitrary simplicial set.

(1) For every ∞-category C, the simplicial set Fun(K, C) is an ∞-category.

(2) Let C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories. Then the induced map Fun(K, C) → Fun(K, D)

is a categorical equivalence.

(3) Let C be an ∞-category, and K → K ′ a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. Then the induced

map Fun(K ′, C) → Fun(K, C) is a categorical equivalence.

The proof makes use of the Joyal model structure on Set∆, and will be given in §2.2.5.

1.2.8 Joins of ∞-Categories
Let C and C′ be ordinary categories. We will deﬁne a new category C ⋆ C′, called the join of C and C′. An
object of C ⋆ C′ is either an object of C or an object of C′. The morphism sets are given as follows:

HomC(X, Y )
HomC′(X, Y )
∅
∗

if X, Y ∈ C
if X, Y ∈ C′
if X ∈ C′, Y ∈ C
if X ∈ C, Y ∈ C′ .

HomC ⋆ C′(X, Y ) = 



Composition of morphisms in C ⋆ C′ is deﬁned in the obvious way.

The join construction described above is often useful when discussing diagram categories, limits, and
colimits. In this section, we will introduce a generalization of this construction to the ∞-categorical setting.

Deﬁnition 1.2.8.1. If S and S′ are simplicial sets, then the simplicial set S ⋆ S′ is deﬁned as follows: for
each nonempty ﬁnite linearly ordered set J, we set

(S ⋆ S′)(J) =

S(I) × S′(I ′),

aJ=I∪I ′
where the union is taken over all decompositions of J into disjoint subsets I and I ′, satisfying i < i′ for
all i ∈ I, i′ ∈ I ′. Here we allow the possibility that either I or I ′ is empty, in which case we agree to the
convention that S(∅) = S′(∅) = ∗.

More concretely, we have

(S ⋆ S′)n = Sn ∪ S′

n ∪

Si × S′
j.

The join operation endows Set∆ with the structure of a monoidal category (see §A.1.3). The identity
for the join operation is the empty simplicial set ∅ = ∆−1. More generally, we have natural isomorphisms
φij : ∆i−1 ⋆ ∆j−1 ≃ ∆(i+j)−1, for all i, j ≥ 0.

i+j=n−1
[

Remark 1.2.8.2. The operation ⋆ is essentially determined by the isomorphisms φij , together with its
behavior under the formation of colimits: for any ﬁxed simplicial set S, the functors

T 7→ T ⋆ S

T 7→ S ⋆ T

commute with colimits, when regarded as functors from Set∆ to the undercategory (Set∆)S/ of simplicial
sets under S.

42

Passage to the nerve carries joins of categories into joins of simplicial sets. More precisely, for every pair

of categories C and C′, there is a canonical isomorphism

N(C ⋆ C′) ≃ N(C) ⋆ N(C′).

(The existence of this isomorphism persists when we allow C and C′ to be a simplicial or topological categories
and apply the appropriate generalization of the nerve functor.) This suggests that the join operation on
simplicial sets is the appropriate ∞-categorical analogue of the join operation on categories.

We remark that the formation of joins does not commute with the functor C[•]. However, the simplicial
category C[S ⋆ S′] contains C[S] and C[S′] as full (topological) subcategories, and contains no morphisms
from objects of C[S′] to objects of C[S]. Consequently, there is unique map φ : C[S ⋆ S′] → C[S] ⋆ C[S′] which
reduces to the identity on C[S] and C[S′]. We will later show that φ is an equivalence of simplicial categories
(Corollary 4.2.1.4).

We conclude by recording a pleasant property of the join operation:

Proposition 1.2.8.3 (Joyal [44]). If S and S′ are ∞-categories, then S ⋆ S′ is an ∞-category.

i → S ⋆ S′ be a map, with 0 < i < n. If p carries Λn

Proof. Let p : Λn
i entirely into S ⊆ S ⋆ S′ or into
S′ ⊆ S ⋆ S′, then we deduce the existence an extension of p to ∆n by invoking the assumption that S and S′
are ∞-categories. Otherwise, we may suppose that p carries the vertices {0, . . . , j} into S, and the vertices
{j + 1, . . . , n} into S′. We may now restrict p to obtain maps

∆{0,...,j} → S

∆{j+1,...,n} → S′,

which together determine a map ∆n → S ⋆ S′ extending p.

Notation 1.2.8.4. Let K be a simplicial set. The left cone K ⊳ is deﬁned to be the join ∆0 ⋆ K. Dually,
the right cone K ⊲ is deﬁned to be the join K ⋆ ∆0. Either cone contains a distinguished vertex (belonging
to ∆0), which we will refer to as the cone point.

1.2.9 Overcategories and Undercategories

Let C be an ordinary category, and X ∈ C an object. The overcategory C/X is deﬁned as follows: the objects
of C/X are morphisms Y → X in C having target X. Morphisms are given by commutative triangles

Y

 @@@@@@@

X

/ Z

~~~~~~~~

and composition is deﬁned in the obvious way.

One can rephrase the deﬁnition of the overcategory as follows. Let [0] denote the category with a single
object, possessing only an identity morphism. Then specifying an object X ∈ C is equivalent to specifying
a functor x : [0] → C. The overcategory C/X may then be described by the following universal property: for
any category C′, we have a bijection

Hom(C′, C/X ) ≃ Homx(C′ ⋆[0], C),

where the subscript on the right hand side indicates that we consider only those functors C′ ⋆[0] → C whose
restriction to [0] coincides with x.

We would like to generalize the construction of overcategories to the ∞-categorical setting. Let us begin
by working in the framework of topological categories. In this case, there is a natural candidate for the

43

 
/
~
relevant overcategory. Namely, if C is a topological category containing an object X, then the overcategory
C/X (deﬁned as above) has the structure of a topological category, where each morphism space MapC/X (Y, Z)
is topologized as a subspace of MapC(Y, Z) (here we are identifying an object of C/X with its image in C).
This topological category is usually not a model for the correct ∞-categorical slice construction. The problem
is that a morphism in C/X consists of a commutative triangle

Y

 @@@@@@@

X

/ Z

~~~~~~~~

of objects over X. To obtain the correct notion, we should allow also triangles which commute only up to
homotopy.

Remark 1.2.9.1. In some cases, the naive overcategory C/X is a good approximation to the correct con-
struction: see Lemma 6.1.3.13.

In the setting of ∞-categories, Joyal has given a much simpler description of the desired construction
(see [43]). This description will play a vitally important role throughout this book. We begin by noting the
following:

Proposition 1.2.9.2 ([43]). Let S and K be simplicial sets, and p : K → S an arbitrary map. There exists
a simplicial set S/p with the following universal property:

HomSet∆(Y, S/p) = Homp(Y ⋆ K, S),

where the subscript on the right hand side indicates that we consider only those morphisms f : Y ⋆ K → S
such that f |K = p.

Proof. One deﬁnes (S/p)n to be Homp(∆n ⋆ K, S). The universal property holds by deﬁnition when Y is a
simplex. It holds in general because both sides are compatible with the formation of colimits in Y .

Let p : K → S be as in Proposition 1.2.9.2. If S is an ∞-category, we will refer to S/p as an overcategory
of S, or as the ∞-category of objects of S over p. The following result guarantees that the operation of
passing to overcategories is well-behaved:

Proposition 1.2.9.3. Let p : K → C be a map of simplicial sets, and suppose that C is an ∞-category.
Then C/p is an ∞-category. Moreover, if q : C → C′ is a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories, then the
induced map C/p → C′

/qp is a categorical equivalence as well.

The proof requires a number of ideas which we have not yet introduced, and will be postponed (see

Proposition 2.1.2.2 for the ﬁrst assertion and §2.4.5 for the second).

Remark 1.2.9.4. Let C be an ∞-category. In the particular case where p : ∆n → C classiﬁes an n-simplex
σ ∈ Cn, we will often write C/σ in place of of C/p. In particular, if X is an object of C, we let C/X denote
the overcategory C/p, where p : ∆0 → C has image X.

Remark 1.2.9.5. Let p : K → C be a map of simplicial sets. The preceding discussion can be dualized,
replacing Y ⋆ K by K ⋆ Y ; in this case we denote the corresponding simplicial set by Cp/ which (if C is an
∞-category) we will refer to as an undercategory of C. In the special case where K = ∆n and p classiﬁes a
simplex σ ∈ Cn, we will also write Cσ/ for Cp/; in particular, we will write CX/ when X is an object of C.

Remark 1.2.9.6. If C is an ordinary category and X ∈ C, then there is a canonical isomorphism N(C)/X ≃
N(C/X ). In other words, the overcategory construction for ∞-categories can be regarded as a generalization
of the relevant construction from classical category theory.

1.2.10 Fully Faithful and Essentially Surjective Functors

Deﬁnition 1.2.10.1. Let F : C → D be a functor between topological categories (simplicial categories,
simplicial sets). We will say that F is essentially surjective if the induced functor hF : hC → hD is
essentially surjective (that is, if every object of D is equivalent to F (X) for some X ∈ C).

We will say that F is fully faithful if hF is a fully faithful functor of H-enriched categories. In other
words, F is fully faithful if and only if, for every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the induced map MaphC(X, Y ) →
MaphD(F (X), F (Y )) is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H.
Remark 1.2.10.2. Because Deﬁnition 1.2.10.1 makes reference only to the homotopy categories of C and
D, it is invariant under equivalence and under operations which pass between the various models for higher
category theory that we have introduced.

Just as in ordinary category theory, a functor F is an equivalence if and only if it is fully faithful and

essentially surjective.

1.2.11 Subcategories of ∞-Categories

Let C be an ∞-category, and let (hC)′ ⊆ hC be a subcategory of its homotopy category. We can then form
a pullback diagram of simplicial sets

C′

C

N(hC)′

/ N(hC).

We will refer to C′ as the subcategory of C spanned by (hC)′. In general, we will say that a simplicial subset
C′ ⊆ C is a subcategory of C if it arises via this construction.

Remark 1.2.11.1. We say “subcategory”, rather than “sub-∞-category”, in order to avoid awkward lan-
guage. The terminology is not meant to suggest that C′ is itself a category, or isomorphic to the nerve of a
category.

In the case where (hC)′ is a full subcategory of hC, we will say that C′ is a full subcategory of C. In this
0 of those objects X ∈ C which belong to C′. We will then say that C′ is

case, C′ is determined by the set C′
the full subcategory of C spanned by C′
0.

It follows from Remark 1.2.2.4 that the inclusion C′ ⊆ C is fully faithful. In general, any fully faithful

functor f : C′′ → C factors as a composition

→ C′ f ′′
where f ′ is an equivalence of ∞-categories and f ′′ is the inclusion of the full subcategory C′ ⊆ C spanned by
the set of objects f (C′′

C′′ f ′

→ C,

0 ) ⊆ C0.

1.2.12

Initial and Final Objects

If C is an ordinary category, then an object X ∈ C is said to be ﬁnal if HomC(Y, X) consists of a single
element, for every Y ∈ C. Dually, an object X ∈ C is initial if it is ﬁnal when viewed as an object of Cop.
The goal of this section is to generalize these deﬁnitions to the ∞-categorical setting.

If C is a topological category, then a candidate deﬁnition immediately presents itself: we could ignore
the topology on the morphism spaces, and consider those objects of C which are ﬁnal when C is regarded as
an ordinary category. This requirement is unnaturally strong. For example, the category CG of compactly
generated Hausdorﬀ spaces has a ﬁnal object: the topological space ∗, consisting of a single point. However,
there are objects of CG which are equivalent to ∗ (any contractible space) but not isomorphic to ∗ (and
therefore not ﬁnal objects of CG, at least in the classical sense). Since any reasonable ∞-categorical notion
is stable under equivalence, we need to ﬁnd a weaker condition.

Deﬁnition 1.2.12.1. Let C be a topological category (simplicial category, simplicial set). An object X ∈ C
is ﬁnal if it is ﬁnal in the homotopy category hC, regarded as a category enriched over H. In other words,
X is ﬁnal if and only if for each Y ∈ C, the mapping space MaphC(Y, X) is weakly contractible (that is, a
ﬁnal object of H).

Remark 1.2.12.2. Since the Deﬁnition 1.2.12.1 makes reference only to the homotopy category hC, it is
invariant under equivalence and under passing between the various models for higher category theory.

In the setting of ∞-categories, it is convenient to employ a slightly more sophisticated deﬁnition, which

we borrow from [43].

Deﬁnition 1.2.12.3. Let C be a simplicial set. A vertex X of C is strongly ﬁnal if the projection C/X → C
is a trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

In other words, a vertex X of C is strongly ﬁnal if and only if any map f0 : ∂ ∆n → C such that f0(n) = X

can be extended to a map f : ∆n → S.

Proposition 1.2.12.4. Let C be an ∞-category containing an object Y . The object Y is strongly ﬁnal if
and only if, for every object X ∈ C, the Kan complex HomR

C (X, Y ) is contractible.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear: the space HomR
C (X, Y ) is the ﬁber of the projection p : C/Y → C
over the vertex X. If p is a trivial ﬁbration, then the ﬁber is a contractible Kan complex. Since p is a right
ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.2.1), the converse holds as well (Lemma 2.1.3.4).

Corollary 1.2.12.5. Let C be a simplicial set. Every strongly ﬁnal object of C is a ﬁnal object of C. The
converse holds if C is an ∞-category.

Proof. Let [0] denote the category with a single object and a single morphism. Suppose that Y is a strongly
ﬁnal vertex of C. Then there exists a retraction of C⊲ onto C, carrying the cone point to Y . Consequently,
we obtain a retraction of (H-enriched) homotopy categories from (hC) ⋆ [0 ] to hC, carrying the unique object
of [0] to Y . This implies that Y is ﬁnal in hC, so that Y is a ﬁnal object of C.
To prove the converse, we note that if C is an ∞-category then HomR

C (X, Y ) represents the homotopy
type MapC(X, Y ) ∈ H; by Proposition 1.2.12.4 this space is contractible for all X if and only if Y is strongly
ﬁnal.

Remark 1.2.12.6. The above discussion dualizes in an evident way, so that we have a notion of initial
objects of an ∞-category C.

Example 1.2.12.7. Let C be an ordinary category containing an object X. Then X is a ﬁnal (initial) object
of the ∞-category N(C) if and only if it is a ﬁnal (initial) object of C, in the usual sense.

Remark 1.2.12.8. Deﬁnition 1.2.12.3 is only natural in the case where C is an ∞-category. For example, if
C is not an ∞-category, then the collection of strongly ﬁnal vertices of C need not be stable under equivalence.

An ordinary category C may have more than one ﬁnal object, but any two ﬁnal objects are uniquely
isomorphic to one another. In the setting of ∞-categories, an analogous statement holds, but is slightly
more complicated because the word “unique” needs to be interpreted in a homotopy theoretic sense:

Proposition 1.2.12.9 (Joyal). Let C be a ∞-category, and let C′ be the full subcategory of C spanned by the
ﬁnal vertices of C. Then C′ is either empty or a contractible Kan complex.

Proof. We wish to prove that every map p : ∂ ∆n → C′ can be extended to an n-simplex of C′. If n = 0,
this is possible unless C′ is empty. For n > 0, the desired extension exists because p carries the nth vertex
of ∂ ∆n to a ﬁnal object of C.

1.2.13 Limits and Colimits

An important consequence of the distinction between homotopy commutativity and homotopy coherence is
that the appropriate notions of limit and colimit in a higher category C do not coincide with the notion of
limit and colimit in the homotopy category hC (where limits and colimits often do not exist). Limits and
colimits in C are often referred to as homotopy limits and homotopy colimits, to avoid confusing them with
ordinary limits and colimits.

Homotopy limits and colimits can be deﬁned in a topological category, but the deﬁnition is rather
complicated. We will review a few special cases here, and discuss the general deﬁnition in the appendix
(§A.2.8).

Example 1.2.13.1. Let {Xα} be a family of objects in a topological category C. A homotopy product
α Xα is an object of C equipped with morphisms fα : X → Xα which induce a weak homotopy
X =
equivalence

Q

for every object Y ∈ C.

MapC(Y, X) →

MapC(Y, Xα)

α
Y

Passing to path components and using the fact that π0 commutes with products, we deduce that

HomhC(Y, X) ≃

HomhC(Y, Xα),

α
Y
so that any product in C is also a product in hC. In particular, the object X is determined up to canonical
isomorphism in hC.

In the special case where the index set is empty, we recover the notion of a ﬁnal object of C: an object

X for which each of the mapping spaces MapC(Y, X) is weakly contractible.

Example 1.2.13.2. Given two morphisms π : X → Z and ψ : Y → Z in a topological category C, let us
deﬁne MapC(W, X ×h
Z Y ) to be the space consisting of points p ∈ MapC(W, X), q ∈ MapC(W, Y ), together
with a path r : [0, 1] → MapC(W, Z) joining π ◦ p to ψ ◦ q. We endow MapC(W, X ×h
Z Y ) with the obvious
topology, so that X ×h
Z Y can be viewed presheaf of topological spaces on C. A homotopy ﬁber product for X
and Y over Z is an object of C which represents this presheaf, up to weak homotopy equivalence. In other
words, it is an object P ∈ C equipped with a point p ∈ MapC(P, X ×h
Z Y ) which induces weak homotopy
equivalences MapC(W, P ) → MapC(W, X ×h

Z Y ) for every W ∈ C.
We note that, if there exists a ﬁber product (in the ordinary sense) X ×Z Y in the category C, then
this ordinary ﬁber product admits a (canonically determined) map to the homotopy ﬁber product (if the
homotopy ﬁber product exists). This map need not be an equivalence, but it is an equivalence in many
good cases. We also note that a homotopy ﬁber product P comes equipped with a map to the ﬁber product
X ×Z Y taken in the category hC (if this ﬁber product exists); this map is usually not an isomorphism.

Remark 1.2.13.3. Homotopy limits and colimits in general may be described in relation to homotopy
limits of topological spaces. The homotopy limit X of a diagram of objects {Xα} in an arbitrary topological
category C is determined, up to equivalence, by the condition that there exist a natural weak homotopy
equivalence

MapC(Y, X) ≃ holim{MapC(Y, Xα)}.

Similarly, the homotopy colimit of the diagram is characterized by the existence of a natural weak homotopy
equivalence

MapC(X, Y ) ≃ holim{MapC(Xα, Y )}.

For a more precise discussion, we refer the reader to Remark A.3.3.13.

In the setting of ∞-categories, limits and colimits are quite easy to deﬁne:

47

Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4 (Joyal [43]). Let C be an ∞-category and let p : K → C be an arbitrary map of
simplicial sets. A colimit for p is an initial object of Cp/ and a limit for p is a ﬁnal object of C/p.

Remark 1.2.13.5. According to Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4, a colimit of a diagram p : K → C is an object of
Cp/. We may identify this object with a map p : K ⊲ → C extending p. In general, we will say that a map
p : K ⊲ → C is a colimit diagram if it is a colimit of p = p|K. In this case, we will also abuse terminology by
referring to p(∞) ∈ C as a colimit of p, where ∞ denotes the cone point of K ⊲.

If p : K → C is a diagram, we will sometimes write lim
−→

(p) to denote a colimit of p (considered either
(p) to denote a limit of p (as either an object of C/p or an object
as an object of Cp/ or of C), and lim
←−
of C). This notation is slightly abusive, since lim
(p) is not uniquely determined by p. This phenomenon is
−→
familiar in classical category theory: the colimit of a diagram is not unique, but is determined up to canonical
isomorphism. In the ∞-categorical setting, we have a similar uniqueness result: Proposition 1.2.12.9 implies
that the collection of candidates for lim
−→

(p), if nonempty, is parametrized by a contractible Kan complex.

Remark 1.2.13.6. In §4.2.4, we will show that Deﬁnition 1.2.13.4 agrees with the classical theory of
homotopy (co)limits, when we specialize to the case where C is the nerve of a topological category.

Remark 1.2.13.7. Let C be an ∞-category, C′ ⊆ C a full subcategory, and p : K → C′ a diagram. Then
p/ = C′ ×C Cp/. In particular, if p has a colimit in C, and that colimit belongs to C′, then the same object
C′
may be regarded as a colimit for p in C′.

Let f : C → C′ be a map between ∞-categories. Let p : K → C be a diagram in C, having a colimit
x ∈ Cp/. The image f (x) ∈ C′
f p/ may or may not be a colimit for the composite map f ◦ p. If it is, we will
say that f preserves the colimit of the diagram p. Often we will apply this terminology not to a particular
diagram p but some class of diagrams: for example, we may speak of maps f which preserve coproducts,
pushouts, or ﬁltered colimits (see §4.4 for a discussion of special classes of colimits). Similarly, we may ask
whether or not a map f preserves the limit of a particular diagram, or various families of diagrams.

We conclude this section by giving a simple example of a colimit-preserving functor.

Proposition 1.2.13.8. Let C be an ∞-category, q : T → C and p : K → C/q two diagrams. Let p0 denote
the composition of p with the projection C/q → C. Suppose that p0 has a colimit in C. Then:

(1) The diagram p has a colimit in C/q, and that colimit is preserved by the projection C/q → C.

(2) An extension

p : K ⊲ → C/q is a colimit of p if and only if the composition

e

is a colimit of p0.

K ⊲ → C/q → C

p0 : K ⊲ → C
Proof. We ﬁrst prove the “if” direction of (2). Let
p with a map K ⋆ ∆0 ⋆ T → C.
is a colimit of p0. We wish to show that
For this, it suﬃces to show that for any inclusion A ⊆ B of simplicial sets, it is possible to solve the lifting
problem depicted in the following diagram:
e

p : K ⊲ → C/q be such that the composite map

p is a colimit of p. We may identify

We now prove (1). Let

1.2.14 Presentations of ∞-Categories

e

e

Like many other types of mathematical structures, ∞-categories can be described by generators and relations.
In particular, it makes sense to speak of a ﬁnitely presented ∞-category C. Roughly speaking, C is ﬁnitely
presented if it has ﬁnitely many objects and its morphism spaces are determined by specifying a ﬁnite number
of generating morphisms, a ﬁnite number of relations among these generating morphisms, a ﬁnite number
of relations among the relations, and so forth (a ﬁnite number of relations in all).

Example 1.2.14.1. Let C be the free higher category generated by a single object X and a single morphism
f : X → X. Then C is a ﬁnitely presented ∞-category with a single object, and HomC(X, X) = {1, f, f 2, . . .}
is inﬁnite and discrete. In particular, we note that the ﬁnite presentation of C does not guarantee ﬁniteness
properties of the morphism spaces.

Example 1.2.14.2. If we identify ∞-groupoids with spaces, then giving a presentation for an ∞-groupoid
corresponds to giving a cell decomposition of the associated space. Consequently, the ﬁnitely presented
∞-groupoids correspond precisely to the ﬁnite cell complexes.

Example 1.2.14.3. Suppose that C is a higher category with only two objects X and Y , and that X and
Y have contractible endomorphism spaces and that HomC(X, Y ) is empty. Then C is completely determined
by the morphism space HomC(Y, X), which may be arbitrary. In this case, C is ﬁnitely presented if and only
if HomC(Y, X) is a ﬁnite cell complex (up to homotopy equivalence).

The idea of giving a presentation for an ∞-category is very naturally encoded in the theory of simplicial
sets; more speciﬁcally, in Joyal’s model structure on Set∆, which we will discuss in §2.2.4. This model
structure can be described as follows:

• The ﬁbrant objects of Set∆ are precisely the ∞-categories.

• The weak equivalences in Set∆ are precisely those maps p : S → S′ which induce equivalences C[S] →

C[S′] of simplicial categories.

If S is an arbitrary simplicial set, we can choose a “ﬁbrant replacement” for S; that is, a categorical
equivalence S → C where C is an ∞-category. For example, we can take C to be the nerve of the topological
category | C[S]|. The ∞-category C is well-deﬁned up to equivalence, and we may regard it as an ∞-category
which is “generated by” S. The simplicial set S itself can be thought of as a “blueprint” for building C. We
may view S as generated from the empty (simplicial) set by adjoining nondegenerate simplices. Adjoining
a 0-simplex to S has the eﬀect of adding an object to the ∞-category C, and adjoining a 1-simplex to S
has the eﬀect of adjoining a morphism to C. Higher dimensional simplices can be thought of as encoding
relations among the morphisms.

1.2.15 Set-Theoretic Technicalities

In ordinary category theory, one frequently encounters categories in which the collection of objects is too large
to form a set. Generally speaking, this does not create any diﬃculties so long as we avoid doing anything
which is obviously illegal (such as considering the “category of all categories” as an object of itself).

The same issues arise in the setting of higher category theory, and are in some sense even more of a
nuisance. In ordinary category theory, one generally allows a category C to have a proper class of objects,

49

but still requires HomC(X, Y ) to be a set for ﬁxed objects X, Y ∈ C. The formalism of ∞-categories treats
objects and morphisms on the same footing (they are both simplices of a simplicial set), and it is somewhat
unnatural (though certainly possible) to directly impose the analogous condition; see §5.4.1 for a discussion.
There are several means of handling the technical diﬃculties inherent in working with large objects (in

either classical or higher category theory):

(1) One can employ some set-theoretic device which enables one to distinguish between “large” and “small”.

Examples include:

– Assuming the existence of a suﬃcient supply of (Grothendieck) universes.

– Working in an axiomatic framework which allows both sets and classes (collections of sets which

are possibly too large to themselves be considered sets).

– Working in a standard set-theoretic framework (such as Zermelo-Frankel), but incorporating a
theory of classes through some ad-hoc device. For example, one can deﬁne a class to be a collection
of sets which is deﬁned by some formula in the language of set theory.

(2) One can work exclusively with “small” categories, and mirror the distinction between “large” and

“small” by keeping careful track of relative sizes.

(3) One can simply ignore the set-theoretic diﬃculties inherent in discussing “large” categories.

Needless to say, approach (2) yields the most reﬁned information. However, it has the disadvantage of
burdening our exposition with an additional layer of technicalities. On the other hand, approach (3) will
sometimes be inadequate, since we will need to make arguments which play oﬀ the distinction between a
“large” category and a “small” subcategory which determines it. Consequently, we shall oﬃcially adopt
approach (1) for the remainder of this book. More speciﬁcally, we assume that for every cardinal κ0, there
exists a strongly inaccessible cardinal κ ≥ κ0. We then let U(κ) denote the collection of all sets having rank
< κ, so that U(κ) is a Grothendieck universe: in other words, U(κ) satisﬁes all of the usual axioms of set
theory. We will refer to a mathematical object as small if it belongs to U(κ) (or is isomorphic to such an
object), and essentially small if it is equivalent (in whatever relevant sense) to a small object. Whenever
it is convenient to do so, we will choose another strongly inaccessible cardinal κ′ > κ, to obtain a larger
Grothendieck universe U(κ′) in which U(κ) becomes small.

For example, an ∞-category C is essentially small if and only if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

• The set of isomorphism classes of objects in the homotopy category hC has cardinality < κ.

• For every morphism f : X → Y in C and every i ≥ 0, the homotopy set πi(HomR

C (X, Y ), f ) has

cardinality < κ.

For a proof and further discussion, we refer the reader to §5.4.1.

Remark 1.2.15.1. The existence of the strongly inaccessible cardinal κ cannot be proven from the standard
axioms of set theory, and the assumption that κ exists cannot be proven consistent with the standard axioms
for set theory. However, it should be clear that assuming the existence of κ is merely the most convenient
of the devices mentioned above; none of the results proven in this book will depend on this assumption in
an essential way.

1.2.16 The ∞-Category of Spaces

The category of sets plays a central role in classical category theory. The main reason is that every category
C is enriched over sets: given a pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, we may regard HomC(X, Y ) as an object of Set. In
the higher categorical setting, the proper analogue of Set is the ∞-category S of spaces, which we will now
introduce.

50

Deﬁnition 1.2.16.1. Let Kan denote the full subcategory of Set∆ spanned by the collection of Kan com-
plexes. We will regard Kan as a simplicial category. Let S = N(Kan) denote the (simplicial) nerve of Kan.
We will refer to S as the ∞-category of spaces.

Remark 1.2.16.2. For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ Kan, the simplicial set MapKan(X, Y ) = Y X is a Kan
complex. It follows that S is an ∞-category (Proposition 1.1.5.10).

Remark 1.2.16.3. There are many other ways to obtain a suitable “∞-category of spaces”. For example,
we could instead deﬁne S to be the (topological) nerve of the category of CW-complexes and continuous
maps. All that really matters is that we have a ∞-category which is equivalent to S = N(Kan). We have
selected Deﬁnition 1.2.16.1 for deﬁniteness and to simplify our discussion of the Yoneda embedding in §5.1.3.

Remark 1.2.16.4. We will occasionally need to distinguish between “large” spaces and “small” spaces. In
such contexts, we will let S denote the ∞-category of small spaces (deﬁned by taking the simplicial nerve of
S the ∞-category of large spaces (deﬁned by taking the simplicial
the category of small Kan complexes), and
S is even
nerve of the category of all Kan complexes). We observe that S is a large ∞-category, and that
bigger.

Chapter 2

Fibrations of Simplicial Sets

Many classes of morphisms which play an important role in the homotopy theory of simplicial sets can be
deﬁned by their lifting properties (we refer the reader to §A.1.2 for a brief introduction and a summary of
the terminology employed below).

Example 2.0.0.1. A morphism p : X → S of simplicial sets which has the right lifting property with respect
to every horn inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n is called a Kan ﬁbration. A morphism i : A → B which has the left lifting
property with respect to every Kan ﬁbration is said to be anodyne.

Example 2.0.0.2. A morphism p : X → S of simplicial sets which has the right lifting property with
respect to every inclusion ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n is called a trivial ﬁbration. A morphism i : A → B has the left lifting
property with respect to every trivial Kan ﬁbration if and only if it is a coﬁbration; that is, if and only if i
is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

By deﬁnition, a simplicial set S is a ∞-category if it has the extension property with respect to all horn
i ⊆ ∆n with 0 < i < n. As in classical homotopy theory, it is convenient to introduce a relative

inclusions Λn
version of this condition.

Deﬁnition 2.0.0.3 (Joyal). A morphism f : X → S of simplicial sets is

• a left ﬁbration if f has the right lifting property with respect to all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 ≤ i < n.

• a right ﬁbration if f has the right lifting property with respect to all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 < i ≤ n.

• an inner ﬁbration if f has the right lifting property with respect to all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n,

0 < i < n.

A morphism of simplicial sets i : A → B is

• left anodyne if i has the left lifting property with respect to all left ﬁbrations.

• right anodyne if i has the left lifting property with respect to all right ﬁbrations.

• inner anodyne if i has the left lifting property with respect to all inner ﬁbrations.

Remark 2.0.0.4. Joyal uses the terms mid-ﬁbration and mid-anodyne morphism for what we have called
inner ﬁbrations and inner anodyne morphisms.

The purpose of this chapter is to study the notions of ﬁbration deﬁned above, which are basic tools in
the theory of ∞-categories. In §2.1, we study the theory of right (left) ﬁbrations p : X → S, which can be
viewed as the ∞-categorical analogue of categories (co)ﬁbered in groupoids over S. We will apply these ideas
in §2.2 to show that the theory of ∞-categories is equivalent to the theory of simplicial categories.

52

There is also an analogue of the more general theory of (co)ﬁbered categories, whose ﬁbers are not
necessarily groupoids: this is the theory of (co)Cartesian ﬁbrations, which we will introduce in §2.4. Cartesian
and coCartesian ﬁbrations are both examples of inner ﬁbrations, which we will study in §2.3.

Remark 2.0.0.5. To help orient the reader, we summarize the relationship between many of the classes
of ﬁbrations which we will study in this book. If f : X → S is a map of simplicial sets, then we have the
following implications:

f is a trivial ﬁbration

f is a Kan ﬁbration

ggggggggggggggggggg
w ggggggggggggggggggg

/WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

f is a left ﬁbration

f is a right ﬁbration

f is a coCartesian ﬁbration

f is a Cartesian ﬁbration

/WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

ggggggggggggggggggg
w ggggggggggggggggggg

f is a categorical ﬁbration

In general, none of these implications is reversible.

f is an inner ﬁbration.

Remark 2.0.0.6. The small object argument (Proposition A.1.2.5) shows that every map X → Z of
simplicial sets admits a factorization

X

p
→ Y

q
→ Z,

where p is anodyne (left anodyne, right anodyne, inner anodyne, a coﬁbration) and q is a Kan ﬁbration (left
ﬁbration, right ﬁbration, inner ﬁbration, trivial ﬁbration).

Remark 2.0.0.7. The theory of left ﬁbrations (left anodyne maps) is dual to the theory of right ﬁbrations
(right anodyne maps): a map S → T is a left ﬁbration (left anodyne map) if and only if the induced map
Sop → T op is a right ﬁbration (right anodyne map). Consequently, we will generally conﬁne our remarks in
§2.1 to the case of left ﬁbrations; the analogous statements for right ﬁbrations will follow by duality.

2.1 Left Fibrations

In this section, we will study the class of left ﬁbrations between simplicial sets. We begin in §2.1.1 with a
review of some classical category theory: namely, the theory of categories coﬁbered in groupoids (over another
category). We will see that the theory of left ﬁbrations is a natural ∞-categorical generalization of this idea.
In §2.1.2 we will show that the class of left ﬁbrations is stable under various important constructions, such
as the formation of slice ∞-categories.

It follows immediately from the deﬁnition that every Kan ﬁbration of simplicial sets is a left ﬁbration.
The converse is false in general. However, it is possible to give a relatively simple criterion for testing whether
or not a left ﬁbration f : X → S is a Kan ﬁbration. We will establish this criterion in §2.1.3 and deduce
some of its consequences.

The classical theory of Kan ﬁbrations has a natural interpretation in the language of model categories:
a map p : X → S is a Kan ﬁbration if and only if X is a ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/S, where the category
(Set∆)/S is equipped with its usual model structure. There is a similar characterization of left ﬁbrations:
a map p : X → S is a left ﬁbration if and only if X is a ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/S with respect to certain
model structure, which we will refer to as the covariant model structure. We will deﬁne the covariant model
structure in §2.1.4, and give an overview of its basic properties.

2.1.1 Left Fibrations in Classical Category Theory

Before beginning our study of left ﬁbrations, let us recall a bit of classical category theory. Let D be a small
category, and suppose we are given a functor

χ : D → Gpd,

where Gpd denotes the category of groupoids (where the morphisms are given by functors). Using the functor
χ, we can extract a new category Cχ via the classical Grothendieck construction:

• The objects of Cχ are pairs (D, η), where D ∈ D and η is an object of the groupoid χ(D).

• Given a pair of objects (D, η), (D′, η′) ∈ Cχ, a morphism from (D, η) to (D′, η′) in Cχ is given by a pair
(f, α), where f : D → D′ is a morphism in D, and α : χ(f )(η) ≃ η′ is an isomorphism in the groupoid
χ(D′).

• Composition of morphisms is deﬁned in the obvious way.

There is an evident forgetful functor F : Cχ → D, which carries an object (D, η) ∈ Cχ to the underlying
object D ∈ D. Moreover, it is possible to reconstruct χ from the category Cχ (together with the forgetful
functor F ), at least up to equivalence; for example, if D is an object of D, then the groupoid χ(D) is
canonically equivalent to the ﬁber product Cχ ×D{D}. Consequently, the Grothendieck construction sets
up a dictionary which relates functors χ : D → Gpd with categories Cχ admitting a functor F : Cχ → D.
However, this dictionary is not perfect; not every functor F : C → D arises via the Grothendieck construction
described above. To clarify the situation, we recall the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 2.1.1.1. Let F : C → D be a functor between categories. We say that C is coﬁbered in groupoids
over D if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) For every object C ∈ C and every morphism η : F (C) → D in D, there exists a morphism

η : C →

D

such that F (

η) = η.

(2) For every morphism η : C → C′ in C and every object C′′ ∈ C, the map

e

HomC(C′, C′′) → HomC(C, C′′) ×HomD(F (C),F (C ′′)) HomD(F (C′), F (C′′))

e

e

is bijective.

54

Example 2.1.1.2. Let χ : D → Gpd be a functor from a category D to the category of groupoids. Then
the forgetful functor Cχ → D exhibits Cχ as ﬁbered in groupoids over D.

Example 2.1.1.2 admits a converse: suppose we begin with a category C ﬁbered in groupoids over D.
Then, for every every object D ∈ D, the ﬁber CD = C ×D{D} is a groupoid. Moreover, for every morphism
f : D → D′ in D, it is possible to construct a functor f! : CD → CD′ as follows: for each C ∈ CD, choose
a morphism f : C → C′ covering the map D → D′, and set f!(C) = C′. The map f may not be uniquely
determined, but it is unique up to isomorphism and depends functorially on C. Consequently, we obtain a
functor f!, which is well-deﬁned up to isomorphism. We can then try to deﬁne a functor χ : D → Gpd by
the formulas

D 7→ CD

f 7→ f!.

Unfortunately, this does not quite work: since the functor f! is determined only up to canonical isomorphism
by f , the identity (f ◦ g)! = f! ◦ g! holds only up to canonical isomorphism, rather than up to equality. This
is merely a technical inconvenience; it can be addressed in (at least) two ways:

• The groupoid χ(D) = C ×D{D} can be described as the category of functors G ﬁtting into a commu-

tative diagram

z

G
z

z

{D}

C

=z

F

/ D .

If we replace the one point category {D} with the overcategory DD/ in this deﬁnition, then we obtain
a groupoid equivalent to χ(D) which depends on D in a strictly functorial fashion.

• Without modifying the deﬁnition of χ(D), we can realize χ as a functor from D to an appropriate

bicategory of groupoids.

We may summarize the above discussion informally by saying that the Grothendieck construction estab-

lishes an equivalence between functors χ : D → Gpd and categories ﬁbered in groupoids over D.

The theory of left ﬁbrations should be regarded as an ∞-categorical generalization of Deﬁnition 2.1.1.1.

As a preliminary piece of evidence for this assertion, we oﬀer the following:

Proposition 2.1.1.3. Let F : C → D be a functor between categories. Then C is coﬁbered in groupoids over
D if and only if the induced map N(F ) : N(C) → N(D) is a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

Proof. Proposition 1.1.2.2 implies that N(F ) is an inner ﬁbration. It follows that N(F ) is a left ﬁbration if
and only if it has the right lifting property with respect to Λn
0 ⊆ ∆n for all n > 0. When n = 1, the relevant
lifting property is equivalent to (1) of Deﬁnition 2.1.1.1. When n = 2 (n = 3) the relevant lifting property
is equivalent to the surjectivity (injectivity) of the map described in (2). For n > 3, the relevant lifting
0 → S extends uniquely to ∆n when S is isomorphic to the nerve of a
property is automatic (since a map Λn
category).

Let us now consider the structure of a general left ﬁbration p : X → S. In the case where S consists of
a single vertex, Proposition 1.2.5.1 asserts that p is a left ﬁbration if and only if X is a Kan complex. Since
the class of left ﬁbrations is stable under pullback, we deduce that for any left ﬁbration p : X → S and
any vertex s of S, the ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is a Kan complex (which we can think of as the ∞-categorical
analogue of a groupoid). Moreover, these Kan complexes are related to one another. More precisely, suppose
that f : s → s′ is an edge of the simplicial set S and consider the inclusion i : Xs ≃ Xs × {0} ⊆ Xs × ∆1.

Restricting the dotted arrow to {1} × Xs, we obtain a map f! : Xs → Xs′ . Of course, f! is not unique, but
it is uniquely determined up to homotopy.

Lemma 2.1.1.4. Let q : X → S be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The assignment

s ∈ S0 7→ Xs

f ∈ S1 7→ f!

determines a (covariant) functor from the homotopy category hS into the homotopy category H of spaces.

Proof. Let f : s → s′ be an edge of S. We note the following characterization of the morphism f! in H. Let K
be any simplicial set, and suppose given homotopy classes of maps η ∈ HomH(K, Xs), η′ ∈ HomH(K, Xs′ ).
Then η′ = f! ◦ η if and only if there exists a map p : K × ∆1 → X such that q ◦ p is given by the composition

η is the homotopy class of p|K × {0}, and η′ is the homotopy class of p|K × {1}.

Now consider any 2-simplex σ : ∆2 → S, which we will depict as

K × ∆1 → ∆1 f

→ S,

We note that the inclusion Xu × {0} ⊆ Xu × ∆2 is left-anodyne (Corollary 2.1.2.7). Consequently there
exists a map p : Xu × ∆2 → X such that p|Xu × {0} is the inclusion Xu ⊆ X and q ◦ p is the composition
Xu × ∆2 → ∆2 σ→ S. Then f! ≃ p|Xu × {1}, h! = p|Xu × {2}, and the map p|Xu × ∆{1,2} veriﬁes the
equation

h! = g! ◦ f!

in HomH(Xu, Xw).

We can summarize the situation informally as follows. Fix a simplicial set S. To give a left ﬁbration
q : X → S, one must specify a Kan complex Xs for each “object” of S, a map f! : Xs → Xs′ for each
“morphism” f : s → s′ of S, and “coherence data” for these morphisms for each higher-dimensional simplex
of S. In other words, giving a left ﬁbration ought to be more or less the same thing as giving a functor from
S to the ∞-category S of spaces. Lemma 2.1.1.4 can be regarded as a weak version of this assertion; we will
prove something considerably more precise in §2.1.4 (see Theorem 2.2.1.2).

We close this section by establishing two simple properties of left ﬁbrations, which will be needed in the

proof of Proposition 1.2.4.3:

Proposition 2.1.1.5. Let p : C → D be a left ﬁbration of ∞-categories, and let f : X → Y be a morphism
in C such that p(f ) is an equivalence in D. Then f is an equivalence in C.

in C. It follows that g ◦ f ≃ idX , so that f admits a left homotopy inverse. Since p(g) = g is an equivalence in
D, the same argument proves that g has a left homotopy inverse. This left homotopy inverse must coincide
with f , since f is a right homotopy inverse to g. Thus f and g are homotopy inverse in the ∞-category C,
so that f is an equivalence as desired.

Proposition 2.1.1.6. Let p : C → D be a left ﬁbration of ∞-categories, let Y be an object of C, and let
f : X → p(Y ) be an equivalence in D. Then there exists a morphism f : X → Y in C such that p(f ) = f
(automatically an equivalence, in view of Proposition 2.1.1.5).

Proof. Let g : p(Y ) → X be a homotopy inverse to f in C. Since p is a left ﬁbration, there exists a morphism
g : Y → X such that g = p(g). Since f and g are homotopy inverse to one another, there exists a 2-simplex
of D which we can depict as follows:

2.1.2 Stability Properties of Left Fibrations

The purpose of this section is to show that left ﬁbrations of simplicial sets exist in abundance. Our main
results are Proposition 2.1.2.1 (which is our basic source of examples for left ﬁbrations) and Corollary 2.1.2.9
(which asserts that left ﬁbrations are stable under the formation of functor categories).

Let C be an ∞-category, and let S denote the ∞-category of spaces. One can think of a functor from C
to S as a “cosheaf of spaces” on C. By analogy with ordinary category theory, one might expect that the
basic example of such a cosheaf would be the cosheaf corepresented by an object C of C; roughly speaking
this should be given by the functor

D 7→ MapC(C, D).

As we saw in §2.1.1, it is natural to guess that such a functor can be encoded by a left ﬁbration
There is a natural candidate for

C: the undercategory CC/. Note that the ﬁber of the map

e

f : CC/ → C

C → C.

e

over the object D ∈ C is the Kan complex HomL
consequence of the following more general result:

C(C, D). The assertion that f is a left ﬁbration is a

Proposition 2.1.2.1 (Joyal). Suppose given a diagram of simplicial sets

K0 ⊆ K

p
→ X

q
→ S

where q is an inner ﬁbration. Let r = q ◦ p : K → S, p0 = p|K0, and r0 = r|K0. Then the induced map

is a left ﬁbration. If the map q is already a left ﬁbration, then the induced map

Xp/ → Xp0/ ×Sr0/ Sr/

is a left ﬁbration as well.

X/p → X/p0 ×S/r0

S/r

Proposition 2.1.2.1 immediately implies the following half of Proposition 1.2.9.3, which we asserted earlier

without proof:

Corollary 2.1.2.2 (Joyal). Let C be an ∞-category and p : K → C an arbitrary diagram. Then the
projection Cp/ → C is a left ﬁbration. In particular, Cp/ is itself an ∞-category.

Proof. Apply Proposition 2.1.2.1 in the case where X = C, S = ∗, A = ∅, B = K.

We can also use Proposition 2.1.2.1 to prove Proposition 1.2.4.3, which was stated without proof in §1.2.4.

Proposition. Let C be an ∞-category, and φ : ∆1 → C a morphism of C. Then φ is an equivalence if and
only if, for every n ≥ 2 and every map f0 : Λn
0 → C such that f0|∆{0,1} = φ, there exists an extension of f0
to ∆n.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that φ is an equivalence, and let f0 be as above. To ﬁnd the desired extension of f0, we
must produce the dotted arrow in the associated diagram

{0}(cid:127)

∆1

/ C/∆n−2

C/ ∂ ∆n−2 .

The projection map p : C/ ∂ ∆n−2 → C is a right ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.2.1). Since φ′ is a preimage of
φ under p, Proposition 2.1.1.5 implies that φ′ is an equivalence. Because q is a right ﬁbration (Proposition
2.1.2.1 again), the existence of the dotted arrow follows from Proposition 2.1.1.6.

We now prove the converse. Let φ : X → Y be a morphism in C, and consider the map Λ2

0 → C indicated

in the following diagram:

The assumed extension property ensures the existence of the dotted morphism ψ : Y → X and a 2-simplex
σ which veriﬁes the identity ψ ◦ φ ≃ idX . We now consider the map

τ0 : Λ3
0

(•,s0φ,s1ψ,σ)

−→ C .

Once again, our assumption allows us to extend τ0 to a 3-simplex τ : ∆3 → C, and the face d0τ veriﬁes the
identity φ ◦ ψ = idY . It follows that ψ is a homotopy inverse to φ, so that φ is an equivalence in C.

We now turn to the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.1. It is an easy consequence of the following more basic

observation:

Lemma 2.1.2.3 (Joyal [44]). Let f : A0 ⊆ A and g : B0 ⊆ B be inclusions of simplicial sets. Suppose either
that f is right anodyne, or that g is left anodyne. Then the induced inclusion

is inner anodyne.

h : (A0 ⋆ B)

(A ⋆ B0) ⊆ A ⋆ B

aA0⋆B0

Proof. We will prove that h is inner anodyne whenever f is right anodyne; the other assertion follows by a
dual argument.

Consider the class of all morphisms f for which the conclusion of the lemma holds (for any inclusion
g). This class of morphisms is weakly saturated; to prove that it contains all right-anodyne morphisms, it
suﬃces to show that it contains each of the inclusions f : Λn
j ⊆ ∆n for 0 < j ≤ n. We may therefore assume
that f is of this form.

Now consider the collection of all inclusions g for which h is inner anodyne (where f is now ﬁxed). This
class of morphisms is also weakly saturated; to prove that it contains all inclusions, it suﬃces to show that
the lemma holds when g is of the form ∂ ∆m ⊆ ∆m. In this case, h can be identiﬁed with the inclusion
Λn+m+1

⊆ ∆n+m+1, which is inner anodyne because 0 < j ≤ n < n + m + 1.

j

The following result can be proven by exactly the same argument:

Lemma 2.1.2.4 (Joyal). Let f : A0 → A and g : B0 → B be inclusions of simplicial sets. Suppose that f
is left anodyne. Then the induced inclusion

is left anodyne.

(A0 ⋆ B)

(A ⋆ B0) ⊆ A ⋆ B

aA0⋆B0

Proof of Proposition 2.1.2.1. After unwinding the deﬁnitions, the ﬁrst assertion follows from Lemma 2.1.2.3
and the second from Lemma 2.1.2.4.

For future reference, we record the following counterpart to Proposition 2.1.2.1:

Proposition 2.1.2.5 (Joyal). Let π : S → T be an inner ﬁbration, p : B → S a map of simplicial sets,
i : A ⊆ B an inclusion of simplicial sets, p0 = p|A, p′ = π ◦ p, and p′
0 = π ◦ p0 = p′|A. Suppose that either i
is right anodyne, or π is a left ﬁbration. Then the induced map

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

φ : Sp/ → Sp0/ ×Tp′

0/ Tp′/

59

Proof. Consider the class of all coﬁbrations i : A → B for which φ is a trivial ﬁbration for every inner ﬁbration
(right ﬁbration) p : S → T . It is not diﬃcult to see that this is a weakly saturated class of morphisms; thus,
it suﬃces to consider the case where A = Λm

i , B = ∆m, for 0 < i ≤ m (0 ≤ i ≤ m).

Let q : ∂ ∆n → Sp/ be a map, and suppose given an extension of φ◦q to ∆n. We wish to ﬁnd a compatible

extension of q. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, we are given a map

r : (∆m ⋆ ∂ ∆n)

(Λm

i ⋆ ∆n) → S

aΛm
i ⋆∂ ∆n
which we wish to extend to ∆m ⋆ ∆n in a manner that is compatible with a given extension ∆m ⋆ ∆n → T
of the composite map π ◦ r. The existence of such an extension follows immediately from the assumption
that p has the right lifting property with respect to the horn inclusion Λn+m+1

⊆ ∆n+m+1.

i

The remainder of this section is devoted to the study of the behavior of left ﬁbrations under exponenti-
ation. Our goal is to prove an assertion of the following form: if p : X → S is a left ﬁbration of simplicial
sets, then so is the induced map X K → SK, for every simplicial set K (this is a special case of Corollary
2.1.2.9 below). This is an easy consequence of the following characterization of left anodyne maps, which is
due to Joyal:

Proposition 2.1.2.6 (Joyal [44]). The following collections of morphisms generate the same weakly saturated
class of morphisms of Set∆:

(1) The collection A1 of all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 ≤ i < n.

(2) The collection A2 of all inclusions

(∆m × {0})

(∂ ∆m × ∆1) ⊆ ∆m × ∆1.

a∂ ∆m×{0}

(3) The collection A3 of all inclusions

(S′ × {0})

(S × ∆1) ⊆ S′ × ∆1,

aS×{0}

where S ⊆ S′.

Proof. Let S ⊆ S′ be as in (3). Working cell-by-cell on S′, we deduce that every morphism in A3 can be
obtained as an iterated pushout of morphisms belonging to A2. Conversely, A2 is contained in A3, which
proves that they generate the same weakly saturated collection of morphisms.

To proceed with the proof, we must ﬁrst introduce a bit of notation. The (n + 1)-simplices of ∆n × ∆1

are indexed by order-preserving maps

We let σk denote the map

[n + 1] → [0, . . . , n] × [0, 1].

σk(m) =

(m, 0)
(m − 1, 1)

(

if m ≤ k
if m > k.

We will also denote by σk the corresponding (n + 1)-simplex of ∆n × ∆1. We note that {σk}0≤k≤n are
precisely the nondegenerate (n + 1)-simplices of ∆n × ∆1.

We deﬁne a collection {X(k)}0≤k≤n+1 of simplicial subsets of ∆n × ∆1 by descending induction on k.

We begin by setting

X(n + 1) = (∆n × {0})

(∂ ∆n × ∆1).

a∂ ∆n×{0}

60

Assuming that X(k + 1) has been deﬁned, we let X(k) ⊆ ∆n × ∆1 be the union of X(k + 1) and the simplex
σk (together with all the faces of σk). We note that this description exhibits X(k) as a pushout

X(k + 1)

∆n+1,

aΛn+1

k

and also that X(0) = ∆n × ∆1. It follows that each step in the chain of inclusions

X(n + 1) ⊆ X(n) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(1) ⊆ X(0)

is contained in the class of morphisms generated by A1, so that the inclusion X(n + 1) ⊆ X(0) is generated
by A1.

To complete the proof, we show that each inclusion in A1 is a retract of an inclusion in A3. More

speciﬁcally, the inclusion Λn

i ⊆ ∆n is a retract of

(∆n × {0})

(Λn

i × ∆1) ⊆ ∆n × ∆1,

aΛn
i ×{0}

so long as 0 ≤ i < n. We will deﬁne the relevant maps

∆n j

→ ∆n × ∆1 r→ ∆n

and leave it to the reader to verify that they are compatible with the relevant subobjects. The map j is
simply the inclusion ∆n ≃ ∆n × {1} ⊆ ∆n × ∆1. The map r is induced by a map of partially ordered sets,
which we will also denote by r. It may be described by the formulae

r(m, 0) =

m if m 6= i + 1
if m = i + 1
i

(

r(m, 1) = m.

Corollary 2.1.2.7. Let i : A → A′ be left-anodyne, and let j : B → B′ be a coﬁbration. Then the induced
map

is left-anodyne.

(A × B′)

(A′ × B) → A′ × B′

aA×B

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.3.2.1, which characterizes the class of left-anodyne maps
as the class generated by A3 (which is stable under smash products with any coﬁbration).

Remark 2.1.2.8. A basic fact in the homotopy theory of simplicial sets is that the analogue of Corollary
2.1.2.7 holds also for the class of anodyne maps of simplicial sets. Since the class of anodyne maps is generated
(as a weakly saturated class of morphisms) by the class of left anodyne maps and the class of right anodyne
maps, this classical fact follows from Corollary 2.1.2.7 (together with the dual assertion concerning right
anodyne maps).

Corollary 2.1.2.9. Let p : X → S be a left-ﬁbration, and let i : A → B be any coﬁbration of simplicial sets.
Then the induced map q : X B → X A ×SA SB is a left ﬁbration. If i is left anodyne, then q is a trivial Kan
ﬁbration.

61

Corollary 2.1.2.10 (Homotopy Extension Lifting Property). Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets.
Then p is a left ﬁbration if and only if the induced map

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

X ∆1

→ X {0} ×S{0} S∆1

For future use, we record the following criterion for establishing that a morphism is left anodyne:

Proposition 2.1.2.11. Let p : X → S be a map of simplicial sets, let s : S → X be a section of p, and let
h ∈ HomS(X × ∆1, X) be a (ﬁberwise) simplicial homotopy from s ◦ p = h|X × {0} to idX = h|X × {1}.
Then s is left anodyne.

Proof. Consider a diagram

where q is a left ﬁbration. We must show that it is possible to ﬁnd a map f rendering the diagram commu-
tative. Deﬁne F0 : (S × ∆1)
S×{0}(X × {0}) to be the composition of g with the projection onto S. Now
consider the diagram

Since q is a left ﬁbration and the left vertical map is left anodyne, it is possible to supply the dotted arrow
F as indicated. Now we observe that f = F |X × {1} has the desired properties.

2.1.3 A Characterization of Kan Fibrations

Let p : X → S be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. As we saw in §2.1.1, p determines for each vertex s of S a
Kan complex Xs, and for each edge f : s → s′ a map of Kan complexes f! : Xs → Xs′ (which is well-deﬁned
up to homotopy). If p is a Kan ﬁbration, then the same argument allows us to construct a map Xs′ → Xs,
which is a homotopy inverse to f!. Our goal in this section is to prove the following converse:

Proposition 2.1.3.1. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. The following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) The map p is a Kan ﬁbration.

(2) For every edge f : t → t′ in T , the map f! : St → St′ is an isomorphism in the homotopy category H

of spaces.

Lemma 2.1.3.2. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that S and T are Kan
complexes, and that p is a homotopy equivalence. Then p induces a surjection from S0 to T0.

Proof. Fix a vertex t ∈ T0. Since p is a homotopy equivalence, there exists a vertex s ∈ S0 and an edge e
joining p(s) to t. Since p is a left ﬁbration, this edge lifts to an edge e′ : s → s′ in S. Then p(s′) = t.

Lemma 2.1.3.3. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that T is a Kan complex.
Then p is a Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. We note that the projection S → ∗, being a composition of left ﬁbrations S → T and T → ∗, is a left
ﬁbration, so that S is also a Kan complex. Let A ⊆ B be an anodyne inclusion of simplicial sets. We must
show that the map p : SB → SA ×T A T B is surjective on vertices. Since S and T are Kan complexes, the
maps T B → T A and SB → SA are trivial ﬁbrations. It follows that p is a homotopy equivalence and a left
ﬁbration. Now we simply apply Lemma 2.1.3.2.

Lemma 2.1.3.4. Let p : S → T be a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Suppose that for every vertex t ∈ T ,
the ﬁber St is contractible. Then p is a trivial Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. It will suﬃce to prove the analogous result for right ﬁbrations (we do this in order to keep the notation
we use below consistent with that employed in the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6).

Since p has nonempty ﬁbers, it has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion ∅ = ∂ ∆0 ⊆ ∆0.
Let n > 0, f : ∂ ∆n → S any map, and g : ∆n → T an extension of p ◦ f . We must show that there exists
an extension

f : ∆n → S with g = p ◦

f .

Pulling back via the map G, we may suppose that T = ∆n and g is the identity map, so that S is an
∞-category. Let t denote the initial vertex of T . There is a unique map g′ : ∆n × ∆1 → T such that
g′|∆n × {1} = g and g′|∆n × {0} is constant at the vertex t.

e

Since the inclusion ∂ ∆n × {1} ⊆ ∂ ∆n × ∆1 is right anodyne, there exists an extension f ′ of f to
∂ ∆n × ∆1 which covers g′| ∂ ∆n × ∆1. To complete the proof, it suﬃces to show that we can extend f ′ to
f ′ : ∆n × ∆1 → S (such an extension is automatically compatible with g′ in view of our assumptions
a map
that T = ∆n and n > 0). Assuming this has been done, we simply deﬁne

f ′|∆n × {1}.

f =

Recall the notation of the proof of Proposition 2.1.2.6, and ﬁlter the simplicial set ∆n × ∆1 by the

e
simplicial subsets

e

e

X(n + 1) ⊆ . . . ⊆ X(0) = ∆n × ∆1.
We extend the deﬁnition of f ′ to X(m) by a descending induction on m. When m = n + 1, we note that
X(n + 1) is obtained from ∂ ∆n × ∆1 by adjoining the interior of the simplex ∂ ∆n × {0}. Since the boundary
of this simplex maps entirely into the contractible Kan complex St, it is possible to extend f ′ to X(n + 1).
Now suppose the deﬁnition of f ′ has been extended to X(i + 1). We note that X(i) is obtained from
X(i + 1) by pushout along a horn inclusion Λn+1
⊆ ∆n+1.
If i > 0, then the assumption that S is an
∞-category guarantees the existence of an extension of f ′ to X(i). When i = 0, we note that f ′ carries
the initial edge of σ0 into the ﬁber St. Since St is a Kan complex, f ′ carries the initial edge of σ0 to an
equivalence in S, and the desired extension of f ′ exists by Proposition 1.2.4.3.

i

Proof of Proposition 2.1.3.1. Suppose ﬁrst that (1) is satisﬁed, and let f : t → t′ be an edge in T . Since
p is a right ﬁbration, the edge f induces a map f ∗ : St′ → St, which is well-deﬁned up to homotopy. It is
not diﬃcult to check that the maps f ∗ and f! are homotopy inverse to one another; in particular, f! is a
homotopy equivalence. This proves that (1) ⇒ (2).

Assume now that (2) is satisﬁed. A map of simplicial sets is a Kan ﬁbration if and only if it is both a
right ﬁbration and a left ﬁbration; consequently, it will suﬃce to prove that p is a right ﬁbration. According
to Corollary 2.1.2.10, it will suﬃce to show that
q : S∆1

→ S{1} ×T {1} T ∆1

is a trivial Kan ﬁbration. Corollary 2.1.2.9 implies that q is a left ﬁbration. By Lemma 2.1.3.4, it suﬃces to
show that the ﬁbers of q are contractible.

Fix an edge f : t → t′ in T . Let X denote the simplicial set of sections of the projection S ×T ∆1 → ∆1,
where ∆1 maps into T via the edge f . Consider the ﬁber q′ : X → St′ of q over the edge f . Since the q and
q′ have the same ﬁbers (over points of S{1} ×T {1} T ∆1
whose second projection is the edge f ), it will suﬃce
to show that q′ is a trivial ﬁbration for every choice of f .

Consider the projection r : X → St. Since p is a left ﬁbration, r is a trivial ﬁbration. Because St is
a Kan complex, so is X. Lemma 2.1.3.3 implies that q′ is a Kan ﬁbration. We note that f! is obtained
by choosing a section of r and then composing with q′. Consequently, assumption (2) implies that q′ is a
homotopy equivalence, and thus a trivial ﬁbration, which completes the proof.

63

Remark 2.1.3.5. Lemma 2.1.3.4 is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.1.3.1, since any map between
contractible Kan complexes is a homotopy equivalence. Lemma 2.1.3.3 also follows immediately, since if T
is a Kan complex, then its homotopy category is a groupoid, so that any functor hT → H carries edges of
T to invertible morphisms in H.

2.1.4 The Covariant Model Structure

In §2.1.2, we saw that a left ﬁbration p : X → S determines a functor χ from hS to the homotopy category
H, carrying each vertex s to the ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s}. We would like to formulate a more precise relationship
between left ﬁbrations over S and functors from S into spaces. For this, it is convenient to employ Quillen’s
language of model categories. In this section, we will show that the category (Set∆)/S can be endowed with
the structure of a simplicial model category, whose ﬁbrant objects are precisely the left ﬁbrations X → S.
In §2.2, we will give an ∞-categorical version of the Grothendieck construction, provided by a suitable right
Quillen functor

(Set∆)C[S] → (Set∆)/S

which we will prove to be a Quillen equivalence (Theorem 2.2.1.2).

Warning 2.1.4.1. We will assume throughout this section that the reader is familiar with the theory of
model categories, as presented in §A.2. We will also assume familiarity with the model structure on the
category Cat∆ of simplicial categories (see §A.3.2).

`

Deﬁnition 2.1.4.2. Let f : X → S be a map of simplicial sets. The left cone of f is the simplicial set
X X ⊳. We will denote the left cone of f by C⊳(f ). Dually, we deﬁne the right cone of f to be the
S
simplicial set C⊳(f ) = S

X X ⊳.

Remark 2.1.4.3. Let f : X → S be a map of simplicial sets. There is a canonical monomorphism of
simplicial sets S → C⊳(f ). We will generally identify S with its image under this monomorphism, and
thereby regard S as a simplicial subset of C⊳(f ). We note that there is a unique vertex of C⊳(f ) which does
not belong to S. We will refer to this vertex as the cone point of C⊳(f ).

`

Example 2.1.4.4. Let S be a simplicial set, and let idS denote the identity map from S to itself. Then
C⊳(idS) and C⊲(idS) can be identiﬁed with S⊳ and S⊲, respectively.
Deﬁnition 2.1.4.5. Let S be a simplicial set. We will say that a map f : X → Y in (Set∆)/S is a:

(C) covariant coﬁbration if it is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

(W ) covariant equivalence if the induced map

is a categorical equivalence.

X ⊳

S → Y ⊳

S

aX

aY

(F ) covariant ﬁbration if it has the right lifting property with respect to every map which is both a covariant

coﬁbration and a covariant equivalence.

Lemma 2.1.4.6. Let S be a simplicial set. Then every left anodyne map in (Set∆)/S is a covariant equiv-
alence.

Proof. By general nonsense, it suﬃces to prove the result for a generating left anodyne inclusion of the form
Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, where 0 ≤ i < n. In other words, we must show any map

i : (Λn

i )⊳

S → (∆n)⊳

S

aΛn

is a categorical equivalence. We now observe that i is a pushout of the inner anodyne inclusion Λn+1
∆n+1.

Proposition 2.1.4.7. Let S be a simplicial set. The covariant coﬁbrations, covariant equivalences, and
covariant ﬁbrations determine a left proper, combinatorial model structure on (Set∆)/S.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that conditions (1), (2), and (3) of Proposition A.2.6.13 are met. We consider each
in turn:

(1) The class (W ) of weak equivalences is perfect. This follows from Corollary A.2.6.12, since the functor

X 7→ X ⊳

X S commutes with ﬁltered colimits.

(2) It is clear that the class (C) of coﬁbrations is generated by a set. We must show that weak equivalences
are stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. In other words, suppose we are given a pushout diagram

which is homotopy coCartesian, since Cat∆ is a left proper model category. Since the upper horizontal
map is an equivalence, so it the bottom horizontal map; thus j′ is a covariant equivalence.

`

X S] and C[Y ⊳

(3) We must show that a map p : X → Y in Set∆, which has the right lifting property with respect to
every map in (C), belongs to (W ). We note in that case that p is a trivial Kan ﬁbration, and therefore
admits a section s : Y → X. We will show that p and s induce mutually inverse isomorphisms between
C[X ⊳
Y S] in the homotopy category hCat∆; it will then follow that p is a covariant
equivalence.
`
Let f : X → X denote the composition s ◦ p; we wish to show that the map C[X ⊳
X S] induced by
f is equivalent to the identity in hCat∆. We observe that f is homotopic to the identity idX via a
homotopy h : ∆1 × X → X. It will therefore suﬃce to show that h is a covariant equivalence. But h
admits a left inverse

`

`

which is left anodyne (Corollary 2.1.2.7) and therefore a covariant equivalence by Lemma 2.1.4.6.

X ≃ {0} × X ⊆ ∆1 × X

Proposition 2.1.4.8. The category (Set∆)/S is a simplicial model category (with respect to the covariant
model structure and the natural simplicial structure).

Proof. We will deduce this from Proposition A.3.1.7. The only nontrivial point is to verify that for any
X ∈ (Set∆)/S, the projection X × ∆n → X is a covariant equivalence. But this map has a section X × {0} →
X × ∆n, which is left anodyne and therefore a covariant equivalence (Proposition 2.1.4.9).

We will refer to the model structure of Proposition 2.1.4.7 as the covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S.
We will prove later that the covariantly ﬁbrant objects of (Set∆)/S are precisely the left ﬁbrations X → S
(Corollary 2.2.3.12). For the time being, we will be content to make a much weaker observation:

Proposition 2.1.4.9. Let S be a simplicial set.

(1) Every left anodyne map in (Set∆)/S is a trivial coﬁbration with respect to the covariant model structure.

(2) Every covariant ﬁbration in (Set∆)/S is a left ﬁbration of simplicial sets.

(3) Every ﬁbrant object of (Set∆)/S determines a left ﬁbration X → S.

Proof. Assertion (1) follows from Lemma 2.1.4.6, and the implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are obvious.

Our next result expresses the idea that the covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S depends functorially

on S:

Proposition 2.1.4.10. Let j : S → S′ be a map of simplicial sets. Let j! : (Set∆)/S → (Set∆)/S′ be the
forgetful functor (given by composition with j), and let j∗ : (Set∆)/S′ → (Set∆)/S be its right adjoint, which
is given by the formula

Then we have a Quillen adjunction

j∗X ′ = X ′ ×S′ S.

(Set∆)/S

j!

j∗

/ (Set∆)/S′

(with the covariant model structures).

Proof. It is clear that j! preserves coﬁbrations. For X ∈ (Set∆)S, the pushout diagram

S

X S

/ X ⊳

X S′

`
is a homotopy pushout (with respect to the Joyal model structure). Thus j! preserves covariant equivalences.
It follows that (j!, j∗) is a Quillen adjunction.

`

Remark 2.1.4.11. Let j : S → S′ be as in Proposition 2.1.4.10. If j is a categorical equivalence, then the
Quillen adjunction (j!, j∗) is a categorical equivalence. This follows from Theorem 2.2.1.2 and Proposition
A.3.3.8.

Remark 2.1.4.12. Let S be a simplicial set. The covariant model structure on (Set∆)/S is usually not
self-dual. Consequently, we may deﬁne a new model structure on (Set∆)/S as follows:

(C) A map f in (Set∆)/S is a contravariant coﬁbration if it is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

(W ) A map f in (Set∆)/S is a contravariant equivalence if f op is a covariant equivalence in (Set∆)/Sop.

(F ) A map f in (Set∆)/S is a contravariant ﬁbration if f op is a covariant ﬁbration in (Set∆)/Sop.

We will refer to this model structure on (Set∆)/S as the contravariant model structure. Propositions 2.1.4.8,
2.1.4.9 and 2.1.4.10 have evident analogues in the contravariant setting.

2.2 Simplicial Categories and ∞-Categories

For every topological category C and every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, Theorem 1.1.5.13 asserts that the counit
map

u : | MapC[N(C)](X, Y )| → MapC(X, Y )

is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces. This result is the main ingredient needed to establish
the equivalence between the theory of topological categories and the theory of ∞-categories. The goal of
this section is to give a proof of Theorem 1.1.5.13 and to develop some of its consequences.

We ﬁrst replace Theorem 1.1.5.13 by a statement about simplicial categories. Consider the composition

MapC[N(C)](X, Y ) v→ Sing Map| C[N(C)]|(X, Y )

Sing(u)

→ Sing MapC(X, Y ).

Classical homotopy theory ensures that v is a weak homotopy equivalence. Moreover, u is a weak homotopy
equivalence of topological spaces if and only if Sing(u) is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.
Consequently, u is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces if and only if Sing(u) ◦ v is a weak
homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets. It will therefore suﬃce to prove the following simplicial analogue of
Theorem 1.1.5.13:

Theorem 2.2.0.1. Let C be a ﬁbrant simplicial category (that is, a simplicial category in which each mapping
space MapC(x, y) is a Kan complex), and let x, y ∈ C be a pair of objects. The counit map

u : MapC[N(C)](x, y) → MapC(x, y)

is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

The proof will be given in §2.2.4 (see Proposition 2.2.4.1). Our strategy is as follows:

(1) We will show that, for every simplicial set S, there is a close relationship between right ﬁbrations S′ → S
and simplicial presheaves F : C[S]op → Set∆. This relationship is controlled by the straightening and
unstraightening functors which we introduce in §2.2.1.

(2) Suppose that S is an ∞-category. Then, for each object y ∈ S, the projection S/y → S is a right
ﬁbration, which corresponds to a simplicial presheaf F : C[S]op → Set∆. This simplicial presheaf F is
related to S/y in two diﬀerent ways:

(i) As a simplicial presheaf, F is weakly equivalent to the functor x 7→ MapC[S](x, y).
(ii) For each object x of S, there is a canonical homotopy equivalence F(x) → S/y ×S {x} ≃

HomR

S (x, y). Here the Kan complex HomR

S (x, y) is deﬁned as in §1.2.2.

(3) Combining observations (i) and (ii), we will conclude that the mapping spaces HomR

S (x, y) are homo-

topy equivalent to the correpsonding mapping spaces HomC[S](x, y).

(4) In the special case where S is the nerve of a ﬁbrant simplicial category C, there is a canonical map

HomC(x, y) → HomR

S (x, y), which we will show to be a homotopy equivalence in §2.2.2.

(5) Combining (3) and (4), we will obtain a canonical isomorphism MapC(x, y) ≃ MapC[N(C)](x, y) in the
homotopy category of spaces. We will then show that this isomorphism is induced by the unit map
appearing in the statement of Theorem 2.2.0.1.

We will conclude this section with §2.2.5, where we apply Theorem 2.2.0.1 to construct the Joyal model
structure on Set∆ and to establish a more reﬁned version of the equivalence between ∞-categories and
simplicial categories.

67

2.2.1 The Straightening and Unstraightening Constructions (Unmarked Case)

In §2.1.1, we asserted that a left ﬁbration X → S can be viewed as a functor from S into a suitable ∞-
category of Kan complexes. Our goal in this section is to make this idea precise. For technical reasons, it will
be somewhat more convenient to phrase our results in terms of the dual theory of right ﬁbrations X → S.
Given any functor φ : C[S]op → C between simplicial categories, we will deﬁne an unstraightening functor
U nφ : SetC
∆ → (Set∆)/S. If F : C → Set∆ is a diagram taking values in Kan complexes, then the associated
map U nφ F → S is a right ﬁbration, whose ﬁber at a point s ∈ S is homotopy equivalent to the Kan complex
F(φ(s)).

Fix a simplicial set S, a simplicial category C and a functor φ : C[S] → Cop. Given an object X ∈ (Set∆)/S,

let v denote the cone point of X ⊲. We can view the simplicial category

M = C[X ⊲]

Cop

C[X]
a

as a correspondence from Cop to {v}, which we can identify with a simplicial functor

This functor is described by the formula

StφX : C → Set∆ .

(StφX)(C) = MapM(C, v).

We may regard Stφ as a functor from (Set∆)/S to (Set∆)C. We refer to Stφ as the straightening functor
associated to φ. In the special case where C = C[S]op and φ is the identity map, we will write StS instead
of Stφ.

By the adjoint functor theorem (or by direct construction), the straightening functor Stφ associated to
φ : C[S] → Cop has a right adjoint, which we will denote by U nφ and refer to as the unstraightening functor.
We now record the obvious functoriality properties of this construction.

Proposition 2.2.1.1.

(1) Let p : S′ → S be a map of simplicial sets, C a simplicial category, and φ :
C[S] → Cop a simplicial functor, and let φ′
: C[S′] → Cop denote the composition φ ◦ C[p]. Let
p! : (Set∆)/S′ → (Set∆)/S denote the forgetful functor, given by composition with p. There is a natural
isomorphism of functors

Stφ ◦ p! ≃ Stφ′

from (Set∆)/S′ to SetC
∆.

(2) Let S be a simplicial set, π : C → C′ a simplicial functor between simplicial categories, and φ : C[S] →

Cop a simplicial functor. Then there is a natural isomorphism of functors

Stπop◦φ ≃ π! ◦ Stφ

from (Set∆)/S to SetC′
given by composition with π.

∆ . Here π! : SetC

Our main result is the following:

Proof. It is easy to see that Stφ preserves coﬁbrations and weak equivalences, so that the pair (Stφ, U nφ)
is a Quillen adjunction. The real content of Theorem 2.2.1.2 is the ﬁnal assertion. Suppose that φ is an
equivalence of simplicial categories; then we wish to show that (Stφ, U nφ) is a Quillen equivalence. We will
prove this result in §2.2.3 as a consequence of Proposition 2.2.3.11.

2.2.2 Straightening Over a Point

In this section, we will study behavior of the straightening functor StX in the case where the simplicial set
X = {x} consists of a single vertex. In this case, we can view StX as a colimit-preserving functor from the
category of simplicial sets to itself. We begin with a few general remarks about such functors.

Let ∆ denote the category of combinatorial simplices and Set∆ the category of simplicial sets, so that
Set∆ may be identiﬁed with the category of presheaves of sets on ∆. If C is any category which admits small
colimits, then any functor f : ∆ → C extends to a colimit-preserving functor F : Set∆ → C (which is unique
up to unique isomorphism). We may regard f as a cosimplicial object C• of C. In this case, we shall denote
the functor F by

S 7→ |S|C •.

Remark 2.2.2.1. Concretely, one constructs |S|C • by taking the disjoint union of Sn × Cn and making
the appropriate identiﬁcations along the “boundaries”. In the language of category theory, the geometric
realization is given by the coend

Sn × Cn.

Z[n]∈∆

The functor S 7→ |S|C • has a right adjoint which we shall denote by SingC • . It may be described by the

formula

SingC •(X)n = HomC(Cn, X).

Example 2.2.2.2. Let C be the category CG of compactly generated Hausdorﬀ spaces, and let C• be the
cosimplicial space deﬁned by

Cn = {(x0, . . . , xn) ∈ [0, 1]n+1 : x0 + . . . + xn = 1}.

Then |S|C • is the usual geometric realization |S| of the simplicial set S and SingC • = Sing is the functor
which assigns to each topological space X its its singular complex.

Example 2.2.2.3. Let C be the category Set∆, and let C• be the standard simplex (the cosimplicial object
of Set∆ given by the Yoneda embedding):

Cn = ∆n.

Then ||C • and SingC • are both (isomorphic to) the identity functor on Set∆.

Example 2.2.2.4. Let C = Cat, and let f : ∆ → Cat be the functor which associates to each ﬁnite nonempty
linearly ordered set J the corresponding category. Then SingC • = N is the functor which associates to each
category its nerve, and ||C • associates, to each simplicial set S, the homotopy category hS as deﬁned in
§1.2.3.

Example 2.2.2.5. Let C = Cat∆, and let C• be the cosimplicial object of C given in Deﬁnitions 1.1.5.1 and
1.1.5.3. Then SingC • is the simplicial nerve functor, and ||C • is its left adjoint

S 7→ C[S].

69

Let us now return to the case of the straightening functor StX , where X = {x} consists of a single vertex.
The above remarks show that we can identify StX with the geometric realization functor ||Q• : Set∆ → Set∆,
for some cosimplicial object Q• in Set∆. To describe Q• more explicitly, let us ﬁrst deﬁne a cosimplicial
simplicial set J • by the formula

J n = (∆n ⋆ {y})

{x}.

The cosimplical simplicial set Q• can then be described by the formula Qn = MapC[J n](x, y).

In order to proceed with our analysis, we need to understand better the cosimplicial object Q• of Set∆.

a∆n

It admits the following description:

• For each n ≥ 0, let P[n] denote the partially ordered set of nonempty subsets of [n], and K[n] the
simplicial set N(P ) (which may be identiﬁed with a simplicial subset of the (n + 1)-cube (∆1)n+1).
The simplicial set Qn is obtained by collapsing, for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the subset

(∆1){j:0≤j<i} × {1} × (∆1){j:i<j≤n} ⊆ K[n]

to its quotient (∆1){j:i<j≤n}.

• A map f : [n] → [m] determines a map Pf : P[n] → P[m], by setting Pf (I) = f (I). The map Pf in turn
induces a map of simplicial sets K[n] → K[m], which determines a map of quotients Qn → Qm when f
is order-preserving.

Remark 2.2.2.6. Let Q• = |Q•| denote the cosimplicial space obtained by applying the (usual) geometric
realization functor to Q•. The space Qn may be described as a quotient of the cube of all functions p : [n] →
[0, 1] satisfying p(0) = 1. This cube is to be divided by the following equivalence relation: p ≃ p′ if there
exists a nonnegative integer i ≤ n such that p|{i, . . . n} = p′|{i, . . . , n} and p(i) = p′(i) = 1.

Each Qn is homeomorphic to an n-simplex, and these homeomorphisms may be chosen to be compatible
with the face maps of the cosimplicial space Q•. However, Q• is not isomorphic to the standard simplex
because it has very diﬀerent degeneracies. For example, the product of the degeneracy mappings Qn → (Q1)n
is not injective for n ≥ 2.

Our goal for the remainder of this section is to study the functors SingQ• and ||Q• and to prove that
they are “close” to the identity functor. More precisely, there is a map π : Q• → ∆• of cosimplicial objects
of Set∆. It is induced by a map K[n] → ∆n, which the nerve of the map of partially ordered sets P[n] → [n]
which carries each nonempty subset of [n] to its largest element.

Proposition 2.2.2.7. Let S be a simplicial set. Then the map pS : |S|Q• → S induced by π is a weak
homotopy equivalence.

Proof. Consider the collection A of simplicial sets S for which the assertion of Proposition 2.2.2.7 holds.
Since A is stable under ﬁltered colimits, it will suﬃce to prove that every simplicial set S having only ﬁnitely
many nondegenerate simplices belongs to A. We prove this by induction on the dimension n of S, and the
number of nondegenerate simplices of S of dimension n. If S = ∅, there is nothing to prove; otherwise we
may write

S ≃ S′

∆n

a∂ ∆n

|S|Q• ≃ |S′|Q•

|∆n|Q• .

a| ∂ ∆n|Q•

Since both of these pushouts are homotopy pushouts, it suﬃces to show that pS′, p∂ ∆n , and p∆n are weak
homotopy equivalences. For pS′ and p∂ ∆n, this follows from the inductive hypothesis; for p∆n, we need only
observe that both ∆n and |∆n|Q• = Qn are weakly contractible.

Remark 2.2.2.8. The strategy used to prove Proposition 2.2.2.7 will reappear frequently throughout this
book: it allows us to prove theorems about arbitrary simplicial sets by reducing to the case of simplices.

Proposition 2.2.2.9. The adjoint functors Set∆

determine a Quillen equivalence from the cat-

Proof. We ﬁrst show that the functors (||Q• , SingQ• ) determine a Quillen adjunction from Set∆ to itself. For
this, it suﬃces to prove that the functor S 7→ |S|Q• preserves coﬁbrations and weak equivalences. The case
of coﬁbrations is easy, and the second case follows from Proposition 2.2.2.7. To complete the proof, it will
suﬃce to show that the left derived functor L||Q• determines an equivalence from the homotopy category
H to itself. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.2.2.7, which implies that L||Q• is equivalent to the
identity functor.

Corollary 2.2.2.10. Let X be a Kan complex. Then the counit map

v : | SingQ• X|Q• → X

is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Remark 2.2.2.11. Let S be a simplicial set containing a vertex s. Let C be a simplicial category, φ :
C[S]op → C a simplicial functor, and C = φ(s) ∈ C. For every simplicial functor F : C → Set∆, there is a
canonical isomorphism

(U nφ F) ×S {s} ≃ SingQ• F(C).
In particular, we have a canonical map from F(C) to the ﬁber (U nφ F)s, which is a homotopy equivalence if
F(C) is ﬁbrant.
Remark 2.2.2.12. Let C and C′ be simplicial categories. Given a pair of simplicial functors F : C → Set∆,
F′ : C′ → Set∆, we let F ⊠ F′ : C × C′ → Set∆ denote the functor described by the formula

(F ⊠ F′)(C, C′) = F(C) × F′(C′).

Given a pair of simplicial functors φ : C[S]op → C, φ′ : C[S′]op → C′, we let φ ⊠ φ′ denote the induced map
C[S × S′] → C × C′. We observe that there is a canonical isomorphism of functors

Restricting our attention to the case where S′ = ∆0 and φ′ is an isomorphism, we obtain an isomorphism

U nφ⊠φ′(F ⊠ F′) ≃ U nφ(F) × U nφ′(F′).

for every simplicial set K. In particular, for every pair of functors F, G ∈ SetC

∆, we have a chain of maps

U nφ(F ⊠K) ≃ U nφ(F) × SingQ• K,

HomSet∆(K, MapSetC

(F, G)) ≃ HomSetC

(F ⊠K, G)
→ Hom(Set∆)/S (U nφ(F ⊠K), U nφ G)

→ Hom(Set∆)/S (U nφ(F) × K, U nφ G)
≃ HomSet∆(K, Map(Set∆)/S (U nφ(F), U nφ(G)).

This construction is natural in K, and therefore determines a map of simplicial sets

MapSetC

∆

(F, G) → Map(Set∆)/S (U nφ F, U nφ G).

Together, these maps endow the unstraightening functor U nφ with the structure of a simplicial functor from

The cosimplicial object Q• of Set∆ will play an important role in our proof of Theorem 1.1.5.13. To
explain this, let us suppose that C is a simplicial category and S = N(C) is its simplicial nerve. For every
pair of vertices x, y ∈ S, we can consider the right mapping space HomR
S (x, y). By deﬁnition, giving an
n-simplex of HomR
S (x, y) is equivalent to giving a map of simplicial sets J n → S, which carries x to x and y
to y. Using the identiﬁcation S ≃ N(C), we see that this is equivalent to giving a map C[J n] into C, which
again carries x to x and y to y. This is simply the data of a map of simplicial sets Qn → MapC(x, y).
Moreover, this identiﬁcation is natural with respect to [n]; we therefore have the following result:
Proposition 2.2.2.13. Let C be a simplicial category, and let X, Y ∈ C be two objects. There is a natural
isomorphism of simplicial sets HomR
N(C)(X, Y ) ≃ SingQ• MapC(X, Y ).

2.2.3 Straightening of Right Fibrations

Our goal in this section is to prove Theorem 2.2.1.2, which asserts that the Quillen adjunction

(Set∆)/S

Stφ

Unφ

/ SetC
∆

is a Quillen equivalence when φ : C[S] → Cop is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We ﬁrst treat the
case where S is a simplex.

Lemma 2.2.3.1. Let n be a nonnegative integer, let [n] denote the linearly ordered set {0, . . . , n}, regarded
as a (discrete) simplicial category, and let φ : C[∆n] → [n] be the canonical functor. Then the Quillen
adjunction

(Set∆)/∆n

Stφ

Unφ

/ Set∆

[n]

is a Quillen equivalence.

Proof. It follows from the deﬁnition of the contravariant model structure that the left derived functor LStφ :
h(Set∆)/∆n → hSet[n]
∆ is conservative. It will therefore suﬃce to show that the counit map LStφ ◦RU nφ → id
is an isomorphism of functors from hSet[n]
∆ to itself. For this, we must show that if F : [n] → Set∆ is
projectively ﬁbrant, then the counit map

StφU nφ F → F

is an equivalence in Set[n]
wish to prove that each of the induced maps

∆ . In other words, we may assume that F(i) is a Kan complex for i ∈ [n], and we

is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.
Let ψ : [n] → [1] be deﬁned by the formula

vi : (StφU nφ F)(i) → F(i)

ψ′(j) =

0
1

(

if 0 ≤ j ≤ i
otherwise.

Then, for every object X ∈ (Set∆)/∆n, we have isomorphisms

(StφX)(i) ≃ (Stψ◦φX)(0) ≃ |X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}|Q• ,
where the twisted geometric realization functor ||Q• is as deﬁned in §2.2.2. Taking X = U nφ F, we see that
vi ﬁts into a commutative diagram

|X ×∆n {n − i}|Q•

|X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}|Q•

Here the upper horizontal map is an isomorphism supplied by Corollary 2.2.2.11, and the right vertical map
is a weak homotopy equivalence by Proposition 2.2.2.10. Consequently, to prove that the map vi is a weak
homotopy equivalence, it will suﬃce to show that the left vertical map is a weak homotopy equivalence. In
view of Proposition 2.2.2.7, it will suﬃce to show that the inclusion

X ×∆n {n − i} ⊆ X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}

is a weak homotopy equivalence. In fact, X ×∆n {n − i} is a deformation retract of X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n}: this
follows from the observation that the projection X → ∆n is a right ﬁbration (Proposition 2.1.4.9).

It will be convenient to restate Lemma 2.2.3.1 in a slightly modiﬁed form. First, we need to introduce a

bit of terminology.

Deﬁnition 2.2.3.2. Suppose given a commutative diagram of simplicial sets

X

p

(cid:31)@@@@@@@

f

S,

Y

(cid:127)~~~~~~~

q

where p and q are right ﬁbrations. We will say that f is a pointwise equivalence if, for each vertex s ∈ S, the
induced map Xs → Ys is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes.

Remark 2.2.3.3. In the situation of Deﬁnition 2.2.3.2, the following conditions are equivalent:

(a) The map f is a pointwise equivalence of right ﬁbrations over S.

(b) The map f is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S.

(c) The map f is a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets.

The equivalence (a) ⇔ (b) follows from Corollary 2.2.3.13 (see below), and the equivalence (a) ⇔ (c) from
Proposition 3.3.1.5.

Lemma 2.2.3.4. Let S′ ⊆ S be simplicial sets. Let p : X → S be any map, and let q : Y → S be a right
ﬁbration. Let X ′ = X ×S S′ and Y ′ = Y ×S S′. The restriction map

φ : Map(Set∆)/S (X, Y ) → Map(Set∆)/S′ (X ′, Y ′)

is a Kan ﬁbration.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that φ is a right ﬁbration. It will suﬃce to show that φ has the right lifting property
with respect to every right anodyne inclusion A ⊆ B. This follows from the fact that q has the right lifting
property with respect to the induced inclusion

i : (B × S′)

(A × S) ⊆ B × S,

aA×S′

since i is again right anodyne (Corollary 2.1.2.7).

Applying the preceding argument to the inclusion ∅ ⊆ S′, we deduce that the projection map

Map(Set∆)/S′ (X ′, Y ′) → ∆0

is a right ﬁbration. Proposition 1.2.5.1 implies that Map(Set∆)/S′ (X ′, Y ′) is a Kan complex. Lemma 2.1.3.3
now implies that φ is a Kan ﬁbration as desired.

Lemma 2.2.3.5. Let U be a collection of simplicial sets. Suppose that:

(i) The collection U is stable under isomorphism. That is, if S ∈ U and S′ ≃ S, then S′ ∈ U.

(ii) The collection U is stable under the formation of disjoint unions.

(iii) Every simplex ∆n belongs to U.

(iv) Given a pushout diagram

in which X, X ′, and Y belong to U. If the map f is a monomorphism, then Y ′ belongs to U.

(v) Suppose given a sequence of monomorphisms of simplicial sets

X(0) → X(1) → . . .

If each X(i) belongs to U, then the colimit lim
−→

X(i) belongs to U.

Then every simplicial set belongs to U.

Proof. Let S be a simplicial set; we wish to show that S ∈ U. In view of (v), it will suﬃce to show that
each skeleton skn S belongs to U. We may therefore assume that S is ﬁnite dimensional. We now proceed
by induction on the dimension n of S. Let A denote the set of nondegenerate n-simplexes of S, so that we
have a pushout diagram

Proof. The implication (b) ⇒ (a) is clear (any homotopy inverse to f determines homotopy inverses for the
maps fs : Xs → Ys, for each vertex s ∈ S), and the implication (c) ⇒ (b) follows from Proposition 1.2.4.1.
We will prove that (a) ⇒ (c). Let U denote the collection of all simplicial sets A such that, for every map
A → S, composition with f induces a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes

Map(Set∆)/S (A, X) → Map(Set∆)/S (A, Y ).

We will show that U satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 2.2.3.5, and therefore contains all simplicial sets.
Conditions (i) and (ii) are obvious, and conditions (iv) and (v) follow from Lemma 2.2.3.4. It will therefore
suﬃce to show that every simplex ∆n belongs to U. For every map ∆n → S, we have a commutative diagram

Map(Set∆)/S

(∆n, X)

Map(Set∆)/S

(∆n, Y )

Map(Set∆)/S ({n}, X)

/ Map(Set∆)/S ({n}, Y ).

Since the inclusion {n} ⊆ ∆n is right anodyne, the vertical maps are trivial Kan ﬁbrations. It will therefore
suﬃce to show that the bottom horizontal map is a homotopy equivalence, which follows immediately from
(a).

Lemma 2.2.3.7. Let φ : C[∆n] → [n] be as in Lemma 2.2.3.1. Suppose given a right ﬁbration X → ∆n, a
projectively ﬁbrant diagram F ∈ Set[n]
∆ , and a weak equivalence of diagrams α : StφX → F. Then the adjoint
map X → U nφ F is a pointwise equivalence of left ﬁbrations over ∆n.

Proof. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, let X(i) = X ×∆n ∆{n−i,...,n} ⊆ X. We observe that (StφX)(i) is canonically
isomorphic to the twisted geometric realization |X(i)|Q• , where Q• is deﬁned as in §2.2.2. Since X → ∆n
is a right ﬁbration, the ﬁber X ×∆n {i} is a deformation retract of X(i). Using Proposition 2.2.2.7, we
conclude that the induced inclusion |X ×∆n {n − i}|Q• → |X(i)|Q• is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since
α is a weak equivalence, we get weak equivalences |X ×∆n {n − i}|Q• → F(i) for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Using
Proposition 2.2.2.9, we deduce that the adjoint maps X ×∆n {n − i} → SingQ• F(i) are again weak homotopy
equivalences. The desired result now follows from the observation that SingQ• F(i) ≃ (U nφ F) ×∆n {n − i}
(Remark 2.2.2.11).

Notation 2.2.3.8. For every simplicial set S, we let RFib(S) denote the full subcategory of (Set∆)/S
spanned by those maps X → S which are right ﬁbrations.

Proposition 2.1.4.9 implies that if p : X → S exhibits X as a ﬁbrant object of the contravariant model
category (Set∆)/S, then p is a right ﬁbration. We will prove the converse below (Corollary 2.2.3.12). For
the moment, we will be content with the following weaker result:

Lemma 2.2.3.9. For every integer n ≥ 0, the inclusion i : (Set∆)◦

where F ∈ Set[n]
∆ is a projectively ﬁbrant diagram. Lemma 2.2.3.7 implies that the adjoint map X → U nφ F
is a pointwise equivalence of right ﬁbrations in ∆n, and therefore a homotopy equivalence in RFib(∆n)
(Lemma 2.2.3.6). It now suﬃces to observe that U nφ F ∈ (Set∆)◦

suﬃce to show that φS is an equivalence.

Let U denote the collection of simplicial sets S for which φS is an equivalence. We will show that U
satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 2.2.3.5, and therefore contains every simplicial set S. Conditions (i) and
(ii) are obviously satisﬁed, and condition (iii) follows from Lemma 2.2.3.10 and Proposition A.3.1.10. We

We conclude this section with one more result which will be useful in studying the Joyal model structure
on Set∆. Suppose that f : X → S is any map of simplicial sets, and {s} is a vertex of S. Let Q• denote the
cosimplicial object of Set∆ deﬁned in §2.2.2. Then we have a canonical map

|Xs|Q• ≃ (St{s}Xs)(s) → (StSX)(s).

Proposition 2.2.3.15. Suppose that f : X → S is a right ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then for each vertex
s of S, the canonical map φ : |Xs|Q• → (StSX)(s) is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

Proof. Choose a weak equivalence StSX → F, where F : C[S]op → Set∆ is a projectively ﬁbrant diagram.
Theorem 2.2.1.2 implies that the adjoint map X → U nS(F) is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S.
Applying the “only if” direction of Corollary 2.2.3.12, we conclude that each of the induced maps

Xs → (U nS F)s ≃ SingQ• F(s)

is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes. Using Proposition 2.2.2.9, we deduce that the adjoint map
|Xs|Q• → F(s) is a weak homotopy equivalence. It follows from the two-out-of-three property that φ is also
a weak homotopy equivalence.

2.2.4 The Comparison Theorem

Let S be an ∞-category containing a pair of objects x and y, and let Q• denote the cosimplicial object of
Set∆ described in §2.2.2. We have a canonical map of simplicial sets

Moreover, in the special case where S is the nerve of a ﬁbrant simplicial category C, the composition

f : | HomR

S (x, y)|Q• → MapC[S](x, y).

| HomR

S (x, y)|Q•

f
→ MapC[S](x, y) → MapC(x, y)

can be identiﬁed with the counit map

| SingQ• MapC(x, y)|Q• → MapC(X, Y ),

and is therefore a weak equivalence (Proposition 2.2.2.10). Consequently, we may reformulate Theorem
2.2.0.1 in the following way:

Proposition 2.2.4.1. Let S be an ∞-category containing a pair of objects x and y. Then the natural map

is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets.

f : | HomR

S (x, y)|Q• → MapC[S](x, y)

f ′′ : (StSS/y)(x) → MapC[S](x, y).

| HomR

S (x, y)|Q• ≃ (St{x}S/y ×S {x})(x) → (StSS/y)(y).

Since the projection S/y → S is a right ﬁbration, the map f ′ is a weak homotopy equivalence (Proposition
2.2.3.15). It will therefore suﬃce to show that f ′′ is a weak homotopy equivalence. To see this, we consider
the commutative diagram

It follows that i is a contravariant equivalence in (Set∆)/S
which is right anodyne by Corollary 2.1.2.7.
(Proposition 2.1.4.9), so the map g is a weak homotopy equivalence of simplicial sets. Since the map h is an
isomorphism, the map f ′′ is also a weak homotopy equivalence by virtue of the two-out-of-three property.

2.2.5 The Joyal Model Structure

The category of simplicial sets can be endowed with a model structure for which the ﬁbrant objects are
precisely the ∞-categories. The original construction of this model structure is due to Joyal, who uses
purely combinatorial arguments ([44]). In this section, we will exploit the relationship between simplicial
categories and ∞-categories to give an alternative description of this model structure. Our discussion will
make use of a model structure on the category Cat∆ of simplicial categories, which we review in §A.3.2.

Theorem 2.2.5.1. There exists a left proper, combinatorial model structure on the category of simplicial
sets with the following properties:

(C) A map p : S → S′ of simplicial sets is a coﬁbration if and only if it is a monomorphism.

(W ) A map p : S → S′ is a categorical equivalence if and only if the induced simplicial functor C[S] → C[S′]

is an equivalence of simplicial categories.

Moreover, the adjoint functors (C, N) determine a Quillen equivalence between Set∆ (with the model

structure deﬁned above) and Cat∆.

Our proof will make use of the theory of inner anodyne maps of simplicial sets, which we will study in

detail in §2.3. We ﬁrst establish a simple Lemma.

Lemma 2.2.5.2. Every inner anodyne map f : A → B of simplicial sets is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. It will suﬃce to prove that if f is inner anodyne, then the associated map C[f ] is a trivial coﬁbration
of simplicial categories. The collection of all morphisms f for which this statement holds is weakly saturated
(Deﬁnition A.1.2.2). Consequently, we may assume that f is an inner horn inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n, 0 < i < n.
We now explicitly describe the map C[f ]:

80

'
7
/
• The objects of C[∂ Λn

i ] are the objects of C[∆n]: namely, elements of the linearly ordered set [n] =

{0, . . . , n}.

• For 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, the simplicial set MapC[Λn

i ](j, k) is equal to MapC[∆n](j, k) unless j = 0 and k = n.

In the latter case,

MapC[Λn

i ](j, k) = K ⊆ (∆1)n−1 ≃ MapC[∆n](j, k),

where K is the simplicial subset of the cube (∆1)n−1 obtained by removing the interior and a single
face.

We observe that C[f ] is a pushout of the inclusion EK ⊆ E(∆1)n−1 (see §A.3.2 for an explanation of this
notation). It now suﬃces to observe that the inclusion K ⊆ (∆1)n−1 is trivial ﬁbration of simplicial sets
(with respect to the usual model structure on Set∆).

Proof of Theorem 2.2.5.1. We ﬁrst show that C carries coﬁbrations of simplicial sets to coﬁbrations of simpli-
cial categories. Since the class of all coﬁbrations of simplicial sets is generated by the inclusions ∂ ∆n ⊆ ∆n,
it suﬃces to show that each map C[∂ ∆n] → C[∆n] is a coﬁbration of simplicial categories. If n = 0, then the
inclusion C[∂ ∆n] ⊆ C[∆n] is isomorphic to the inclusion ∅ ⊆ ∗ of simplicial categories, which is a coﬁbration.
In the case where n > 0, we make use of the following explicit description of C[∂ ∆n] as a subcategory of
C[∆n]:

• The objects of C[∂ ∆n] are the objects of C[∆n]: namely, elements of the linearly ordered set [n] =

{0, . . . , n}.

• For 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n, the simplicial set HomC[∂ ∆n](j, k) is equal to HomC[∆n](j, k) unless j = 0 and

k = n. In the latter case, HomC[∂ ∆n](j, k) consists of the boundary of the cube

(∆1)n−1 ≃ HomC[∆n](j, k).

In particular, the inclusion C[∂ ∆n] ⊆ C[∆n] is a pushout of the inclusion E∂(∆1)n−1 ⊆ E(∆1)n−1, which is

a coﬁbration of simplicial categories (see §A.3.2 for an explanation of our notation).

We now declare that a map p : S → S′ of simplicial sets is a categorical ﬁbration if it has the right lifting
property with respect to all maps which are coﬁbrations and categorical equivalences. We now claim that
the coﬁbrations, categorical equivalences, and categorical ﬁbrations determine a left proper, combinatorial
model structure on Set∆. To prove this, it will suﬃce to show that the hypotheses of Proposition A.2.6.13
are satisﬁed:

(1) The class of categorical equivalences in Set∆ is perfect. This follows from Corollary A.2.6.12, since
the functor C preserves ﬁltered colimits, and the class of equivalences between simplicial categories is
perfect.

(2) The class of categorical equivalences is stable under pushouts by coﬁbrations. Since C preserves coﬁ-

brations, this follows immediately from the left-properness of Cat∆.

(3) A map of simplicial sets which has the right lifting property with respect to all coﬁbrations is a
In other words, we must show that if p : S → S′ is a trivial ﬁbration of
categorical equivalence.
simplicial sets, then the induced functor C[p] : C[S] → C[S′] is an equivalence of simplicial categories.
Since p is a trivial ﬁbration, it admits a section s : S′ → S. It is clear that C[p] ◦ C[s] is the identity; it
therefore suﬃces to show that

C[s] ◦ C[p] : C[S] → C[S]

is homotopic to the identity.

Let K denote the simplicial set MapS′(S, S). Then K is a contractible Kan complex, containing points
x and y which classify s◦p and idS. We note the existence of a natural “evaluation map” e : K ×S → S,

81

such that s ◦ p = e ◦ ({x} × idS), idS = e ◦ ({y} × idS). It therefore suﬃces to show that the functor
C carries {x} × idS and {y} × idS into homotopic morphisms. Since both of these maps section the
projection K × S → S, it suﬃces to show that the projection C[K × S] → C[S] is an equivalence of
simplicial categories. Replacing S by S × K and S′ by S, we are reduced to the special case where
S = S′ × K and K is a contractible Kan complex.
By the small object argument, we can ﬁnd an inner anodyne map S′ → V , where V is an ∞-category.
The corresponding map S′ × K → V × K is also inner anodyne (Proposition 2.3.2.1), so the maps
C[S′] → C[V ] and C[S′ × K] → C[V × K] are both trivial coﬁbrations (Lemma 2.2.5.2). It follows
that we are free to replace S′ by V and S by V × K. In other words, we may suppose that S′ is
an ∞-category (and now we will have no further need of the assumption that S is isomorphic to the
product S′ × K).
Since p is surjective on vertices, it is clear that C[p] is essentially surjective. It therefore suﬃces to
show that for every pair of vertices x, y ∈ S0, the induced map of simplicial sets MapC[S](x, y) →
MapC[S′](p(x), p(y)) is a weak homotopy equivalence. Using Propositions 2.2.4.1 and 2.2.2.7, it suﬃces
to show that the map HomR
S′ (p(x), p(y)) is a weak homotopy equivalence. This map is
obviously a trivial ﬁbration if p is a trivial ﬁbration.

S (x, y) → HomR

By construction, the functor C preserves weak equivalences. We veriﬁed above that C preserves coﬁbra-

tions as well. It follows that the adjoint functors (C, N) determine a Quillen adjunction

Set∆

C

N

/ Cat∆

.

To complete the proof, we wish to show that this Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence. According to
Proposition A.2.5.1, we must show that for every simplicial set S and every ﬁbrant simplicial category C, a
map

is a categorical equivalence if and only if the adjoint map

u : S → N(C)

v : C[S] → C

is an equivalence of simplicial categories. We observe that v factors as a composition

C[S]

C[u]
→ C[N(C)] w→ C .

By deﬁnition, u is a categorical equivalence if and only if C[u] is an equivalence of simplicial categories.
We now conclude by observing that the counit map w is an equivalence of simplicial categories (Theorem
2.2.0.1).

We now establish a few pleasant properties enjoyed by the Joyal model structure on Set∆. We ﬁrst note
that every object of Set∆ is coﬁbrant; in particular, the Joyal model structure is left proper (Proposition
A.2.4.2).

Remark 2.2.5.3. The Joyal model structure is not right proper. To see this, we note that the inclusion
Λ2
1 ⊆ ∆2 is a categorical equivalence, but it does not remain so after pulling back via the ﬁbration ∆{0,2} ⊆
∆2.

Corollary 2.2.5.4. Let f : A → B be a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets, and K an arbitrary
simplicial set. Then the induced map A × K → B × K is a categorical equivalence.

82

/
o
o
Proof. Choose an inner anodyne map B → Q, where Q is an ∞-category. Then B × K → Q × K is also inner
anodyne, hence a categorical equivalence (Lemma 2.2.5.2). It therefore suﬃces to prove that A× K → Q × K
is a categorical equivalence. In other words, we may suppose to begin with that B is an ∞-category.

Now choose a factorization A

f ′′
→ B where f ′ is an inner anodyne map and f ′′ is an inner ﬁbration.
Since B is an ∞-category, R is an ∞-category. The map A × K → R × K is inner anodyne (since f ′ is), and
therefore a categorical equivalence; consequently, it suﬃces to show that R × K → B × K is a categorical
equivalence. In other words, we may reduce to the case where A is also an ∞-category.

f ′
→ R

Choose an inner anodyne map K → S, where S is an ∞-category. Then A×K → A×S and B×K → B×S
are both inner anodyne, and therefore categorical equivalences. Thus, to prove that A × K → B × K is a
categorical equivalence, it suﬃces to show that A × S → B × S is a categorical equivalence. In other words,
we may suppose that K is an ∞-category.

Since A and K are ∞-categories, h(A × K ) ≃ hA × hK ; similarly h(B × K ) ≃ hB × hK . It follows that
A × K → B × K is essentially surjective, provided that f is essentially surjective. Furthermore, for any pair
of vertices (a, k), (a′, k′) ∈ (A × K)0, we have

HomR

A×K((a, k), (a′, k′)) ≃ HomR

A(a, a′) × HomR

K(k, k′)

HomR

B×K((f (a), k), (f (a′), k′)) ≃ HomR

B(f (a), f (a′)) × HomR

K(k, k′).

It follows that A × K → B × K is fully faithful, provided that f is fully faithful, which completes the
proof.

Remark 2.2.5.5. Since every inner anodyne map is a categorical equivalence, it follows that every categor-
ical ﬁbration p : X → S is a inner ﬁbration (see Deﬁnition 2.0.0.3). The converse is false in general; however,
it is true when S is a point. In other words, the ﬁbrant objects for the Joyal model structure on Set∆ are
precisely the ∞-categories. The proof will be given in §2.4.6, as Theorem 2.4.6.1. We will assume this result
for the remainder of the section. No circularity will result from this, since the proof of Theorem 2.4.6.1 will
not use any of the results proven below.

The functor C[•] does not generally commute with products. However, Corollary 2.2.5.4 implies that C

commutes with products in the following weak sense:

Corollary 2.2.5.6. Let S and S′ be simplicial sets. The natural map

C[S × S′] → C[S] × C[S′]

is an equivalence of simplicial categories.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that there are ﬁbrant simplicial categories C, C′ with S = N(C), S′ = N(C′). In this
case, we have a diagram

C[S × S′]

f
→ C[S] × C[S′]

g
→ C × C′ .

By the two-out-of-three property, it suﬃces to show that g and g ◦f are equivalences. Both of these assertions
follow immediately from the fact that the counit map C[N(D)] → D is an equivalence for any ﬁbrant simplicial
category D (Theorem 2.2.5.1).

In the general case, we may choose categorical equivalences S → T , S′ → T ′, where T and T ′ are nerves
of ﬁbrant simplicial categories. Since S × S′ → T × T ′ is a categorical equivalence, we reduce to the case
treated above.

Let K be a ﬁxed simplicial set, and let C be a simplicial set which is ﬁbrant with respect to the Joyal
model structure. Then C has the extension property with respect to all inner anodyne maps, and is therefore
a ∞-category. It follows that Fun(K, C) is also an ∞-category. We might call two morphisms f, g : K → C

83

homotopic if they are equivalent when viewed as objects of Fun(K, C). On the other hand, the general theory
of model categories furnishes another notion of homotopy: f and g are left homotopic if the map

can be extended over a mapping cylinder I for K.

K → C

Proposition 2.2.5.7. Let C be a ∞-category and K an arbitrary simplicial set. A pair of morphisms
f, g : K → C are homotopic if and only if they are left-homotopic.

Proof. Choose a contractible Kan complex S containing a pair of distinct vertices, x and y. We note that
the inclusion

K

K ≃ K × {x, y} ⊆ K × S

g : K

exhibits K × S as a mapping cylinder for K. It follows that f and g are left homotopic if and only if the
K → C admits an extension to K × S. In other words, f and g are left homotopic if and
map f
only if there exists a map h : S → CK such that h(x) = f and h(y) = g. We note that any such map factors
through Z, where Z ⊆ Fun(K, C) is the largest Kan complex contained in CK. Now, by classical homotopy
theory, the map h exists if and only if f and g belong to the same path component of Z. It is clear that this
holds if and only if f and g are equivalent when viewed as objects of the ∞-category Fun(K, C).

We are now in a position to prove Proposition 1.2.7.3, which was asserted without proof in §1.2.7. We

ﬁrst recall the statement.

Proposition. Let K be an arbitrary simplicial set.

(1) For every ∞-category C, the simplicial set Fun(K, C) is an ∞-category.

(2) Let C → D be a categorical equivalence of ∞-categories. Then the induced map Fun(K, C) → Fun(K, D)

is a categorical equivalence.

(3) Let C be an ∞-category, and K → K ′ a categorical equivalence of simplicial sets. Then the induced

map Fun(K ′, C) → Fun(K, C) is a categorical equivalence.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (1). To show that Fun(K, C) is an ∞-category, it suﬃces to show that it has the
extension property with respect to every inner anodyne inclusion A ⊆ B. This is equivalent to the assertion
that C has the right lifting property with respect to the inclusion A × K ⊆ B × K. But C is an ∞-category
and A × K ⊆ B × K is inner anodyne (Corollary 2.3.2.4).

Let hSet∆ denote the homotopy category of Set∆, taken with respect to the Joyal model structure. For
each simplicial set X, we let [X] denote the same simplicial set, considered as an object of hSet∆. For every
pair of objects X, Y ∈ Set∆, [X × Y ] is a product for [X] and [Y ] in hSet∆. This is a general fact when X
and Y are ﬁbrant; in the general case, we choose ﬁbrant replacements X → X ′, Y → Y ′, and apply the fact
that the canonical map X × Y → X ′ × Y ′ is a categorical equivalence (Proposition 2.2.5.7).

If C is an ∞-category, then C is a ﬁbrant object of Set∆ (Theorem 2.4.6.1). Proposition 2.2.5.7 allows us
to identify HomhSet∆([X], [C]) with the set of equivalence classes of objects in the ∞-category Fun(X, C). In
particular, we have a canonical bijections

HomhSet∆([X] × [K], [C]) ≃ HomhSet∆([X × K], [C]) ≃ HomhSet∆([X], [Fun(K, C)]).
It follows that [Fun(K, C)] is determined up to canonical isomorphism by [K] and [C] (more precisely, it is
an exponential [C][K] in the homotopy category hSet∆), which proves (2) and (3).

Our description of the Joyal model structure on Set∆ is diﬀerent from the deﬁnition given in [44]. Namely,
Joyal deﬁnes a map f : A → B to be a weak categorical equivalence if, for every ∞-category C, the induced
map

hFun(B , C) → hFun(A, C)

is an equivalence (of ordinary categories). To prove that our deﬁnition agrees with his, it will suﬃce to prove
the following.

84

Proposition 2.2.5.8. Let f : A → B be a map of simplicial sets. Then f is a categorical equivalence if and
only if it is a weak categorical equivalence.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that f is a categorical equivalence. If C is an arbitrary ∞-category, Proposition 1.2.7.3
implies that the induced map Fun(B, C) → Fun(A, C) is a categorical equivalence, so that hFun(B , C) →
hFun(A, C) is an equivalence of categories. This proves that f is a weak categorical equivalence.

Conversely, suppose that f is a weak categorical equivalence. We wish to show that f induces an
isomorphism in the homotopy category of Set∆ with respect to the Joyal model structure. It will suﬃce
to show that for any ﬁbrant object C, f induces a bijection [B, C] → [A, C], where [X, C] denotes the set
of homotopy classes of maps from X to C. By Proposition 2.2.5.7, [X, C] may be identiﬁed with the set
of isomorphism classes of objects in the category hFun(X , C). By assumption, f induces an equivalence of
categories hFun(B , C) → hFun(A, C), and therefore a bijection on isomorphism classes of objects.

Remark 2.2.5.9. The proof of Proposition 1.2.7.3 makes use of Theorem 2.4.6.1, which asserts that the
(categorically) ﬁbrant objects of Set∆ are precisely the ∞-categories. Joyal proves the analogous assertion
for his model structure in [44]. We remark that one cannot formally deduce Theorem 2.4.6.1 from Joyal’s
result, since we need Theorem 2.4.6.1 to prove that Joyal’s model structure coincides with the one we have
deﬁned above. On the other hand, our approach does give a new proof of Joyal’s theorem.

Remark 2.2.5.10. Proposition 2.2.5.8 permits us to deﬁne the Joyal model structure without reference to
the theory of simplicial categories (this is Joyal’s original point of view [44]). Our approach is less elegant,
but allows us to easily compare the theory of ∞-categories with other models of higher category theory, such
as simplicial categories. There is another approach to obtaining comparison results, due to To¨en. In [76], he
shows that if C is a model category equipped with a cosimplicial object C• satisfying certain conditions, then
C is (canonically) Quillen equivalent to Rezk’s category of complete Segal spaces. To¨en’s theorem applies in
particular when C is the category of simplicial sets, and C• is the “standard simplex” Cn = ∆n. In fact,
Set∆ is in some sense universal with respect to this property, since it is generated by C• under colimits and
the class of categorical equivalences is dictated by To¨en’s axioms. We refer the reader to [76] for details.

2.3

Inner Fibrations

In this section, we will study the theory of inner ﬁbrations between simplicial sets. The meaning of this notion
is somewhat diﬃcult to motivate, because it has no counterpart in classical category theory: Proposition
1.1.2.2 implies that every functor between ordinary categories C → D induces an inner ﬁbration of nerves
N(C) → N(D).

In the case where S is a point, a map p : X → S is an inner ﬁbration if and only if X is an ∞-category.

Moreover, the class of inner ﬁbrations is stable under base change: if

X ′

p′

S′

/ X

p

/ S

is a pullback diagram of simplicial sets and p is an inner ﬁbration, then so is p′. It follows that if p : X → S
is an arbitrary inner ﬁbration, then each ﬁber Xs = X ×S {s} is an ∞-category. We may therefore think of
p as encoding a family of ∞-categories parametrized by S. However, the ﬁbers Xs depend functorially on s
only in a very weak sense.
Example 2.3.0.1. Let F : C → C′ be a functor between ordinary categories. Then the map N(C) → N(C′) is
an inner ﬁbration. Yet the ﬁbers N(C)C = N(C ×C′{C}) and N(C)D = N(C ×C′ {D}) over objects C, D ∈ C′
can have wildly diﬀerent properties, even if C and D are isomorphic objects of C′.

In order to describe how the diﬀerent ﬁbers of an inner ﬁbration are related to one another, we will intro-
duce the notion of a correspondence between ∞-categories. We review the classical theory of correspondences
in §2.3.1, and explain how to generalize this theory to the ∞-categorical setting.

In §2.3.2, we will prove that the class of inner anodyne maps is stable under smash products with arbitrary
coﬁbrations between simplicial sets. As a consequence, we will deduce that the class of inner ﬁbrations (and
hence the class of ∞-categories) is stable under the formation of mapping spaces.

In §2.3.3, we will study the theory of minimal inner ﬁbrations, a generalization of Quillen’s theory
of minimal Kan ﬁbrations.
In particular, we will deﬁne a class of minimal ∞-categories and show that
every ∞-category C is (categorically) equivalent to a minimal ∞-category C′, where C′ is well-deﬁned up
to (noncanonical) isomorphism. We will apply this theory in §2.3.4 to develop a theory of n-categories for
n < ∞.

2.3.1 Correspondences
Let C and C′ be categories. A correspondence from C to C′ is a functor

M : Cop × C′ → Set .

If M is a correspondence from C to C′, we can deﬁne a new category C ⋆M C′ as follows. An object of C ⋆M C′
is either an object of C or an object of C′. For morphisms, we take

HomC(X, Y )
HomC′(X, Y )
M (X, Y )
∅

if X, Y ∈ C
if X, Y ∈ C′
if X ∈ C, Y ∈ C′
if X ∈ C′, Y ∈ C .

HomC ⋆M C′(X, Y ) = 



Composition of morphisms is deﬁned in the obvious way, using the composition laws in C and C′, and the
functoriality of M (X, Y ) in X and Y .

Remark 2.3.1.1. In the special case where F : Cop × C′ → Set is the constant functor taking the value ∗,
the category C ⋆F C′ coincides with the ordinary join C ⋆ C′.

86

(cid:15)
(cid:15)

For any correspondence M : C → C′, there is an obvious functor F : C ⋆M C′ → [1] (here [1] denotes
the linearly ordered set {0, 1}, regarded as a category in the obvious way), uniquely determined by the
condition that F −1{0} = C and F −1{1} = C′. Conversely, given any category M equipped with a functor
F : M → [1], we can deﬁne C = F −1{0}, C′ = F −1{1}, and a correspondence M : C → C′ by the formula
M (X, Y ) = HomM(X, Y ). We may summarize the situation as follows:

Fact 2.3.1.2. Giving a pair of categories C, C′ and a correspondence between them is equivalent to giving a
category M equipped with a functor M → [1].

Given this reformulation, it is clear how to generalize the notion of a correspondence to the ∞-categorical

setting.

Deﬁnition 2.3.1.3. Let C and C′ be ∞-categories. A correspondence from C to C′ is a ∞-category M
equipped with a map F : M → ∆1 and identiﬁcations C ≃ F −1{0}, C′ ≃ F −1{1}.

Remark 2.3.1.4. Let C and C′ be ∞-categories. Fact 2.3.1.2 generalizes to the ∞-categorical setting in
the following way: there is a canonical bijection between equivalence classes of correspondences from C to
C′ and equivalence classes of functors Cop × C′ → S, where S denotes the ∞-category of spaces. In fact, it is
possible to prove a more precise result (a Quillen equivalence between certain model categories), but we will
not need this.

To understand the relevance of Deﬁnition 2.3.1.3, we note the following:

Proposition 2.3.1.5. Let C be an ordinary category, and let p : X → N(C) be a map of simplicial sets.
Then p is an inner ﬁbration if and only if X is an ∞-category.

Proof. This follows from the fact that any map Λn

i → N(C), 0 < i < n, admits a unique extension to ∆n.

It follows readily from the deﬁnition that an arbitrary map of simplicial sets p : X → S is an inner
ﬁbration if and only if the ﬁber of p over any simplex of S is an ∞-category. In particular, an inner ﬁbration
p associates to each vertex s of S an ∞-category Xs, and to each edge f : s → s′ in S a correspondence
between the ∞-categories Xs and Xs′ . Higher dimensional simplices give rise to what may be thought of as
compatible “chains” of correspondences.

Roughly speaking, we might think of an inner ﬁbration p : X → S as a functor from S into some
kind of ∞-category of ∞-categories, where the morphisms are given by correspondences. However, this
description is not quite accurate, since the correspondences are required to “compose” only in a weak sense.
To understand the issue, let us return to the setting of ordinary categories. If C and C′ are two categories,
then the correspondences from C to C′ themselves constitute a category, which we may denote by M (C, C′).
There is a natural “composition” deﬁned on correspondences. If we view an object F ∈ M (C, C′) as a functor
Cop × C′ → Set, and G ∈ M (C′, C′′), then we can deﬁne (G ◦ F )(C, C′′) to be the coend

F (C, C′) × G(C′, C′′).

ZC ′∈C′

If we view F as determining a category C ⋆F C′ and G as determining a category C′ ⋆G C′′, then C ⋆G◦F C′′

is obtained by forming the pushout

(C ⋆F C′)

(C′ ⋆G C′′)

C′
a

and then discarding the objects of C′.

Now, giving a category equipped with a functor to [2] is equivalent to giving a triple of categories C, C′,
C′′, together with correspondences F ∈ M (C, C′), G ∈ M (C′, C′′), H ∈ M (C, C′′) and a map α : G ◦ F → H.
But the map α need not be an isomorphism. Consequently, the above data cannot literally be interpreted
as a functor from [2] into a category (or even a higher category) in which the morphisms are given by
correspondences.

87

If C and C′ are categories, then a correspondence from C to C′ can be regarded as a kind of generalized
functor from C to C′. More speciﬁcally, for any functor f : C → C′, we can deﬁne a correspondence Mf by
the formula

Mf (X, Y ) = HomC′ (f (X), Y ).
This construction gives a fully faithful embedding MapCat(C, C′) → M (C, C′). Similarly, any functor g :
C′ → C determines a correspondence Mg given by the formula Mg(X, Y ) = HomC(X, g(Y )); we observe that
Mf ≃ Mg if and only if the functors f and g are adjoint to one another.

If an inner ﬁbration p : X → S corresponds to a “functor” from S to a higher category of ∞-categories
with morphisms given by correspondences, then some special class of inner ﬁbrations should correspond to
functors from S into an ∞-category of ∞-categories with morphisms given by actual functors. This is indeed
the case, and the appropriate notion is that of a (co)Cartesian ﬁbration which we will study in §2.4.

2.3.2 Stability Properties of Inner Fibrations

Let C be an ∞-category and K an arbitrary simplicial set.
In §1.2.7, we asserted that Fun(K, C) is an
∞-category (Proposition 1.2.7.3). In the course of the proof, we invoked certain stability properties of the
class of inner anodyne maps. The goal of this section is to establish the required properties, and deduce
some of their consequences. Our main result is the following analogue of Proposition 2.1.2.6:

Proposition 2.3.2.1 (Joyal [44]). The following collections all generate the same class of morphisms of
Set∆:

(1) The collection A1 of all horn inclusions Λn

i ⊆ ∆n, 0 < i < n.

(2) The collection A2 of all inclusions

(∆m × Λ2
1)

(∂ ∆m × ∆2) ⊆ ∆m × ∆2.

a∂ ∆m×Λ2

1

(3) The collection A3 of all inclusions

(S′ × Λ2
1)

(S × ∆2) ⊆ S′ × ∆2,

aS×Λ2

1

where S ⊆ S′.

Proof. We will employ the strategy that we used to prove Proposition 2.1.2.6, though the details are slightly
more complicated. Working cell-by-cell, we conclude that every morphism in A3 belongs to the weakly
saturated class of morphisms generated by A2. We next show that every morphism in A1 is a retract of a
morphism belonging to A3. More precisely, we will show that for 0 < i < n, the inclusion Λn
i ⊆ ∆n is a
retract of the inclusion

(∆n × Λ2
1)

(Λn

i × ∆2) ⊆ ∆n × ∆2.

i ×Λ2
aΛn
1

To prove this, we embed ∆n into ∆n × ∆2 via the map of partially ordered sets s : [n] → [n] × [2] given by

(j, 0)
(j, 1)
(j, 2)

if j < i
if j = i
if j > i.

s(j) = 


and consider the retraction ∆n × ∆2 → ∆n given by the map

j
r(j, k) = 



if j < i, k = 0
if j > i, k = 2
otherwise.

We now show that every morphism in A2 is inner anodyne (that is, it lies in the weakly saturated class of
morphisms generated by A1). Choose m ≥ 0. For each 0 ≤ i ≤ j < m, we let σij denote the (m + 1)-simplex
of ∆m × ∆2 corresponding to the map



fij : [m + 1] → [m] × [2]

fij(k) = 

(k, 0)
(k − 1, 1)
(k − 1, 2)

if 0 ≤ k ≤ i
if i + 1 ≤ k ≤ j + 1
if j + 2 ≤ k ≤ m + 1.

For each 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m, we let τij denote the (m + 2)-simplex of ∆m × ∆2 corresponding to the map



gij : [m + 2] → [m] × [2]

gij(k) = 

(k, 0)
(k − 1, 1)

if j + 2 ≤ k ≤ m + 2.

Let X(0) = (∆m × Λ2
1)

∂ ∆m×Λ2
1

(∂ ∆m × ∆2). For 0 ≤ j < m, we let



`

X(j + 1) = X(j) ∪ σ0j ∪ . . . ∪ σjj .

We have a chain of inclusions

X(j) ⊆ X(j) ∪ σ0j ⊆ . . . ⊂ X(j) ∪ σ0j ∪ . . . ∪ σjj = X(j + 1),

each of which is a pushout of a morphism in A1 and therefore inner anodyne. It follows that each inclusion
X(j) ⊆ X(j + 1) is inner-anodyne. Set Y (0) = X(m), so that the inclusion X(0) ⊆ Y (0) is inner anodyne.
We now set Y (j + 1) = Y (j) ∪ τ0j ∪ . . . ∪ τjj for 0 ≤ j ≤ m. As before, we have a chain of inclusions

Y (j) ⊆ Y (j) ∪ τ0j ⊆ . . . ⊆ Yj ∪ τ0j ∪ . . . ∪ τjj = Y (j + 1)

each of which is a pushout of a morphism belonging to A1. It follows that each inclusion Y (j) ⊆ Y (j + 1)
is inner anodyne. By transitivity, we conclude that the inclusion X(0) ⊆ Y (m + 2) is inner anodyne. We
conclude the proof by observing that Y (m + 2) = ∆m × ∆2.

Corollary 2.3.2.2 (Joyal [44]). A simplicial set C is an ∞-category if and only if the restriction map

is a trivial ﬁbration.

Fun(∆2, C) → Fun(Λ2

1, C)

Proof. By Proposition 2.3.2.1, C → ∗ is an inner ﬁbration if and only if S has the extension property with
respect to each of the inclusions in the class A2.

Remark 2.3.2.3. In §1.1.2, we asserted that the main function of the weak Kan condition on a simplicial
set C is that it allows us to compose the edges of C. We can regard Corollary 2.3.2.2 as an aﬃrmation of this
philosophy: the class of ∞-categories C is characterized by the requirement that one can compose morphisms
in C, and the composition is well-deﬁned up to a contractible space of choices.

89

Corollary 2.3.2.4 (Joyal [44]). Let i : A → A′ be an inner anodyne map of simplicial sets, and let j : B → B′
be a coﬁbration. Then the induced map

is inner anodyne.

(A × B′)

(A′ × B) → A′ × B′

aA×B

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.3.2.1, which characterizes the class of inner anodyne
maps as the class generated by A3 (which is stable under smash products with any coﬁbration).

Corollary 2.3.2.5 (Joyal [44]). Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration, and let i : A → B be any coﬁbration
of simplicial sets. Then the induced map q : X B → X A ×SA SB is an inner ﬁbration. If i is inner anodyne,
then q is a trivial ﬁbration. In particular, if X is a ∞-category, then so is X B for any simplicial set B.

2.3.3 Minimal Fibrations

One of the aims of homotopy theory is to understand the classiﬁcation of spaces up to homotopy equivalence.
In the setting of simplicial sets, this problem admits an attractive formulation in terms of Quillen’s theory
of minimal Kan complexes. Every Kan complex X is homotopy equivalent to a minimal Kan complex, and
a map X → Y of minimal Kan complexes is a homotopy equivalence if and only if it is an isomorphism.
Consequently, the classiﬁcation of Kan complexes up to homotopy equivalence is equivalent to the classi-
ﬁcation of minimal Kan complexes up to isomorphism. Of course, in practical terms, this is not of much
use for solving the classiﬁcation problem. Nevertheless, the theory of minimal Kan complexes (and, more
generally, minimal Kan ﬁbrations) is a useful tool in the homotopy theory of simplicial sets. The purpose
of this section is to describe a generalization of the theory of minimal models, in which Kan ﬁbrations are
replaced by inner ﬁbrations. An exposition of this theory can also be found in [44].

We begin by introducing a bit of terminology. Suppose given a commutative diagram

u /
/ X
>~
~

p

A

i

B

~

~
v

S

of simplicial sets where p is an inner ﬁbration, and suppose also that we have a pair f, f ′ : B → X of
candidates for the dotted arrow which render the diagram commutative. We will say that f and f ′ are
homotopic relative to A over S if they are equivalent when viewed as objects in the ∞-category given by the
ﬁber of the map

X B → X A ×SA SB.
Equivalently, f and f ′ are homotopic relative to A over S if there exists a map F : B × ∆1 → X such that
F |B × {0} = f , F |B × {1} = f ′, p ◦ F = v ◦ πB, F ◦ (i × id∆1) = u ◦ πA, and F |{b} × ∆1 is an equivalence
in the ∞-category Xv(b) for every vertex b of B.

Deﬁnition 2.3.3.1. Let p : X → S be an inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. We will say that p is minimal if
f = f ′ for every pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆n → X which are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n over S.

We will say that an ∞-category C is minimal if the associated inner ﬁbration C → ∗ is minimal.

Remark 2.3.3.2. In the case where p is a Kan ﬁbration, Deﬁnition 2.3.3.1 recovers the usual notion of a
minimal Kan ﬁbration. We refer the reader to [32] for a discussion of minimal ﬁbrations in this more classical
setting.

Remark 2.3.3.3. Let p : X → ∆n be an inner ﬁbration. Then X is an ∞-category. Moreover, p is a
minimal inner ﬁbration if and only if X is a minimal ∞-category. This follows from the observation that
for any pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆m → X, a homotopy between f and f ′ is automatically compatible with the
projection to ∆n.

Remark 2.3.3.4. If p : X → S is a minimal inner ﬁbration and T → S is an arbitrary map of simplicial
sets, then the induced map XT = X ×S T → T is a minimal inner ﬁbration. Conversely, if p : X → S is an
inner ﬁbration and if X ×S ∆n → ∆n is minimal for every map σ : ∆n → S, then p is minimal. Consequently,
for many purposes the study of minimal inner ﬁbrations reduces to the study of minimal ∞-categories.

Lemma 2.3.3.5. Let C be a minimal ∞-category, and let f : C → C be a functor which is homotopic to the
identity. Then f is a monomorphism of simplicial sets.

Proof. Choose a homotopy h : ∆1 × C → C from idC to f . We prove by induction on n that the map f
induces an injection from the set of n-simplices of C to itself. Let σ, σ′ : ∆n → C be such that f ◦ σ = f ◦ σ′.
By the inductive hypothesis, we deduce that σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n = σ0. Consider the diagram

(∆2 × ∂ ∆n)

2 × ∆n is given by amalgamating h ◦ (id∆1 ×σ) with h ◦ (id∆1 ×σ′), and G0|∆2 × ∂ ∆n is given

∆2 × ∂ ∆n → ∆1 × ∂ ∆n σ0→ ∆1 × C h→ C .
Since h|∆1 × {X} is an equivalence for every object X ∈ C, Proposition 2.4.1.8 implies the existence of the
map G indicated in the diagram. The restriction G|∆1 × ∆n is a homotopy between σ and σ′ relative to
∂ ∆n. Since C is minimal, we deduce that σ = σ′.

Lemma 2.3.3.6. Let C be a minimal ∞-category, and let f : C → C be a functor which is homotopic to the
identity. Then f is an isomorphism of simplicial sets.

Proof. Choose a homotopy h : ∆1 × C → C from idC to f . We prove by induction on n that the map f
induces a bijection from the set of n-simplices of C to itself. The injectivity follows from Lemma 2.3.3.5, so
it will suﬃce to prove the surjectivity. Choose an n-simplex σ : ∆n → C. By the inductive hypothesis, we
may suppose that σ| ∂ ∆n = f ◦ σ′

0 : ∂ ∆n → C. Consider the diagram

indicated in the diagram follows from Proposition 2.4.1.8; if n = 0 it is obvious. Now let σ′ = G|{0} × ∆n.
To complete the proof, it will suﬃce to show that f ◦ σ′ = σ.

The existence of the dotted arrow H follows once again from Proposition 2.4.1.8. The restriction H|∆{1,2} ×
∆n is a homotopy from f ◦ σ′ to σ relative to ∂ ∆n. Since C is minimal, we conclude that f ◦ σ′ = σ as
desired.

Proposition 2.3.3.7. Let f : C → D be an equivalence of minimal ∞-categories. Then f is an isomorphism.

Proof. Since f is a categorical equivalence, it admits a homotopy inverse g : D → C. Now apply Lemma
2.3.3.6 to the compositions f ◦ g and g ◦ f .

The following result guarantees a good supply of minimal ∞-categories:

Proposition 2.3.3.8. Let p : X → S be a inner ﬁbration of simplicial sets. Then there exists a retraction
r : X → X onto a simplicial subset X ′ ⊆ X with the following properties:

(1) The restriction p|X ′ : X ′ → S is a minimal inner ﬁbration.

(2) The retraction r is compatible with the projection p, in the sense that p ◦ r = p.

(3) The map r is homotopic over S to idX relative to X ′.

(4) For every map of simplicial sets T → S, the induced inclusion X ′ ×S T ⊆ X ×S T is a categorical

equivalence.

Proof. For every n ≥ 0, we deﬁne a relation on the set of n-simplices of X: given two simplices σ, σ′ :
∆n → X, we will write σ ∼ σ′ if σ is homotopic to σ′ relative to ∂ ∆n. We note that σ ∼ σ′ if and only if
σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n and σ is equivalent to σ′ where both are viewed as objects in the ∞-category given by a
ﬁber of the map

X ∆n

→ X ∂ ∆n

×S∂ ∆n S∆n

.

Consequently, ∼ is an equivalence relation.

Suppose that σ and σ′ are both degenerate, and σ ∼ σ′. From the equality σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n we deduce
that σ = σ′. Consequently, there is at most one degenerate n-simplex of X in each ∼-class. Let Y (n) ⊆ Xn
denote a set of representatives for the ∼-classes of n-simplices in X, which contains all degenerate simplices.
We now deﬁne the simplicial subset X ′ ⊆ X recursively as follows: an n-simplex σ : ∆n → X belongs to X ′
if σ ∈ Y (n) and σ| ∂ ∆n factors through X ′.

Let us now prove (1). To show that p|X ′ is an inner ﬁbration, it suﬃces to prove that every lifting

problem of the form

Λn
i

|

∆n

X ′

=|

s

|

σ
|

/ S

with 0 < i < n has a solution f in X ′. Since p is an inner ﬁbration, this lifting problem has a solution
0 = diσ : ∆n−1 → X be the induced map. Then
σ′ : ∆n → X in the original simplicial set X. Let σ′
0 is homotopic over S, relative to ∂ ∆n−1 to some map
σ′
0| ∂ ∆n−1 factors through X ′. Consequently, σ′
σ0 : ∆n−1 → X ′. Let g0 : ∆1 × ∆n−1 → X be a homotopy from σ′
0 to σ0, and let g1 : ∆1 × ∂ ∆n → X be
the result of amalgamating g0 with the identity homotopy from s to itself. Let σ1 = g1|{1} × ∂ ∆n. Using
Proposition 2.4.1.8, we deduce that g1 extends to a homotopy from σ′ to some other map σ′′ : ∆n → X
with σ′′| ∂ ∆n = σ1. It follows that σ′′ is homotopic over S relative to ∂ ∆n to a map σ : ∆n → X with the
desired properties. This proves that p|X ′ is an inner ﬁbration. It is immediate from the construction that
p|X ′ is minimal.

We now verify (2) and (3) by constructing a map h : X × ∆1 → X such that h|X × {0} is the identity,
h|X × {1} is a retraction r : X → X with image X ′, and h is a homotopy over S and relative to X ′. Choose
an exhaustion of X by a transﬁnite sequence of simplicial subsets

X ′ = X 0 ⊆ X 1 ⊆ . . .

by induction on α. By the inductive hypothesis, we may suppose that we have already deﬁned h<α =
∂ ∆n ∆n corresponding
h|X <α × ∆1. If X = X <α, then we are done. Otherwise, we can write X α = X <α
to some nondegenerate simplex τ : ∆n → X, and it suﬃces to deﬁne hα|∆n × ∆1. If τ factors through X ′,
we deﬁne hα|∆n × ∆1 to be the composition

Otherwise, we use Proposition 2.4.1.8 to deduce the existence of the dotted arrow h′ in the diagram

∆n × ∆1 → ∆n σ→ X.

Let τ ′ = h′|∆n × {1}. Then τ ′| ∂ ∆n factors through X ′. It follows that there is a homotopy h′′ : ∆n ×
∆{1,2} → X from τ ′ to τ ′′, which is over S and relative to ∂ ∆n, and such that τ ′′ factors through X ′. Now
consider the diagram

∂ ∆n × ∆2 → ∂ ∆n × ∆1 h<α→ X.

Using the fact that p is an inner ﬁbration, we deduce that there exists a dotted arrow H rendering the
diagram commutative. We may now deﬁne hα|∆n × ∆1 = H|∆n × ∆{0,2}; it is easy to see that this extension
has all the desired properties.

We now prove (4). Using Proposition 3.2.2.8, we can reduce to the case where T = ∆n. Without loss of
generality, we can replace S by T = ∆n, so that X and X ′ are ∞-categories. The above constructions show
that r : X → X ′ is a homotopy inverse of the inclusion i : X ′ → X, so that i is an equivalence as desired.

We conclude by recording a property of minimal ∞-categories which makes them very useful for certain

applications.

Proposition 2.3.3.9. Let C be a minimal ∞-category, and let σ : ∆n → C be an n-simplex of C such that
σ|∆{i,i+1} = idC : C → C is a degenerate edge. Then σ = siσ0 for some σ0 : ∆n−1 → C.

Proof. We work by induction on n. Let σ0 = di+1σ and let σ′ = siσ0. We will prove that σ = σ′. Our ﬁrst
goal is to prove that σ| ∂ ∆n = σ′| ∂ ∆n; in other words, that dj σ = djσ′ for 0 ≤ j ≤ n. If j = i + 1 this is
obvious; if j /∈ {i, i + 1} then it follows from the inductive hypothesis. Let us consider the case i = j, and set
σ1 = diσ. We need to prove that σ0 = σ1. The argument above establishes that σ0| ∂ ∆n−1 = σ1| ∂ ∆n−1.
Since C is minimal, it will suﬃce to show that σ0 and σ1 are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n−1. We now observe
that

Since σ and σ′ coincide on ∂ ∆n, to prove that σ = σ′ it will suﬃce to prove that σ and σ′ are homotopic

relative to ∂ ∆n. We now observe that

(snσ′, . . . , si+2σ′, siσ′, siσ, si−1σ, . . . , s0σ)

We can interpret Proposition 2.3.3.9 as asserting that in a minimal ∞-category C, composition is “strictly
unital”. For example, in the special case where n = 2 and i = 1, Proposition 2.3.3.9 asserts that if f : X → Y
is a morphism in an ∞-category C, then f is the unique composition idY ◦f .

2.3.4 n-Categories
The theory of ∞-categories can be regarded as a generalization of classical category theory: if C is an ordinary
category, then its nerve N(C) is an ∞-category which determines C up to canonical isomorphism. Moreover,
Proposition 1.1.2.2 provides a precise characterization of those ∞-categories which can be obtained from
ordinary categories. In this section, we will explain how to specialize the theory of ∞-categories to obtain a
theory of n-categories, for every nonnegative integer n. (However, the ideas described here are appropriate
for describing only those n-categories which have only invertible k-morphisms, for every k ≥ 2.)

Before we can give the appropriate deﬁnition, we need to introduce a bit of terminology. Let f, f ′ :
K → C be two diagrams in an ∞-category C, and suppose that K ′ ⊆ K is a simplicial subset such that
f |K ′ = f ′|K ′ = f0. We will say that f and f ′ are homotopic relative to K ′ if they are equivalent when
viewed as objects of the ∞-category Fun(K, C)×Fun(K ′,C) {f0}. Equivalently, f and f ′ are homotopic relative
to K ′ if there exists a homotopy

with the following properties:

(i) The restriction h|K ′ × ∆1 coincides with the composition

h : K × ∆1 → C

K ′ × ∆1 → K ′ f0→ C .

(ii) The restriction h|K × {0} coincides with f .

(iii) The restriction h|K × {1} coincides with f ′.

(iv) For every vertex x of K, the restriction h|{x} × ∆1 is an equivalence in C.

We observe that if K ′ contains every vertex of K, then condition (iv) follows from condition (i).

Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. Let C be a simplicial set and n ≥ −1 an integer. We will say that C is an n-category if
it is an ∞-category and the following additional conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) Given a pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆n → C, if f and f ′ are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n, then f = f ′.

(2) Given m > n and a pair of maps f, f ′ : ∆m → C, if f | ∂ ∆m = f ′| ∂ ∆m, then f = f ′.

It is sometimes convenient to extend Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 to the case where n = −2: we will say that a

simplicial set C is a (−2)-category if it is a ﬁnal object of Set∆: in other words, if it is isomorphic to ∆0.

Example 2.3.4.2. Let C be a (−1)-category. Using condition (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1, one shows by
induction on m that C has at most one m-simplex. Consequently, we see that up to isomorphism there are
precisely two (−1)-categories: ∆−1 ≃ ∅ and ∆0.

Example 2.3.4.3. Let C be a 0-category, and let X = C0 denote the set of objects of C. Let us write x ≤ y
if there is a morphism φ from x to y in C. Since C is an ∞-category, this relation is reﬂexive and transitive.
Moreover, condition (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 guarantees that the morphism φ is unique if it exists. If x ≤ y
and y ≤ x, it follows that the morphisms relating x and y are mutually inverse equivalences. Condition (1)
then implies that x = y. We deduce that (X, ≤) is a partially ordered set. It follows from Proposition 2.3.4.5
below that the map C → N(X) is an isomorphism.

Conversely, it is easy to see that the nerve of any partially ordered set (X, ≤) is a 0-category in the sense
of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. Consequently, the full subcategory of Set∆ spanned by the 0-categories is equivalent to
the category of partially ordered sets.

Remark 2.3.4.4. Let C be an n-category, and let m > n + 1. Then the restriction map

θ : HomSet∆ (∆m, C) → HomSet∆(∂ ∆m, C)

is bijective. If n = −1, this is clear from Example 2.3.4.2; let us therefore suppose that n ≥ 0, so that m ≥ 2.
The injectivity of θ follows immediately from part (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. To prove the surjectivity, we
consider an arbitrary map f0 : ∂ ∆m → C. Let f : ∆m → C be an extension of f0|Λm
1 (which exists since C
is an ∞-category, and 0 < 1 < m). Using condition (2) again, we deduce that θ(f ) = f0.

The following result shows that, in the case where n = 1, Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 recovers the usual deﬁnition

of a category:

Proposition 2.3.4.5. Let S be a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) The unit map u : S → N(hS ) is an isomorphism of simplicial sets.

(2) There exists a small category C and an isomorphism S ≃ N(C) of simplicial sets.

(3) The simplicial set S is a 1-category.

Proof. The implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are clear. Let us therefore assume that (3) holds, and show that
f : S → N(hS ) is an isomorphism. We will prove, by induction on n, that the map u is bijective on
n-simplices.

For n = 0, this is clear. If n = 1, the surjectivity of u obvious. To prove the injectivity, we note that if
f (φ) = f (ψ), then the edges φ and ψ are homotopic in S. A simple application of condition (2) of Deﬁnition
2.3.4.1 then shows that φ = ψ.

Now suppose n > 1. The injectivity of u on n-simplices follows from condition (3) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1, and
the injectivity of u on (n−1)-simplices. To prove the surjectivity, let us suppose given a map s : ∆n → N(hS ).
Choose 0 < i < n. Since u is bijective on lower-dimensional simplices, the map s|Λn
i factors uniquely through
s : ∆n → S. Since N(hS ) is the nerve
S. Since S is an ∞-category, this factorization extends to a map
of a category, a pair of maps from ∆n into N(hS ) which agree on Λn
i must be the same. We deduce that
u ◦

s = s, and the proof is complete.

Remark 2.3.4.6. The condition that an ∞-category C be an n-category is not invariant under categorical
equivalence. For example, if D is a category with several objects, all of which are uniquely isomorphic to one
another, then N(D) is categorically equivalent to ∆0, but is not a (−1)-category. Consequently, there can
be no intrinsic characterization of the class of n-categories itself. Nevertheless, there does exist a convenient
description for the class of ∞-categories which are equivalent to n-categories; see Proposition 2.3.4.18.

Our next goal is to establish that the class of n-categories is stable under the formation of functor
categories. In order to do so, we need to reformulate Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 in a more invariant manner. Recall
that for any simplicial set X, the n-skeleton skn X is deﬁned to be the simplicial subset of X generated by
all the simplices of X having dimension ≤ n.

Proposition 2.3.4.7. Let C be an ∞-category and n ≥ −1. The following are equivalent:

95

(1) The ∞-category C is an n-category.

(2) For every simplicial set K and every pair of maps f, f ′ : K → C such that f | skn K and f ′| skn K are

homotopic relative to skn−1 K, we have f = f ′.

Proof. The implication (2) ⇒ (1) is obvious. Suppose that (1) is satisﬁed and let f, f ′ : K → C be as in
the statement of (2). To prove that f = f ′ it suﬃces to show that f and f ′ agree on every nondegenerate
simplex of K. We may therefore reduce to the case where K = ∆m. We now work by induction on m. If
m < n, there is nothing to prove. In the case m = n, the assumption that C is an n-category immediately
implies that f = f ′. If m > n, the inductive hypothesis implies that f | ∂ ∆m = f ′| ∂ ∆m, so that (1) implies
that f = f ′.

Corollary 2.3.4.8. Let C be an n-category and X a simplicial set. Then Fun(X, C) is an n-category.

Proof. Proposition 1.2.7.3 asserts that Fun(X, C) is an ∞-category. We will show that Fun(X, C) satisﬁes
condition (2) of Proposition 2.3.4.7. Suppose given a pair of maps f, f ′ : K → Fun(X, C) such that f | skn K
and f ′| skn K are homotopic relative to f | skn−1 K. We wish to show that f = f ′. We may identify f and
f ′ with maps F, F ′ : K × X → C. Since C is an n-category, to prove that F = F ′ it suﬃces to show that
F | skn(K × X) and F ′| skn(K × X) are homotopic relative to skn−1(K × X). This follows at once, since
skp(K × X) ⊆ (skp K) × X for every integer p.

When n = 1, Proposition 1.1.2.2 asserts that the class of n-categories can be characterized by the

uniqueness of certain horn ﬁllers. We now prove a generalization of this result.

Proposition 2.3.4.9. Let n ≥ 1, and let C be an ∞-category. Then C is an n-category if and only if it
satisﬁes the following condition:

• For every m > n and every diagram

where 0 < i < m, there exists a unique dotted arrow f as indicated, which renders the diagram

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that C is an n-category. Let f, f ′ : ∆m → C be two maps with f |Λm
0 < i < m and m > n. We wish to prove that f = f ′. Since Λm
i
it will suﬃce (by Proposition 2.3.4.7) to show that f and f ′ are homotopic relative to Λm
immediately from the fact that the inclusion Λm
Now suppose that every map f0 : Λm

i ⊆ ∆m is a categorical equivalence.

i , where
contains the (n − 1)-skeleton of ∆m,
i . This follows

i → C, where 0 < i < m and n < m, extends uniquely to an
m-simplex of C. We will show that C satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. Condition (2) is
obvious: if f, f ′ : ∆m → C are two maps which coincide on ∂ ∆m, then they coincide on Λm
1 and are therefore
equal to one another (here we use the fact that m > 1 because of our assumption that n ≥ 1). Condition (1)
is a bit more subtle. Suppose that f, f ′ : ∆n → C are homotopic via a homotopy h : ∆n × ∆1 → C which is
constant on ∂ ∆n × ∆1. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, let σi denote the (n + 1)-simplex of C obtained by composing h with
the map

we conclude that σi = sidiσi, so that diσi = di+1σi. A dual argument establishes the same equality for
0 < i. Since n > 0, we conclude that diσi = di+1σi for all i. Consequently, we have a chain of equalities

i+1 is equivalent to the restriction (sidiσi)|Λn+1

f ′ = d0σ0 = d1σ0 = d1σ1 = d2σ1 = . . . = dnσn = dn+1σn = f

so that f ′ = f , as desired.

Corollary 2.3.4.10. Let C be an n-category and let p : K → C be a diagram. Then C/p is an n-category.

Proof. If n ≤ 0, this follows easily from Examples 2.3.4.2 and 2.3.4.3. We may therefore suppose that n ≥ 1.
Proposition 1.2.9.3 implies that C/p is an ∞-category. According to Proposition 2.3.4.9, it suﬃces to show
that for every m > n, 0 < i < m, and every map f0 : Λm
i → C/p, there exists a unique map f : ∆m → C/p
extending f . Equivalently, we must show that there is a unique map g rendering the diagram

commutative. The existence of g follows from the fact that C/p is an ∞-category. Suppose that g′ : ∆m ⋆K →
C is another map which extends g0. Proposition 1.1.2.2 implies that g′|∆m = g|∆m. We conclude that g
and g′ coincide on the n-skeleton of ∆m ⋆ K. Since C is an n-category, we deduce that g = g′ as desired.

We conclude this section by introducing a construction which allows us to pass from an arbitrary ∞-
category C to its “underlying” n-category, by discarding information about morphisms of order > n. In
the case where n = 1, we have already introduced the relevant construction: we simply replace C by its
homotopy category (or, more precisely, the nerve of its homotopy category).

Notation 2.3.4.11. Let C be an ∞-category and let n ≥ 1. For every simplicial set K, let [K, C]n ⊆
Fun(skn K, C) be the subset consisting of those diagrams skn K → C which extend to the (n + 1)-skeleton
of K (in other words, the image of the restriction map Fun(skn+1 K, C) → Fun(skn K, C)). We deﬁne an
equivalence relation ∼ on [K, C]n as follows: given two maps f, g : skn K → C, we write f ∼ g if f and g are
homotopic relative to skn−1 K.

Proposition 2.3.4.12. Let C be an ∞-category and n ≥ 1.

(1) There exists a simplicial set hnC with the following universal mapping property: Fun(K, hnC) =

[K, C]n/ ∼.

(2) The simplicial set hnC is an n-category.

(3) If C is an n-category, then the natural map θ : C → hnC is an isomorphism.

(4) For every n-category D, composition with θ induces an isomorphism of simplicial sets

ψ : Fun(hnC, D) → Fun(C, D).

Proof. To prove (1), we begin by deﬁning hnC([m]) = [∆m, C]n/ ∼, so that the desired universal property
holds by deﬁnition whenever K is a simplex. Unwinding the deﬁnitions, to check the universal property for
a general simplicial set K we must verify the following fact:

(∗) Given two maps f, g : ∂ ∆n+1 → C which are homotopic relative to skn−1 ∆n+1, if f extends to an

(n + 1)-simplex of C, then g extends to an (n + 1)-simplex of C.

This follows easily from Proposition A.2.3.1.

We next show that hnC is an ∞-category. Let η0 : Λm

wish to show that η0 extends to an m-simplex η : ∆m → C. If m ≤ n + 2, then Λm
can be written as a composition

i → hnC be a morphism, where 0 < i < m. We

The existence of η now follows from our assumption that C is an ∞-category.
HomSet∆(Λm

i , hnC) ≃ HomSet∆ (∆m, hnC) by construction, so there is nothing to prove.

If m > n + 2, then

We next prove that hnC is an n-category. It is clear from the construction that for m > n, any two
m-simplices of hnC with the same boundary must coincide. Suppose next that we are given two maps
f, f ′ : ∆n → hnC which are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆n. Let F : ∆n × ∆1 → hnC be a homotopy from f to
f ′. Using (∗), we deduce that F is the image under θ of a map
F | ∂ ∆n × ∆1
factors through the projection ∂ ∆n × ∆1 → ∂ ∆n. Since n > 0, we conclude that
F is a homotopy from
F |∆n × {0} to
e

F |∆n × {1}, so that f = f ′. This completes the proof of (2).

F : ∆n × ∆1 → hnC, where

To prove (3), let us suppose that C is an n-category; we prove by induction on m that the map C → hnC
is bijective on m-simplices. For m < n, this is clear. When m = n it follows from part (1) of Deﬁnition
e
2.3.4.1. When m = n + 1, surjectivity follows from the construction of hn C, and injectivity from part (2) of
Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1. For m > n + 1, we have a commutative diagram

where the bottom horizontal map is an isomorphism by the inductive hypothesis, the left vertical map is an
isomorphism by construction, and the right vertical map is an isomorphism by Remark 2.3.4.4; it follows
that the upper horizontal map is an isomorphism as well.

To prove (4), we observe that if D is an n-category, then the composition

is an inverse to φ, where the second isomorphism is given by (3).

Fun(C, D) → Fun(hnC, hnD) ≃ Fun(hnC, D)

Remark 2.3.4.13. The construction of Proposition 2.3.4.12 does not quite work if n ≤ 0, since there may
exist equivalences in hn C which do not arise from equivalences in C. However, it is a simple matter to give
an alternative construction in these cases which satisﬁes conditions (2), (3), and (4); we leave the details to
the reader.

Remark 2.3.4.14. In the case n = 1, the ∞-category h1C constructed in Proposition 2.3.4.12 is isomorphic
to the nerve of the homotopy category hC.

We now apply the theory of minimal ∞-categories (§2.3.3) to obtain a characterization of the class of
∞-categories which are equivalent to n-categories. First, we need a deﬁnition from classical homotopy theory.

Deﬁnition 2.3.4.15. Let k ≥ −1 be an integer. A Kan complex X is k-truncated if, for every i > k and
every point x ∈ X, we have

πi(X, x) ≃ ∗.

By convention, we will also say that X is (−2)-truncated if X is contractible.

Remark 2.3.4.16. If X and Y are homotopy equivalent Kan complexes, then X is k-truncated if and only
if Y is k-truncated. In other words, we may view k-truncatedness as a condition on objects in the homotopy
category H of spaces.

Example 2.3.4.17. A Kan complex X is (−1)-truncated if it is either empty or contractible.
It is 0-
truncated if the natural map X → π0X is a homotopy equivalence (equivalently, X is 0-truncated if it is
homotopy equivalent to a discrete space).

Proposition 2.3.4.18. Let C be an ∞-category and n ≥ −1. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) There exists a minimal model C′ ⊆ C such that C′ is an n-category.

(2) There exists a categorical equivalence D → C, where D is an n-category.

(3) For every pair of objects X, Y ∈ C, the mapping space MapC(X, Y ) ∈ H is (n − 1)-truncated.

Proof. It is clear that (1) implies (2). Suppose next that (2) is satisﬁed; we will prove (3). Without loss of
generality, we may replace C by D and thereby assume that C is an n-category. If n = −1, the desired result
follows immediately from Example 2.3.4.2. Choose m ≥ n and an element η ∈ πm(MapC(X, Y ), f ). We can
represent η by a commutative diagram of simplicial sets

∂ ∆m(cid:127)

/ {f }

∆m

s

/ HomR

C (X, Y ).

We can identify s with a map ∆m+1 → C whose restriction to ∂ ∆m+1 is speciﬁed. Since C is an n-category,
the inequality m + 1 > n shows that s is uniquely determined. This proves that πm(MapC(X, Y ), f ) ≃ ∗, so
that (3) is satisﬁed.

To prove that (3) implies (1), it suﬃces to show that if C is a minimal ∞-category which satisﬁes (3),
then C is an n-category. We must show that the conditions of Deﬁnition 2.3.4.1 are satisﬁed. The ﬁrst
of these conditions follows immediately from the assumption that C is minimal. For the second, we must
show that if m > n and f, f ′ : ∂ ∆m → C are such that f | ∂ ∆m = f ′| ∂ ∆m, then f = f ′. Since C is
minimal, it suﬃces to show that f and f ′ are homotopic relative to ∂ ∆m. We will prove that there is a map
g : ∆m+1 → C such that dm+1g = f , dmg = f ′, and dig = dismf = dismf ′ for 0 ≤ i < m. Then the sequence
(s0f, s1f, . . . , sm−1f, g) determines a map ∆m × ∆1 → C which gives the desired homotopy between f and
f ′ (relative to ∂ ∆m).

To produce the map g, it suﬃces to solve the lifting problem depicted in the diagram
