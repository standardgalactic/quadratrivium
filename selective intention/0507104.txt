Informationally complete measurements allow the estimation of expectation values of any opera-
tor on a quantum system, by changing only the data-processing of the measurement outcomes. In
particular, an informationally complete measurement can be used to perform quantum tomogra-
phy, namely to estimate the density matrix of the quantum state. The data-processing is generally
nonunique, and can be optimized according to a given criterion. In this paper we provide the solu-
tion of the optimization problem which minimizes the variance in the estimation. We then consider
informationally complete measurements performed over bipartite quantum systems focusing atten-
tion on universally covariant measurements, and compare their statistical eﬃciency when performed
either locally or globally on the two systems. Among global measurements we consider the special
case of Bell measurements, which allow to estimate the expectation of a restricted class of operators.
We compare the variance in the three cases: local, Bell, and unrestricted global—and derive condi-
tions for the operators to be estimated such that one type of measurement is more eﬃcient than the
other. In particular, we ﬁnd that for factorized operators and Bell projectors the Bell measurement
always performs better than the unrestricted global measurement, which in turn outperforms the
local one. For estimation of the matrix elements of the density operator, the relative performances
depend on the basis on which the state is represented, and on the matrix element being diagonal or
oﬀ-diagonal, however, with the global unrestricted measurement generally performing better than
the local one.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most distinctive features of quantum mechanics is that the information on the state of the quantum
system cannot be retrieved in a single measurement [1]. Among the diﬀerent methods for retrieving information on the
state—including quantum tomography, state discrimination, and quantum state estimation [2]—the informationally
complete measurement [3, 4, 5] (shortly named infocomplete in the following) is the most versatile, allowing one to
obtain the expectation hOi of any operator O of the system, and with the additional possibility of adapting the
processing of outcomes, depending on the quantity to be estimated and on the set of states on which the measurement
is performed. A particularly interesting case is when the measurement is covariant [6, 7] with respect to a group of
physical transformations. This means that there is an action of a group on the probability space which maps events
into events in a covariant fashion, namely that when the quantum system is group-transformed, the probability of
the given event becomes the probability of the transformed event. This situation is very natural, and occurs in many
applications (e .g. heterodyne detection [8], measurement of the spin-direction [9], transmission of reference frames
[10], estimation of unitary transformations [11], etc.)

In this paper we study covariant infocomplete measurements for bipartite quantum systems. The problem of
optimization of data-processing will be solved using the method of frame theory [12, 13], which recently has been
shown [14, 15] to be perfectly suited to optimize covariant infocomplete measurements. Dealing with bipartite (or
multipartite) quantum system, the study of the possibility to perform information-theoretic tasks locally on non-local
states has become a new paradigm in the ﬁeld of quantum information. In this respect consider for example the study
of local implementation of non-local quantum gates [16], telecloning [17], remote manipulation and preparation of
quantum states [18], and local discrimination of non-local states [19]. The problem of comparing the performances of
local and entangled estimation schemes has not been addressed yet, and this is precisely the purpose of the present
paper, where we compare the statistical eﬃciency of local infocomplete measurements with that of nonlocal ones. In
particular, the possibility of having a maximally entangled infocomplete measurement—or Bell quorum—has never
been considered. Here we will show that, although an infocomplete Bell measurement strictly does not exist, however,
Bell measurements can be used to estimate the expectation of any operator O having both partial traces Tr1[O]
and Tr2[O] proportional to the identity, e. g. maximally entangled operators and traceless factorized observables.
This possibility is interesting also in view of the relevant problem of the classiﬁcation of measurements according to
separability criteria, which still remains unsolved.

The statistical eﬃciency of an infocomplete measurement is quantiﬁed by the noise in the estimation of the operator
expectation hOi. This generally depends both on the state and on the operator O to be estimated. However, for

 
 
 
 
2

unbiased estimations the squared expectation is independent of the measurement, whereas if the measurement is also
fully covariant (i. e. covariant under the full group of unitary transformations) the square of the estimation averaged
over the ensemble of possible input states depends only on the measurement: this greatly simpliﬁes the evaluation of
the variances, and allows a simple comparison of statistical eﬃciencies of diﬀerent infocomplete measurements.

The paper is organized as follows. After summarizing some useful notation and elements of the Theory of Frames in
Section II, in Sect. III we give a general method for optimizing the data-processing. In Sect. IV we consider covariant
infocomplete measurements for bipartite quantum systems, in which case the optimal data-processing is provided by
the so-called canonical dual frame. In Sections V, VI, and VII we derive the minimal noise (averaged over an ensembles
of covariant states) for factorized, global, and Bell infocomplete covariant measurements, and ﬁnally we conclude the
paper in Section VIII by comparing the resulting statistical eﬃciencies of the diﬀerent types of measurements.

II. NOTATION AND ELEMENTS OF THE THEORY OF FRAMES

An infocomplete measurement is characterized by a Positive Operator-Valued Measurement (POVM) that spans
the whole space of linear operators. The Theory of frames [12, 13] provides simple and powerful tools to establish
whether a set of operators is complete in the whole operator space, and in addition gives a simple algebraic rule for
constructing all possible expansion coeﬃcients—representing all possible data-processing of measurement outcomes—
in terms of the so-called dual frames. Upon denoting with {Pi} the elements of an infocomplete POVM [14], dual
frames correspond to sets of operators {Di} in terms of which we can write the operator expansion as follows

N

Xi=1

Tr[D†

i O] Pi = O ,

(1)

where N denotes the number of outcomes of the POVM (in the following we will not specify it anymore in the sum
limits). When considering expansions of operators over a Hilbert space H it is convenient to exploit the natural
isomorphism between operators O on H and vectors | Oii in H⊗2, deﬁned through the equation

We will make repeated use of the following identities [20]

| Oii

Tr1[| AiihhB |] = Aτ B∗ ,
Tr2[| AiihhB |] = AB† ,

(2)

(3)
(4)
(5)

where τ and ∗ denote transposition and complex conjugation with respect to the given ﬁxed basis in Eq. (2). The
main results from frame theory are the following [14]. First, a the POVM {Pi} is infocomplete if and only if the frame
operator

F =

| PiiihhPi | ,

Xi

is invertible. A dual frame {Di} is given by the following one (usually referred to as canonical)

| Diii = F −1| Piii .

(6)

(7)

In general there exist inﬁnitely many alternate duals {D′

i} , which can be obtained from the canonical one as follows

D′

i = Di + Yi −

Tr[P †

j Di] Yj ,

Xj

(8)

for arbitrary set {Yj}. Finally, whenever a POVM is not complete, the span of its elements coincides with the
support (the orthogonal complement of the kernel) of the operator F . Then the operators in such a subspace can
be reconstructed through Eq. (1), where the canonical dual is now deﬁned through the Moore-Penrose generalized
inverse F ‡ of F , which corresponds to invert F on its support.

III. OPTIMIZATION OF THE DATA-PROCESSING

In the following we will restrict our attention only to ﬁnite dimension d < ∞ of the system Hilbert space. Apart
from the case of POVM {Pi} with exactly d2 linearly independent elements Pi (whence with discrete sample space),
for infocomplete POVM’s there always exist inﬁnitely many alternate duals. This feature provides a wide freedom
in choosing the dual frame, which can be exploited in order to optimize the data-processing, e. g. to minimize the
variance in the estimation. Therefore, suppose that an experimenter is collecting statistics using an infocomplete
measuring apparatus—e. g.
in a quantum tomographic setup—with the aim of estimating the expectations of any
desired operator. The noise in the estimation of the operator O can be evaluated by [21]

δO2(ρ; P )

|Tr[D†

i O]|2Tr[Piρ] − |Tr[Oρ]|2 ,

(9)

which clearly depends on the state ρ. Notice that we consider generally complex operators O, i. e. we can include the
case of external products O = |iihj| of orthonormal basis, which are needed to estimate the matrix elements ρij of
the density operator ρ. In a Bayesian scheme the noise (9) can be minimized for a given prior probability distribution
dµ(ρ) of the input states ρ, corresponding to the prior state ¯ρ =
dµ(ρ)ρ. The dual frame {Di} can be chosen in
order to minimize such a noise, which in turn corresponds to minimize the following norm

where |ci =

i O]|eii is a vector in CN , and {ei} denotes the canonical basis of CN . We will now state a

where ci = hei|ci. The matrix elements representing Λ in the bases |eii ∈ CN and |mi|ni ∈ H⊗2 are given by

(12)

We can deﬁne Γ to be a generalized inverse of Λ, shortly g-inverse, if Λ = ΛΓΛ holds (in the following, for all properties
of the various kinds of g-inverse see Ref. [22]). We now show that any g-inverse Γ must have matrix elements of the
form

Γi,mn = (D∗

i )mn ,

(13)

In fact, (ΓΛ)ij = Tr[D†

i Pj]. Then, by informational completeness of the POVM
g-inverse can be written as (ΛΓΛ)mn,j =
i Tr[D†
i O]Pi = O must hold, and necessarily {Di} is a dual. Moreover, since
{Pj}, the reconstruction formula
P
{Di} is a dual, than the g-inverse is also reﬂexive , namely ΓΛΓ = Γ, as can be easily checked from the expansion
i )mn ≡ (Γ)i,mn. In addition, the g-inverse Γ is also a least square inverse, since
(ΓΛΓ)i,mn ≡
i O](Pi)mn = (O)mn. Therefore, summarizing,
||ΛΓO − O|| = 0, as a consequence of the expansion (ΛΓO)mn ≡
any dual frame {Di} corresponds to a reﬂexive and least square g-inverse Γ of Λ through Eqs. (12) and (13).

Now, the quantity we want to minimize is ||ΓO||π, where the norm || • ||π is deﬁned through

||c||2

π = hc|π|ci ,

(14)

π being the diagonal matrix (in the canonical basis ei) with entries πii = Tr[Piρ] (for ﬁnite dimension the POVM is
trace-class). Notice that when Tr[Piρ] does not depend on i (as in the case where the average over the prior distribution
of states gives ¯ρ ∝ I and the POVM is covariant so that Tr[Pi ¯ρ] ∝ Tr[UiνU †
i ] = Tr[ν]) then π ∝ I. The quantity to be
minimized is then simply ||c||2 = hc|ci, and the solution to the minimum-norm problem is provided by any matrix Γ
such that ΓΛ = Λ†Γ† = Λ†Γ†ΓΛ. Along with the reﬂexivity and least-square properties, the minimum-norm condition
uniquely determines the g-inverse in terms of the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse Γ ≡ Λ‡. Since (ΓΛ)ij = Tr[D†
i Pj],
the previous identity is equivalent to

hhDi|Pjii = hhPi|Djii =

hhPi|DkiihhDk|Pjii .

(15)

Xk

4

Now it is easy to check that the canonical dual Di, deﬁned as |Diii = F −1|Piii, satisﬁes the previous condition, as

k |DkiihhDk| = F −1, and

P

hhDi|Pj ii = hhPi|Djii =

hhPi|DkiihhDk|Pj ii = hhPi|F −1|Pjii .

(16)

Xk

In the general case in which π 6∝ I, analogous proof as in the previous case [22] leads to the following condition for
minimization of ||ΓO||π

πΓΛ = Λ†Γ†π = Λ†Γ†πΓΛ .

(17)

The results of the present and the previous sections also apply in the case of continuous POVM by suitably replacing
the discrete index i with a continuous one, and sums with integrals with some care about summability of integrals in
the case of noncompact groups.

IV.

INFOCOMPLETE COVARIANT MEASUREMENTS FOR BIPARTITE SYSTEMS

In the following we will consider quantum measurements that are covariant under the action of a group G of unitary
operators Ug, g ∈ G, on the Hilbert space H⊗2 of a bipartite system, H denoting the Hilbert space of the two identical
systems, for ﬁnite dimension d = dim(H). As well known [6], the POVM of the measurement has the form

dg Pg = dg UgξU †
g ,

(18)

where ξ is a suitable positive operator such that the POVM is normalized, and dg denotes a (suitably normalized)
Haar invariant measure on the group (for what we need in the following, the group is unimodular, which guarantees
that an invariant measure always exists). For later convenience, we will normalize the Haar measure over the group as
G dg = d (d is the dimension of the Hilbert space on which the group is represented). For infocomplete measurements
every operator can be expanded over the POVM density, namely Pg spans the whole linear space of linear operators.
R
Clearly, all expansions for bounded operators must be square summable over the group G. However, since we are
considering only ﬁnite dimensions, all operators are bounded, and since we consider only compact groups (which then
admit normalizable invariant Haar measure), all group integrals are bounded too. In the present case, the noise in
Eq. (9) can be rewritten as

δO2(ρ; P )

(19)

We will consider the following classes of pure states with uniform prior probability distribution: a) all pure input
states; f ) all factorized pure input states; e) all maximally entangled input states (also called EPR states). The
averaged noise in all three cases can be evaluated with the following integrals

which the average is estimated. Upon denoting by overline the average over input states, one has

One can easily show that the ﬁrst integral in Eq. (19) is independent of the input state ensemble, so that the ﬁrst
term of the noise depends only on the POVM, whereas the second term depends only on the input ensemble. This
can be veriﬁed using identities (26) and (27). One has

(33)

where the elements g, h belong to SU(d), and ν , ν′ are pure states in Cd. Such a POVM describes a measurement
that can be performed locally by two separate parties, with classical communication needed in order to evaluate the
processing function.

It can be easily shown by Schur’s lemma that Pg ⊗ Ph is actually a POVM. The canonical dual can be written as

[14]

The noise δxO2[P loc] in the evaluation of the expectation value of an operator O is given by

(38)

(39)

(40)

with g belonging to SU(d). Using Eq. (26) it is easy to verify that Eq. (40) actually deﬁnes a POVM. On the other
hand, such a POVM is not infocomplete since operators whose partial trace is not proportional to the identity cannot
be spanned. This can be seen directly from the reconstruction formula (1). We can evaluate explicitly the frame
operator as follows

can be used, however, to obtain the expectation values of any operator of the form

O = α00I +

αij Vi ⊗ Wj ,

Xi,j6=0

(42)

where Vi and Wj are orthogonal bases for the operators with V0 = W0 = I (and hence with Vi and Wj traceless for
i, j 6= 0). These are exactly the operators in the support of F . Notice also that any maximally entangled state is of
the form (42).

Clearly, for operators O having Tr1[O] = Tr2[O] = 0 (e. g. for operators of the form O = A ⊗ B with both A and B
traceless) one has

δ2Ox[P Bell] 6 δ2Ox[P glob] 6 δ2Ox[P loc] .

(48)

For oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements in a factorized basis, namely with O = |iihj| ⊗ |nihm| and i 6= j and/or n 6= m,
the inequalities (48) also hold true, and, speciﬁcally, for diagonal matrix elements one has δ2Ox[P glob] = δ2Ox[P loc].
Also for maximally entangled projectors O = 1
(48), whereas for
d | V iihhW | and Tr[W †V ] = 0 one has
O = 1

d | V iihhV | the variances are bounded as in Eq.

δ2Ox[P glob] 6 δ2Ox[P loc] ,

(49)

and generally the expectation of O cannot be estimated using the Bell POVM, unless W †V ∝ I. This means that
for matrix elements in an orthogonal Bell basis | Vnii where Vn are traceless (apart from the identity) and form a
also a (projective) representation of a group (such as the usual orthonormal basis with Pauli matrices for d = 2, or
shift-and-multiply operators in dimension d > 2), the Bell POVM is optimal for diagonal matrix elements, whereas
for oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements it cannot be used, and for these it is better to use the global measurement than the
local one.

We conclude that for factorized traceless operators, for Bell projectors, and for the density matrix estimation in
factorized basis the Bell measurement always performs better than the unrestricted global measurement, which in
turn outperforms the local one. For the diagonal matrix elements in the factorized basis the Bell measurement cannot
be used, and global and local POVM’s perform equally well. Finally, for matrix elements in an orthogonal Bell basis
the Bell POVM is optimal for diagonal matrix elements, whereas for oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements it cannot be used,
and for these elements the global measurement performs better than the local one.

A further interesting study continuing the present analysis is the evaluation of the noise for infocomplete measure-

ments with minimal number of outcomes, comparing local versus global measurements.
