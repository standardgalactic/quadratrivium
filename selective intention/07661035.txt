Summary: Inspired by work of Ejiri-Micallef on closed minimal surfaces, we compare the energy index
and the area index of a free-boundary minimal surface of a Riemannian manifold with boundary, and
show that the area index is controlled from above by the area and the topology of the surface. Combining
these results with work of Fraser-Li, we conclude that the area index of a free-boundary minimal surface
in a convex domain of Euclidean three-space, is bounded from above by a linear function of its genus and
its number of boundary components. We also prove index bounds for submanifolds of higher dimension.
