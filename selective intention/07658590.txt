Summary: Annotation. A numerical-analytical simulation of scattering by a three-barrier heterostructure
of an electronic Gaussian wave packet, the spectral width of which is on the order of the distance between
the levels of the doublet of quasi-stationary states, is carried out. This article proves that as a result of
scattering, damped waves of electron charge and current densities are formed outside the double well,
their characteristics are determined by the structure of the initial wave packet and the poles of the
scattering amplitudes. The frequency of these waves is equal to the diﬀerence frequency of the doublet,
the wavenumber is the diﬀerence between the wave numbers of free motion of electrons with resonant
energies, and the speed of their propagation is the ratio of these quantities. The system can go into the
regime of repetition or ampliﬁcation of the emission of electron waves if a periodic resonant pumping of
the doublet population is provided by scattering of a series of coherent wave packets.
