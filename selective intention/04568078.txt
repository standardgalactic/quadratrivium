1. Introduction

In [LS] an extension of the propositional logic of
linear time was described and claimed useful for reason 
ing in an uncertain world. Le. a world in which time floW's
and 1il. which the transition from one instant ot time to
the next is probabilistic in nature. Three logical systems
of axioms and rules of inference were proposed and
proved deductively complete with· respect
to ditferent
classes of models. One of
these systems. Teb, was
clai~ed to be most adequate for stating and proving pro 
perties about a large interesting family of probabilistic

three systems had impressive expressive power. since
they are similar. ~n. .expressive power to thesystemcrL 
described. tor branching time. in [~li2]. Tb.18 last system
is the most expressive of those defined in [EH2] and no
elementary decision procedure is known tor it. It is even
possible that methods similar to ours could yield efficient
decision procedure for CTL -. We assume familiarity with
the basic notions and notations of [LS] (see ICALP 83
Springer Verlag Leoture Notes in C.S. for an extended
abstract): the models. the language (I') and Validity.

2. The logical systems

In [LS] three different logical systelIUl: Teg. TCb and
Tef were proposed. each one of them corresponding to
one of the notions of ,.-validity define d there (7 is 9 . b or
t- denotes provabllity in the system
J). The symbol

3. The lower bounds

Our

result

three systems are

PSPACE-hard. In [Se] the temporal logic of linear time is
shown to be PSPACE-hard. Let II be a formula of the
temporal logic ot linear time. It Is also a formula of r. If
is valid in the logic of linear time then it holds lor
tI
every path of a 9 -model and it is g-val1d. Any 9 -valid
formulA 1s b -valid and any b -valid formula is f -valid. Let
us call a g -model deternnnistic if for any state s there is
a state t such that p (8 ,t) =1.
If a formula a. is f -valid
then it is. in particular. satisfied by all finite determinis 
~ic. ,models. But finite deterministic models are exactly
finite linear models. Since the logic or linear time has
the tlnlte model property any formula ot the logic of
linear time that 1s I-valid is valid.

Our second result is that no decision procedure for
any of our three systems can work in less than exponen 
tial time.

Theorem 2: There is a constant a >1 such that the
validity problems for TCg. TCb and TCf are not members
ot DTIME(c n ). where n. is the size (I) of the formula.

The proof is by reduction to one letter PDL. Let us
call PDL- the restriction of PDL obtained by restricting
oneself to a Bingle basic program ( 1-) and not allowing
sequential eomposition ( ; ) or non-deterministic choice (
U ). Noti;e that PDL- has essentially only two programs:
t- and f- . In (FL]. it is shown that the validity problem
for PDL - requires exponential time. Define UB- as the
subset of UB (see (BMP]) defined when one allows V G
and VX as the only temporal connectives (i.e. V F and JG
are disallowed, classical connectives are allowed). The
simple tran!lation of PDL - to UB- that translates [1-] by
VX and (t- ] by V G shows that the validity problem for
UB-requiresexponential time (this result seems to be
part of the folklore of the subject). Our remark is essen 
tially that UB- is so restricted that the branching time
interpretation is eqUivalent to the probabilistic interpre 
tation.

More precisely. "tVe translate UB- into a subset r' of
r by translating YX by va and Y G by VO If a, is 8. for 
mula ot US-, its translation in r' will be denoted by fi.
Let npw 11 be a 9 -model (probabilistic). we shall denote
by 11.
the branching time model obtained from 11 by
allowlng those transitions that have positive probability
in 1J (and forgetting the probabilities).

larger set of formulas.

Proof: An easy induction on the structure of rJ" rea 

soning at the same time on a formula and 1ts negation.

Lemma 2: Let a. be a formula of UB- and 'IJ be a g 

model, then 11' F a, <;:::;> U 1=, ii .

Proof: An easy induction on the structure or a.
Lemma 3: Let a, be a formula of UB-. then the fol 

lowing propositions are equivalent:
a) a, is valid for branching time logic
b) a is 9 -valid
c)
if is b -valid
d) cr is / ·valid

Proof: a) ~ b) by lemma 2. b) ::::;> c) and c) :::;> d)
are obvious. Suppose d) is true. By lemma 2 tor any 1 
model 11 we have 11' Fa. Given a finite model for branch 
ing time 11, one may always give numeric positive proba 
bilities to the transitions of V to obtain an I-model 'Ii
such that'll' =V. We conclude that a is satisfted in all
finite models for branching time. Since UB- enjoys the

finite model property, we may conclude that Dr

4. Upper bounds

All three completeness results of [LS] proceed by
building a "universal" model, Le. a model in which points
are labeled by traces of a suitable size and every trace of
that size labels some point of the model that is built in
such a way that the standard generic paths out of a
point satisfy exactly those formulas that appear in their
In all three cases those models, though infinite in
label.
the cases 9 and b, may be finitely (and succinctly)
described. The basic idea is to collect a set of properties
enjoyed by the universal model that is rich enough to
guarantee that the standard generic paths out of a point
satisfy exactly those formulas that appear in their label.
We may know guess a model satisfying those propertie's
and look out tor a label containing formula Va. It one is
found then a is satisfiable.
If no model contains such a
label, then the universal model contains no such label
and a. is not satisfiable.

5. A decision procedure for reg

First we shall define the small set of formulas to be

considered.

Definition 1: If a. E: r, we define CZ-( Do)

to be the

smallest subset of r satisfying:
a) Va E: a-(a,)
b) a '-(0,) is closed under sub-formulas
c) a-(a) is closed under negation
d) p E: CZ-( a) (p stands for a propositional variable )
==:> Vp E: a-(a)

Deftnition 2: A formula b is in Or (a.) iff it il either in
where

form V b IV . · • b~

the

or

of

a -(a)
b, E a (CI ). i = 1f

•

•

• .Ic.

Notice that G!(a) contains only em formulas. Now,
to restrict our attention to those subsets of
we want
a (a.) that are reasonable candidates for labels. Notice
that our requirements deal only with the formulas of
a -(a.).

Definition 8: D ~ a (a.) is a standard set (for a) if it

satisfies:
a) if b E et-( a.) , .. b €. D <=> b ,. D
b) it b vee: Ct -( II) . then b vee: D <t=:;> b e: D or c e: D
c) Db E: D <:=;> b ED and aOb ED
d) if V b e: a -( a, ). then V b e: D :::;> b e: D

f) 6 Untilc e: D ::::;..
g) b Untnc e: D ¢::;>

... 0"" c E D
c e: D or b e: D and Orb Untnc) e: D

We detlne !b to be the set of all the standard subsets of
a (a)
Remark: 2 contains at most 22 C'(CI) elements. for some
constant c
We detinet now. the successor relation R on !b. Notice
again that only formulas of Cl-(a) are considered.

Deftnition 4: Let D1 and De be standard sets (Le
11 e:2» we Bay that D1 R D 2 iff for all b e:r such that
Ob e: Cl-(a.), we have Ob e: D I <;::;> b e: De-
Similarly we define a relation E on 2J.

It is crucial
here that our requirement is only for formulas of CZ-( a).

DeOnltlon ~: Let D I and De be in!l:J. We say that
Dl E Da ift for all b e:r such that Vb Eo: Ct -(a.), we have
Vb E: D1 <=:> Vb e: D2 .

Now we may define the pseudo-models for the case

g.

5) for all D e: W . there eXis~a D' E: W such...that Dr D'

there exists aD' E: W such that Dr· D' and b t. D' where

there exists aD' e: W such that D ~ D 'and b t. D '

We shall also assume that double negations are automati

linear in the length ot a.

Similarly to what must be done in the completeness
proof we need to detlnea set of formulas that is, larger
than Cl-(a,). The labels considered will be subsets of this

Proof: Let .A be the set of all D's tor which there is
a 9 -consistent and complete
theory T such that
D:: Tn Cl (m). Notice that here we consider Cl (tJ) not
a -(a.). One may see that <..A •s .e·>, is a pseudo-model

that D1 =T1 n Cl (a,)

for m, where s and e are defined below and e· is the

tlon 11.6 ot [L6]. We shall sketch the verification or con

- Let m, be a natural number. Let a be a sequence of
states of 11 (any sequence). Suppose a = <zi . Di >. We
shall say that a is an m-standard sequence if there
exists an ft Etl such that: for any i such that ~i<n we
have zi =D. tor any i ~n. z, =1. tor any i
such that
~i<n+m,. we have .Da R D'+l and for any i~n+m. we

it has some m-standard tail.

We see. using conditions 2 and 5 of definition 9, that
the set of m-standard sequences beginning at a state s
has positive weight and that the set of ultimately m, 
standard sequences beginning at a state s has weight 1.
Equivalent ( E ) sequences are defined as in the case or
reg.

We shall now need a stronger definition ot generic
sequences (it is needed in th~0 case below). Let t1 be a
sequence of states of 1J (a e:S ), a is said to be generic iff

8. Open problems There is a gap between the deter 
ministic
non 
deterministic double- exponential upper bound. It is our
feeling that this gap may be reduced. A natural idea is to
try and obtain a deterministic double-exponential time
decision procedure by an iterative method in the spirit
of [SH], but a too simple-minded effort tails. The idea
seems applicable, though, for a sUblanguage containing
large enough to include the
only "state formulas",
language of (HS]. One should also look for methods to
check whether a given formula Is satisfied in a given
model (described in some finite way).
