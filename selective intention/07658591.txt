Summary: In measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), computation is carried out by a se-
quence of measurements and corrections on an entangled state. Flow, and related concepts, are powerful
techniques for characterising the dependence of the corrections on previous measurement outcomes. We
introduce ﬂow-based methods for MBQC with qudit graph states, which we call Zd-ﬂow, when the lo-
cal dimension is an odd prime. Our main results are a proof that Zd-ﬂow is a necessary and suﬃcient
condition for a strong form of outcome determinism. Along the way, we ﬁnd a suitable generalisation of
the concept of measurement planes to this setting and characterise the allowed measurements in a qudit
MBQC. We also provide a polynomial-time algorithm for ﬁnding an optimal Zd-ﬂow whenever one exists.
