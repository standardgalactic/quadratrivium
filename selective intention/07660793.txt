Summary: We investigate the non-equilibrium behaviour of the 3d random ﬁeld Ising model at ﬁnite
temperature, as an external ﬁeld is increased through its coercive ﬁeld. We show by numerical simulations
that the phenomenology of avalanches – which are sharply deﬁned only at zero temperature – also persists
over a signiﬁcant range of ﬁnite temperatures. We analyse the main diﬀerences between the thermal and
zero-temperature systems, including an excess of small avalanches in the thermal case, whose behaviour is
consistent with activated dynamical scaling. We also investigate the extent to which individual avalanches
at ﬁnite temperature can be traced back to parent avalanches in the athermal system.
