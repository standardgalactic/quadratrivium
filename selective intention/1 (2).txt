Abandonment

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE

Although children who are abandoned tend to be
infants or young children (who are called foundlings),
abandonment still
is important to consider when
studying the period of adolescence. Abandonment
potentially relates to adolescents in two major ways.
First, abandonment is relevant to adolescents in that
they can be abandoned or in that the feeling of being
abandoned leads youth to leave their parents by, for
example, running away from their homes (Thompson
et al. 2008). Second, abandonment is relevant to ado-
lescents because they may be at risk for abandoning
their own children. These propositions may be true
but, regrettably, research on abandonment is consider-
ably inadequate and does not support them conclu-
sively. For example, researchers and policy makers lack
reliable statistics regarding how many children are
abandoned, their basic characteristics and situations,
as well as the characteristics of those who abandon
them. Even the most comprehensive federal statistics
reporting on the incidence and common features of
child maltreatment do not report abandonment rates
or characteristics (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services 2009). Thus, studies do not have
a ﬁrm grip on the number of cases involving abandon-
ment, but they do provide a sense that it is an impor-
tant issue that may affect adolescents.

turns out

Abandonment

to be a much more
complicated legal and social concept than might be
initially imagined. Legally, children are abandoned
when their parents leave them without the supervision
of an appropriate person for what is deemed to be an
inappropriate amount of time. Typically, the parents do
not intend to return and relinquish their control over

the child’s care; and the child is abandoned outside of
legal adoption. As with other types of child maltreat-
ment, abandonment is regulated by both civil and
criminal law. Child abandonment is a criminal offense
in every state; but what constitutes abandonment varies
from one state to another. Variations focus on what the
parents do, the child’s characteristics, and the penalties.
Much variation exists in the civil context as well.
Variation in this context also focuses not only on
what parents do as well as on the child’s characteristics
and situations but also on the rights of parents
involved and the types of resources that might be
provided to the parents and families. In the civil con-
text, abandonment also arises when a court decides to
terminate the natural rights of parents on the grounds
of abandonment in order to permit adoption or other
state interventions on behalf of the child. Importantly,
pursuing abandonment in criminal or civil contexts
has consequences, especially in terms of protections
individuals would have and what would be appropriate
outcomes for the parents as well as the children:
criminal justice systems would aim to prosecute and
punish parents in ways that might remove them from
their homes while civil, child welfare systems would
aim to consider, in appropriate cases, the potential
rehabilitation of parents as well as reuniﬁcation with
their families.

The law remains equally complicated when dealing
with abandonment from the perspective of adolescents
who might be the ones to abandon their own children.
Adolescents who have children may be at higher risk of
abandoning their infants, and this supposition has led
to important legal developments relating directly to the
legal regulation of abandonment. Although adolescents
may be deemed at higher risk, research has yet to
provide supporting evidence to that effect. It has been
adolescent (and other young) mothers, however, who
have tended to attract attention from society and policy
makers. That attention recently contributed to the
development of “Safe Haven Laws.” Every state now

has laws permitting parents to abandon their children
at a safe place, such as with ﬁre station departments,
emergency medical personnel, hospitals, police
departments, and in some cases, churches (Pollock
and Hittle 2003). Although these laws have been
described as permitting parents to abandon their chil-
dren anonymously and without fear of prosecution,
that description actually may not be the case depending
on state laws. Again and as with all other areas of child
welfare and criminal law, laws can be quite complicated
and can vary from state to state.

State laws vary considerably in their approaches to
regulating safe havens for children who would be aban-
doned. They vary in the manner that they restrict the
age of babies who can be legally relinquished, vary in
terms of who they allow to relinquish the children, and
vary to the extent that they assure anonymity. Equally
they vary in the speciﬁc protection
importantly,
granted to those who seek to relinquish, for example,
if a child has been abused; the case is likely to be treated
as an abandonment rather than relinquishment, and
the relinquisher can be prosecuted for their abusive
actions. States also vary in terms of who can accept
the baby and the protections that they would get from
liability. In addition, states vary in terms of the rights of
the relinquishing parent (e.g., whether they can change
their minds) as well as the rights of the children (e.g.,
whether their medical history can be taken by the
relinquisher). The rights of fathers also vary, with
some states requiring a search for the natural father.
Although it may be a general rule that safe haven laws
permit abandonment without fear or prosecution,
is permitted certainly varies and that
then, what
variation highlights well some of the important con-
siderations that can arise in cases of abandonment.

In addition to their remarkable variation, safe
haven laws are notable for the extent to which they
have attracted considerable controversy as well as
their relative ineffectiveness (Sanger 2006). Although
they have helped assuage fears of children being killed
or otherwise harmed by parents who no longer wanted
them, available evidence has yet to support their effec-
tiveness (see Pollock and Hittle 2003). The legal
responses also have been seen as problematic in that
they do not seek to identify and serve the young women
who feel isolated and lack access to resources and
support in times of crisis leading to abandonment.
This lack of a broader perspective makes this area

important to the study of adolescence as it necessarily
involves the need to address broader issues relating
to adolescent sexuality and pregnancy, enhance com-
munication among youth, families, and communities,
and develop supportive networks for adolescents in
need. These broader issues go to the core of the study
of adolescence as well as the core of efforts that can
eventually address abandonment and its consequences.

Abnormality

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Conceptions of abnormality are at the center of the
study of mental health and healthy development, both
generally and as applied to the adolescent period. Yet,
what constitutes abnormality continues to be the
considerable debate and controversy.
subject of
A close examination of the study of abnormality and
disorder reveals that there are many ways to approach
the notion of abnormality, all of which have their
limitations and strengths.

Controversies surrounding conceptions of disorder
and abnormality emerged quite forcefully a few decades
ago, especially in popular culture, as they were sparked
by the writings of Thomas Szaz (1971, 1974) who
argued that mental disorders could be conceived as
a function of subjective societal values and were, in
essence, myths. Although his model was unable to

Abnormality A 3

A

explain why some socially disapproved beliefs were not
deemed pathological (such as rudeness or some forms
of racism), his conceptualization did focus on a key
point of abnormality, which is that abnormality at least
partly constitutes conditions deemed undesirable and
that societal conditions ﬁgure prominently in determin-
ing what should be deemed undesirable in the ﬁrst
instance. This approach was championed by many
who questioned whether the concept of mental disorder
actually existed, and viewed it as a myth that justiﬁed
the use of medical power to intervene in socially
disapproved behavior (see Foucault 1964/1965; Sarbind
1969). This skeptical view, having made important
points, still left much to be examined, as highlighted
by other efforts to deﬁne and understand abnormality.
One of the most expected ways to conceptualize
abnormality relies on the statistical conception of nor-
mal. Cohen (1981) provided the most authoritative
statement on a statistical approach to disorder in
which he viewed disease as a quantitative deviation
from the statistical norm. The approach has consider-
able merit, as statistical deviations are critical to several
deﬁnitions of disorders, such as intelligence. Yet, statis-
tical deviation above the norm may be viewed as
healthy, and even arguing that deviation must be in
the negative direction to be deemed abnormal in the
sense of being a disorder remains problematic since
some behaviors can be statistically deviant but still
not disorders (such as immoral or criminal behaviors).
Still, disorders often are statistically deviant, and deter-
mining what would constitute a disorder would require
imposing either subjective or objective judgments on
that statistical deviance.

Another approach to determining what constitutes
abnormality relies on the notion that it simply is what
health professionals treat (see Taylor 1976). This
approach has some appeal in that it takes a pragmatic
approach focusing on conditions that elicit interven-
tions from mental health professionals, centers on
patients and professionals, and may circumvent issues
relating to broader societal value judgments. Still, the
approach has its limitations in that many conditions
treated by professionals (e.g., pregnancy or parent–
child conﬂicts) may not be pathological yet still evoke
a need for professional assistance. Perhaps even more
problematic, this approach runs the risk of having both
patients and professionals being wrong about what
constitutes a disorder and, equally problematically, it

can lead to not viewing disorders as disorders until
those in treatment view them as such. Thus, this
approach may have considerable merit but it still
lacks a general concern for broader societal or group
judgments.

Other models focus less on enlisting social criteria
and personal value judgments and more on invoking
biological criteria. Some, for example, have argued that
abnormality should be deﬁned by relying strictly on
such biological criteria derived from evolutionary
theory (see Kendell 1975). These would include iden-
tifying as abnormal conditions that reduced one’s life
span or reduced reproductive ﬁtness. Although this
approach has the advantage of trying to be objective,
it still necessarily relies on value judgments in determi-
nations of what would be considered disadvantageous.
The approach also encounters important limitations in
that many disadvantages may be due to environments,
and many disadvantages are tied to intrinsic conditions
(males die younger than females) and not to disorders.
Yet another approach conceives of abnormality as
harmful dysfunction. This approach (see Wakeﬁeld
1992) champions a view that takes into account social
values in the concept of harm and more objective
approaches through focusing on dysfunction. The
approach seeks to distinguish conceptions of abnor-
mality that are socially constructed from those that are
arguably more scientiﬁc. Although the approach has
considerable merit, it too is subject to limitations in
that there are no clear cut deﬁnitions of dysfunction
and adaptive functions, and there may not be clear
dividing
and abnormal
functioning.

lines between normal

Arguably, the most widely accepted view of abnor-
mality and disorder comes from the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual (DSM), now in its 4th edition and
published by the American Psychiatric Association
(2000). The DSM’s deﬁnition has been relatively
unchanged since its third edition. Its criteria for
disorder
focus on notions of distress, disability,
expectability, and dysfunction. The concept of disabil-
ity is meant to capture behavioral and observable com-
ponents while the notion of distress seeks to capture the
more subjective and experiential aspects of mental dis-
order. The focus on expectability highlights a focus on
statistical norms and what is likely within a normal
range. The focus on dysfunction denotes a breakdown
or disruption indicating a failure to perform functions,

which was meant to provide a more objective view of
abnormality that resisted a focus on social value judg-
ments. Although the DSM’s approach brings together
many others, it too has been widely criticized, as illus-
trated by studies highlighting different manifestations
of mental disorders worldwide (see, e.g., Kleinman and
Cohen 1997) as well as by commentaries highlighting
the inherent problems with the use of terms like “dys-
function” to deﬁne disorder (see, e.g., Wakeﬁeld 1992)
and arguing that the approach to diagnoses lacks sufﬁ-
cient clinical utility (see Andersson and Ghaderi 2006).
revolving around deﬁnitions of
abnormality are likely to continue. They likely are to
do so given the challenges of identifying clear criteria
for abnormality and changing societal views of what
can be deemed valued. Still, despite these controversies,
researchers and theorists do tend to rely on overlapping
criteria for what constitutes abnormality, a tendency
that helps to account for the remarkable consensus that
does exist regarding whether speciﬁc conditions could
be deemed abnormal.

Abortion Counseling

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Unwanted pregnancies leading to abortions are com-
mon life events, and they relate directly to youth.
Approximately 22% of the 205 million annual preg-
nancies end in abortion (Sedgh et al. 2007), and in 2004
individuals less than 19 comprised approximately
17.4% of completed abortions while 32.8% were ages
20–24. Despite its prevalence, abortions raise a host of
social and legal issues that challenge basic values and
foster intense controversy. Indeed, researchers often
charge that the scientiﬁc enterprise in this area of
study is being manipulated and that research ﬁndings
are being misrepresented to justify particular social
agendas, especially efforts involving access to contra-
ception and abortion (see Russo and Denious 2005).
Those controversies likely will continue, especially as
they relate to mothers’ mental health outcomes relating
to abortions, and particularly as they relate to adoles-
cents and their status (with research noting varied
outcomes and mostly focusing on adult women; see
Major et al. 2009). Although controversies tend to
focus on elective abortions, this essay examines all
three main types of abortion – therapeutic, elective,
and spontaneous abortions, and some of the important
legal and clinical issues they might raise for adolescents.
Therapeutic and elective abortions typically are
considered together, although they can be deemed
considerably different. Therapeutic abortion is the
deliberate termination of a pregnancy aimed at pre-
serving the mental or physical health of the mother,
preventing the birth of a lethally defective fetus, or
reducing the number of fetuses in multiple conceptions
to reduce health risks. Thus, an elective abortion is one
done for any other reason. Over 90% of abortions
occur during the ﬁrst trimester, either utilizing surgical

Abortion Counseling A 5

A

or nonsurgical procedures. Vacuum aspiration may be
used during weeks 6–12, and medicinal abortion
between weeks 0–9. Surgical options available after
the ﬁrst trimester are dilation and curettage used
during 12–15 weeks, and dilation and evacuation is
used 15–12 weeks. Dilation and extraction, performed
after 21 weeks, is largely illegal in the USA since the
passing of the Partial-birth Abortion Ban of 2003,
which the Supreme Court upheld in Gonzales v.
Carhart (2007). The legal foundation of that case is
important to consider given that it directly concerns
many of the legal and policy issues relating to elective
and therapeutic abortions, and those issues directly
relate to counseling contexts.

In Carhart, the Court held that the partial-birth
abortion ban did not impose an undue burden on the
due process right of women to obtain an abortion. The
Court did so by noting that the burden was not imper-
missible as framed under precedents assumed to be
controlling, such as the Court’s prior decisions in Roe
v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992). Roe v. Wade had recog-
nized that a right to privacy under the due process
clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution extends to a woman’s decision to
have an abortion, but it had noted that the right needed
to be balanced against the government’s legitimate
interests for regulating abortions (protecting prenatal
life and protecting the mother’s health). Finding that
the state’s interests grew over the course of the preg-
nancy, the Court ruled in favor of permitting greater
state regulation depending on the trimester of the
pregnancy. That approach would be modiﬁed later to
permit a right to abortion up to the point of viability,
which is usually placed at 7 months (28 weeks) but may
occur earlier. The Court adopted the viability approach
in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.
Casey (1992).

In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania
v. Casey (1992), a deeply divided Court rendered
a plurality opinion that recognized viability as the
point at which the state interest in the life of the fetus
outweighs the rights of the woman and abortion may
be banned entirely except where it is necessary, in
appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of
the life or health of the mother. The plurality opinion in
Casey also crafted the rule that a restriction would be
impermissible if it posed an undue burden on women’s

rights to seek an abortion, with the undue burden
deﬁned as a restriction that had the purpose or effect
of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman
seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. Speciﬁcally in
this case, the Court used the standard to ﬁnd imper-
missible the need for spousal notiﬁcations but upheld
the use of 24-hour waiting periods, informed consent,
and parental consent requirements on the grounds that
they did not pose undue burdens. The focus on
informed consent was to ensure that women had fuller
knowledge of what abortions were and parental
consent requirements were efforts to ensure (with
some exceptions) that parents were involved in the
minor’s decision-making. These provisions highlight
the tension between a focus on individual rights and
a focus on seeking to ensure that individuals make
deliberate decisions.

The tension between individual rights and those of
others who might have a stake in the abortion decision
is worth highlighting in that it is particularly important
for adolescents. As noted, the Court in Planned Parent-
hood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992)
had considered, among other provisions, the parental
consent measure of an abortion statute. The statute
provided that, except in a medical emergency, the
informed consent of at least one parent (or guardian)
was required before an unemancipated minor could
obtain an abortion. The statute also provided a judicial
bypass procedure, if neither parent gave consent, upon
a ﬁnding that the young woman was sufﬁciently mature
or that an abortion would be in her best interests. The
Court ruled that a state may require a minor seeking an
abortion to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian,
provided that there is an adequate judicial bypass
procedure. That approach conﬁrmed what the Court
had previously noted, in passing, in prior cases, most
notably Bellotti v. Baird (1979). It was in Bellotti that
the Court had noted criteria that could make for
a constitutional bypass provision. The provision must
allow the minor to bypass the consent requirement if
she establishes that she is mature enough and well
enough informed to make the abortion decision inde-
pendently, must allow the minor to bypass the consent
requirement if she establishes that the abortion would
be in her best interests, must ensure the minor’s ano-
nymity, and must provide for expeditious bypass pro-
cedures. The Court strictly foreclosed parents’ absolute
right to be consulted about, much less veto, their child’s

6 A Abortion Counseling

decision to abort. This recognition has led the Court to
require states to provide access to an alternative deci-
sion-maker, such as a judge, when the state imposes
parental notice and consent conditions on the minor’s
abortion decision. This balance serves as a compromise
position between according minors the right to make
their own decisions concerning the continuation of
a pregnancy and according parents or guardians’
unchallenged authority to determine whether the preg-
nancy must be continued to term. But it does recognize
that parents can serve important functions in that
minors typically lack valuable attributes and resources
(such as ﬁnancial stability, education, and maturity)
that an adult would be more likely to bring to a situation
of unwanted motherhood. Clearly, whether parents are
notiﬁed or give consent raises important tensions, and
these same tensions emerge in counseling.

Important issues arise in counseling contexts, and
they can vary throughout the decision-making process.
In therapeutic abortion, individuals must ﬁrst decide
whether to continue with the pregnancy despite the
risks. If indeed the pregnancy is wanted and possibly
difﬁcult to achieve, efforts are made to address poten-
tial feelings of uncertainty, grief, or despair. In these
contexts, ethical and religious questions likely arise. In
procedures involving elective abortion, pre-abortion
counseling seeks to aid in the decision-making process
and consideration of reasons and options. Counseling
involves considering not only obstacles from their aca-
demic, career, and life plans but also responses from
families or communities. Adolescent girls likely are in
different positions than adults in that they also likely
must consider their readiness for parenthood, stunted
development, and family discord. In elective abortion
contexts, postabortion counseling may not be neces-
sary, as a range of emotions may be present including
sadness, anxiety, guilt, regret, but also positive emo-
tions. Counseling most likely is needed in contexts
where the adolescent lacks social support, feels coerced
in the decision-making, has high ambivalence, or has
other preexisting circumstances that can contribute to
negative postabortion reactions. For postabortion
counseling, no standards have been published; how-
ever, women generally are helped to identify emotions
and life circumstances impacted by their decision.
Psychoeducation may be given regarding new coping
skills, and religious aspects may be considered to facil-
itate personal resolution. Importantly and depending

on resolutions, counseling may be provided during the
process itself, and it also may be needed later.

Spontaneous abortions, or miscarriages, occur
before 27 weeks of pregnancy and result in infant
death. While 12–15% of clinically known pregnancies
end in miscarriage, many more occur before anyone
recognizes the pregnancy, thus increasing the miscar-
riage rate to an estimated 45–50% of all pregnancies.
Risk appears to increase with age, with women ages
20–24 having a 9% chance. Sometimes miscarriages
may be physically painful processes, with the negative
experiences sometimes compounded by the very pri-
vate nature of the event. Miscarriage puts individuals at
risk for depressive symptoms, major depression, anxi-
ety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic-
stress disorder (Klier et al. 2002; Geller et al. 2004).
Some women may be concerned about immediate
medical issues and underlying factors for the miscar-
riage. Here, post-loss counseling aims to validate death
and normalize feelings of grief. Symptom reduction,
grief management, utilization of coping resources, and
psychosocial factors also may be addressed. Research in
this area has not centered on the needs of adolescents,
although adolescents’ status and developmental needs
may raise distinct issues.

Whether intentional or unintentional, abortion
remains prevalent. It necessarily involves numerous
complex and difﬁcult issues. Those issues are likely
even more complex when dealing with adolescents.
In addition to dealing with psychological, moral,
and social considerations, this area of adolescents’
experiences also involves complex laws that raise
important issues and try to balance many rights and
responsibilities. Despite
and
perhaps because of intense controversies, research rel-
evant to adolescents has been sporadic and much of the
research in this area, including writings that focus on
clinical
issues, tends not to focus on adolescents’
particular needs (see Coleman 2006; Levesque 2000).

Abortion Rights

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

One of the most important issues facing adolescents
involves the extent to which their right to privacy will
be respected, and that right is implicated in a broad
variety of potential contexts and circumstances. In the
United States, a key area where this issue has been
litigated has been in the context of abortion. This
context is of signiﬁcance in and of itself as well as for
demonstrating how the legal system approaches the
rights of adolescents. As a result, Bellotti v. Baird
(1979), the leading Supreme Court case dealing with
adolescents’ rights to access abortions without the
involvement of their parents, is one of the most impor-
tant United States Supreme Court decisions dealing
with the adolescent period. The case and this area of
law address the fundamental issue of the extent to
which adolescents can have rights of their own and,
equally importantly, the extent to which they can
control the exercise of those rights.

Bellotti involved a Massachusetts law requiring par-
ents to consent for minors who were seeking abortions.

refuse consent,

The law had provided that if one or both parents of the
the minor could obtain
minor
a judicial order permitting the abortion if they were
able to show good cause. On appeal to the United
States Supreme Court, the Justices were unable to
agree on a single opinion that would announce the
rule and reasoning for its decision, but eight members
of the Court agreed that the Massachusetts statute
violated the United States Constitution. The law,
according to the Supreme Court, violated the indepen-
dent rights of minors to seek and obtain abortions.
Among other ﬁndings,
the Court required states
to respect mature minors’ rights to exercise their
right to access abortions and, by doing so, recognized
minors’ own rights without requiring parental involve-
ment. That general rule is worth exploring in greater
detail as it has important consequences for protecting
the rights of adolescents, especially those rights that
would be deemed fundamental and highly protected if
they were adults.

The case had multiple opinions that focused on
different aspects of adolescents’ rights. One of the
opinions (by four members of the Court) provided
the key ruling in the case. The opinion reasoned that
states need not require parental involvement in adoles-
cents’ decisions regarding abortions. However, if they
do seek to require a pregnant minor to obtain one or
both parents’ consent to an abortion, they also must
provide an alternative procedure for obtaining autho-
rization for the abortion. Alternative procedures must
allow a pregnant minor the opportunity to show either
(1) that she is mature enough and well enough
informed to make her abortion decision, in consulta-
tion with her physician, independently of her parents’
wishes, or (2) that even if she is not able to make the
decision independently, the abortion desired would be
in her best interests. The state also must ensure that
such proceedings assure that a resolution of the issue,
and any appeals that might follow, will be completed
with anonymity and with sufﬁcient expedition to
provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be
performed. Following that reasoning, the Court held
that the Massachusetts statute unduly burdened the
constitutional right to seek an abortion because it
permitted the withholding of judicial authorization
for an abortion for a minor found to be mature
and fully competent to decide to have an abortion; it
was also unconstitutional because it required parental

consultation or notiﬁcation in every instance, without
affording a pregnant minor an opportunity to receive
an independent judicial determination that she is
mature enough to consent to an abortion or that an
abortion would be in her best interests.

The case also had an important concurring opinion
and a strong dissent. A concurring opinion (also by
four members of the Court) expressed the view that
a pregnant minor’s right to make the abortion decision
may not be conditioned on the consent of one parent,
especially given the Court’s earlier decisions holding
that a woman’s right to decide whether to terminate
a pregnancy is entitled to constitutional protection.
Given that reasoning, the statute was unconstitutional
because under it no minor, no matter how mature and
capable of informed decisionmaking, might receive an
abortion without the consent of either both of her
parents or a judge, there thus being, in every instance,
an absolute third-party veto to which a minor’s deci-
sion to have an abortion was subject. A dissenting
opinion expressed the view that the statute was not
unconstitutional in requiring parental consent when
an unmarried woman under 18 years of age seeks an
abortion.

In addition to being important for this area of
jurisprudence, as noted above, the case was important
for what it highlighted about the rights of minors. The
Court emphasized that minors are not beyond the
protection of the Constitution. The Court noted that
the legal system typically favors the rights of parents to
raise their children as they see ﬁt, it did so by highlight-
ing three fundamental rationales for justifying the
conclusion that the constitutional rights of children
cannot be equated with those of adults: the peculiar
vulnerability of children; their inability to make critical
decisions in an informed, mature manner; and the
importance of the parental role in child rearing. By
supporting the power of parents to control the rights
of adolescents under those conditions, the Court also
laid the groundwork for the opposite. That is, when
rights, adolescents are
dealing with fundamental
increasingly given control over those rights if they can
show that they are not peculiarly vulnerable, can make
informed and mature decisions, and the parents’ role is
attenuated in the matter. If these conditions are met,
then adolescents are more likely to be able to control
their own rights or states are more likely to provide
mechanisms for them to demonstrate that they should

be able to exercise their rights. The legitimacy of this
approach was conﬁrmed in this case’s approval of the
“judicial bypass” provision – the stipulation that states
must provide minors with an opportunity to demon-
strate that they are mature enough to not engage their
parents and can make their own decisions or, in the
alternative, another decision maker can decide what
course of action should be taken if the minor is not
mature enough.

The case is of signiﬁcance for recognizing the rights
of minors to control some very important decisions, as
it arguably includes the right to privacy on which
abortion decisions are made. But the case actually is
considerably limiting (see Levesque 2000). For exam-
ple, in practice, the judicial bypasses have tended to be
unnecessary since adolescents tend to be quite mature
if they can ﬁgure out that they can seek a judicial bypass
and, as it turns out, most are found mature by judges.
Also in practice, especially as it relates to abortions, the
need for appearances in court results in delays and
other obstacles which, in theory, should be avoided
due to the urgencies involved and, as many have
argued, since the use of the judicial bypass brings little
of value to the minors or their families. Despite these
and other criticisms, the bypass requirements are likely
to continue given that they do provide a balance
between the rights of parents and those of their chil-
dren and they do, in many ways, help reinforce parental
rights, which remains the dominant standard. In fact,
the focus on judicial bypasses was what allowed the
Supreme Court to permit laws requiring parental
notiﬁcation that minors were seeking abortions (see
Hodgson v. Minnesota 1990). The provision of alterna-
tives means that the major rule, the rights of parents,
remains, which is something of considerable signiﬁ-
cance given that it is not clear whether and how
adolescents will know of alternatives and thus avail
themselves of them.

Abstention

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Abstention refers to a deliberate act of self-denial. The
period of adolescence involves considerable absten-
tion, especially in the form of social and legal efforts
to encourage adolescents to abstain from engaging in
numerous types of behaviors. Included among the
most
frequent behaviors that adolescents abstain
from are smoking (Jacobsen et al. 2005), consuming
alcohol and illicit drugs (Rosenberg et al. 2008), engag-
ing in sexual activity (Loewenson et al. 2004), as well as
general delinquency (Boutwell and Beaver 2008). Our
society has developed and continues to support numer-
ous institutions that help adolescents abstain and that
even can use the force of law to have adolescents abstain
from activities deemed problematic. Illustrative of
justice
these efforts are the juvenile and criminal
systems, schools, health-care institutions, as well as
families. These institutions also embrace efforts to
help adolescents abstain from more socially acceptable
and legally permissible activities, such as using poten-
tially harmful products like caffeine (Oberstar et al.
2002), sugared products (French et al. 2003), and
even the media (Levesque 2007). Given the recognition
of the need to prevent negative health and its associ-
ated outcomes, the period of adolescence always has
been a period that has attracted considerable efforts to
foster habits that would result in having adolescents
abstain from an ever-increasing amount of activities
deemed potentially problematic. These efforts always
have attracted considerable controversy, as evidenced

education (Levesque 2000), since they go to the heart
of what it means to be an adolescent: someone who is
considered to be in transition and who needs special
supports to transition through a period that likely

development.

Overview
The majority of teenagers in the USA begin their
adolescence in a state of sexual abstinence and end it
sexually active. These before and after points are
known, but there is much about adolescents’ absti-
nence behavior and meaning-making that is not. This
essay summarizes the state of scientiﬁc and scholarly
knowledge about abstinence in the lives of teenagers. It
places abstinence in its social and political context,
discusses various deﬁnitions of abstinence, examines
research on the goals of abstinence and whether it
achieves them, and considers potential beneﬁts and
harms of abstinence to adolescents, while highlighting
gaps in knowledge and areas of controversy.

10 A Abstinence

The majority of teenagers in the USA begin their ado-
lescence in a state of sexual abstinence and end it
sexually active. While fewer than one in eight 15 year
olds have ever had sex, 70% of 19 year olds have had
vaginal sexual intercourse (Abma et al. 2004). Though
these before and after points are known, there is much
about adolescents’ abstinence behavior and meaning-
making that is not. This essay will summarize what
is known about abstinence in the lives of teenagers
while highlighting gaps in knowledge and areas of
controversy.

The Social and Political Context
of Abstinence
Any consideration of abstinence among US adolescents
must be situated within the socio-political context of
abstinence-only education. Unlike other wealthy,
industrialized democracies, for the past few decades,
the USA has emphasized sexuality education programs
for teenagers that instruct adolescents to abstain from
sex until they are married or to become “secondary
virgins” by ceasing sexual activity until marriage. This
federal policy, only very recently ended, has brought
the concept of abstinence to prominence among those
who study and provide care for adolescents, but has left
it ill-deﬁned and not well understood.

Abstinence is most often studied in the context
of research into sexual behavior, cognitions, and
emotions. This context has had several effects upon
the populations generally studied. It can be difﬁcult
to obtain parental consent, institutional approval, and
funding for the study of sexuality-related phenomena
among young adolescents, unless these adolescents are
members of a group seen as particularly vulnerable to
negative sexual outcomes such as teen pregnancy or
sexually transmitted infections
the
majority of studies that investigate abstinence either
work with older, easier to reach adolescents such as
college students, or they focus on these “at-risk”
groups, especially African-American teenagers and
girls. Two important exceptions are data on abstinence
and sexual behavior from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative
study of seventh- to twelfth-graders that began in 1995,
and data from a nationally representative sample of
adults reporting on their adolescent experiences in
the National Sexual Health Survey, carried out in
1995–1996.

(STIs). Thus,

What is Abstinence?
Clinicians, educators, and parents often assume that
adolescents regard “having sex” and “being abstinent”
as opposites. In fact, research suggests that youths’
understanding of these constructs is more complex.
There is a solid consensus across studies of how adoles-
cents deﬁne abstinence that vaginal intercourse “counts”
as having sex, and that avoiding all erotic contact, even
kissing, constitutes abstinence. However, much less
agreement is found about behaviors such as mutual
masturbation, oral sex, and anal sex. Some adolescents
deﬁne these acts as sex, while others, possibly working
from an “anything but vaginal intercourse” point of
view, deﬁne them as abstinence (Byers et al. 2009).

The appropriate role of abstinence in youths’ lives is
another topic on which adolescents’ perspectives may
diverge from those of some adults. Many adolescents
report thinking of abstinence as a way of protecting
themselves against the potentially negative social and
physical consequences of sex. Others report viewing
the practice of abstinence as a moral or religious
choice. However, most youth also see abstinence as
a developmental stage rather than a steady state, and
perceive it as part of the trajectory that eventually leads
to partnered sexual activity (Ott et al. 2006). In this
conceptualization, adolescents who have stepped onto
the “sexual escalator” start at abstinence and move
toward sex (Masters et al. 2008).

Abstinence may be consciously chosen by some
teenagers as a values-driven practice, as a sexual risk
reduction method, or as a combination of both. This
notion of abstinence applies to youth who have oppor-
tunities to engage in partnered sexual behavior but
chose not to do so. However, research suggests that
many teenagers, both those who have already experi-
enced ﬁrst intercourse and those who have not, simply
lack frequent sexual opportunities. They may not have
a sexual partner, or having a willing partner, may not
have the privacy, space, or time for sex. These youths’
behavior – not having sex – may appear from the
outside to be identical to that of youth who are absti-
nent on purpose, but the behavior’s meaning to them,
and its role in their sexual and relational development,
is likely to be very different.

These deﬁnitional issues are of both practical and
conceptual interest to those who work with youth.
Practically, adolescents who view their behavior (e.g.,
oral sex) as abstinent rather than as sexual may be less

likely to practice sexual risk reduction, thus increasing
their risk of STIs. Attempts to be abstinent according to
the “anything but vaginal
intercourse” deﬁnition
apparently held by some teenagers may paradoxically
lead to even higher risk sexual behavior, such as the
anecdotal reports of young women substituting anal
sex, with its attendant higher risk of HIV transmission,
for vaginal sex as a method of “virginity preservation.”
Conceptually, researchers and clinicians attempting to
assess adolescents’ abstinence practices may need to be
more behaviorally explicit about how they ask their
questions, rather than assuming a shared deﬁnition of
abstinence. Attention to why adolescents are abstinent
also seems warranted: There are likely to be important
differences between the abstinence of an 18-year-old
Catholic girl who is saving intercourse for marriage and
that of a 15-year-old boy from a secular family who also
has never had partnered sex, but who aspires to do so at
the earliest opportunity.

Does Abstinence “Work”?
Abstinence is sometimes described as being 100%
effective in preventing pregnancy and STIs. However,
if abstinence is considered as a contraceptive or STI
prevention method rather than as a values-governed
practice, it has, like all such methods, a failure rate. This
failure rate is the difference between perfect use
(abstaining from sex at every sexual opportunity) and
typical use (intending to be abstinent, but not having
100% success doing so). Prevention methods such as
condoms are susceptible to both user failure and
method failure; all abstinence failure, clearly, is user
failure.

Very little research investigating the failure rate of
abstinence as a contraceptive or STI preventative has
been done. Mathematical modeling based on the
assumption that typical abstinence use is less than
100% demonstrates that partial abstinence (infrequent
sex) provides some protection against infections with
a low per-act probability of transmission, such as HIV.
However, for those infections with a high per-act prob-
ability of transmission, such as syphilis and Chlamydia,
and for pregnancy, abstinence needs to be nearly
perfect to reduce risk effectively (Pinkerton 2001).
A study using nationally representative data examined
the effectiveness of virginity pledges (public statements
of commitment to abstinence until marriage) in reduc-
ing STI rates among young adults. Rates of STI, as

Abstinence A 11

measured with biomarkers, did not differ between
young adults who had taken abstinence pledges as
adolescents and those who had not (Bruckner and
Bearman 2005). Both of these ﬁndings suggest the
relative ineffectiveness of abstinence, as practiced in
real life, at preventing most STIs and pregnancy.

A

Is Abstinence Good for Adolescents?
Abstinence until marriage, the average age of which –
now 27 for men and 25 for women – is older with each
generation, seems increasingly unlikely for most ado-
lescents (Finer 2007). Nonetheless, some abstinence
advocates assert that premarital sex is inherently dan-
gerous to teenagers, likely to result in physical and
psychological harm. Any given sex act may indeed result
in a negative physical, social, or emotional outcome
such as contracting an STI, becoming unintentionally
pregnant, being teased or stigmatized by peers, or
wounded feelings. However, research suggests that
whether people’s initial sexual experiences occur before
marriage does not affect their long-term physical or
emotional health. Rather, the context in which an ado-
lescent begins to have partnered sex is the more critical
factor: If the experience is pre-pubertal, incestuous,
forced, or coerced, then this is likely to affect later
functioning; otherwise, premarital sex is not associated
with negative health outcomes in adulthood (Else-
Quest et al. 2005). Another study using nationally rep-
resentative data classiﬁed ages at ﬁrst intercourse as early
(lowest quartile, mean age 14), normative (middle two
quartiles, mean age 17), or late (highest quartile, mean
age 22) based on adults’ reports of their adolescent
experiences. Both early and late sexual initiations were
associated with problems in sexual functioning, espe-
cially among men. Initiation before marriage, but within
normative age ranges, was not associated with sexual
difﬁculties or general ill-health (Sandfort et al. 2008).

Other research suggests that not only may absti-
nence, in some situations, offer little beneﬁt to youth, it
may also have its own potentially harmful effects. Teen-
agers’ identiﬁcation of themselves as people committed
to abstinence may keep them from considering situa-
tions in which they might someday choose to engage in
sexual behavior and from learning how they might then
protect themselves against unwanted pregnancy and
STIs. Uncritical endorsement of abstinence as the
only appropriate choice for adolescents is often linked
with a view of sexual behavior that minimizes the role

12 A Abstinence Education

of personal choice and agency in making sexual deci-
sions, particularly for young women (Tolman 2002).
“Virginity pledging” is associated with a reduced like-
lihood of contraceptive or condom use at ﬁrst inter-
course (Bearman and Bruckner 2001).

Abstinence advocacy by educators, policy makers,
and health care providers can also cause social harm to
the adolescents it excludes. Such discussions rarely
acknowledge the experience of sexual minority adoles-
cents. This lack can be attributed to the inﬂuence of
teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock birth prevention
goals on contemporary thinking about abstinence;
conceptualizations of abstinence that frame it as a way
to avoid “illegitimate” births will naturally tend to be
hetero-centric. One of the tenets of the pro-abstinence
movement in the USA is that a monogamous married
relationship is the standard of human sexual activity.
Since gay men and lesbians cannot legally marry in the
majority of states, sexual minority teens are left with no
guidance on how to make an informed, values-driven
decision about whether or when to begin partnered
sexual activity. This exclusion can contribute to the
marginalization of an already vulnerable group of
adolescents.

For some adolescents, in some situations, absti-
nence can be a very positive choice. Most youth will
experience an abstinent period during which they are
riding the “sexual escalator” but do not yet feel ready
for intercourse. They may experiment with physical
intimacy and participate in relationships that include
noncoital sexual behavior during this period. Some
youth will be members of communities with a moral
or religious framework that values abstinence until
marriage, and choosing to enact this value consistently
in their own lives may be a practice of empowerment,
safety, and integrity for them. However, youth with
different ethical frameworks may initiate partnered
sex outside of marriage, and it is equally possible for
them to take this action with empowerment, safety, and
integrity.

Adolescents have many choices for safe, healthy,
ethical expression of their sexuality,
including the
choice of abstinence. Teenagers who are informed of
these options by adults, and taught skills both for
refusing unwanted sex and for negotiating wanted
sex, sexual safety, and pregnancy prevention, will be
more likely to traverse their adolescence successfully
and establish fulﬁlling adult relationships.

Overview
“Abstinence education” (also known as abstinence-only,
abstinence-only-until-marriage
abstinence-plus,

or

education) has, in recent years, become a specialized
label, a technical term employed by educators, politi-
cians, youth advocates, and public health workers in
the USA. The label identiﬁes a particular moral and
educational agenda shaping what has been taught
about human sexuality within USA public schools,
since the 1980s. Approaches to teaching sexuality that
lack the characteristics of
this particular agenda
(described in more detail, below) are titled, in turn,
“comprehensive sexuality education.” Labeling or
branding these educational efforts has facilitated their
polarization, their validation as entrepreneurial efforts,
and their entanglement in an ongoing, bitter dispute
over the best strategies to teach children and adoles-
cents about sexual health.

This brief essay – far from an exhaustive account of
the issue – reviews the polemics surrounding absti-
nence education, summarizes abstinence education’s
history in the USA, and reﬂects on the role sexual
abstinence plays in adolescent development. In each
of these segments, readers will ﬁnd the views of absti-
nence education proponents presented alongside the
perspectives of its critics. As abstinence education and
comprehensive sexuality education have coexisted
within US public schools, the juxtaposition presented
here is intentional because it highlights the complex
dynamics and “subtle dance” between two distinct
sexuality education paradigms.

It is important to bear in mind that abstinence
education is not unique to the USA, however. Uganda,
for instance, has promoted a public health campaign to
prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS based on the “ABC”
approach (“abstain, be faithful, condomise”; see http://
www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm for details on the varia-
tions on the ABC deﬁnition). Nevertheless, many of
the abstinence education initiatives being implemented
in various countries have their philosophical and
methodological origins in the USA movement. Due to
space constraints, this essay will focus exclusively on
abstinence education efforts in the USA.

Abstinence Education or
Comprehensive Sexuality Education?
Participants on both sides of the issue tend to agree on
a basic, bare-bones deﬁnition of abstinence education:
Abstinence education directs children and adolescents
to deliberately and voluntarily avoid “having sex”
(speciﬁcally, to avoid penile–vaginal intercourse) until

Abstinence Education A 13

A

behaviors,

they are married, in order to prevent an unintended
pregnancy or various sexually transmitted infections
(or STIs). Such restraint is viewed as the healthiest
way of circumventing the undesirable consequences
associated with certain sexual
and
maintaining the sexual health of children and adoles-
cents. While proponents and critics of abstinence
education tend to agree on this basic deﬁnition, how-
ever, they differ signiﬁcantly regarding the scope and
methods for teaching abstinence in a developmentally
appropriate manner. Some of the questions ﬁercely
debated by friends and foes include, for example,
“Abstinence from which behaviors, speciﬁcally, should
be taught?” And, “Should information about sexual
anatomy and physiology also be presented?”

When evaluating a particular type of abstinence
education – programs funded by Title V in Texas
between the years 2000 and 2005 (see description of
Title V funding, below) – the authors of this essay and
their evaluation team quickly learned that programs’
deﬁnitions of abstinence (and, by extension, of absti-
nence education) were surprisingly more nuanced and
complex than the bare-bones deﬁnition presented
above. The team learned that abstinence consisted of
not only avoiding sexual activity (however sexual activ-
ity was deﬁned), but also adopting or assimilating
a series of behaviors, intentions, and attitudes, perti-
nent to an “abstinent-life-style.” In other words, to be
considered truly “abstinent” by abstinence education
proponents, adolescents should also adopt a positive
view of sexless relationships, of their own academic/
themselves as worthy
professional
of
human
▶ self-esteem). Alongside this repertoire of attitudes,
“truly abstinent
teens” should also avoid many
noncoital sexual behaviors (in some instances, even
hand-holding) and other practices such as becoming
friends with peers who are sexually active, using/abus-
ing alcohol and drugs, and consuming media with
sexual content (pornography, erotic movies, rap lyrics).

various deﬁnitions of abstinence, see Goodson et al.

integrity, and loyalty. Abstinence education curricula
also place a strong emphasis on inﬂuencing/shaping
individual-level psychological factors such as percep-
tions of social norms and, ultimately, self-esteem. Little
(and sometimes no) emphasis is placed on teaching
about healthy sexuality in its various dimensions
(relationships, sexual communication, sexual identity,
sexual anatomy, physiology, reproduction, contraception,
infection prevention).

In contrast, comprehensive sexuality education is
less directive and places stronger emphasis on teaching
about all the dimensions of sexual health, including
abstinence, using developmentally appropriate strate-
gies. Those who support comprehensive sexuality
education do so grounded in the assumption that
knowledge is power, and withholding information
from youth (information that could, potentially, save
their lives and protect their health) is nothing short of
unethical and tantamount to educational misconduct.
Comprehensive sexuality education, therefore, pro-
poses that youth should have access to all available
knowledge about human sexuality, in ways that are
appropriate for their age. While such knowledge
includes information about sexual anatomy, physiol-
ogy, and protection from diseases or unwanted preg-
nancies, abstinence from risky sexual behavior is
equally an essential element of this knowledge-base.

comprehensive

This assumption – that information imparted in
developmentally appropriate ways is empowering and
ethical – has led one of the major organizations
involved in promoting
sexuality
education in the USA – the Sexuality Information and
Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) – to
propose a set of guidelines for educators teaching
sexual health to various age groups. These recommen-
dations can be found in the publication Guidelines for
Comprehensive Sexuality Education: Kindergarten –
12th Grade (National Guidelines Task Force 2004).

Despite the emphasis on teaching all dimensions of
sexual health, comprehensive sexuality education has
consistently highlighted the message that abstinence
from intercourse is the healthiest form of “sexually
being in the world” for all children and most

adolescents. As in the case of abstinence education,
comprehensive sexuality education views the teaching
of sexual abstinence as healthy and desirable. Compre-
hensive sexuality education’s dispute with abstinence
education centers, however, in abstinence education’s
approaches (not providing information about the var-
ious aspects of sexual health), its assumptions (that
teaching abstinence from sex and teaching ways to
protect oneself provide youth with mixed, ambiguous
messages), and the socially conservative and pro-
marriage agendas being championed through these
programs (for instance, the promotion of marriage as
the only acceptable venue for sexual relationships).

To better understand comprehensive sexuality
education’s various concerns, it is important to learn
about the legislative efforts put in place to support both
comprehensive sexuality and abstinence education
programs in the USA, in recent decades. The section
below provides a brief outline of these laws.

Brief History of Legislation Efforts
Supporting Comprehensive Sexuality
and Abstinence Education in the USA
Attempts to educate USA children and adolescents in
the public school system about health and sexuality
enjoy a lengthy, yet conﬂicted, history. Prior to the
1980s, schools focused on providing students basic
information about puberty and personal hygiene, obe-
dient to the charge of forming healthy and productive
citizens.

In the early 1980s, conservative groups (led by
political and religious leaders) initiated focused and
systematic efforts to inﬂuence the teaching of sexuality
education in public schools. These efforts hinged on,
and were nourished by, the argument that the then-
available approach to sexuality education (comprehen-
sive) had been ineffective in halting the epidemics of
unplanned teenage pregnancies and STIs in the USA.
Comprehensive sexuality education had achieved little,
if anything, in terms of prevention, and was deemed
a “miserable failure” by these conservative groups.
According to abstinence advocates, what was needed
was a different modus operandi, a different worldview
for teaching adolescents about healthy sexuality: an
approach that went beyond merely minimizing risk
behaviors and emphasized eliminating sexual risks,
altogether. Abstinence education was proposed, there-
fore, as a “much-needed” variant of school-based

sexuality education or as an alternative approach to
comprehensive sexuality education. Many proponents
viewed it as the only alternative, however, and claimed
abstinence education should replace all comprehensive
sexuality education (Mann et al. 2000).

forms of risky sexual behaviors yet,

This latter point-of-view hinged on the belief that
comprehensive sexuality education, besides having
proven ineffective for prevention, bore the potential,
in fact, to harm adolescents. Defenders of abstinence
education claimed (then and now) that comprehensive
approaches send teenagers an ambiguous message: the
message that youth can (and should) choose to abstain
from all
in
circumstances where they cannot, they should protect
themselves
from unintended consequences. This
“ambiguous message” communicates the notion that
abstinence is, indeed, too difﬁcult a choice, and there
are other ways to negotiate sexual relationships (Mann
et al. 2000). According to abstinence education
proponents, this apparent contradiction generates too
much uncertainty for children and adolescents regard-
ing their sexual decision-making and should not be
taught as a healthy option. In an effort to purge this
ambiguity from the school-based sexuality education
available then, religious and politically conservative
groups began (in the 1980s) to effectively advocate for
federal funding of abstinence-only education, in which
the message regarding abstinence from coital activity
would be strengthened, and the information about
protection from pregnancy and STIs would be
weakened.

Below is a brief outline of the main legislative efforts
put forth in the last 4 decades to support comprehen-
sive sexuality and abstinence education. It is important
to bear in mind that, while attempts to promote absti-
nence were in place as early as the 1980s, it was the 1996
legislation that represented a major shift in the history
of school-based sexuality education. The 1996 legisla-
tion has had, thus far, the most signiﬁcant impact on
the teaching of sexuality education in US public
schools. It stands out as a unique innovation in the
realm of morality politics and government oversight of
the content taught in health and sexuality education
classes. (To better understand why the 1996 legislation
represents an innovation in public policy and sexuality
education, see Doan and Williams 2008.)

1970 – Family Planning Services and Population
Research Act (PL 91–572). The Act established the

Ofﬁce of Population Affairs in the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare. Title X funds were
allocated for “family planning services, training, infor-
mation, and education programs” (Doan and Williams
2008, p. 26).

1978 – Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy
Prevention Care Act. Spearheaded by Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-MA), “this act intended to reduce teen
pregnancy by increasing access to federally funded con-
traception and abortion services” (Doan and Williams
2008, p. 26).

1981 – Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA; PL 97–35).
This represented the ﬁrst “federally funded, and sanc-
tioned, sex education legislation” (Doan and Williams
2008, p. 28). Generated in response to pressure from
conservative Christians, it was included in the Omni-
bus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 – “signed into
law as Title XX of the Public Health Service Act”
(Doan and Williams 2008, p. 28). Title XX funded
many initiatives emphasizing “abstinence and adop-
tion as an alternative to abortion” and, therefore,
opened wide the doors for funding focused exclusively
on abstinence-only-until-marriage education in 1996
(Doan and Williams 2008, p. 28).

1996 – Personal Responsibility and Work Opportu-
nity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). This was a welfare
reform omnibus bill. According to Doan and Williams
(2008), “omnibus legislation refers to the practice of
packaging numerous, disparate policy issues into one
massive bill” (p. 15) whose details often get approved
without discussion. Thus, absent any public or
Congressional debate (similar to the creation of Title
XX in 1981), $50 million of federal funding were allo-
cated, annually,
for abstinence-only-until-marriage
programs. Title V funding, then, became available for
“educational or motivational” programs willing to
comply with eight well-deﬁned parameters for the
teaching of abstinence (known as the “A-through-H
Deﬁnition” – see Glossary for deﬁnition).

2000/2001 – Special Projects of Regional and
National Signiﬁcance – Community-Based Abstinence
Education (SPRANS-CBAE). This was an abstinence
program advocated by the George W. Bush adminis-
tration that “bypasse[d] state intervention by pro-
to
viding [federal government] money directly
community organizations, including faith-based orga-
nizations” (Doan and Williams 2008, p. 41). Recipients
of these funds had to comply with the requirements

16 A Abstinence Education

spelled out in Title V (described above), including
abiding by the “A-through-H Deﬁnition.” SPRANS-
CBAE programs were required to shift from a focus
on reducing risky behavior to one promoting preparation
for marriage (Doan and Williams 2008, p. 32). Between
2001 and 2006, funding for CBAE increased over 450%
(SIECUS 2008). According to Advocates for Youth,
“from 1998 to 2003, almost a half a billion dollars in
state and federal funds were appropriated to support
the Title V initiative” (Hauser 2008).

2007 – Legislation passed by Congress requiring absti-
nence education programs funded by Title V comply with
all of the eight characteristics of the “A-through-H Deﬁ-
nition.” In addition to the compliance mandate, states
were now required to provide assurances that funded
curricula and materials “meaningfully represent[ed]
each element of the deﬁnition” (SIECUS 2008).

2009 – End to Reauthorization of Title V funding.
Funding for the Family Life Act remained stable, but
signiﬁcant cuts were made to CBAE’s budget for ﬁscal
year 2009.

2009 – Baucus Amendment (The Personal Responsi-
bility Education for Adulthood Training) and Hatch
Amendment (Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Educa-
tion). Both amendments were approved by the Senate
Finance Committee on September 29, 2009. The
Baucus Amendment proposed to fund comprehensive
sexuality education, with $75 million allotted to
evidence-based programs and $25 million, to “inno-
vative programs as well as research and evaluation”
(SIECUS 2009). The Hatch Amendment proposed to
reinstate Title V funding for abstinence education. Both
amendments are part of the Patient Affordable Care Act
(also known as the “Healthcare Reform Bill” – H.R.
3590) that will be voted by the US House and Senate, in
the near future. At the time of this writing, the US
House of Representatives had voted in favor of the
Act, and the Senate had approved a motion to move
forward with discussion (consideration) of the Act.

Although extensive, the list above does not tell
a complete story: it fails to reﬂect many other streams
of funding (from both federal and state monies) that
have supported abstinence education. Speciﬁcally, the
list does not include support being provided through
earmarked grants awarded to certain states and to
speciﬁc organizations
(SIECUS 2008). Moreover,
according to a recent SIECUS report: “Abstinence-

(SIECUS 2008).

those

Finally, it is important to note that, in addition to
all government-generated support, abstinence educa-
tion initiatives have spawned a multimillion-dollar
business in the USA, centered on nonproﬁt organiza-
tions and curriculum developers. Examples include
organizations
such as “Aim for Success” (www.
aimforsuccess.org) and curricula such as “Worth the
Wait,” sponsored by a healthcare agency (www.
worththewait.org). Therefore, even if Title V and
other major abstinence education initiatives become
defunded through legislative acts during President
Obama’s administration (2009 onward), the impact
this might have on the abstinence education agenda
in the USA remains unknown.

Evaluations of Abstinence Education
Initiatives
In July 2009, the CDC reported data from the National
Vital Statistics System in the USA focusing on the
sexual and reproductive health of persons aged 10–24
years. The data were collected over a 5-year period,
2002–2007 (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion 2009). The report concluded that after a signiﬁcant
decline between 1991 and 2005, birth rates as well as
syphilis infection among teenagers 15–19 years old
increased between the years 2005 and 2007 (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention 2009, p. 02).
When the initial declines were documented, abstinence
education advocates were quick to claim the credit for
these statistical improvements. As the rates began to
increase, however, critics readily pointed to the ineffec-
tiveness of abstinence education programming as the
main culprit.

While documentation of abstinence education
programs’ successes or failures was scarce prior to the
Title V authorization in 1996, evaluations of these
programs and concomitant publication of evaluation
reports have grown exponentially, since then. A few
states that received Title V funding,
for instance,
opted to carry out an independent evaluation of their
initiatives (perhaps instigated by the requirement that
states provide a substantial amount of matching funds
of their own, to support these programs). Texas was

one of
the states putting in place a multiyear,
multiphase evaluation (carried out by an evaluation
team that included the authors of this essay). Other
states conducting their own evaluations during the ﬁrst
5 years of Title V funding included Maryland,
Missouri, Nebraska, Arizona, Florida, Oregon, Wash-
ington, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and California (who ceased
to receive Title V funding after its evaluation revealed
the programs were not effective) (Hauser 2008). The

Findings from all of these evaluations have been
mixed and non-convincing: state-level evaluations as
well as Mathematica national data suggest abstinence
education programs fail to foster, among participants,
both the intention and the practice of waiting to have
sex until marriage. Findings do suggest, however, that
in terms of changing youth’s attitudes toward absti-
nence (“It’s ‘cool’ to be abstinent!”), improving their
perceptions of the social norms regarding sexual activ-
ity among teens (“People around me think abstinence
is best for me . . .”), and increasing their awareness of
the beneﬁts of postponing sexual relationships, the
programs have experienced some measure of success.
The programs have failed, however, in helping teens
“translate” this awareness, these attitudes and these
beliefs into actual intentions, motivations, and behav-
iors (Guide to Community Preventive Services 2009).
Evaluations of abstinence education have failed to
demonstrate strong and long-term, sustainable indica-
tors of program effectiveness, but the reasons for such
failure are multiple and complex. Most of the evalua-
tions, themselves, have failed to employ rigorous exper-
imental or quasi-experimental designs (for various,
often valid reasons), limiting conﬁdence in the ﬁndings
(United States Government Accountability Ofﬁce
2006). According to a report evaluating abstinence
education interventions to prevent HIV/AIDS, other
STIs, and pregnancy, released by the Task Force on
Community Preventive Services at the CDC, “there is
insufﬁcient evidence to determine the effectiveness of
group-based abstinence education . . . evidence was
considered insufﬁcient due to inconsistent results
across studies” (Guide to Community Preventive
Services 2009). Unquestionably, reasons for lack of
effectiveness also lie within the programs. For example,
most evaluated programs revealed a conspicuous

A

absence of sound theoretical grounding. Only 2 of the
32 programs evaluated in Texas proposed to develop
their curricula based on well-tested health behavior or
youth development theories (Goodson et al. 2006b).

According to the Texas and the Mathematica eval-
uations, programs had, instead, an implicit, unstated
theory-of-action (or causal explanations for why cer-
tain activities in the program might promote abstinent
behavior among participants). Remarkably,
these
theories-of-action, more often than not, mirrored the
wisdom available in the scientiﬁc literature, and
targeted variables correlated with teens’ sexual behav-
ior. Nonetheless, when it came to delivering the pro-
frequently placed too much
grams,
emphasis on factors only minimally associated with
behaviors and intentions.

lesson plans

A telling example of this misplaced focus has been
the forceful messages targeting adolescents’ self-esteem.
The logic behind the messages: higher self-esteem will
lead to more conﬁdent and healthier choices, thus
fostering avoidance from risky behaviors. While self-
esteem has been found, at times, to be correlated with
sexual attitudes,
intentions, and behaviors among
youth, the quality of the evidence is questionable, the
strength of the association is modest, at best, and at
times the relationship between self-esteem and sexual
behavior has been inverse (i.e., higher levels of self-
esteem are associated with lower levels of preventive/
protective behaviors; for a systematic review of this
issue, see Goodson et al. 2006a). Empirical evidence
does not support the disproportionate importance
abstinence education programs have placed on the
self-esteem factor; therefore, despite an internal logic
that echoes scientiﬁc ﬁndings, abstinence education
programs tend to – in practice – “overdo” certain
factors and ignore others, thus transforming their
efforts into a-theoretical interventions with diminished
probabilities of success (Goodson 2010).

Continued evaluations of abstinence education pro-
grams will remain an important area of study, even if
these programs ﬁnd themselves stripped of federal
funding in the future: the question of how to teach
human sexuality with emphasis on abstinence from
risky sexual activity, in developmentally appropriate
manners, remains a valid and pedagogically important
question. Only since the advent of federally funded
abstinence education initiatives have sexuality educa-
tors begun to pay any serious attention to the question.

18 A Abstinence Education

Abstinence Education: Its Role in
Adolescent Development
Despite the political and pedagogical controversies
surrounding the teaching of abstinence, as they have
played themselves out in the history of sexuality
education in the USA, does abstinence education have
a role to play in the healthy development of children
and adolescents? The answer to this question is quite
simple: While abstinence education as an ideological
agenda may have proven less than helpful to American
teenagers given these programs’
inability to affect
youth sexual behavior, the notion of abstaining from
practices that may pose health and social risks for
adolescents is, undoubtedly, valid, and valuable.

Abstinence from sexual/coital behavior during
childhood and adolescence is the healthiest and ideal
practice for youth and – as an ideal construct – ﬁnds
support at many levels of arguments: for children and
adolescents it makes sense to avoid sexual intercourse,
based on biological, psychological, social, economic,
legal, and spiritual arguments. Because children’s and
adolescents’ bodies, sexual organs, sexual physiology,
and emotional make-up lack maturity, they are consid-
erably more vulnerable to diseases,
infections, and
emotional traumas with lasting consequences (some-
times life-long effects, such as in the case of infertility
caused by Chlamydia infection, or infection with the
cancer-causing strain of the ▶ Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) and HPV Vaccines). From a psychological
perspective, adolescents do not have the cognitive and
emotional maturity to make wise decisions regarding
personal relationships that might impact their futures.
From a social interaction perspective, choices to couple
with certain partners have important implications for
teens’ existing social networks, either exposing them to
risk-prone environments (where they may engage in
other risky behaviors such as alcohol consumption or
drug use), or destroying extant supportive networks.
Economically, because adolescents are, mainly, con-
sumers and not producers in a capitalist economy,
they are not equipped to face the ﬁnancial challenges
posed by an unplanned pregnancy, and the conse-
quences associated with raising an unexpected child.
Legally, sexual relationships with minors are against the
law in the USA, a notion that often seems neglected,
only to be resurrected when a “case” happens, a couple
is “caught,” and the justice system is invoked. Lastly,
the spiritual lives of adolescents can become seriously

affected by premature sexual relationships, leading to
existential angst, doubt, and uncertainty. Because sex-
ual relationships do not occur in a vacuum but are,
instead, embedded in people’s set of values, beliefs, and
commitments, the potential ramiﬁcations for youth’s
spiritual lives, of engaging early in a sexual relationship
(or more than one) can lead to cognitive dissonance,
lack of healthy attachments, and personal distress.

While the notion of abstinence from risky sexual
activity can be defended on many grounds as the ideal
for children and adolescents, it is important to remem-
ber that youth (worldwide) inhabit an imperfect world
and live nonideal
lives. Granted, many teenagers
engage in sexual activity without experiencing any of
the difﬁculties outlined above. Nevertheless, most of
the available scientiﬁc and social science evidence
supports the notion that, the younger the child or
to
adolescent,
experiencing these ills. The odds are not in teenagers’
favor, compared to their adult counterparts, when it
comes to their sexual health and well-being. While
teaching the ideal, sexuality educators must also
ground themselves in their social realities and provide
teens with the resources (information and social
support) to minimize potential risks.

the higher his/her

vulnerability

therefore,

The intrinsic value of sexual abstinence for children
and adolescents,
is easily supported by
empirical data and logical arguments, from multiple
perspectives. It is, indeed, a healthy practice and it plays
a major role in adolescents’ psychosocial, physical, and
spiritual development. Unfortunately,
abstinence
education debates in the USA have been mired in
controversies about political agendas, pedagogical
approaches, and content coverage; it is here that expert
opinions conﬂict and clash, often to the neglect of the
adolescents themselves.

through the US educational system. Regardless of the
operationalization, the link between academic achieve-
ment and later life prospects is well established in the
extant literature. Adolescents who earn poorer grades
in school are more likely to be retained in grade, to fall
behind in credit accrual, and to earn lower achievement
test scores, all of which are associated with lower high
school completion rates and higher dropout rates

services
Although academic achievement is strongly associated
with cognitive ability and motivation (Eccles et al.
2003), a comprehensive understanding of adolescents’
academic achievement must take into account how the
ecological contexts in which adolescents are embedded
promote or inhibit their academic achievement.

social

Academic Achievement in Context
There is a growing recognition among developmentalists
that environmental contexts, such as families, schools,
and peers, affect numerous developmental domains,
including academic achievement (Chung and Steinberg
2006; Cook et al. 2002). Ecological theory provides
one lens for exploring the interactions between the
individual and both distal and more proximal ecolog-
ical
that ultimately drive
adolescent development, including academic achieve-
ment (Bronfenbrenner 1979). During adolescence, the
most common proximal contexts in individuals’ lives
are families, schools, and peers (Steinberg and Morris
2001). The structures of these environments as well as
the interactions that occur therein can either promote
or inhibit adolescents’ academic achievement.

interactions

contexts,

An exploration of adolescents’ academic achieve-
ment must also be situated in an understanding of the
larger stratiﬁcation systems in the US, stratiﬁcation
reﬂected in the achievement gap between low-income
and more afﬂuent youth as well as the gap between
African-American and Latino youth as compared to
their White and Asian-American peers (Farkas 2003).
Although a more distal factor, the sociohistorical con-
text in which adolescents develop, including existing
stratiﬁcation systems in the US generally and in the

20 A Academic Achievement: Contextual Influences

American educational system more speciﬁcally, shapes
educational opportunities and academic prospects. As
such, a comprehensive understanding of adolescents’
academic achievement must entail understanding the
larger stratiﬁcation systems as well as the more proxi-
mal contexts of adolescents’ development.

Stratification and Academic
Achievement
The achievement gap between African-American and
Latino students and their White and Asian-American
peers is well established, as is the achievement gap
between poor and non-poor youth in the US. National
statistics show that African-American youth are most
likely to have been retained in grade before ninth grade
(16%), followed by Latino (11%) and White (8%)
students. Poor students’ retention rates (23%) are
almost ﬁve times that of non-poor students (5%).
Moreover,
the achievement divide between these
demographic groups only widens across time. Dropout
rates for Asian-American (3%) and White (6%)
students are relatively low compared to those of
African-American (12%) and Latino students (20%),
and the dropout rates of
low-income youth are
approximately ﬁve times that of high-income youth
(NCES 2009).

Research further metes out the gaps reﬂected in
overall national trends. In comparing standardized
achievement test scores for the various race/ethnic
groups, research consistently documents the achieve-
ment divide (Anderson and Keith 1997; Caldas and
Bankston 1997; Lee 2007). These differences are
observed across content areas (i.e., English/language
arts, writing, mathematics,
science, history) and
widen from early to late adolescence (Gregory and
Weinstein 2004). The race/ethnic achievement gap is
also observed for adolescents’ grades in school (Fuligni
1997; Lohman et al. 2007) and their dropout status
(Lee and Burkam 2003). Consistent with research on
the achievement gap across race/ethnic groups, an
achievement gap between low-income and high-
income youth is also observed for achievement test
scores (Blair et al. 1999; Caldas and Bankston 1997),
and the proportion of life spent in poverty is associated
with lower reading comprehension achievement test
scores during adolescence (Eamon 2005). A more
detailed discussion of the effects of household socio-
economic status (including not only income but also

family structure and educational and occupational sta-
tus) as a structural characteristic of families is discussed
in greater detail below.

Academic Achievement and the
Family Context
Numerous studies have explored the link between the
structural characteristics of families and adolescents’
academic achievement, with the vast majority focusing
on various facets of family socioeconomic status (SES).
Higher family SES, as measured by parental educa-
tional and occupational status and income, is associ-
ated with higher achievement test scores (Felner et al.
1995; Gregory and Weinstein 2004; Lee 2007). More-
over, higher-SES adolescents earn higher grades in
school (Fuligni 1997; Lohman et al. 2007; Stewart
2008) and are less likely to drop out of school (Lee
and Burkam 2003). More extensive reviews of the pov-
erty literature (see Bradley and Corwyn 2002; McLoyd
1998) detail the pernicious effects of being poor or low-
SES for adolescents’ academic achievement measured
in a number of ways (i.e., achievement test scores, class
failure, retention in grade, graduation rates, dropout
rates). In addition to SES, family structure is also
associated with adolescents’ academic achievement –
adolescents reared in single-parent headed households
earn lower achievement
scores (Caldas and
Bankston 1997; Lee 2007) and lower grades in school
(Lohman et al. 2007; Stewart 2008), are less likely to
complete high school, and are more likely to drop out
of school (Rumberger 1987) than those reared in intact,
two-parent families.

test

In addition to the inﬂuence of familial structural
characteristics, the processes that occur within families
also inﬂuence adolescents’ academic achievement.
Parents’ support for academics, discussions around
academics, and provision of educational enrichment
in the home are associated with better academic per-
formance, in terms of adolescents’ achievement test
scores and grades in school (Eamon 2005; Steinberg
et al. 1992; Woolley and Grogan-Kaylor 2006). Parents’
direct involvement in their adolescents’ schools, via
activities such as open house attendance, parent–
teacher
and classroom
volunteering, are positively associated with higher test
scores and grades (Gutman and Eccles 1999; Park and
Bauer 2002; Shumow and Miller 2001). In their meta-
analysis of middle-school-aged adolescents’ parental

association participation,

Academic Achievement: Contextual Influences A 21

A

involvement, Hill and Tyson (2009) found that aca-
demic socialization practices (e.g., discussions around
academics,
fostering educational aspirations) were
more effective in promoting academic achievement
than home-based supports or school-based involve-
ment, ﬁndings consistent with an earlier meta-analysis
of secondary students residing in urban areas (Jeynes
2007).

In addition to direct involvement in their children’s
education, other processes within the home also play
a role in adolescents’ academic success. For example,
adolescents who believe their parents are warm and
supportive tend to earn higher grades in school (Bean
et al. 2003; Benner and Kim 2010; LeCroy and Krysik
2008), have higher achievement test scores (Portes
1999), and show greater growth in achievement test
scores across adolescence (Gregory and Weinstein
2004). In contrast, adolescents who report greater emo-
tional distance between themselves and their parents as
well as those who report higher levels of conﬂict and
harsh discipline often earn lower grades and score more
poorly on standardized achievement tests (Benner and
Kim 2010; Crosnoe 2004; Dotterer et al. 2008; Gutman
and Eccles 1999). Parents’ behavioral control of their
adolescents, in terms of monitoring adolescents’ activ-
ities, is positively associated with higher achievement
test scores (Blair et al. 1999; Gregory and Weinstein
2004) and grades (Bean et al. 2003), although the
inﬂuence of parental monitoring has been found to
vary across race/ethnic groups.

In addition to these individual indicators of family
processes and interactions, scholars have also examined
multiple aspects of parenting simultaneously to iden-
tify parenting proﬁles or typologies, generally focusing
on parental warmth and control (see Baumrind 1971;
Maccoby and Martin 1983). Studies examining the link
between parenting proﬁles and adolescents’ academic
achievement ﬁnd that youth whose parents employ
authoritative parenting (high warmth combined with
high levels of control) earn higher grades and better
achievement test scores than those whose parents
employ other parenting styles, although again, some
differences emerge across race/ethnic groups (Fletcher
et al. 1999;
Jeynes 2007; Steinberg et al. 1992).
For example, it appears that White and Latino adoles-
cents beneﬁt more academically from authoritative
parents than African-American and Asian-American
adolescents.

Overall, this body of research suggests that family
characteristics, particularly those directly related to
economic well-being, inﬂuence the academic achieve-
ment of adolescents. However, the processes that occur
within families can promote stronger achievement –
adolescents beneﬁt academically when they have fam-
ilies who are involved in the educational process and
who provide warmth and support but also appropriate
monitoring of adolescents’ day-to-day lives.

structural

Academic Achievement and the
School Context
The school is another primary context of socialization
during adolescence, and the relationship between
school
characteristics and adolescents’
performance is well established. Adolescents in high-
poverty schools (generally measured by the percentage
lunch
of students qualifying for the federal school
program) and schools with high percentages of race/
ethnic minority students generally experience more
academic difﬁculties than their peers attending more
afﬂuent schools and schools with fewer race/ethnic
minority students (Benner and Graham 2009; Caldas
and Bankston 1997; Lee and Croninger 1994; Leventhal
and Brooks-Gunn 2004). Although not as consistent, in
general greater school diversity is associated with
higher grades in school and stronger educational
attainment (Borman et al. 2004; Goza and Ryabov
2009). Additionally, adolescents enrolled in large
schools tend to perform more poorly on standardized
tests and exhibit less growth in achievement across time
(Lee et al. 1997), earn lower grades in school (Benner
and Graham 2009), and have higher dropout rates
(Baker et al. 2001; Lee and Burkam 2003) than students
attending smaller schools. Similar academic difﬁculties
emerge for adolescents in schools with higher student-
to-teacher ratios (Baker et al. 2001; McNeal 1997).

Tracking systems are another structural character-
istics of many American middle and high schools.
Tracking, whether it emerges de facto or as a more
systemic practice, “places students who appear to
have similar educational needs and abilities into sepa-
rate classes and programs of instruction” (Oakes 1987,
p. 131). Higher socioeconomic diversity and race/
ethnic diversity are associated with more pronounced
de facto tracking in mathematics and English courses in
American schools (Lucas and Berends 2002), and in
general, research suggests that track placement serves to

22 A Academic Achievement: Contextual Influences

only promote and reinforce existing academic inequal-
ities, with African-American and Latino adolescents and
low-income adolescents being placed in the “lower”
tracks at substantially higher rates than their White,
Asian-American, and more afﬂuent peers
(Oakes
2005). Not surprisingly, adolescents’ track placement
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on changes in their academic
achievement across time, such that placement in higher
tracks
(i.e., honors, advanced) promotes greater
achievement than placement in lower tracks (i.e., very
basic, basic; Hallinan 1994; Oakes 2005). The structure
of
tracking systems also inﬂuences adolescents’
achievement – when there is immobility within track-
ing systems (i.e., little movement of students changing
academic tracks across time), a greater achievement
gap in achievement test scores exists between tracks,
whereas high levels of inclusiveness in a tracking system
(i.e., proportion of students in a college-preparatory
curriculum) are associated with a smaller gap in
achievement across tracks (Gamoran 1992).

School

transitions, normative experiences

that
occur when adolescents enter middle or junior high
school and high school, involve a shift in both the
structural characteristics of the schools adolescents
attend and the relationships and interactions that
occur within and across the school contexts. As such,
it is not surprising that school transitions are inﬂuen-
tial
for adolescents’ academic achievement. Initial
research posited that the academic challenges experi-
enced in early adolescence were due to the develop-
mental transition into adolescence, but Simmons and
Blyth’s (1987) groundbreaking work illustrated that the
transition to middle school was a driving force in
explaining early adolescents’ academic declines. Subse-
quent research has corroborated these initial ﬁndings,
documenting substantial declines in both grades and
teacher-rated academic performance from elementary
to middle school (Gutman and Midgley 2000; Rudolph
et al. 2001). Although less is known about the transi-
tion to high school, scholars identify similar achieve-
ment disruptions across the high school transition
(Barber and Olsen 2004; Reyes et al. 1994). Research
suggests that the declines observed across the high
school transition persist across the ﬁrst 2 years of high
school and are particularly disruptive for incongruent
African-American and Latino adolescents who transi-
tion to high school with few same-ethnicity peers
(Benner and Graham 2009).

speciﬁcally around aca-
demics, beyond the obvious instructional activities,
promote academic achievement during adolescence.
For example, when adolescents believe their teachers
have high regard for them as students, they earn higher
grades in school (Roeser and Eccles 1998), consistent
with the extensive teacher expectancies literature that
highlights a strong link between teachers’ educational
expectations for students and students’ academic
achievement (Gill and Reynolds 1999; Muller et al.
1999; Smith et al. 1998). Although teacher opinions
about particular students can inﬂuence academic
achievement, teachers’ overall views of the academic
caliber of students in their schools are also linked to
adolescents’ academic success. For example, teachers’
general ratings of the achievement orientation of the
student body are associated with adolescents’ reading
and math achievement test scores as well as their grades
in school (Brand et al. 2008).

In addition to interactions and processes directly
tied to academics, the emotional connections within
schools are also important for adolescents’ academic
achievement. When adolescents feel closer to their
teachers and express more positive perceptions about
student–teacher
exhibit
stronger academic achievement, in terms of achieve-
ment test score growth, grades in school, and dropout
status (Crosnoe 2004; Gregory and Weinstein 2004; Lee
and Burkam 2003; Woolley and Grogan-Kaylor 2006),
the
although interestingly,
student–teacher relationship are not predictive of
adolescents’ achievement (Brand et al. 2008). Similar
trends are observed for more general ratings of school
climate – adolescents who view their schools more
favorably and feel more connected to their schools
receive higher grades (LeCroy and Krysik 2008; Stewart
2008; Zand and Thomson 2005) and earn higher scores
on achievement tests (Eamon 2005) than those who
view their schools more negatively. Perceptions of
speciﬁc aspects of the school climate are also important
for adolescents’ academic success. For example, adoles-
cents who report more positive evaluations of their
schools’
interracial climates have better academic
achievement (Mattison and Aber 2007). Similarly,
perceptions of school safety also promote academic

performance – when adolescents are in schools that
they perceive as more safe or that their teachers rate
as more safe, they perform better on achievement tests
(Brand et al. 2008; Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2004)
and are less likely to drop out of school (Rumberger
1995). Adolescents also perform better academically
when in schools where teachers rate the student body
as less disruptive (Brand et al. 2008).

Overall, the patterns of inﬂuence observed in the
school context closely mirror those observed at the
family level. The structural characteristics of schools,
particularly the SES and racial/ethnic make-up of
schools, are directly related to adolescents’ academic
achievement. Yet this body of research suggests that
the processes and interactions that occur within schools
can promote the academic achievement of all students,
with adolescents beneﬁtting from close bonds with their
teachers speciﬁcally and their schools more generally.

Academic Achievement and the Peer
Context
Although research linking the structural characteristics
of peer/friendship groups to academic achievement is
more rare, evidence suggests that these characteristics
do in fact play a role in adolescents’ achievement. For
example, adolescents with higher-SES peers generally
earn higher grades and are more likely to complete high
school than those with lower SES peers, although these
effects are often race/ethnic dependent (Goza and
Ryabov 2009). The academic achievement of an
adolescents’ peer group is also linked to their own
academic achievement. Whether examining recipro-
cated friendships or larger peer networks, the grades
of those with whom adolescents are closest are posi-
tively associated with adolescents’ own grades in school
(Altermatt and Pomerantz 2005; Mounts and Steinberg
1995; Ryan 2001). Similarly, when adolescents are
embedded in highly dense networks of high achieving
peers, they have the highest achievement levels, whereas
adolescents embedded in highly dense networks of
low-achieving peers have the worst achievement
(Maroulis and Gomez 2008). Related to this, adoles-
cents who have more friends who have dropped out of
school have a greater likelihood of later dropping out
themselves (Ream and Rumberger 2008).

In addition to the structural characteristics of peer
groups and friendship groups, the quality and support
adolescents receive from these signiﬁcant others also

ingly, when adolescents’ peers
oriented and provide academic support, adolescents
typically earn higher grades in school (Herman 2009;
LeCroy and Krysik 2008; Steinberg et al. 1992; Stewart
2008; Wentzel et al. 2004) and have a lower likelihood
of later school dropout (Ream and Rumberger 2008).
More generally, associating with prosocial peers is
linked to higher grades in school (Wentzel et al.
2004), whereas having more deviant and disruptive
peers is associated with poorer school performance
during adolescence (Berndt and Keefe 1995; Fuligni
et al. 2001). Feeling accepted by peers, whether mea-
sured as a reciprocated friendship or by more general
ratings of support and acceptance, is positively associ-
ated with adolescents’ academic achievement (Hartup
1996; Wentzel et al. 2004; Wentzel and Caldwell 1997).
Victimization by peers, in contrast, is associated with
poorer school performance (Graham et al. 2006;
Juvonen et al. 2000).

The link between peer processes and achievement
has received particular attention from scholars exam-
ining oppositional identity and the “burden of acting
white” for African-American adolescents (Fordham
and Ogbu 1986). Fordham and Ogbu argued that the
underachievement of African-American adolescents is
linked, in part, to a peer culture that devalues academic
effort and achievement,
labeling it “acting white.”
A number of studies have challenged the theses of
Fordham and Ogbu, acknowledging that although
adolescents of color may experience peers’ accusations
of acting White, these accusations do not inﬂuence
achievement
adolescents’
(Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey 1998; Bergin and
Cooks 2002). Moreover, Tyson and colleagues (2005)
identify not only racialized peer pressure with African-
American adolescents, but also class-based peer
pressure with White adolescents, where lower-income
White adolescents equate academic achievement with
acting “high and mighty” (p. 598).

academic

Overall, although the research linking adolescents’
peer groups to their academic achievement is more
scarce, a clear pattern emerges. When adolescents
have friends who perform better in school, are more
oriented to school, and provide more academic sup-
port, adolescents beneﬁt academically. In addition to
the academic characteristics of peers and academically
based interactions, more general emotional support

24 A Academic Achievement: Contextual Influences

and friendship quality also seemingly promote
academic success during adolescence, whereas rejection
and victimization by peers is detrimental to adoles-
cents’ academic well-being.

Future Directions of the Adolescent
Academic Achievement Literature
Across the primary contexts of adolescents’ develop-
ment – families, schools, and peer groups – a consistent
pattern of ﬁndings links both the structural character-
istics of each context and the processes and interactions
that occur therein with adolescents’ academic achieve-
ment. When contexts are characterized by more
resources and less social marginalization, adolescents
perform better
academically. Moreover, warm,
academics-oriented relationships within each context
promote academic achievement and educational
growth. Although these patterns are clear, much is left
to explore in relation to adolescents’ academic achieve-
ment, and ecological theory serves as an important
guide for future inquiry.

First, ecological theory suggests a fundamental
interplay between the structural characteristics of
a given ecological context and the processes that
occur within that context, yet researchers sometimes
conﬂate structure and process and create models that
do not differentiate between the two. Future research
on adolescents’ academic achievement should examine
how the structural characteristics of families, schools,
and peer groups inﬂuence the processes and interac-
tions that occur within these contexts (see Benner et al.
2008 for an example). Investigation of the differential
effects of structure and process will provide insights
into what aspects of contexts are more amenable and
malleable to change in order to better promote adoles-
cents’ academic success.

schools,

A second area ripe for future inquiry relates to the
interplay across the ecological contexts of adolescence.
The contexts of adolescents’ development do not exist
within a vacuum – parents attend activities at their
children’s
academic
involvement and support in homes, peers interact
both within and outside the conﬁnes of school. These
cross-context interactions, as well as the consistency in
relations across contexts, inﬂuence adolescent develop-
ment, yet researchers have, with few exceptions,
ignored these mesosystemic inﬂuences. Those scholars

teachers’ promote

who have explored cross-system interactions have
highlighted the importance of these for adolescents’
academic achievement. For example, Crosnoe (2004)
found that close relations to parents were associated
with higher grades in school when adolescents also
attended schools with more positive student–teacher
bonds. Similarly, Gregory and Weinstein (2004) found
that monitoring and regulation by parents and teachers
exerted an additive effect for adolescents’ mathematics
achievement. Future research should further explore
the additive (and possibly compensatory) nature of
relationships across ecological contexts as well as the
extent to which the structural characteristics of a given
context might inﬂuence cross-context interactions. It is
through understanding these more nuanced processes
and interactions that we will be able to more effectively
promote the academic achievement of all adolescents.

Overview
Time spent in learning accounts for a large portion of
an adolescent’s life. Enjoyment in learning activities,
setting, and academic
adjustment
achievement represent desired attainments for both
students and their families. A vast literature addition-
ally shows that these attainments inﬂuence children’s
course of life, by affecting their scholastic choices and
professional aspirations, as well as their psychosocial
development and well-being. Among the factors
contributing to these attainments are academic self-
efﬁcacy beliefs and optimal experience in learning.
The ﬁrst part of this essay will
illustrate the two
constructs and related assessment methodologies. The
short- and long-term developmental outcomes of the
constructs will also be outlined, as well as the contex-
tual and individual factors contributing to optimal
learning environment and experience. The second
part will present a model combining academic self-
efﬁcacy beliefs and optimal experience, and will bring
forward future directions for research and practice.

Introduction
Learning at school is one of the major means through
which culturally relevant information is transmitted,
with the view to provide individuals with the

knowledge required to identify and fulﬁll their role in
society. On the one hand, a great number of studies
attest to the natural human tendency to learn and the
thirst for knowledge in young children (Shernoff and
Csikszentmihalyi 2009). On the other hand, ﬁndings in
western countries highlight that once children enter the
formal school system, they start to report lack of inter-
est, disengagement, and apathy toward learning, which
can lead to poor concepts assimilation and eventually
to school dropout. Obstacles to learning usually
include disruptive thoughts, dysfunctional emotional
reactions, negative interpersonal relationships, and
poor organizational skills. This is much more true of
adolescents who tend to be even less engaged in school
activities. In order to shed light on the reasons for such
learning disaffection and to identify intervention strat-
egies promoting engagement
in school activities,
scholars in the 1960s and 1970s have advocated the
agentic role of students in regulating academic learn-
ing. In particular, two theories have proved successful
in providing sound empirical evidence and models of
academic learning: Bandura’s social-cognitive theory
(1997) and Csikszentmihalyi’s ﬂow theory (1975/
2000). The ﬁrst part of this essay will illustrate the
two theoretical frameworks, related methodology, and
major ﬁndings connected to the learning domain. The
second part will present a model building a bridge
between the two theories, and will bring forward future
directions for research and practice.

Self-efficacy Beliefs in Bandura’s
Social-Cognitive Theory
Bandura’s social-cognitive theory stresses the active
and proactive role individuals play in shaping the
course of their life (Bandura 1986, 2001). People are
viewed as self-regulating agents whose development
takes place in complex transactions within a network
of socio-structural and psychosocial inﬂuences, where
individuals are both producers and products of their
social systems. During these transactions, individuals
play a decisive role in setting goals, in choosing which
paths to follow, and in selecting the activities and social
relationships that are most appropriate to their choices.
the mechanisms of human agency,
a pervasive inﬂuence is played by self-efﬁcacy beliefs,
namely, the beliefs that individuals hold about their
capacity to exert control over the events that affect

their lives, and to organize and execute courses of
action to attain designed goals. Any other factor that
may operate as motivator in people’s efforts to reach
their goals is rooted in the core belief that one has the
power
to produce effects by one’s own actions
(Bandura 1997, 2001). Self-efﬁcacy beliefs directly
contribute to decisions, actions, and experiences, as
people reﬂect upon their capacities when deciding
whether to undertake challenging activities or to persist
in pursuing difﬁcult tasks. Findings have documented
the inﬂuential role of self-efﬁcacy beliefs in various
domains of functioning such as learning, work, sports,
health, social adjustment, and well-being, in different
conditions and phases of life (for a review, see Bandura
1997, 2001). Moreover, the functional role of perceived
self-efﬁcacy and the processes through which it operates
have been conﬁrmed across cultures (Bandura 2002).

Compared to other psychological

constructs,
perceived self-efﬁcacy has a variety of distinctive
characteristics. First, it concerns perceived capacities
to perform an activity or to manage a task, and not
personality traits (i.e., extraversion) or other general
psychological characteristics (i.e., self-esteem). Second,
self-efﬁcacy beliefs are not only domain-speciﬁc, but
may also be context- and task-speciﬁc. Moreover, they
vary across several dimensions, such as level, generality,
and strength. The level of perceived self-efﬁcacy refers
to its dependence on the difﬁculty level of a particular
task (i.e., a math addition problem); generality refers to
the transferability of one’s efﬁcacy judgements across
different tasks, contexts, or domains; ﬁnally, strength
pertains to the conﬁdence with which one can perform
a speciﬁc task or activity.

Self-efficacy Beliefs’ Assessment
The distinctive features of self-efﬁcacy described above
have implications for the construct measurement. As
the efﬁcacy beliefs system is not a global trait but
a differentiated set of self-beliefs linked to distinct
realms of functioning, only multi-domain measures
can adequately reveal the pattern and degree of gener-
ality of people’s sense of personal efﬁcacy. The “one
measure ﬁts all” approach has a limited explanatory
and predictive value because most of the items in such
a measure may have little or no relevance to the speciﬁc
domain of functioning or task one is interested to
evaluate. Self-efﬁcacy beliefs covary across distinct
domains only when different spheres of activity are

governed by similar subskills, or when skills in diverse
domains are developed together.

All over the world, scales were developed to
measure people’s self-efﬁcacy beliefs in different life
domains. In the academic settings, there are scales
assessing students’ perceived capabilities to learn spe-
ciﬁc subjects (e.g., the “Self-efﬁcacy to Learn Statistics”
scale; Finney and Schraw 2003); scales measuring the
perceived capabilities to apply successful learning strat-
the “Self-Efﬁcacy for Learning Form”;
egies (e.g.,
Zimmerman et al. 2005); and multi-domain scales,
assessing students’ capacity to enlist social resources,
to learn speciﬁc subjects, and to self-regulate their
learning activities (e.g., the measure developed by
Bandura 2006).

New scales can be designed by scholars and educa-
tors interested in measuring self-efﬁcacy beliefs in
speciﬁc contexts and in relation to particular domains
or tasks. The guidelines developed by Bandura (2006)
enlist the main rules that have to be respected in order
to build a proper self-efﬁcacy scale. First, the construc-
tion of a scale primarily relies on a good conceptual
analysis of the domain of interest, as the knowledge
of
the activity domain speciﬁes which aspects of
personal efﬁcacy should be measured. In particular,
a comprehensive efﬁcacy assessment should be linked
to the behavioral factors that mostly determine the
quality of functioning in the domain and over which
people can exercise some control. Second, efﬁcacy
items should accurately reﬂect the construct of self-
efﬁcacy. They should be phrased in terms of “can do”,
as the “can” phrase reﬂects a judgment of capability
(“Can you ﬁnish your homework assignments by dead-
line?”). Perceived self-efﬁcacy should be measured
against levels of task demands that represent challenges
or difﬁculties to successful performance. Self-efﬁcacy
judgements reﬂect the level of difﬁculty individuals
believe they can surmount. If there are no obstacles to
overcome, the activity is easily performable, and every-
one is highly efﬁcacious. For instance, every student
can state he or she feels able to “get him or herself to
study” when there is no challenge or impediment, but
only the most efﬁcacious will judge themselves very
capable to “get themselves to study when there are
other interesting things to do”. The nature and level of
the challenges against which personal efﬁcacy is judged
will vary depending on the sphere of activity and may
be graded in terms of level of exertion, accuracy,

threat, or

productivity,
self-regulation required.
Constructing scales to assess self-efﬁcacy thus requires
preliminary work to identify speciﬁc challenges and
impediments. In preliminary phases, people are usually
asked to describe the things that make it hard for them
to perform the required activities on a regular basis.
The identiﬁed challenges or impediments are then
inserted into the efﬁcacy items, and respondents are
asked to judge their ability to meet the challenges or to
overcome the various impediments. At last, item for-
mat should present sufﬁcient gradations to guarantee
a variety of answers in the population and to avoid
ceiling effects.

Self-efficacy Beliefs in Educational
Settings
Research on adolescents’ academic perceived self-
efﬁcacy, namely, their self-beliefs in managing activities
connected to learning processes and success at school,
is extremely wide and has been conducted in different
cultures (see for major reviews: Bandura 1997; Pajares
1996, 1997; Schunk and Pajares 2004). Studies used
various assessment
scales and adopted different
research designs. In experimental studies, self-efﬁcacy
beliefs were usually manipulated in order to assess their
effect on students’ performance. In nonexperimental
studies, the relationship of efﬁcacy beliefs with indica-
tors of students’ performance or well-adjustment was
evaluated cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Other
studies speciﬁcally evaluated the effectiveness of long-
term interventions aimed to strengthen students’ per-
ceived self-efﬁcacy through trainings based on the
sources of self-efﬁcacy identiﬁed by Bandura. Overall,
research demonstrated that self-efﬁcacy beliefs inﬂu-
ence students’ academic and career choices, as well as

factors and learning strategies

Academic Choices and Career
Self-efﬁcacy beliefs inﬂuence academic choices as stu-
dents are prone to engage in tasks in which they feel
conﬁdent and avoid those in which they do not. Espe-
cially in high school and college, where students have
greater control over activity selection, their efﬁcacy
beliefs strongly inﬂuence course choices and academic
career (Britner and Pajares 2006). For example, several
studies conducted in the areas of science and mathe-
matics showed that perceived self-efﬁcacy is more

predictive of interest in and choice of these learning
domains than prior achievement and outcome expec-
tations (e.g., Lent et al. 1993; Pajares and Miller 1995).
In addition, adolescents’ academic self-efﬁcacy has
been demonstrated to affect career trajectories through
occupational self-efﬁcacy (Bandura et al. 2001).

motivational factors (see Schunk and Miller 2002, for
a review). Perceived self-efﬁcacy determines the effort
students will expend on activities and their persever-
ance in front of obstacles and difﬁculties (e.g.,
Bouffard-Bouchard et al. 1991; Gore 2006). Conﬁdent

have greater
challenging goals, and maintain strong commitment
to them. Moreover, they more quickly regain their
conﬁdence after failures or setbacks, and they attribute
failure to insufﬁcient effort or lack of acquirable knowl-
edge and skills (Schunk 1998; Zimmerman et al. 1992).
Conversely, students with low self-efﬁcacy tend to
believe that things are more difﬁcult than they really
are, and they are likely to attribute their failure to
inborn and permanent lack of ability. Both sets of
thoughts foster negative emotions and determine low
conﬁdence in personal capabilities. Students with
higher self-efﬁcacy beliefs also use more effective cog-
nitive and meta-cognitive learning strategies and show
greater ﬂexibility in their use, as shown by Zimmerman
and his colleagues in their extensive line of inquiry on
the relationships between self-efﬁcacy beliefs, academic
self-regulatory strategies, and academic achievement.

Academic Achievement
There is ample empirical evidence that self-efﬁcacy
beliefs are related to and exert an inﬂuence on academic
achievement, either directly or through the inﬂuence
of other personal achievement predictors, such as
previous achievement, skills, and mental abilities (see
Pajares and Schunk 2001, for a review). Early adoles-
cents’ perceived academic self-efﬁcacy has also been

30 A Academic Self-efficacy

demonstrated to mediate the inﬂuence of external
factors such as parents’ own efﬁcacy beliefs and aspira-
tions, and the family’s socioeconomic status (Bandura
et al. 1996).

Longitudinal studies attested to the long-lasting
effect of efﬁcacy beliefs on academic achievement and
likelihood of dropping out of school (Caprara et al.
2008). A general decline in efﬁcacy beliefs has also
been observed from junior high to high school, as
a consequence of the increasing demands and pressures
on children’s academic performance. However, that
decline is weaker for children with higher self-efﬁcacy
beliefs. The effects of efﬁcacy beliefs on achievement are
usually stronger for high school and college students
than for elementary students. In particular, recent
empirical studies and meta-analyses demonstrated the
strong predictive value of efﬁcacy beliefs on late ado-
lescents’ performance in college (Gore 2006; Robbins
et al. 2004). The strongest effects were obtained when
achievement was assessed through basic skills measures
or classroom-based indices such as grades. Moreover,
although a reciprocal inﬂuence between self-efﬁcacy
beliefs and school attainments can be hypothesized,
Schunk and his colleagues showed the causal inﬂuence
of perceived self-efﬁcacy on students’ achievement-
related behaviors. In particular, they detected that the
increase of self-efﬁcacy through instructional strategies
resulted in improved academic performances (e.g.,
Schunk and Swartz 1993).

Factors Promoting Students’
Self-efficacy Beliefs
Bandura (1986, 1997) identiﬁed four main sources of
self-efﬁcacy: personal mastery, physiological reactions,
vicarious experiences, and forms of persuasion. (1)
Personal mastery experiences are the strongest source
for enhancing perceptions of self-efﬁcacy. In general,
frequent successes boost self-efﬁcacy, whereas consis-
tent failure experiences usually undermine it. However,
this process is not completely automatic, as personal
accomplishments are interpreted in light of one’s
self-regulatory processes,
self-evaluations,
attributions, and goal setting. For instance, perceived
self-efﬁcacy depends on the individual evaluation of
circumstances and external factors; if a student does
well on a math test but judges it easier than typical
math tests, it is unlikely that his or her efﬁcacy beliefs
will change. (2) Physiological reactions can also

such as

inﬂuence a student’s efﬁcacy judgement. If a student
gets extremely anxious during a classwork, he or she
may interpret the rapid heart rate as an indicator of
personal
ineffectiveness. (3) Adolescents also judge
their level of self-efﬁcacy through vicarious experi-
ences, such as modeling, deﬁned as the behavioral,
cognitive, and affective changes resulting from observ-
ing other individuals. Models may be different types of
individuals (peers or adults) and can take various
forms (live or symbolic). Their effectiveness will be
strongest when observers believe they are similar to
the model
in terms of age, gender, and ability.
(4) Finally, also social persuasion can shape students’
efﬁcacy perceptions. In the learning settings, teachers
and parents may promote students’ positive efﬁcacy
beliefs using various form of verbal persuasion aimed
at encouraging (e.g., “I’m sure you can do it”) and
reassuring them (e.g., “You will do better on the next
exam”), as well as providing speciﬁc feedback that
clearly link performance and its progress, with strategy
use (e.g., “You failed because you used a wrong way to
study. I’ll suggest...”). This form of social persuasion
has a strong long-lasting effect as it encourages students
to view academic success and failure in terms of
controllable personal strategies that can be learned
and progressively improved.

Optimal Experience and
Psychological Selection
Another line of research that has brought about
valuable contributions
setting
focuses on the phenomenology of learning experience.
Csikszentmihalyi’s ﬂow theory (1975/2000) belongs to
the well-established humanistic tradition in psychol-
ogy, stressing the crucial role of subjective experience in
individuals’
interaction with their daily context.
Subjective experience comprises cognitive, emotional,
and motivational components, and represents the
conscious processing of information coming from the
individual’s outer and inner worlds. As attentional
processes regulating the stream of conscious experience
are a limited psychic resource, only a selected amount
of this information will be processed (Csikszentmihalyi
1978). Csikszentmihalyi has identiﬁed the quality of
experience as the selection criterion of the content in
consciousness. In their daily lives, individuals associate
activities and situations with different experiential
states, based on the challenges or opportunities for

action perceived in such activities and situations, and
on the skills they perceive to possess in facing such
challenges. In particular, empirical ﬁndings showed
that people report a globally positive and complex
experience in activities or situations in which they
perceive high challenges matched with adequate
high skills (Massimini et al. 1987). Such condition
has been deﬁned as optimal experience or ﬂow. It is
characterized by deep concentration, absorption,
enjoyment, control of the situation, clear-cut feedback
on the course of the activity, clear goals, and intrinsic
reward. The term “ﬂow” expresses the feeling of
ﬂuidity and continuity in concentration and action
described by most participants (Csikszentmihalyi and
Csikszentmihalyi 1988).

Several

studies,

cross-cultural

conducted on
samples widely differing in age, educational level, and
occupation, have shown that optimal experience can
occur during the most various activities of daily life,
such as work, study, parenting, sports, arts and crafts,
social interactions, and religious practice (Delle Fave
and Bassi 2009; Delle Fave and Massimini 2004;
Hektner et al. 2007; Massimini and Delle Fave 2000).
However, regardless of the activity, the onset of optimal
experience is associated with a speciﬁc condition: The
ongoing task has to be challenging enough to require
concentration and engagement, and to promote
satisfaction in the use of personal skills.

These studies also shed light on the psychological
structure of optimal experience (Delle Fave and
Massimini 2005). It comprises a cognitive and stable
core, represented by components such as high concen-
tration and control of the situation. These components
do not show remarkable variations across samples and
activities. On the contrary, affective and motivational
variables widely vary across activities. Therefore,
optimal experience represents a multifaceted construct
with stable cognitive features, around which motiva-
tional and emotional components ﬂuctuate in intensity
according to the associated activities. More speciﬁcally,
regarding motivational variables, wide cross-domain
variations were detected in the values of perceived
goals and short-term activity desirability. In particular,
in productive activities – such as study and work – the
perception of goals is prominent, but the short-term
desirability is perceived as signiﬁcantly lower than in
other domains. Social interactions and leisure activities
are characterized by both short-term desirability and

Academic Self-efficacy A 31

A

high values of long-term goals; passive entertainment
activities, such as watching TV, are characterized by
short-term desirability, but by the lowest perception
of goals.

Research has shown that, by virtue of its positive
and complex characteristics, optimal experience repre-
sents an important indicator of individuals’ optimal
psychological functioning. From the wider perspective
of the theory of psychological selection (Massimini and
Delle Fave 2000), ﬂow experience plays a key role in
promoting individuals’ long-term development. The
positive features of this complex state of consciousness
foster the active investment of time and effort in the
practice and cultivation of the associated activities.
This progressively leads to an increase in related skills
and competencies, and to the search for higher
challenges in order to support the engagement, con-
centration, and involvement that characterize optimal
experience (Delle Fave et al. 2009). This process there-
fore gives rise to a virtuous cycle promoting individual
development, through both the selective acquisition of
increasingly complex information and the reﬁnement
of related personal competencies (Massimini and Delle
Fave 2000). It also supports the creation of an individ-
ual life theme, that is, the interests and goals a person

The Investigation of Optimal
Experience: Instruments and Models
Several research procedures have been developed to
investigate the daily ﬂuctuations of subjective experi-
ence and the occurrence of ﬂow. Among them, the
most widely used are Experience Sampling Method
(ESM) (Csikszentmihalyi et al. 1977; Hektner et al.
2007), Flow Questionnaire (Csikszentmihalyi 1975/
2000; Delle Fave and Massimini 1991), and the Flow
State Scale-2 (Jackson and Eklund 2002). The ﬁrst two
instruments were widely used in the educational setting
and are thus described below.

Experience Sampling Method (ESM) provides
information on contextual and experiential aspects of
daily life through online repeated self-reports that
participants ﬁll out during the real unfolding of daily
events and situations. In a standard ESM study, partic-
ipants carry for 1 week an electronic device sending
random signals six to eight times a day during waking
hours. They are asked to ﬁll out a form at each signal

reception. ESM forms comprise open-ended questions
investigating the ongoing activities, location and social
context, the content of thought, the desired activities,
places and interactions, if any. Likert-type scales assess
the level of affective, cognitive, motivational variables,
as well as the level of perceived challenges and skills,
personal satisfaction, short- and long-term importance
of the activity. In order to explore the relationship
between challenge and skill perception on the one
side and the quality of experience on the other side,
a model of analysis has been developed, the Experience
Fluctuation Model (EFM; Massimini et al. 1987). The
analysis of ESM data through the EFM showed
a recurrent association between speciﬁc challenge/skill
ratios and speciﬁc experiences.

In particular,

Optimal experience can also be assessed by means
of single administration questionnaires, among which
Flow Questionnaire is the most commonly used in the
educational setting. Participants are asked to read three
quotations that describe optimal experience, to report
whether they have ever had similar experiences in their
life and, if so, to list the associated activities or situa-
tions (also deﬁned optimal activities). Subsequently,
participants are asked to describe such an experience
through 0–8 point

affective, and motivational variables. The individual
and environmental conditions which contribute to
the onset and maintenance of optimal experience are
also investigated.

scales

Optimal Experience and Learning
Research on optimal experience and learning has
mainly been conducted with ESM, thus allowing for
the online investigation of learning activities as well
as the quality of associated experience. Studies on
adolescents were performed in different countries and
cultures, shedding light on the quality of experience in
learning, the contextual and individual factors contrib-
uting to ﬂow onset in learning activities, as well as
the impact of optimal experience in learning activities
on students’ short-term well-being and long-term
development.

Quality of Experience in Learning
Based on ESM assessments, adolescents devote between
40% and 78% of their daily time budget to learning
activities, be they academic tasks performed at school
or studying at home (Hektner et al. 2007). Across
cultures, learning activities represent potentially chal-
lenging opportunities for self-expression and creativity
(Delle Fave and Massimini 2005; Hektner et al. 2007;
Shernoff and Csikszentmihalyi 2009). In particular,
students associate them with high cognitive invest-
ment, the perception of long-term goals, and short-
term stakes. However, they also describe low levels of
happiness, intrinsic motivation, and short-term desir-
ability. When students report a match between high
challenges and high skills, as in optimal experience, the
quality of the learning experience improves in its cog-
nitive, emotional, and motivational dimensions, even
though short-term desirability still hits negative values.
In addition, a difference emerged between school-
work activities – such as listening to lectures and taking
notes – and homework tasks (Bassi and Delle Fave
2004; Hektner et al. 2007). The former are more
frequently associated with apathy and disengagement,
whereas the latter with optimal experience. Such
difference can be related to the degree of perceived
autonomy and self-regulation students describe in the
two contexts. At school, learning activities are primar-
ily directed by the teachers, both in terms of lesson
contents and of amount of time devoted to a given
task. In this condition, adolescents mostly report pas-
sively listening to lessons, ﬁnding in it low meaningful
challenges and no room for skill investment. While at
home, on the other hand, they are in control of learning
activities, are free to decide how much time to devote to
learning, and are thus more likely to experience ﬂow
and active engagement in the task at hand.

Contextual and Individual Variables
Favoring Flow in Learning
Contextual factors play a relevant role in the occur-
rence and cultivation of optimal experience. The pro-
cess of psychological selection is partially regulated by
the set of norms and rules that characterizes the cul-
tural system individuals live in (Csikszentmihalyi and
Massimini 1985). Cultural constraints also contribute
to deﬁne the range and variety of activities available
to the individuals as potential opportunities
for
optimal experiences (Delle Fave and Massimini 2004).

Academic Self-efficacy A 33

In particular, formal education is crucial both for indi-
viduals’ adjustment to society and for the transmission
and perpetuation of cultural information. Cultures dif-
fer in the importance attached to academic learning
and the strategies adopted to transmit it. For example,
studies have shown that Asian and Asian-American
students tend to report a more positive learning expe-
rience, and to retrieve more opportunities for optimal
experience in school activities than their Western Cau-
casian counterparts (Asakawa and Csikszentmihalyi
1998; Shernoff and Schmidt 2008).

Family and school represent the proximal environ-
ment in the ﬁrst stages of development that strongly
inﬂuences individual’s discovery and cultivation of opti-
mal activities. The interaction patterns within the family
can facilitate or hamper the natural tendency of children
to selectively reproduce rewarding activities. Studies on
the role of family in sustaining adolescents’ active
engagement in learning have shown that parents can
represent models of commitment to self-determined
goals (Hektner 2001). In particular, children whose
parents place high relevance on academic activities
and provide both support and challenge in the learning
process are more likely to enjoy learning and to associ-
ate it with optimal experience (Rathunde 2001).

At the school level, various factors have been shown
to impact on students’ retrieval of optimal experiences.
A notion-centered school environment can lead stu-
dents to the development of a passive and compulsory
learning strategy; on the opposite, a learning environ-
ment that enables students to ﬁnd meaningful relations
between study contents and personal experience and
goals can help them discover the rewarding features
of knowledge and the potential of learning tasks as
opportunities for optimal experience (Shernoff and
Csikszentmihalyi 2009). As shown above, teachers
play a major role in promoting students’ optimal expe-
rience at school through the degree of autonomy they
give to learners. Teachers frequently report that stu-
dents’ engagement in academic activities supports their
optimal experiences in teaching; in their turn, students
indicate that their ﬂow in learning is related to the
teachers’ enthusiasm (Hektner et al. 2007). However,
the simultaneous ESM assessment of students’ and
teachers’ experience at school has shown an alarming
discrepancy: While teachers mostly report ﬂow while
teaching, students mostly report apathy while listening
to classes and taking notes. Again, this may be related to

the difference in perceived control. While teaching,
teachers are in control of instruction, but students are
not. This tentative explanation can also apply to the
different quality of experience students associate with
various
learning activities. Comparing ﬁve most
common in-class activities (TV/video, lecture, group
work, individual work, and test/quiz), studies have
shown that adolescents are more engaged in group
and individual work than while listening to a lecture
or watching TV or a video; while taking a test or quiz,
students report very high levels of concentration but
low enjoyment (Shernoff and Csikszentmihalyi 2009).
Also individual factors play a relevant role in the
occurrence and cultivation of optimal experience in
learning (Delle Fave et al. 2009). Evidence has shown
that biological predispositions and speciﬁc talents inﬂu-
ence the orientations of psychological selection and the
perceived opportunities for optimal experience. Studies
with talented teenagers (Csikszentmihalyi et al. 1993)
have highlighted the relationship between talents in
speciﬁc domains, such as music or mathematics, and
the selective long-term engagement in these domains as
opportunities for optimal experiences and skill cultiva-
tion. Also, personality characteristics are associated
with the occurrence of optimal experience in learning;
these include optimism, self-esteem, and extraversion
(Schmidt et al. 2007). Moreover, female high school
students tend to report ﬂow in classrooms more
frequently than males (Shernoff and Schmidt 2008).
However, this may be related to the higher frequency of
optimal experience reported by girls across all contexts.
Finally, studies with US participants also identiﬁed
differences in optimal experience based on age, with
older students (12th graders) reporting more occasions
for ﬂow than younger students (10th graders) (Hektner
et al. 2007; Shernoff and Schmidt 2008).

Short-Term and Long-Term Impact of
Flow on Adolescent’s Development
A great number of studies have shown that the associ-
ation of learning activities with optimal experience has
both short- and long-term consequences (Hektner
et al. 2007, and Shernoff and Csikszentmihalyi 2009,
for a review). In the short term, students derive enjoy-
ment, intrinsic reward, and sense of mastery from
learning tasks (Delle Fave and Bassi 2000). They
additionally report high levels of engagement which,
in its turn, is reﬂected in high academic achievement

34 A Academic Self-efficacy

and grades (Shernoff and Schmidt 2008). In the long
term, research has highlighted the role of optimal
experience in sustaining commitment in learning and
in shaping individual
life themes (Asakawa and
Csikszentmihalyi 1998; Delle Fave and Massimini
2005). Students report longitudinal coherence in the
amount of time devoted to study over a 3-year period
in secondary school (Hektner 2001). The association of
ﬂow with learning activities further contributes to
predicting the level of academic career students are
willing to pursue, and to shaping adolescents’ long-
term goals and future work interests (Csikszentmihalyi
and Schneider 2000; Hektner 2001; Wong and
Csikszentmihalyi 1991).

Merging Perspectives: Self-efficacy
Beliefs and Optimal Experience in
Learning
In the learning domain, recent attempts have been
made to fruitfully join the social-cognitive perspective
underlying academic self-efﬁcacy research with the
humanistic-phenomenological perspective underlying
ﬂow studies (Bassi et al. 2007). Both approaches share
the view that individuals are active agents in the inter-
action with their environment, and stress the role of
self-regulation processes
in programming future
actions on the basis of expectations and beliefs, on the
one hand, and of perceived quality of experience, on
the other. In addition, both underline the role of per-
ceived abilities and sense of mastery in facing environ-
mental challenges. However, the two approaches also
show some differences: Social-cognitive theory places
special emphasis on expectancy about success or fail-
ure, and on beliefs about one’s ability and performance,
while the theory of psychological selection focuses on
the intrinsic value of engaging in learning activities and
its impact on achievement and future plans.

With the aim to better understand adolescents’
learning behavior in the short and long term, the cog-
nitive and experiential constructs were combined into
a broader framework. It was suggested that self-efﬁcacy
beliefs may inﬂuence behavior through the mediating
effect of associated quality of experience. To put this
framework to the test, two groups of Italian secondary
school students were selected on the basis of their high
and low perceived academic self-efﬁcacy. Through ESM,
for 1 week online information was collected on the daily
activities and associated quality of experience of the two

groups. In line with expectations, high self-efﬁcacy stu-
dents devoted more time to learning, especially at home,
than low self-efﬁcacy students. They also reported
a more positive quality of experience during learning,
primarily associating schoolwork (listening to lectures,
taking notes), classwork (oral and written tests), and
homework with optimal experience. On the contrary,
low self-efﬁcacy students did not perceive a great
amount of opportunities for optimal experience in
learning tasks, and they reported different experiential
proﬁles according to the type of learning activities. More
speciﬁcally, they primarily associated schoolwork and
homework with low challenging experiences, such as
apathy and relaxation, and tests and exams with anxiety,
reporting a perceived lack of skills in facing the task.

Conclusions and Future Directions
Findings reported in this essay highlight the impor-
tance of adolescents’ academic self-efﬁcacy beliefs and
optimal experience in learning activities as key factors
in the promotion of well-adjustment at school, quality
learning, and long-term development. The centrality of
these constructs is going to increase in contemporary
society, where information technologies are introduc-
ing extensive changes in educational settings and
increasing importance is assigned to students’ personal
control over learning. Suggestions for intervention as
well as future directions in research can be derived from
these studies.

At the intervention level (see Pajares and Schunk
2001, and Shernoff and Csikszentmihalyi 2009), results
bring forward the need to provide students with learn-
ing activities which are challenging enough in the face
of personal skills. Lack of challenges can lead to expe-
riences of apathy or disengagement that do not sustain
enjoyment in learning and long-term academic com-
mitment (Bassi et al. 2007; Delle Fave and Bassi 2000).
At the same time, sense of competence and conﬁdence
in one’s skills can primarily be raised through success-
ful experiences with the task at hand, namely, through
mastery experiences. For example, a series of studies
(Pajares and Schunk 2001) showed that students’ self-
efﬁcacy beliefs increased through the use of instruc-
tional strategies such as modeling, goal setting, strategy
training, as well as provision of proximal rather than
distal goals, rewards, and attributional or progress
feedback. Emphasis should also be placed on the devel-
opment of students’ self-regulatory habits, providing

Academic Self-efficacy A 35

A

students with optimal learning environments in which
both autonomy and initiative are supported.
Concerning future research directions,

further
studies are needed to devise and test a formal model
including academic self-efﬁcacy beliefs and quality of
experience in learning. Self-efﬁcacy beliefs are expected
to direct behavior through the mediation of perceived
quality of experience, and of optimal experience in
particular. However, optimal experience in learning
activities could have both synchronic and diachronic,
cumulative
consequences. By providing intrinsic
reward, optimal experience can sustain long-term
perseverance and effort in cultivating associated activ-
ities. It could also represent a feedback to perceived
self-efﬁcacy. Direct experience of competence in high
challenge/high skill situations could be cognitively
elaborated into rather stable self-efﬁcacy beliefs. In
their turn, these beliefs could direct time and energy
investment into activities in which individuals perceive
themselves as highly competent in the face of current
challenges. This process would facilitate the retrieval of
optimal experiences and the development of lasting
high self-efﬁcacy beliefs. In the long run, this process
could go on in a virtuous circle, promoting individual
development, with respect to skill cultivation, satisfac-
tion, and goal setting. Shedding light on the mutual
inﬂuences between self-efﬁcacy and ﬂow can advance
understanding of adolescents’ motivational processes
and offer guidelines for promoting enjoyment and
engagement in the school setting.

cultures come into continuous ﬁrst hand contact with

either or both groups” (Redﬁeld et al. 1936, p. 149).
This original deﬁnition stressed continuous, long-term
change and allowed for the process to be bidirectional,
wherein both of the interacting cultures could make
accommodations. The course of the acculturation pro-
cess has been described as ﬂowing from contact between
dominant and nondominant cultural groups to conﬂict
or crises between those groups that eventually results in
adaptations by one or both of the conﬂicting groups.
Based on the relationships to the immigrant’s culture
of origin and the host culture, researchers have
emphasized four cultural adaptation styles: separation,
assimilation, biculturalism, and cultural marginality.
Separation or enculturation has been linked to higher
self-esteem. Assimilation appears to be a risk factor for
poor health and mental health. Biculturalism has been
reported to be the healthiest cultural adaptation style.

Background and Definitions

Acculturation
Acculturation was ﬁrst deﬁned as “phenomena which
result when groups of individuals having different
cultures come into continuous ﬁrst hand contact with
subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of
either or both groups” (Redﬁeld et al. 1936, p. 149).
This original deﬁnition stressed continuous, long-term
change and allowed for the process to be bidirectional,
wherein both of the interacting cultures could make
accommodations. During the Cold War era, the deﬁni-
tion of acculturation was gradually modiﬁed to denote
linear, unidirectional change (Trimble 2003) as a result
of interactions between dominant and nondominant
groups, with nondominant groups taking on the
language, laws, religions, norms, and behaviors of the
dominant group (Berry 1998; Castro et al. 1996. For
example, Smith and Guerra (2006) referred to accul-
turation as “the differences and changes in values and
behaviors that individuals make as they gradually
adopt the cultural values of the dominant society”
(p. 283). Many factors, such as differences in attitudes
between generations and sociopolitical trends, have
inﬂuenced the conceptualization of acculturation, leav-
ing no universally accepted deﬁnition of the term.

Adding further complexity, many other constructs
in cultural research, such as assimilation, enculturation,

acculturation stress,
segmented assimilation, and
biculturalism, have been invoked under the umbrella
of acculturation research. The term acculturation,
which denotes the bidirectional process of cultural
contact and adaptation,
is often erroneously used
interchangeably with the term assimilation, which
captures unidirectional adaptations made by minority
individuals to ﬁt into the host society. Consequently,
the original Redﬁeld (Redﬁeld et al. 1936) deﬁnition
captures the bidirectional notion of acculturation,
whereas the description offered by Smith and Guerra
(2006)
assimilation
approach. These competing unidirectional and bidirec-
tional approaches dominate acculturation research,
inﬂuencing conceptualization, measurement, analytic
strategies, and results of empirical studies in this area
(Cabassa 2003).

Berry (1980) characterized the course of
acculturation process as ﬂowing from contact between
dominant and nondominant cultural groups to conﬂict
or crises between those groups that eventually results in
adaptations by one or both of the conﬂicting groups.
These acculturation phases not only characterize large-
scale sociological group dynamics over long periods,
but also cultural interactions between social groups
during different eras as well as individual psychological
and social processes that affect a person’s adjustment to
a new cultural situation. Cultural conﬂict may develop
gradually and extend continuously over generations, as
it did for Native American people, or it may be quite
abrupt and intense, such as the unsettling immersion
experienced by a newly immigrated Latino or Asian
child who speaks no English when he or she enters
a US school for the ﬁrst time. Although acculturation
stages describe a sociological phenomenon that occurs
between groups, a parallel
interpersonal process is
thought to occur among immigrant individuals and
families.

several

Within this overarching sociological process of
acculturation,
frameworks have
theoretical
been developed to describe what happens to individ-
uals and families during acculturation (Lafromboise
et al. 1993). These various approaches can be divided
into two competing frameworks: assimilation theory
and alternation theory. While proponents of these two
theories agree that there are two criteria for accultura-
tion – whether or not the acculturating individual or
group retains cultural identity and whether or not

38 A Acculturation

a positive relationship to the dominant society is
established (Berry 1998) – they posit different views
on how the acculturation process should end.

Acculturation Theories of Adaptation
Assimilation theorists say that individuals lose cultural
identity in order to identify with the dominant cultural
group. The assimilation model assumes that an indi-
vidual sheds her or his culture of origin in an attempt to
take on the values, beliefs, ways, and perceptions of the
target culture (Berry 1998; Trimble 2003). The domi-
nant culture is seen as more desirable, while the culture
of origin is seen as inferior. In this model, change is
directional, unilinear, nonreversible, and continuous.
Assimilation theory is so pervasive that many accultur-
ation theorists incorrectly use the terms acculturation
and assimilation interchangeably (Lafromboise et al.
1993). This assimilation concept is captured by the
notion of America as a “melting pot” where immi-
grants become “American,” losing their prior culture
and language in order to adapt to the host culture.

Alternation theorists, or proponents of the bicul-
tural model, believe that individuals can both retain
cultural identity and establish a positive relationship
with the dominant culture. Researchers are now
reconsidering linear conceptualizations of acculturation
and are revisiting the original deﬁnition that allowed for
dynamic bidirectional change (Trimble 2003). Alterna-
tion theorists believe that there is great value in the
individual maintaining her or his culture of origin
while acquiring the second culture. Thus, biculturalism,
or having the ability to competently navigate within two
different cultures, is the optimal end point for the pro-
cess of cultural acquisition (LaFromboise et al. 1993).

In contrast

to the unidirectional assimilation
approach, the bidirectional approach from alternation
theory considers enculturation (i.e., adoption and
maintenance of behaviors, norms, values, and customs
from a person’s culture of origin), ethnic identity (i.e.,
a person’s self-deﬁnition based on membership in
a distinct group derived from a perceived shared
heritage), and biculturalism (i.e., ability to integrate

systems

To summarize, acculturation is the overall process
involvement, conﬂict, and change that

of contact,

occurs when two independent cultural systems meet.
Within this large acculturation process, there are two
critical dimensions to consider;
the individual or
families’ relationship to the culture of origin and the
relationship to the host culture. Bringing these two
dimensions together, acculturation researchers discuss
four different cultural adaptation styles (Berry 1998)
that are shown in Table 1. The common notion of
assimilation entails persons losing their culture-of-
origin identity to identify with the dominant (host)
cultural group. Integration, or biculturalism, would
ensue from both retaining ethnic cultural identity and
establishing a positive relationship with the dominant
culture. Retaining culture-of-origin identity without
establishing a positive relationship to the dominant
culture would indicate rejection of
the dominant
culture, separation, and unwillingness to assimilate.
Finally, losing cultural identity without establishing
a positive relationship to the dominant culture would
be the hallmark of deculturation or cultural marginality
(Berry 1980; LaFromboise et al. 1993). Acculturation is
the overall process of cultural involvement. Assimila-
tion is generally associated with high levels of host
culture involvement. A moderate-to-high level of
involvement in both cultures marks integration or
biculturalism. Separation or maintaining
ethnic
identity alone (enculturation) is associated with high
levels of involvement in the culture of origin.

These cultural adaptation styles are important
when considering the research on adolescent accultur-
ation and health behavior. Several decades of empirical
research ﬁndings lead researchers to conclude that
assimilation is an important risk factor for increases
in negative health behaviors and mental health prob-
lems (Amaro et al. 1990; Marks et al. 1990; Miranda
et al. 2000; Vega et al. 1998). Conversely, biculturalism
appears to be emerging as a protective factor that
buffers acculturation stress, enhances sociocognitive

Enculturation
There are several important underlying concepts within
the overarching acculturation process. In contrast to
acculturation, which occurs between cultural groups,
enculturation is the adoption and maintenance of
behaviors,
from
values,
a person’s culture of origin. Every culture indoctrinates
children by exposing them to, or socializing them with,
speciﬁc ideas, beliefs, routines, rituals, religious prac-
tices, languages, and ways of being in the world. The
resulting cluster of beliefs and behaviors culminates in
a person’s ethnic identity. This sense of ethnic identity
is a person’s self-deﬁnition based on membership in
a distinct group derived from a perceived shared
heritage (Phinney and Ong 2007). The broad concept
of enculturation encompasses the individual’s level of
involvement in his or her culture of origin, which is
nurtured through early childhood exposure to cultural
symbols and messages transmitted primarily through
family interactions. By early adulthood, consistent
exposure to these cultural beliefs and behaviors leads
to an individual’s working sense of ethnic identity (e.g.,
an afﬁliation with a cultural group and an understand-
ing of how that cultural group expects its members to
be in the world). The enculturation process both
deﬁnes the characteristics of the group and secures its
future by indoctrinating new members.

Retaining enculturation or culture-of-origin iden-
tity alone without establishing a positive relationship
to the dominant culture would indicate separation and
unwillingness to assimilate. The enculturation quad-
rant in Table 1 represents strong enculturation and
low assimilation into the dominant or host society.
Separation is the adaptation style that characterizes
most immigrant parents who cling strongly to their
culture-of-origin identity and who ﬁnd the accultura-
tion process particularly stressful.

Enculturation is an important

in the
three phases of acculturation given above. During
intercultural contact, differences
in enculturation
between the two groups become apparent. For

instance, Native Americans believed that land was
a gift from the Creator, and no individual owned this
gift. In contrast, the pilgrims, indoctrinated in the
European currency economy and believing that they
were God’s chosen people, saw no difﬁculty in buying,
trading for, or taking land for personal ownership.
Differences between worldviews make groups wary of
outsiders, triggering an urge to close ranks, and defend
the way of life the group understands. It is easy to
see how conﬂict may arise. With the future at stake,
enculturation prompts individuals to choose us versus
them – our beliefs and ways of doing things or theirs.

that power. Usually,

Assimilation
The central issue after different cultures make contact
becomes who has power and control, and how will the
dominant group use
the
nondominant group is strongly inﬂuenced to take on
norms, values, and behaviors espoused by the domi-
nant group. The intensity and negativity associated
with this process is largely contingent upon the recep-
tivity of the dominant group in welcoming, respecting,
or stigmatizing the nondominant group (Berry 1998).
Further, the attitudes held by the dominant group
inﬂuence the adoption of policies for relating to the
nondominant group. For example, dominant group
attitudes toward immigrants that inﬂuence policy are
reﬂected in the debate in the USA regarding whether
English should be declared the country’s ofﬁcial
language, whether school districts support English
immersion or bilingual education programs, and
restrictions requiring certain forms of identiﬁcation
that are difﬁcult for immigrants to obtain in order to
receive a driver’s license.

During the conﬂict and adaptation phases of accul-
turation, antagonistic attitudes from the dominant
group toward immigrants often prompt calls for assim-
ilation or elimination. The term acculturation, which
denotes the bidirectional process of cultural contact
and change, is often erroneously used interchangeably
with the term assimilation, which captures unidirec-
tional adaptations made by minority individuals to
conform to the dominant group.

The common notion of assimilation entails persons
losing their culture-of-origin identity to identify with
the dominant cultural group. That is, a movement in
Table 1 from separation to assimilation, which a person
completes by swapping the positive relationship with

40 A Acculturation

his or her culture of origin for a positive afﬁliation with
the dominant culture. The assimilation model assumes
that an individual sheds her or his culture of origin in
an attempt to take on the values, beliefs, behaviors, and
perceptions of the target culture (Chun et al. 2003).
The individual perceives the dominant culture as
more desirable, whereas the culture of origin is seen
as inferior. In this model, change is “directional,
unilinear, nonreversible, and continuous” (Suarez-
Orozco and Suarez-Orozco 2001, p. 8).

Assimilation theory has been applied in a range of
policies and practice situations. For example, English as
a Second Language (ESL) programs in which instruc-
tors speak only English and policy proposals that
declare English to be the state’s or country’s “ofﬁcial”
language have deep roots in assimilationist ideology. In
1998, California voters passed Proposition 227, which
requires that all public school instruction be conducted
in English by a wide margin (61% vs. 39%; now EC
300–340 of the California Education Code). Similarly,
Arizona’s voters passed Proposition 203 in 2000, which
mandates school instruction must be in English and
severely limits opportunity for bilingual instruction.
Both propositions are examples of the assimilationist
Structured English Immersion approach to educating
immigrants who are not proﬁcient in English.

In general, higher levels of assimilation are associ-
ated with negative health behaviors and mental health
difﬁculties for both adolescents and adults (Rogler et al.
1991; Miranda et al. 2000; Smokowski et al. 2009). In
comparison to their less-acculturated peers, Latinos
who have become more assimilated to the host culture
less
display higher levels of alcohol and drug use,
consumption of nutritionally balanced meals, and
more psychiatric problems (Amaro et al. 1990; Marks
et al. 1990; Vega et al. 1998; Alegrı´a et al. 2008).

Most research on acculturation and adolescent
health behavior has focused on youth violence and
aggressive behavior. Recently, Paul Smokowski et al.
(2009) conducted a comprehensive review of studies
examining the relationship of Latino adolescent
acculturation and youth violence. Among the studies
reviewed, the association between acculturation and
youth violence outcomes was examined in 16 studies;
13 of these investigations examined the perpetration of
violence as the outcome, and these studies examined
fear of being a victim of violence as the outcome.
The results favored a signiﬁcant positive association

status,

between assimilation and youth violence. Nine of
the thirteen studies reported that higher adolescent
assimilation (deﬁned in different ways by time in the
USA, generational
language use, or with
multidimensional measures) was associated with
increased youth violence (Buriel et al. 1982; Sommers
et al. 1993; Vega et al. 1993, 1995; Brook et al. 1998;
Samaniego and Gonzales 1999; Dinh et al. 2002; Bui
and Thongniramol 2005; Smokowski and Bacallao
2006; Schwartz et al. 2007).

Integration
While assimilation theory continues to be popular,
a growing body of research has begun to question
whether it is indeed adaptive for a person to give up
his or her cultural identity to ﬁt into the dominant
culture (de Anda 1984; Feliciano 2001; Suarez-Orozco
and Suarez-Orozco 2001). Critics of the assimilation
model usually support the further development of
alternation theory, a framework that rejects linear
conceptualizations of acculturation and revisits the
Redﬁeld deﬁnition of acculturation that allowed for
dynamic bidirectional change (Trimble 2003). Follow-
ing Table 1, integration, or biculturalism, would ensue

culture. In contrast to the unidirectional approach of
assimilation,
the bidirectional approach considers
enculturation (i.e., adoption and maintenance of
behaviors, norms, values, and customs from a person’s
culture of origin), ethnic identity (i.e., a person’s
self-deﬁnition based on membership in a distinct
group derived from a perceived shared heritage), and

important aspects of

Alternation theorists believe that individuals can
both retain cultural identity and establish a positive
relationship with the dominant culture. Proponents
of the alternation theory of cultural acquisition assert
that there is great value in the individual maintaining
her or his culture of origin while acquiring the second
culture (Feliciano 2001). These theorists believe that
the unidirectional change approach espoused by assim-
ilationists may have ﬁt prior groups of white European
immigrants but does not adequately characterize

Acculturation A 41

A

adaptations made by subsequent waves of immigrants
from Latin America or Asia (de Anda 1984). In this
perspective, biculturalism, or having the ability to
competently navigate within and between two different
cultures, is the optimal end point for the process of
cultural acquisition (Coleman and Gerton 1993). For
the immigrant individual and her or his family, alter-
nation theory supports the integration of cognition,
attitudes, and behaviors from both the culture of origin
and the culture of acquisition. This integration may
result in bilingualism, cognitive code-switching, and
the development of multiple identities (e.g., immigrant
adolescents behaving “American” at
school and
“Latino” at home) to meet disparate environmental
demands (Dolby 2000; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-
Orozco 2001; Trueba 2002).

Of course, the inﬂuence of the dominant or host
culture plays an important role in the acculturation
process. Just as assimilation ideology pushes immi-
grants to accept host culture norms and behaviors,
environmental contexts that actively support and
value multiculturalism can also prompt individuals
and families
toward integration or biculturalism
(Berry 2001; de Anda 1984). Beginning in the 1960s,
multiculturalism gained traction, prompting melting-
pot metaphors to be replaced with references to
a cultural salad bowl or cultural mosaic. In this newer
multicultural approach, each “ingredient” retains its
integrity and ﬂavor while contributing to a successful
ﬁnal product. However, considering the backdrop of
stress and tension, these ethnic relations are better
characterized as a simmering stew than a salad bowl.
In recent years, this multicultural approach has been
ofﬁcially promoted in traditional melting-pot societies
such as Australia, Canada, and Britain, with the intent
of becoming more tolerant of immigrant diversity.
Meanwhile, the USA continues to vacillate between
assimilation and alternation (or multicultural)
approaches to immigration and ethnic relations.

Alternation theory has been used in practice, but
few macro policies have been based on this framework.
English as a Second Language (ESL) and Two-Way
Immersion programs that
in both
English and Spanish are underpinned by alternation
theory. Bicultural skills training programs are another
reﬂection of how alternation theory has been applied to
practice (e.g., see Szapocznik et al. 1984; Bacallao and
Smokowski 2005).

teach content

Research ﬁndings have linked biculturalism with
more adaptive, positive mental health outcomes than
either low- or high-assimilation levels. Alternation
theorists believe that biculturalism is an important,
positive cultural adaptation style within the accultura-
tion process. There is research evidence for this as a
hypothesis. In a study comparing low- and high-
assimilated Latinos, researchers found that bicultural
Latinos obtained higher levels of quality of life, affect
balance, and psychological adjustment (Lang et al.
1982). Miranda and Umhoefer (1998) reported bicul-
tural individuals displayed high levels of social interest
and low levels of depression. In a sample of 252 Latina
undergraduate students, Gomez and Fassinger (1994)
found bicultural women had wider repertoires of
behavioral styles than either their low- or high-
acculturated peers. Other studies found that bicultural
individuals have increased creativity (Carringer 1974),
and greater attention control (Bialystok 1999; Bialystok
et al. 2004). Benet-Martinez et al. (2006) argue that the
more complex mainstream and ethnic cultural repre-
sentations developed by bicultural individuals relate to
their higher levels of both cultural empathy (i.e., the
ability to detect and understand other’s cultural habits
or pressures) and cultural ﬂexibility (i.e., the ability to
quickly switch from one cultural strategy or framework
to another).

Rivera-Sinclair (1997) investigated biculturalism in
a sample of 254 Cuban adults. She measured bicultur-
alism using the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire
(BIQ), and found biculturalism was related to a variety
of factors, including length of time a person had lived
in the USA, age, family income, education level, and
general anxiety level. Her ﬁndings showed that the
study participants who were more likely to report
high levels of biculturalism were those individuals
who had been in the USA longer, had higher incomes,
and had more education. In addition, she found that
younger

bicultural than were older persons. Most important,

Gil et al. (1994) found bicultural adolescents had
the lowest levels of acculturation stress and were less
likely to report low family pride as compared with
low- and high-assimilated Latino adolescents. For
these bicultural adolescents, the acculturation process
did not erode levels of family pride – a dynamic that

instead of

In a study with 323 Latino adolescents living in
North Carolina and Arizona (Smokowski and Bacallao
2007), biculturalism was a cultural asset associated with
fewer internalizing problems and higher self-esteem.
Interestingly,
it was
individuals’ high level of involvement in non-Latino
culture (i.e., US culture) that fueled the protective
effect of biculturalism. However, ethnic identity or
involvement in the culture of origin is strongly related
to self-esteem and familism (e.g., family cohesion).
Similarly, Coatsworth et al. (2005) compared the accul-
turation patterns of 315 Latino youth, and found that
bicultural youth reported signiﬁcantly higher levels of
academic competence, peer competence, and parental
monitoring.

Berry et al. (2006) conducted the largest and most
elaborate investigation of acculturation and adaptation
in immigrant youth in a study that encompassed youth
from 26 different cultural backgrounds in 13 countries.
In all, 7,997 adolescents participated, including 5,366
immigrant youth and 2,631 national youth (ages 13–18
years; mean age of 15 years). These researchers were
able to conﬁrm empirically the four cultural adaptation
styles discussed in this essay. Integration or bicultural-
ism was the predominant adaptation style with 36.4%
immigrant youth ﬁtting this proﬁle (22.5%
of
[separation], 18.7%
displayed an ethnic proﬁle
a national or assimilation proﬁle, and 22.4% a diffuse
or marginalized proﬁle). This bicultural way of living
included reporting diverse acculturation attitudes,
having both ethnic and national cultural identities,
being proﬁcient in both ethnic and national language
knowledge and use, having social engagements with
both ethnic and national peers, and endorsing the
acceptance of both obligations to family and parents,
as well as believing in adolescents’ rights. This high level
of biculturalism (i.e., integrative cultural adaptation
style) in youth supports earlier ﬁndings with adult
immigrants (Berry and Sam 1997).

In this study, Berry and colleagues (2006) found
that the longer youth had lived in the new culture, the
more likely they were to have a bicultural adaptation
style. Further, these researchers found the integrative
cultural adaptation style was associated with both
positive psychological adaptation (measured by indi-
cators of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and psychological

sociological

and positive

problems)
adaptation
(measured by school adjustment and behavioral prob-
lems). In comparison, the ethnic cultural adaptation
style was linked to better psychological adaptation but
worse sociological adaptation, whereas both the
national and diffuse styles were associated with poor
psychological and sociological adaptation. Although
boys had slightly better psychological adaptation than
girls, they had poorer sociocultural adaptation. These
studies provide mounting evidence that psychological

Finally, losing cultural identity without establishing

grants as they construct a new or integrated cultural

Conclusions
To summarize, acculturation is the overall process of
cultural involvement. Assimilation is generally associ-
ated with high levels of host culture involvement.
A moderate-to-high level of
in both
cultures marks integration or biculturalism. Separation
or maintaining ethnic identity alone (enculturation) is
associated with high levels of
involvement in the
culture of origin, whereas having no afﬁliation with
either culture is the hallmark of deculturation or
marginalization. These four cultural adaptation styles
and two major theories of cultural change (assimilation
and alternation theories) capture much of the dynamic
complexity within the overall acculturation process.
Revisiting Berry’s (1998) criteria, assimilation theory
posits that a positive relationship to the dominant
society is established without retention of ethnic
identity, whereas in alternation theory, a moderate-
to-strong positive relationship to the dominant society
is established and a moderate-to-strong positive rela-
tionship to ethnic identity or culture of origin is
retained. Neither theory has much to say about cultural

marginality, which occurs when a positive relationship
is not formed with either the new culture or the culture
of origin. Cultural marginality can result in apathy, lack
of interest in culture, or the formation of a negative
relationship with both cultures.

Flannery et al. (2001) conducted the earliest direct
comparison of
the assimilation and alternation
models. In a sample of 291 Asian-Americans, they
reported that both models had adequate predictive
validity for use in acculturation research. They
recommended using the unidirectional assimilationist
model as an economical proxy measure of accultura-
tion, and using the bidirectional alternation model for
investigations of acculturation”
“full
(Flannery et al. 2001, p. 1035).

theoretical

Turning our attention back to the conceptualiza-
tions of acculturation, alternation theory is aligned
with the original Redﬁeld deﬁnition that allows for
dynamic bidirectional adaptations to occur in either
or both cultures. Assimilation theory is aligned with
the modiﬁed deﬁnition of acculturation that assumes
unidirectional change from the dominant
to the
nondominant group. Assimilation and alternation
theories, and the various cultural adaptation styles
introduced above, are fascinating sociological con-
structs; however, these ideas become ever more critical
when linked to health and mental health. Assimilation
and alternation theories have both inspired several
decades of research and knowledge development.
Neither theory has been able to marshal enough empir-
ical support to dominate the other. Rogler et al. (1991)
reviewed 30 investigations to determine if consensus
existed on the link between acculturation and mental
health. Their review found evidence supporting each of
the proposed relationships – positive, negative, and
curvilinear – between acculturation and mental health.
The relationship depends upon the speciﬁc mental
health issue (e.g., drug use, aggressive behavior, depres-
sion, anxiety)
scrutiny. Research
is under
conducted after this review suggests that assimilation
is an important risk factor, especially for youth
violence, and biculturalism is a salient cultural asset,
promoting psychological and social well-being.

Achievement Motivation

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Achievement motivation may be understood as an
individual’s concern for becoming successful, doing
well, meeting obligations, overcoming obstacles, and
attaining a sense of excellence. In the ﬁeld of psychol-
ogy, the concept ﬁrst emerged as one of the basic needs
identiﬁed in Henry Murray’s (1938) groundbreaking
theory of human motivation. Murray proposed that
internal states of disequilibrium drive individuals’
behaviors, and that disequilibrium emerges when

Achievement Motivation A 45

A

individuals have a sense that they lack something and
a need to address it. Murray classiﬁed needs as being
primary (such as those that are biologically based like
the need for food, air, water) or as secondary (such as
those either driven by biological needs or an individ-
ual’s psychological makeup, like need for afﬁliation,
power, recognition, autonomy). Murray conceptual-
ized the need for achievement as a secondary need.
That need has been one of the most studied, along
with the need for power and afﬁliation, and has
mushroomed into several areas of research that relate
to the period of adolescence.

The study of achievement motivation initially was
popularized by the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT;
McClelland et al. 1953) and efforts to link the need for
achievement with other characteristics and their out-
comes. The TAT gives high scores to those who work
well under moderate risk, seek new information,
advice, and feedback. Individuals who delay gratiﬁca-
tion, who get along well with others, and also attribute
their success to internal factors and failure to external
factors receive high TAT scores. Although the tendency
has been to view the need to achieve as a good dispo-
sition, this is not always the case, as those with a high
need to achieve also have been found more likely to use
illegal or deceitful means
to achieve their goals
(McClelland 1985). Still, studies using the TAT have
been among the most fruitful as they have led to
important research and theoretical developments.

Deﬁned as an operationalization of Max Weber’s
protestant ethic, TAT achievement scores have been
found to be less reliable for predicting achievement in
certain situations (McClelland 1961). These differences
essentially have revolutionized the ﬁeld. For example,
TAT scores are less reliable when measuring academic
achievement motivation for school and more reliable
for predicting frustration in political ﬁgures. In addi-
tion, TATmeasures and direct measures of achievement
motivation do not appear to correlate; they are associ-
ated with different actions and life outcomes. These
important ﬁndings contributed to a considerable
amount of research seeking to explain them. The result
of that research has led researchers to conclude that
the TAT measures intrinsic motivation, while direct
measures look more at social rewards for achievement
(see Spangler 1992) and that two distinct but related
motivational
systems exist: explicit and implicit
achievement motivation (see McClelland et al. 1989;

46 A Achievement Motivation

Thrash et al. 2007). These developments have been
shown to have important implications. Notably, they
reveal that different types of achievement motivations
affect cognitive activities, self-regulatory strategies,
and expectations for success. These differences have
practical implications given how intrinsically or extrin-
sically motivated individuals can respond differently to
different performance contexts (Story et al. 2009).

(1966)

Researchers have provided other important ways to
measure and understand achievement motivation. For
example, Atkinson and Feather
created
a multivariate model that includes achievement moti-
vation and the probability of success. This approach
helped researchers to understand not only longitudinal
pathways and outcomes but also the development of
the theory of motivational behavior, such as separate
components for approach and avoidance of achieve-
ment. Another group of researchers conceptualized
achievement needs in a way that has become known
as expectancy value theory, a theory developed to
understand the mental calculations that take place in
attitude development (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975). For
example, their model views beliefs about achievement
beliefs (e.g., self-perceptions of competence) and behav-
iors (e.g., persistence) as determined both by the expec-
tancy youth have for success and the subjective value
they place on succeeding (Wigﬁeld and Eccles 2000).

Much research has focused on sex and cultural
differences as well as developmental aspects of motiva-
tions for achievement. Historically, researchers viewed
arousal and expression as differing by gender; however,
comprehensive reviews have found no such pattern
(Stewart and Chester 1982; Smith 1992). International
studies generally have conﬁrmed results from the USA;
however, ideas of achievement differ depending on
their cultural context (McClelland 1961), with achieve-
ment motivation associating with cultural differences
in the perception and selection of domains, goals, and
behaviors
(Hofer et al. 2010). Developmentally,
evidence has shown that parenting styles that train
children for healthy independence – those with
warmth, encouragement, and low control – cultivate
high motivational achievement (McClelland 1985;
Turner et al. 2009). As expected, these results do not
always carry through from one study to the next, but
general themes continue to gain support.

The study of achievement motivation has grown
considerably given that several researchers have now

offered different ways to understand it, sometimes
using a variety of terms, and an increasing focus on
the factors that contribute to what would be deemed
achievement motivation. For example, Maehr (1984),
who focused on educational contexts, hypothesized
that motivation for achievement depends on the mean-
ing that the learner creates for it, and this in turn
inﬂuences how much time and energy the learner
invests. For Maehr, meaning was comprised of three
facets: an individual’s current personal goals, that indi-
vidual’s sense of self, and that individual’s perceptions
of what could be achieved in the classroom. These three
facets were proposed to be inﬂuenced by four anteced-
ents: available information, characteristics of the learn-
ing situation, personal
experience, and broader
sociocultural
contexts. Achievement motivation,
under this approach, depends on all of these factors
and, not surprisingly, all of these factors have been the
subject of increasing research. Most notably, the sense
of self that is now known as “self-efﬁcacy” has received
considerable interest. Self-efﬁcacy, an individual’s
belief that they can perform a task, is part of under-
standing the self; it has been shown to be positively
related to academic behaviors such as persistence,
and achievement
strategy use,
effort,
(Bandura 1997). Similarly, peer environments have
been viewed as particularly important for adolescents.
Belonging, peer interest in learning, and peer resistance
to school norms might all be related to classroom
environments. Positive associations have been shown
between perceived peer investment in class activities
and grades and their achievement. Acceptance and
value also enhance a sense of belonging, as well as the
sense that classrooms support mastery and improve-
ment. And adolescents’ social groups may promote or
discourage certain behaviors, such as an achievement
orientation, which could include a lack of it (Nelson
and DeBacker 2008). These important lines of research
conﬁrm the complexity of this area of study and the
need for research to focus on multiple factors.

cognitive

The study of achievement motivation has grown
considerably since it was conceptualized in the early
1900s. Although several researchers continued to use
the term and have devised important measures to
understand it, more recent research appears to focus
more on its related components and on speciﬁc
contexts of the need to achieve, such as in academic
settings (see Steinmayr and Spinath 2009) and work-

based contexts (Kenny et al. 2010). These studies high-
light key points, such as the importance of families,
peers, and other social environments in fostering and
shaping individuals’ sense of self related to the need to
achieve. The fragmentation may leave an impression of
a reduced interest in understanding achievement moti-
vation, but the reality appears to be that researchers have
increased their interest in it, especially in understanding
its developmental roots and potential outcomes.

Achievement Tests

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Achievement tests are evaluations that seek to measure
knowledge or skills gained after training, instruction,
or other experiences (Gibson and Mitchell 2008;
McMillan and Schumacher 2010). These types of tests
are taken by adolescents throughout their educational
careers, even though they sometimes may not even
realize that they are taking them. Although a wide
variety of achievement tests exists, they can be grouped
into categories according to their primary purpose and
the scope of comparison (Whiston 2009). For example,
norm-referenced achievement tests compare an indi-
vidual’s test score in a speciﬁc area to those of other
test-takers. Criterion reference tests compare an
individual’s scores to a preset of knowledge or abilities.
Some tests can be a mixture of both, such as some
diagnostic achievement tests that are given to individ-
to determine academic progress or identify
uals
strengths and weaknesses.

Efforts to measure achievement have grown, and
their increase has resulted in considerable controversy.
In educational environments, most notably, these tests
often have become known as “high-stakes tests.” These
types of tests are those that can have important conse-
quences for individuals, such as their moving to the

48 A Acting Out

next grade, graduating, being allowed to take certain
classes, or earning admittance into a school. Perhaps
the most familiar use of achievement tests are group
entrance exams taken by college-bound adolescents,
such as the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs) that play
a critical role in the admissions criteria used by colleges
and universities. It is these tests that have attracted the
most controversy since they potentially have a powerful
effect on an individual’s life. The increasing controver-
sies that these tests attract include, for example, con-
cern that they use arbitrarily set standards, that they do
not test important skills, that they shift the learning
environment away from more creative learning, that
they disadvantage particular groups in society, and that
they are being used inappropriately (like for closing
schools deemed problematic)
(see, e.g., Whiston
2009). Despite these controversies, the tests can remain
useful tools that reveal the extent of an individual’s
knowledge and how they might perform in certain
environments. It seems clear that, despite criticisms,
these types of tests are likely to continue to play an
important role in adolescence, a role that seems to
increase in signiﬁcance even when controversies and
resistance abound.

Acting Out

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

The term “acting out” can have a variety of meanings
as well as be executed at different levels of intensity.
Acting out typically describes situations involving an
individual’s failure to exercise proper control over their
actions, which is why acting out also tends to be used as
a pejorative term. It indicates that the individual has
failed to censor their taboo primitive impulses and

signals a lack of assimilation into basic social norms
is
(e.g., a faulty upbringing). Because acting out
considered destructive, self-destructive, and socially
undesirable, it usually is reserved for an observation
of others’ behaviors. Acting out can be understood
from the perspective of several disciplines, but it ﬁgures
most prominently in therapeutic settings and those
concerned with delinquent or other risky behavior
(see Alexander and Sexton 2002; Overbeek et al.
2005). Almost invariably, acting out has been associ-
ated with the adolescent period, with acting out even
seen as acting adolescent.

Therapeutic and criminological views of acting out
show well its manifestations. From the perspective of
psychotherapy and clinical science, acting out is con-
sidered the emergence of inner conﬂict without inten-
tion or insight (see Richarz and Romisch 2002). Some
therapists see acting out as a means for personal growth
and self-expression, while others see it as detrimental
because it causes catharsis without insight. Acting out
can involve demonstrating inner thoughts against
a person’s better judgment, divulging emotions that
they do not want to acknowledge, or enacting experi-
ences that they do not want to process. Criminological
views tend to view acting out as an expression of
deviance, violence (to the self or others), and risk
taking (see, e.g., Overbeek et al. 2005). Acting out
behavior may not be a usual characteristic of an
individual; however, some individuals act out as
a normal part of their lives. The therapeutic and
criminological views, then, complement one another
well in the manner they give a broader view of acting
out, with one viewing it in constructive ways while the
other viewing it as essentially problematic and in need
of control.

The criminological view that

focuses on risk
taking likely is the most generally recognized form
of “acting out” as it reﬂects popular perceptions of
some adolescents. Indeed, some view adolescents as
quintessentially linked to acting out; they regard the
adolescent period as one marked by actions destructive
to themselves or others in the manner they hamper the
effective development of
feelings and social skills.
Although leading commentators may lament this neg-
ative view of adolescents, considerable research does
support the claim that much of “acting out” revealed in
antisocial behavior occurs during adolescence, that
much of antisocial behavior is adolescence-limited

(see Mofﬁtt 2003). Becoming mature and thus able not
to act out typically means developing the ability to
express conﬂicts safely and constructively, and being
able to exercise appropriate impulse control, personal
development, self-care, and relationship skills (see, e.g.,
Barker and Galambos 2005; Schultz et al. 2003).

fantasies or

Although popular images of acting out associate it
with the adolescent period, researchers tend to ﬁnd acting
out as part of everyday life and ﬁnd it in many contexts.
The most notable contexts include acting out desires and
fears through dreaming (see Richarz and Romisch 2002)
or acting out
socially inappropriate
thoughts by watching or otherwise interacting with
media that can mimic real-life situations (see Bo¨sche
2009). Despite those contributions, acting out likely
will continue to be a term pejoratively associated with
youth. Seen more comprehensively, however, the con-
cept of acting out clearly has been quite useful as it has
made important contributions to our understanding of
adolescents’
their relative
impulses and behaviors,
levels of maturity and deviance, as well as their
developmental challenges and outcomes.

Overview
Youth activism is a form of political engagement in
which young people identify common interests, mobi-
lize their peers, and work collectively to make their
voices heard in the public square. Research on youth
activism is interdiscipinary, emerging out of scholar-
ship on youth development, civic engagement, cultural
studies, and social movements. Youth activism is an
important domain of research for two broad reasons.
First, youth activists defy societal stereotypes about
teenagers, such as that they are self-involved, impulsive,
or unprepared for participation in mature community
activities. Understanding youth’s accomplishments in
activism can challenge and expand conventional
notions about adolescence as a developmental stage.
Second, understanding youth activism as a develop-
mental context is important, particularly for youth
who feel marginalized from their schools or communi-
ties. Settings that support youth activism exemplify
principles of learning that are relevant to other kinds
of learning environments, such as schools and after-
school programs.

Introduction
Young people seek to make their voices heard and
improve their communities or schools in a lasting way
by engaging in activism and organizing. Youth may not
have opportunities to vote or hold formal seats on
decision-making bodies, but many contribute to social
action campaigns that give voice to their hopes and
concerns (Checkoway and Richards-Schuster 2006).
For example, activist groups have worked to strengthen
failing schools, performed action research to expose
environmental polluters, and developed partnerships
between gay and straight youth to promote safety and
inclusion (Sadowski 2007; Warren et al. 2008). Here
the term “activism” is used synonymously with “orga-
nizing” in order to capture the broad range of groups
that engage young people in social change. Typically,
such groups are based in community organizations,

50 A Activism

The developmental

churches, or after-school youth programs, but in some
cases they may arise from school classes or clubs. In
contrast to community service programs where youth
clean parks, tutor children, or serve food to the home-
less, youth activism groups seek to inﬂuence public
policy or change institutional practices, often with
a social justice focus (Kahne and Westheimer 1996). In
this sense such groups exemplify a critical form of civic
engagement, in which youth are encouraged to chal-
lenge the status quo and envision better alternatives for
themselves and their peers (Watts and Flanagan 2007).
literature on youth activism
discussed in this essay focuses on middle-school-aged
and high-school-aged youth, as distinct from research
about activism among college students. Much of the
research on activism among youth between the ages of
12 and 18 has focused on young people from commu-
nities that have been systematically left out of decision
making or who are deprived of adequate opportunities
to learn in their schools and neighborhoods. For exam-
ple, in the USA, research on activism has described
efforts by African-American, Latino, and Asian-
American youth from low-income neighborhoods to
become collectively organized and participate in the
public square. The term “marginalized” is broader
than just ethnicity, however. Gay–straight alliances,
for example, represent efforts by gay, lesbian, bisexual,
and transgender (GLBT) youth and their heterosexual
allies to create safe spaces in schools for GLBT students
(Sadowski 2007). Research on youth activism tends to
focus on marginalized youth because, historically, it is
through organizing that oppressed groups gain power
and accomplish social change.

Youth activism has proven to be an interdisciplin-
ary ﬁeld that attracts developmentalists, sociologists,
anthropologists, and political scientists, among others.
scholars have conducted
Adolescent development
studies that demonstrate the kinds of developmental
competencies associated with activism (e.g., Larson &
Hanson, 2005). Sociologists have examined activism in
terms of broader questions about age segregation,
inequality, and resistance (Ginwright et al. 2006; Gor-
don 2010). Education researchers focus on the political
impact of youth organizing, such as in the arena of
school reform (Oakes and Rogers 2006; Warren et al.
2008).

For the most part, research has relied on case
studies of youth groups that draw upon ethnographic

observation and interviews (e.g., Ginwright 2007;
Kirshner 2009; Larson and Hansen 2005). Several
reasons account for this pattern. First, youth activism
is an emerging domain of research. In early stages of
research, open-ended, exploratory inquiry is called for
in order to understand the domain. This was particu-
larly the case with youth organizing, because scholars
argued that conventional measures of civic engage-
ment, such as those that measure volunteering or
future intention to vote, did not capture the kinds of
grassroots community engagement activities of low-
income youth (Cohen 2006). Second, because activism
is signaled by authentic behavior and action, it is best
studied in real-world, naturalistic contexts, rather than
through laboratory simulations. In this sense the
research has been driven by practice. Third, youth
activist groups tend to be self-selecting. Unlike schools,
they attract participants who elect to be there, which
means that it would not make sense to impose random
assignment on such groups and expect results to have
ecological validity.

Scholars have begun to develop measures that can
be used in surveys with larger populations of youth that
tap into personal behavior or attitudes associated with
organizing and activism. Measures focus on constructs
that include political voice, competencies for civic
action, participation in boycotts or demonstrations,
political efﬁcacy, and perceptions of inequality and
injustice. A comprehensive list of these survey measures
can be found in Flanagan et al. (2007).

Youth Activism as a Context for
Development
This section idenﬁties common features of settings that
engage youth in efforts to improve their schools and
communities.

Authentic Interests
Youth activism campaigns emerge from struggles that
youth experience in their everyday lives, such as pollu-
tion, lack of safety, and substandard schools (Ginwright
and James 2002; Delgado and Staples 2007). Effective
organizers invite youth to reﬂect on what they want to
see improved about their environment – in short, to
articulate their interests (Boyte 2004). Organizing
a project around people’s self-interests means the
stakes are high – it has real consequences for the
participants.

Activism A 51

A

Collective Problem Solving
Researchers have noted that the collective focus of
youth activism is one of its deﬁning features (Youniss
and Hart 2005). Participation involves a shift in focus
from individual to group – from “what I can do” to
“what we can do together.” Members learn how to work
effectively with others because their projects would
otherwise not succeed. Watkins et al. (2007) showed
that through working together on a social action
campaign, youth participants learned how to “bridge
differences” related to race, ethnicity, gender, and
sexual orientation. Such experiences may contribute
to feelings of collective efﬁcacy. In a case study of
a youth organizing group, young people commonly
invoked the slogan “power in numbers” or “strength
in numbers” to recruit others to their cause, suggesting
the formation of a sense of collective efﬁcacy (Kirshner
2009).

From the perspective of cognitive science,
the
emphasis on collective problem solving in youth activ-
ism embodies a distinct form of distributed cognition,
which refers to the ways in which problem solving is
distributed across people and tools (Hutchins 2000).
According to this view, cognition is not just inside
a person’s head, but is instead distributed across
a range of people and technological tools. Similarly,
tasks in youth activism groups are often distributed
among participants (Kirshner 2008). For example,
include
a group designing a press release might
a computer-savvy writer, a talented artist, and someone
who is good at keeping people on task. In such
a scenario, each person may not master all of the
same skills, but together they made an effective team.
The collaborative, distributed nature of work in
activism groups enables participants to accomplish
goals they would be hard-pressed to accomplish on
their own. Consider some of the complex cognitive
and social tasks required in effective political action
campaigns. For example, participants must develop
long-term strategies and respond to unexpected
contingencies. They need to construct arguments that
are sensitive to audience, such as when speaking before
a city council. And along the way they need to build
support among their peers and community members.
Young people’s accomplishments in campaigns defy
predictions about what adolescents are capable of
doing according to standard developmental theory
(Youniss and Hart 2005).

When effective, youth organizing groups comprise
highly interdependent systems that provide the neces-
sary scaffolding and resources for youth to accomplish
challenging goals. In this sense, activism groups engage
young people’s “zone of proximal development”
(ZPD), which refers to the distance between what
a person can do alone and what she can do in collab-
oration with peers or an experienced adult (Vygotsky
1978). Activities targeted toward the upper end of the
zone of proximal development are said to stimulate
development – they comprise “leading activities” for
development, helping to support and stimulate young
people’s maturing psychological functions (Grifﬁn and
Cole 1999). When organized optimally, social action
campaigns may serve as leading activities for the devel-
opment of
thinking and sociopolitical
awareness.

strategic

Youth–Adult Partnerships
Much of the literature about youth activism fore-
grounds the actions and accomplishments of youth
themselves. But this emphasis on “youth” obscures the
fact that activism groups typically embody cross-age
collaborations in which young adults (usually in their
twenties) play critical roles as organizers and advisors.
The quality of relationships between youth and
young adults has become a topic of
for
researchers (Larson et al. 2005). Adults who work
with high-school-aged or middle-school-aged youth
often experience dilemmas about their roles. For exam-
ple, some adults may seek to empower youth by letting
them formulate campaign strategy; they step aside so
that youth can assume leadership. But these same
adults may have greater expertise in campaign strategy
or how to facilitate group decision making. Tensions
between youth empowerment goals and adult exper-
tise, therefore can pose challenges for adult leaders
(Kirshner 2008).

interest

Forms of youth–adult interaction vary considerably
across groups. Some groups aspire to be “youth-led,” in
which case adults act simply as facilitators who help
youth formulate their own goals and plans (Larson
et al. 2005). Other groups seek to develop partnerships
characterized by shared roles and egalitarian decision
making (Camino 2005). Still others embrace an
apprenticeship approach, in which veteran activists
model what it means to engage in social action or
community organizing (Kirshner 2006). As in craft

52 A Activism

apprenticeships, experienced adults gradually “fade” so
that youth can take over the activities of the group.
And, of course, there are additional ways of parsing
gradations of youth–adult interaction, as suggested by
Hart’s (1992) “ladder of participation,” which is used
widely by youth organizations (see also Hart 2006 for
an updated commentary on this framework).

Regardless of the speciﬁc type of collaboration, the
very fact that youth interact with adults as they carry
out activism campaigns is signiﬁcant, given a broader
societal context in which age segregation is common
(Hart 2006; Heath 1999; Zeldin et al. 2003). As Rogoff
et al. (2003) write, “Instead of routinely helping adults,
children are often involved in specialized child-focused
exercises to assemble skills for later entry in mature
activities” (p. 181). Urban high schools, in particular,
are often too large, anonymous, and lacking in oppor-
tunities for meaningful connections between teachers
and students (National Research Council 2003. Youth
groups, therefore, provide an important venue for
young people to develop relationships with adults in
the context of task-oriented activities.

Alternative Frames for Identity
Youth activists forge identities that challenge stereo-
types about low-income youth of color. One way they
do this is through the actions they take in the public
realm. By participating in civic venues, such as school
board or city council meetings, youth position them-
selves – and are positioned by others – as competent
political actors (Nasir and Kirshner 2003). Youth activ-
ism groups also provide alternative frames for identity
through the kinds of sociopolitical ideologies that they
espouse. As Youniss and Yates (1997) have written, in
order to develop a civic identity, adolescents must
come to identify with transcendent values and ideolo-
gies that link the self to a past and present. Here the
term ideology is not limited to speciﬁc political sys-
tems, but instead connotes the need to ﬁnd meaning –
to identify with beliefs that link one to a broader social
and cultural context (Furrow and Wagener 2003).
Experiences that expose teenagers to political view-
points support civic identity development because
they enable young people to reﬂect on sociopolitical
issues and to see themselves as active producers of
society (Kirshner 2009).

Social justice-oriented youth activism groups, in
particular, seek to foster awareness of the inﬂuence of

social forces on individual behavior as well as a belief in
the power of ordinary people to accomplish social
change (Freire 1970; Watts and Flanagan 2007). Such
conversations may be especially relevant to low-income
youth of color who have experienced a disjuncture
between American ideals and their lived experiences
of poverty or racism (Rubin 2007). Activism projects
enable youth to see how issues that are typically treated
as a private responsibility can be reframed as
a collective responsibility. This way of framing social
problems can be signiﬁcant in identity development
because it contributes to feelings of empowerment
and collective self-determination (Flores-Gonzales
et al. 2006). For example, Ginwright (2007) described
the case of a young mother seeking her high-school
diploma who encountered barriers to ﬁnding child care
during school hours. Rather than interpret the situa-
tion as her own isolated problem, she organized other
teenage mothers to make their case to the district
superintendent, who decided to keep the child-care
center open. Although longitudinal research is called
for to understand precisely how social action experi-
ences
identity development,
Ginwright’s study suggests that taking action may
contribute to a sense of collective identity that is related
to positive youth development outcomes.

Engagement in Academic and Civic
Institutions
Social action can be a vehicle for making academic
skills relevant to youth’s everyday lives (Tate 1995).
For example, Rogers et al. (2007) write about the
history, language arts, and statistics skills that youth
employed to accomplish projects documenting ineq-
uities in the Los Angeles school system. Youth partici-
pants described these academic practices as “tools” to
accomplish goals they cared about – rather than view
school subjects as foreign or alienating, they sought to
become more proﬁcient so that they could ﬁnd and
document evidence for their projects. Similarly, Mitra
(2004) has written about the powerful competencies
that students develop when they pursue strategies to
gain greater “student voice” in their schools. Propo-
nents of student voice aim to create opportunities for
a broad range of students to be heard in decision
making and planning, by creating new structures that
convene youth and adults to work together, such as
assessment and strategic planning, student-guided

Activism A 53

A

neighborhood tours for teachers, or leading profes-
sional development workshops for teachers (Mitra
2007; Yonezawa and Jones 2007).

Activism groups also connect youth to mainstream
civic institutions. Campaigns typically culminate in
presentations to civic decision makers, outreach to
community residents, or closed-door meetings with
policymakers where youth present policy proposals or
grievances (Kirshner and Geil (in press)). Political
encounters such as these represent concrete access
points for youth. Such access points offer some of the
few public channels through which young people can
transgress age segregation and contribute their voice to
political decision making.

Debates and Knowledge Gaps

Measures of Civic Action
Efforts to quantify civic engagement through surveys
struggle with what counts as civic action. Some argue
that existing measures of civic engagement, such as
intention to vote or volunteer, are too narrow and
discount other important forms of engagement, such
as helping out a neighbor in need, providing informal
mentoring to neighborhood children, or performing
a socially conscious hip-hop song. Ethnographic
research has sought to uncover and report a more
expanded set of behaviors and practices that scholars
include when talking about youth civic engagement. At
the same time, some scholars argue that research
should demarcate behaviors that are explicitly political
in nature, such as efforts to change policies or institu-
tional structures that contribute to inequality.

Insider and Outsider Approaches to
Youth Voice and Activism
Insider strategies tend to work from within the system
by building partnerships between students and adult
personnel
that contribute to site-based decision
making and changes to classroom instruction (Mitra
2006). Such opportunities go beyond student councils
by creating new structures that convene youth and
adults to work together to improve their school. One
especially promising strategy is student action research
(Jones and Yonezawa 2008; Rubin and Jones 2007).
Administrators, parents, and students share a common
interest in high-quality data that captures features
of school quality and climate that are absent from

NCLB-mandated measures, but which are relevant to
school improvement. In a project described by Jones
and Yonezawa (2008), for example, students collected
data showing a wide discrepancy between students and
teachers’ views of the level of challenge in their classes,
which provoked conversations among teachers about
how to respond. In another example, students in Oak-
land created a youth-authored School Accountability
Report (SAR) that included variables such as student
achievement, teacher quality, health and nutrition, and
facilities
(Duncan-Andrade n.d.). These ﬂedgling
efforts to create broader measures of school quality
leverage students’ expertise about their worlds and
school leaders’ desire for useful data to complement
measures of test performance. One potential limitation
of insider strategies is if they become focused solely on
technical questions, such as how to improve grading
procedures or create stronger teacher–student relation-
ships, without also addressing broader issues of equity
in a school or district (Renee et al. 2009). Another
limitation is if student roles are just window dressing
or tokenistic (Zeldin et al. 2003).

Youth and community organizing groups based
outside of schools, on the other hand, have sometimes
shown their ability to hold political decision makers
accountable to constituents and thereby promote equi-
table reforms (Oakes and Rogers 2006; Warren et al.
2008). Kwon (2006), for example, described how a pan-
ethnic coalition of youth groups successfully defeated
a plan to build a “super jail” for juvenile offenders in
California. Youth organizing groups may be more likely
to appeal to students who feel marginalized in school or
are not academically successful. Further research is
needed, however, that compares the effectiveness of
insider and outsider approaches for accomplishing
equity-based school reform.

Effects of Activism on Development
Qualitative case study research suggests that extended
social action or youth voice campaigns provide oppor-
tunities to develop and practice powerful competen-
cies, such as decision making, social trust, strategic
thinking, civic efﬁcacy, and intergroup understanding
(Larson and Hansen 2005; Watkins et al. 2007; Mitra
2004; Ginwright 2007). Because of the self-selected
populations and lack of comparison studies, however,
some scholars have questioned the causal inferences
that people make about these studies. It could be that

54 A Activism

the key drivers of development in these settings have
more to do with their small size, the personalities of
adult leaders, or the fact that they are self-selected in
their composition.

These unresolved debates have important implica-
tions for civic education. For example, if youth were
required or randomly assigned to join a social action
group as part of the school curricula, would such expe-
riences show the same effects? Forced participation
such as this would likely undermine the basic principles
of empowerment settings. Nevertheless, efforts to apply
youth organizing principles in a more general way to
schools represent an important future direction for
research and practice. It is an open question whether
the guiding principles of community-based activism
groups would show similar successes engaging youth
if they were formalized as part of a school-based civic
education curricula.

A related area for research pertains to the impact of
activism on youth development
and resiliency.
Although there have been longitudinal studies of par-
ticipants in the Civil Rights movement (discussed in
Youniss and Yates 1997), few studies of contemporary
youth activism have examined participants’ trajectories
of development over several years. It is not known how
short-term experiences contribute to youth’s long-term
sociopolitical identities or other developmental out-
comes. This kind of research is particularly challenging
because young people tend to self-select into such
groups, making causal inferences difﬁcult. Neverthe-
less, careful longitudinal studies need not be random-
ized experiments
to help us understand how
participants change over time and how social action
experiences become meaningful in their lives.

Understudied Populations
In 2006, there were widespread rallies for immigration
reform in the USA. Many of the participants were
undocumented youth. But with some exceptions (e.g.,
Perez 2009), few scholars have studied the precursors or
outcomes of activism for undocumented immigrant
youth. This is partly because undocumented youth
need to conceal their status for fear of deportation or
other consequences
families
(Gonzalez 2007). Despite barriers to participation,
many undocumented youth are taking active roles
trying to lobby legislators to pass immigration reform
and the Dream Act.

them and their

for

Another understudied population is socially con-
servative youth, such as those who organize to restrict
abortion or promote prayer in schools. Activism is
often viewed as the province of politically progressive
groups, but scholarship on activism will be limited if it
does not also explore its conservative varieties.

Conclusion
In the context of developmental psychology, adoles-
cence has historically been portrayed as a stage between
childhood and adulthood. For some, the stage-based
approach implies a view of teenagers as “unﬁnished”
or “undeveloped,” which has contributed to social
policies that restrict them from the public sphere
(Vadeboncoeur 2005). Although neurological and
biological research has shown that adolescence is a time
of heightened physiological change, the implications for
adolescent roles are under-determined. For example,
some interpret evidence of
the
prefrontal cortex as a rationale for limiting youths’ roles
or treating them as a separate class from adults. Others
point to such evidence to show how important it is that
youth gain complex experiences interacting with adult
systems and learning how to participate in them as agents
of change. The research on youth activism discussed in
this essay provides support for the argument that the
most effective response to youth’s transitional status is to
provide authentic opportunities to participate, rather
than maintain their segregation from adult institutions.

Acute Brain Disorders

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Acute brain disorders, sometimes referred to as acute
brain syndromes, are various psychiatric syndromes

that are temporary, reversible, and diffuse in their
impairment. Acute refers to the process’ reversibility.
The impairment is typically caused by head injury, use
of drugs, or an infection. More recently, delirium has
become the preferred term to use to label the tempo-
rary in the ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention as
well as a change in thinking (e.g., in memory and
disorientation) or perceptual disturbances that ﬂuctu-
ate in severity (see Brown and Boyle 2002).

Adaptation

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Adaptation involves ﬁtting or conﬁrming to an envi-
ronment. Adaptation generally implicates the assump-
tion that it is advantageous; thus, “maladjustment”
results from unsuccessful adaptation and “adjustment”
results from successful adaption. Importantly, adapta-
tion typically is viewed as involving a combination
of changing the self as well as altering the external
environment.

The term gained renewed popularity with the rise
of modern sociobiology. Sociobiology examined both
species level and individual explanations for behaviors
(see Wilson 1975). Species level types of explanations
(“ultimate explanation”) involve the function (or
adaptation) that a speciﬁc behavior serves and the
evolutionary process (or phylogeny) that resulted in
the behavior or trait’s functionality. Individual level
types of explanations focus on the development of the
individual (ontogeny) and the proximate mechanisms
involved in the behavior or trait (such as speciﬁc
hormones). Sociobiologists deem phenotypic traits
adaptive if they provide organisms with a reproductive
advantage.

How adolescents adapt

the opportunities provided by their environments.
Adolescents have been shown to simultaneously adapt
their career goals to their interests, scholastic achieve-
ment, and environmental opportunities (see Hirschi
and Vondracek 2009). How adolescents adapt to their
environments also, for example, has been important
to studies addressing adolescents’ immigration and
cultural adaptation (see, e.g., Chuang and Gielen
2009) as well those examining adolescent mental health
(see, e.g., Williamson et al. 2009). It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
an area of study relating to adolescents that does not
eventually relate to adolescents’ adaptation.

Addiction

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Addiction is a behavioral disorder marked by a physical
or psychological dependency that results in signiﬁcant
negative disruptions in an individual’s quality of life.
Formally, addictions relate to drug (including alcohol)
use, although the term often is used colloquially
to include apparent compulsive behavior and dedica-
tion to activities. The important sign of addiction is
the continued engagement in self-destructive behavior
despite negative
self-
destructive behaviors involve a loss of control, compul-
sive seeking, and vulnerability to relapse. Importantly,
dependency and addiction are often used interchange-
ably, but dependency actually relates to physiological
effects while addiction relates to behaviors; and both

consequences. Addiction’s

often coexist although they need not do so. Ceasing to
use depended on drugs typically (but not always) leads
to withdrawal and produces an abstinence syndrome.
Although traditionally limited to drug use, the term
has been the subject of considerable scientiﬁc debate
that has considered whether to include other addictive
behaviors under the classiﬁcation of addiction. The
commonly proposed behavioral addictions include
pathological gambling, compulsive buying, compulsive
exercise, workaholism, computer addiction, Internet
addiction, and sexual addiction (see Albrecht et al.
2007). Efforts to include other behavioral addictions
continue, such as the recent recognition that mobile
phone use by adolescents may result in addiction
(Cho´ liz 2010). Research on mobile phone use reveals
some of the most characteristic symptoms of depen-
dence – those symptoms include excessive use; prob-
lems with parents due to excessive use; interference
with usual activities; an increase in use to reach same
levels of satisfaction, including efforts to obtain new
models and devices; and the need to frequently use
phones. Although it may be tempting to not view
behavioral problems as addictive, there are increasing
efforts to expand the use of the term addiction to non-
substance-use related conditions (see Potenza 2006;
Albrecht et al. 2007).

Epidemiological evidence has long shown that
individuals who begin experimenting with drugs of
abuse during early adolescence are more likely to
develop substance use disorders. Despite that relation-
ship, research has yet to conﬁrm a causal link (see
Schramm-Sapyta et al. 2009). Although the adolescent
brain may be vulnerable to certain drugs, the level of
maturity, for example, may not permit it to be vulner-
able to certain aspects of drugs. As an example,
cocaine-sensitive neuronal circuits continue to mature
during adolescence, which may account for the well-
established ﬁnding in indicating a decreased behavioral
response to cocaine in adolescents as compared to
adults (Cao et al. 2007).

Overview
Juvenile adjudicative competence is a complex topic
that involves neurobiology, ethics, and legal consider-
ations. To understand adjudicative competence’s layers,
one must ﬁrst understand its legal deﬁnitions, consti-
tutional bases, and components. Such understanding
requires familiarity with the evolution and implemen-
tation of the concept of adjudicative competence in the
juvenile justice system. Additionally, recent psycholog-
ical and neurobiological research has underscored the
potential impact of mental illness and developmental
immaturity on juveniles’ adjudicative competence.
Recognizing the biology of the adolescent mind helps
inform what has proven to be a long-standing, ethically
controversial subject.

Introduction
Adjudicative competence refers to a defendant’s com-
petence to proceed with and participate in the adjudi-
cative process, either in juvenile court or adult criminal
court. At least three fundamental competencies are
integrated into adjudicative competence: competence
to waive counsel, competence to enter a guilty plea
(and thereby relinquish a variety of trial-related rights),
and competence to stand trial.
In addition to
establishing these competencies, a defendant must

Pre-adjudicative competence includes competence to
confess or to waive one’s Miranda rights (i.e., one’s
right to remain silent, to know that anything said may
be used against one in court, and to consult with an
attorney, among other things).

Constitutional Basis
Competence to stand trial is an established principle of
jurisprudence that extends back to at least the seven-
teenth century. Adjudicating incompetent defendants
violates several Amendments of the U.S. Constitution
(in addition to English Common Law),
including
a defendant’s 6th Amendment
trial-related rights
(e.g., the right to effective assistance of counsel, the
right to confront one’s accusers, and the right to pre-
sent evidence) and the Due Process clause of the 14th
Amendment (“Nor shall any State deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law”). Ensuring that defendants are competent to pro-
ceed in the adjudicative process safeguards the accuracy
of any criminal adjudication, helps guarantee a fair
trial, and helps to make certain the defendant,
if
found guilty, knows why he/she is being punished. In
short, it preserves the dignity and integrity of the legal
process.

Select Case Law Regarding
Adjudicative Competence
In the 1960 case of Dusky v. U.S., the U.S. Supreme
Court established the substantive standard for compe-
tence to stand trial, one aspect of adjudicative compe-
tence. The Dusky standard for competence to stand trial
is “whether the accused has sufﬁcient present ability to
consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of
rational understanding and whether he has a rational
as well as factual understanding of the proceedings
against him” (Dusky v. U.S. 1960). This standard is
employed in some form or other in every state and in
federal court. The ruling in Dusky v. U.S. requires that
a defendant currently possess two capabilities: (1) the
ability to understand the charges and proceedings
against him and (2) the ability to work with his attor-
ney in preparation of his defense. Dusky does not
require that a mental disorder be the cause of
incompetence.

A judge, defense attorney, or prosecutor can raise
the issue of adjudicative competence. However, com-
petence is presumed unless the defendant proves

otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e.,
“more likely than not”). In order for a defendant to
be found incompetent to stand trial (IST), most states
require that either a developmental disability (e.g.,
mental retardation) or a mental disease, defect, or
disorder be the cause of the deﬁcits that render the
defendant incompetent. Mere ignorance or simple
unwillingness to participate in the adjudicative process
does not render a defendant IST. If a defendant is
likely be considered competent.
educable, he will
Until recently, courts and legislatures had essentially
remained silent on the topic of whether developmental
immaturity may be viewed as a potential cause of
incompetence in either juvenile or adult criminal
court (see later for more recent development in this
domain). For example, the California Standard for
Adjudicative Competence (California Penal Code,
2011, } 1170.17) dictates, “A defendant is mentally
incompetent for purposes of this essay if, as a result of
mental disorder or developmental disability, the defen-
dant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal
proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of
a defense in a rational manner.” The federal standard,
modiﬁed by the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984,
deﬁnes incompetence to stand trial as “a present mental
disease or defect [that] renders the defendant unable
to understand the nature and consequences of the
proceedings against him or to assist in his defense.”

Since Dusky, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that
a defendant’s right to be competent is “so fundamental
to an adversary system of justice” that conviction of an
incompetent defendant or failure to adhere to proce-
dures designed to assess a defendant’s competence
(when doubt has been raised regarding it) violates
the Due Process Clause of
the 14th Amendment
(Drope v. Missouri 1975). Additional cases have also
discussed complex aspects of competence to stand
trial. In Jackson v. Indiana (1972), the Court addressed
what should happen to defendants who will never be
competent to stand trial. In Jackson, the U.S. Supreme
Court opined, “A defendant cannot be held more than
the reasonable period of time necessary to determine
whether there is a substantial probability that he will
regain competence in the foreseeable future.” The
Court also noted that, “Due process requires that the
nature and duration of conﬁnement bear some reason-
able relation to the purpose for which the individual
is
is committed.” Therefore, operationally once it

apparent that restoration of a defendant’s competence
is unlikely, he/she must be released or civilly committed.

Components of Competence
In 1973, the McGarry Criteria operationalized the
“competence to stand trial” concept. Four main areas
comprise the McGarry Criteria for competence:
(1) understanding of
the charges and potential
consequences, (2) understanding of the trial process,
(3) capacity to participate with an attorney in defense,
and (4) potential
courtroom participation.
“Understanding of the charges and their potential
consequences” includes the abilities to appreciate the
charges and their relative seriousness, to understand
possible dispositional consequences of guilty, not
guilty, and not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI)
verdicts or pleas, to appreciate the range and nature
of possible penalties, and to realistically appraise the
likely outcomes of the trial. “Understanding the trial
process” requires the ability to understand the roles

quences of pleading and plea bargaining, and to grasp

According to the McGarry Criteria, a defendant is
capable of “participating with an attorney in one’s
defense” if he can: display the abilities to adequately
trust or work collaboratively with an attorney, disclose
a reasonable,
facts
pertaining to the charge to the attorney, reason about
available options by weighing their consequences,
and realistically challenge prosecution witnesses and
monitor trial events. “Potential for courtroom partici-
pation” is measured by the defendant’s ability to testify
coherently and relevantly, if testimony is needed, con-
trol one’s behavior during trial proceedings, manage
the stress of trial, and display self-serving motivation
(Laboratory of Community Psychiatry and Harvard
Medical School 1973).

Assessment of Competence

Competence Assessment Instruments
Although the cornerstone of assessing competence

Assessment Instruments (CAIs) can serve as adjunctive
tools that can help guide and assist the examiner.

be familiar with the court process. This may have
negatively impacted the test’s validity for use in
mentally retarded pretrial detainees.

The Georgia Court Competency Test (GCCT),
which was initially developed in 1978 and revised in
1988 (Georgia Court Competency Test – Mississippi
State Hospital Version (GCCT-MSH)), is a standard-
ized, 21-item instrument (Nicholson et al. 1988). Its
questions address six domains: (1) physical layout of
the court, (2) functions of court participants in a trial,
(3) the defendant’s charges, (4) helping one’s attorney,
(5) the alleged crime, and (6) potential consequences.
The administration of the exam takes 10–15 min, and it
is scored from 0 to 100, with a score <70 indicating that
further examination of competence-related abilities is
likely warranted. The GCCT-MSH has shown good
inter-rater reliability; however, it has been criticized
for being too focused on the defendant’s knowledge
of the trial process and not focused enough on the
defendant’s ability to assist in his/her defense. The
GCCT-Juvenile Revision (GCCT-JR) was an additional
variation developed in 1997.

In 1997, Richard Bonnie and his colleagues (Hoge
et al. 1997) developed the MacArthur Competence
Assessment Tool – Criminal Adjudication (MacCAT-
CA) (see Bonnie and Grisso 2000). This standardized,
22-question instrument requires approximately 30 min
to administer. Competence is scored along three axes:
understanding, reasoning, and appreciation. For each
measured domain, defendants can score within three
levels of impairment: none or minimal (<1.0 standard
deviations (SD) below the mean of the “presumed
competent” sample), mild (1.0–1.5 SD below the
(>1.5 SD below
mean), or clinically signiﬁcant
mean). While some examiners ﬁnd working with its
hypothetical case difﬁcult, the exam has good internal
reliability.

For defendants with mental retardation, the Com-
petence Assessment for Standing Trial for Defendants
with Mental Retardation (CAST-MR) commonly is
used. It includes 40 multiple-choice items and ten
items
related to the defendant’s particular case.
Defendants evaluated by this instrument must have
a 4th-grade reading level, but the questions, which
require narrative answers, can be read to the defendant.
The CAST-MR was initially tested on subjects with
mental retardation in the community, not criminal
defendants; therefore, the subjects were less likely to

Structured Interview
In 2005, Grisso et al. developed the Juvenile Adjudica-
tive Competence Interview (JACI). This structured
interview was designed to guide clinicians in assessing
youths’ reasoning, understanding, and appreciation of
is speciﬁcally
the adjudicative process. The JACI
designed to allow examiners to obtain information
about errors or distortions that arise because of ado-
lescents’ developmental characteristics. Through its
provisions for retesting of defendants to evaluate reten-
tion of material, examiners may determine whether or
not defendants are educable. While the JACI is slowly
becoming the “standard of care and practice,” research
and experience with its use is still somewhat limited.

Limitations
Available competence assessment instruments have
some limitations, some of which are particularly evi-
dent when attempting to utilize them with juveniles.
With the exception of the JACI, the instruments were
all developed on adults. Many of them are weighed
more toward “understanding” than the other assessed
domains. If global scores are used, speciﬁc deﬁcits that
may prevent defendants from being competent (e.g.,
delusions) potentially can be masked by proﬁciency in
other areas. Additionally, only cognitive (rather than
both cognitive and psychosocial) factors are typically
assessed. The difference between these factors and the
implications of assessing only cognitive factors will be
discussed later.

Adjudicative Competence and the
Juvenile Justice System
The juvenile justice system – juvenile referring to
a person who has not yet reached the age at which
one is treated as an adult by the criminal
justice
system – has its origins in 1899 with the Illinois
legislature, which founded the ﬁrst juvenile court in
Chicago. This court invoked as the operating principle
a parens patriae doctrine (“parent of
the state”)
rather than a police power doctrine. The court focused
on helping/rehabilitating the delinquent rather than
punishing the crime and protecting the public. Due
process protections, such as assuring adjudicative

competence, generally were not considered because the
court fashioned itself as strictly rehabilitative and
because the proceedings were considered civil, not
criminal, in nature (Scott 2000).

Until the 1960s, juvenile courts operated unfettered
by the constitutional mandates that applied to adult
criminal court proceedings. Judges had a great deal of
discretion in almost every aspect of delinquency
proceedings,
including the ultimate disposition of
youths adjudicated delinquent. Not surprisingly, there
were some abuses of power.

Relevant Case Law
In the 1960s, the lack of due process in juvenile court
proceedings was challenged in a number of cases. Kent
v. United States (1966) was the ﬁrst U.S. Supreme Court
case involving juvenile court proceedings. Its ruling
established that prior to waiver/transfer to adult
court, juveniles are entitled to a hearing, access by
counsel
to the records involving the waiver, and
a written statement by the judge outlining the reasons
for the waiver.

To date, In re Gault (1967) has proven to be the
most signiﬁcant U.S. Supreme Court case involving
juvenile court proceedings. The ruling established
that in hearings that could result in commitment to
an institution (considered a serious deprivation of
liberty), juveniles have the right to notice of charges,
counsel, confrontation and cross-examination of
witnesses, and privilege against
self-incrimination
(i.e., Fifth Amendment rights). Presiding Justice Abe
Fortas stated, “Neither the 14th Amendment nor the
Bill of Rights is for adults only” and referred to the
Gault court as a “kangaroo court.” Of note, no right to
appeal was granted.

Additional cases addressed juvenile justice matters
throughout the 1970s. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
during In re Winship (1970) that the proper standard of
proof
in delinquency adjudications was “beyond
a reasonable doubt” not “preponderance of the evi-
dence.” The U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in McKeiver
v. Pennsylvania (1971) held that the due process clause
of the 14th Amendment does not require jury trials in
juvenile court.

Ultimately, through the “criminalization of the
juvenile court system,” the U.S. Supreme Court has
determined that due process protections apply to juve-
nile court proceedings. As a result of the Gault hearing,

the accountability of youths has been acknowledged,
but the special character of the juvenile justice system
has been maintained. Many viewed such changes as
fairly sweeping; nevertheless, adjudicative competence
still was not viewed as an important issue because the
jeopardy adolescents faced in juvenile court was not
perceived as particularly great and many understood
parens patriae as the operative doctrine. Although
infrequently explicitly stated,
the presumption in
adult criminal court is that juveniles tried there are
subject to the “adult competence” standard, which is
typically codiﬁed. In juvenile court, the situation is less
clear. According to Johnson’s 2006 review, approxi-
mately 35 states and the District of Columbia explicitly
recognize a juvenile’s right to adjudicative competence
(in juvenile court) through case law or statutory pro-
visions (only Oklahoma explicitly does not recognize
this right). In some cases, the adult adjudicative com-
petence standard is employed, though rarely has this
been elucidated clearly by courts or state legislatures.

juvenile

state provisions

With regard to IST, some states require that mental
illness or mental disease (rather than developmental
immaturity) be the cause of such incompetence, while
other
adjudicative
competence do not explicitly require predicate mental
disorders (Johnson 2006). At present, few state statutes
ofﬁcially recognize developmental
immaturity as a
cause for incompetence. Florida and Arkansas recog-
nize that, in certain cases, chronological age and devel-
opmental immaturity may prevent a juvenile offender
from being competent to stand trial. In fact, Arkansas
presumes
that youth under 13 years of age are
incompetent.

Remediation of Competence
Another area that demands more research is the resto-
ration of juvenile adjudicative competence, or what
Viljoen and Grisso (2007) refer to as “remediation of
competence” in minors deemed IST. In general, when
compared with adults, youth have cognitive and devel-
limitations (which can be compounded
opmental
by psychopathology or mental
illness) which may
adversely impact their understanding of legal proceed-
ings, their ability to assist counsel, and their apprecia-
tion of the “situation at hand.” Because of the dearth of
empirically based remediation efforts, Viljoen and
Grisso suggest drawing from research in the ﬁelds of
education and developmental and clinical psychology.

62 A Adjudicative Competence

They describe four areas to target in the remediation of
competence: (1) factual understanding, (2) rational
understanding, (3) communication with counsel, and
(4) reasoning. However, they also acknowledge the
inherent challenges in such remediation attempts.

Purposes of the Criminal Justice
System
Once a defendant is deemed competent to stand trial,
he/she enters the criminal justice system. The purposes
of the criminal
justice system are best understood
as fourfold. Deterrence aims to dissuade the future
commission of crimes by the individual and/or others.
Incapacitation, manifested as incarceration or execu-
tion, attempts to protect the public. Rehabilitation is
attempted through the participation in treatment and/
or correctional programs to correct underlying prob-
lems and prevent recidivism. Finally, retribution is
reﬂected in the idea that individuals are incarcerated
or executed because they “deserve it.”

Historical Perspectives
During the late 1980s and 1990s, youth violence
increased while
juvenile homicide precipitously
increased. With public pressure on state and federal
policymakers to use juvenile court (and adult criminal
court) as a mechanism for social control (i.e., police
power and protecting the public, rather than for reha-
bilitation of juvenile offenders), this time period was an
era of punitive reforms. This approach was manifest as
a “get tough on juvenile crime” mentality. Commonly
heard aphorisms included “juvenile offenders are
criminals who happen to be young, not children who
happen to be criminal” and “old enough to do the
crime, old enough to do the time.” While clever in
their phrasing, these notions have been criticized for
discounting the importance of youthful immaturity
in the assessment of adjudicative competence and
criminal responsibility.

Waivers to Adult Court
With the historical shift to a more punitive model,
numerous pieces of legislation (e.g., Prop 21 in Cali-
fornia in 2000) were passed with the intent to decrease
juvenile crime. The most notable effect, however, was
the increased ease with which juveniles were transferred
(“waived”) to adult criminal court from juvenile court.
The number of juveniles waived to adult court in 1994

was 73% greater than the number waived in 1986 (Stahl
1999). Additionally, the age at which juveniles could be
tried in adult criminal court was lowered. In 2009,
juveniles under 12 years of age could be prosecuted in
adult court in more than half of states, while 7-year-
olds could be tried as adults in 22 states and in the
District of Columbia (Deitch et al. 2009). Since 2006,
the federally enacted Adam Walsh Child Protection and
Safety Act requires states to place juveniles as young as
14-years-old on a sex offender registry if they are found
guilty of certain sexual offenses. “This law – and many
similar state statutes – applies not only to predatory
offenses, but also to those involving consensual sex,
public exposure, or inappropriate touching” (Annie
E. Casey Foundation 2008).

In addition to speciﬁc laws demanding that juvenile
offenders register as adult offenders in certain cases,
there are several categories of waiver from juvenile to
adult court. A legislative waiver (also referred to as
a statutory exclusion) occurs when legislature deter-
mines that charges for certain crimes must be ﬁled in
adult criminal court if the juvenile defendant is of
a minimum age (usually 14–16 years of age). A prose-
cutorial waiver (also called a direct ﬁle) can occur when
the prosecutor has fairly broad discretion in deciding
whether to ﬁle charges in juvenile or adult court. The
extent to which prosecutorial waivers occur depends
largely on prosecutors’ philosophies and the political
climate. Due to wide variation, this phenomenon has
been referred to as “Justice by Geography.”

In a judicial or discretionary waiver, the judge deter-
mines the waiver. Generally, the burden of proof is on
the prosecutor to prove that the juvenile is “not ﬁt.”
A presumptive waiver is a type of discretionary waiver
in which a juvenile is presumed not to be a “ﬁt and
proper subject” to be dealt with in juvenile court if he/
she is charged with a certain crime and is of a certain
age. However, the juvenile is entitled to a pretrial hear-
ing in juvenile court (a “ﬁtness hearing”) to rebut this
presumption.

A reverse waiver can occur if charges are directly
ﬁled in an adult criminal court and the minor is
subsequently convicted of a different charge that is
not eligible for “direct-ﬁling.” After a post-conviction
“ﬁtness hearing” in either juvenile or criminal court,
the judge can remand the case to juvenile court for
disposition. The major determinant in these cases is
whether a defendant is amenable to treatment, though

some states, such as California, have multiple deter-
mining factors (California Welfare and Institutions
Code, 2011, } 707).

The more punitive historical trend in the juvenile
justice system has shown paradoxical results. In a 2007
review of the impact of transfer laws on subsequent
violence in the juvenile offender population, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC
2007) reported that “transfer to the adult criminal justice
system is associated with subsequent violence among
juvenile participants when compared with violence
among juveniles retained in the juvenile justice system.”
Also, the CDC noted “. . .little evidence supports the idea
that transfer laws deter juveniles in the general popula-
tion from violent crime.” Fagan et al. (1989) wrote that
juvenile offenders in adult criminal institutions were
found more likely to be assaulted physically and sexu-
ally and more likely to commit suicide.

Other Punitive Reforms
There have been other consequences of juvenile crime
initiatives as well. Some juvenile offenses have counted
toward “strikes,” while records of juvenile court pro-
ceedings may or may not be sealed or kept conﬁdential.
There has been an increased use of “blended sentenc-
ing,” that is, the juvenile justice system has jurisdiction
over an offender until age 18, at which point the
offender is turned over to the adult correctional system.
juvenile offenders have seen longer
Additionally,
periods of custody,
for example, California Youth
Authority (CYA) may keep “juveniles” in custody
until age 25. Furthermore, courts have increasingly
used “once waived, always waived” statutes, which
establish that once a juvenile has been waived to and
convicted in an adult criminal court, all subsequent
charges must be ﬁled in adult criminal court.

Factors Potentially Influencing
Juvenile Adjudicative Competence

Mental Disorders
The prevalence of mental disorders in youth in the
juvenile justice system is high. These are the same
youth in whom adjudicative competence is likely to
be at issue. Approximately 66% of juvenile pretrial
detainees or delinquents meet the American Psychiatric
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), criteria

Adjudicative Competence A 63

for a mental disorder (including Substance Disorders
and Conduct Disorder). Excluding conduct disorder
alone as a mental disorder only decreases the rates by
approximately 5% (Grisso 2004).

A

competence

adjudicative

In adult offenders, mental disorders that typically
into question are
call
psychotic disorders and mental retardation. Other
disorders
such as major depressive disorder or
attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are
not usually considered serious enough to impair
signiﬁcantly adjudicative competence.
In contrast,
“subthreshold” disorders may have signiﬁcantly more
repercussions on adjudicative competence in juveniles
than in adults, due to the relatively immature cognitive
processes of those individuals under 15 years of age.
Additionally and obviously, juveniles generally show
more psychosocial immaturity than their adult coun-
terparts; mental retardation or borderline intellectual
functioning further increases juveniles’ risk for being
incompetent to participate in the adjudicative process.
This is important because the average IQ of youth in
the juvenile justice system is approximately one to two
standard deviations below normal. For example, Otto’s
meta-analysis (1992) showed that the rates of mental
retardation (i.e., an IQ (cid:1) 70) in the juvenile justice
population are approximately three to eight times
higher than the rates in the general population, and
the prevalence of learning disorders is 17–53%. Subse-
quent studies generally have replicated his ﬁndings.

Regardless, in juveniles, mental illness has generally
been considered a less-important etiology of adjudica-
tive incompetence than developmental
immaturity.
Many scholars have assumed this is due to the rarity
of psychosis
in childhood and early adolescence
compared to the almost ubiquitous developmental
immaturity in this age group.

Developmental (Im)maturity
Cognitive and psychosocial domains of developmental
maturity both potentially inﬂuence juvenile adjudica-
tive competence. The cognitive domain of develop-
mental maturity encompasses a defendant’s ability to
understand, reason about, and appreciate the adjudi-
cative process. More simply, this addresses the ques-
tion: Does the defendant know what he should do?
Some or all of these “cognitive” abilities may be either
impaired or newly acquired in juveniles. The psycho-
factors or
social domain integrates developmental

64 A Adjudicative Competence

traits that inﬂuence the dependability and uniformity
with which juveniles deploy their cognitive abilities.
This domain addresses
the question: What does
the defendant actually do and why? Many of these
factors/traits are transient and change as the juvenile
matures.

Initially,

competence.

Cognitive Domain
In the past, research typically focused on cognitive
differences between juveniles and adults that may
impair
legal
standards for CST motivated this line of inquiry. Sub-
sequently, it was discovered that age and intelligence
are the most consistent predictors of adjudicative com-
petence or the lack thereof. Juveniles younger than
14–15 years of age are generally more likely to show
deﬁcits in cognitive domains. They often view their
rights as discretionary and externally controlled rather
than automatic and inalienable. They also display
poorer understanding and valuation of the trial process
and participants than adults. However, studies query-
ing adults and juveniles 15 years of age or older about
hypothetical, nonlegal circumstances found little dif-
ference between these two groups. Unfortunately, many
of these studies did not examine delinquent youth, who
are more likely to have lower intelligence levels and
higher rates of mental illness than the general juvenile
population. Furthermore, many researchers have
questioned whether these laboratory studies are rele-
vant to stressful, emotionally charged, real-world set-
tings where youth actually may make these decisions.
Therefore, juvenile adjudicative competence must be
considered in a broader developmental framework.

Psychosocial Domain
Because juveniles have historically been viewed by
society as more impulsive, more vulnerable to peer
pressure, and more likely to engage in risky and imme-
diately gratifying (but ultimately damaging) behaviors
than adults, they are generally precluded from certain
activities (e.g., driving, serving in the military) until
they reach certain ages. Recently, researchers have
begun to examine more precisely particular domains
of “immaturity,” quantify the degree of these impair-
ments by age, and examine how these impairments
may affect adjudicative competence.

Many adolescents manifest deﬁcits in the following
domains: (1) risk appraisal, (2) time perspective,

(3) peer inﬂuence, (4) abstract thinking, (5) perceived
autonomy, and (6) “character” stability (Kambam and
Thompson 2009; Steinberg 2009). Adolescents tend to
discount and undervalue risk (risk appraisal), care
more about short-term consequences than long-term
consequences, and are less “future-oriented” than
adults (time perspective). Adolescents are much more
likely than adults to be subject and succumb to peer
inﬂuence (peer
inﬂuence). The perceptions and
decisions of youth may be based on overly concrete
ideas; they may view rights as discretionary or condi-
tional as opposed to automatic and inalienable
(abstract thinking). A child’s or adolescent’s lack of
perceived autonomy can manifest itself as passivity,
inattention, or compliance with authority or perceived
autonomy (Galvan et al. 2007; Gardner and Steinberg
2005; Scott et al. 1995; Steinberg and Cauffman 1996).
Furthermore, coherent integration of various elements
of identity does not occur until early adulthood under
the best of circumstances (“character stability”). There-
fore, while adolescent antisocial behavior (much of
which may be predicated on the above “deﬁcits”) is
extremely common, only a small percentage of
adolescents continue this behavior into adulthood
(Mofﬁtt 1993).

Case examples illustrate these psychosocial issues in
adolescents. For example, because pleading “not
guilty” would require him to remain in custody,
a minor may agree to plead guilty to a charge despite
limited evidence because he wants to be released to his
parents quickly. Here, the minor does not appropri-
ately weigh the longer-term consequences of pleading
guilty. In another scenario, a minor who has stolen
property and faces strong evidence against him may
refuse to agree to a plea bargain in an attempt to appear
“cool” to his peer group.

Neurobiological Research
Researchers have identiﬁed developmental, structural,
and functional neurobiological changes and have corre-
lated them with concurrent behavioral and cognitive
data in order to draw conclusions about the causal
mechanisms for (at least a portion of) these deﬁcits.
Reductions in gray matter density (i.e., pruning) in the
frontal and parietal lobes appear to begin around puberty
and proceed into adulthood (Sowell et al. 2001; Gogtay
et al. 2004). White matter density and volume appear
to increase with age. In fact, Bartzokis et al. (2001)

Adjudicative Competence A 65

A

found that myelin volumes in the frontal and temporal
lobes did not peak until age 45–50. Sowell et al. (2003)
found that while limbic cortices complete myelination
relatively early, frontal and parietal cortices show a less
linear pattern of maturing and continue to myelinate
into adulthood.

Psychological Research
Scholars have conducted competence studies to evalu-
ate the extent to which adolescents may differ from
adults in their abilities to participate as defendants in
trials. Thomas Grisso coordinated the MacArthur Juve-
nile Adjudicative Competence Study (1998–2002),
which found that youth under age 16 are signiﬁcantly
more likely than adults to have impaired adjudicative
competence in the areas of understanding, reasoning,
and appreciation of their legal issues; youth under age
14 and those of below-average intelligence were at
greatest risk of impairment. Ficke et al. (2006) found
that incarcerated juveniles generally have signiﬁcantly
lower IQ and achievement test scores than youth in the
general population. In particular, 9–12-year-olds and
those with IQs less than 60 demonstrated signiﬁcant
deﬁcits in understanding, reasoning, or appreciation
on the MacCAT-CA.

Limited Research
Multiple factors may explain the limited,
though
expanding, body of knowledge on assessment of
juveniles’ competence to stand trial. Juvenile compe-
tence is not explicitly recognized by statute in most
states. Juvenile proceedings have historically been con-
sidered civil (rather than criminal), non-adversarial,
and almost
adjudicative
therapeutic. Therefore,
competence generally has not been perceived as
a necessity for juveniles (at least those remaining in
juvenile court). From a more pragmatic standpoint,
few juvenile cases are appealed, thus depriving appeals
courts of
the opportunity to decide the juvenile
competence issue.

Commentary
An accumulating body of evidence suggests that juve-
niles, particularly younger adolescents and children,
frequently demonstrate deﬁcits that impair their ability
to participate effectively in the adjudicative process.
These deﬁcits are most frequently a result of develop-
mental immaturity, rather than the result of a mental

illness. Therefore, the traditional paradigm of restora-
tion of adjudicative competence (i.e., commitment to
a state hospital and treatment with medication) does
not typically apply. Rather, juveniles must attain com-
petence through normal maturation; however, keeping
children in state custody until competence is attained
likely challenges constitutional standards (see Jackson v.
Indiana (1972)) and may have a deleterious impact on
children’s or adolescents’ development. Dismissing
potentially serious charges because of incompetence
is, for many, an equally unsatisfactory solution.

The salient question remains: How does one mini-
mize the risk that juveniles’ 6th and 14th Amendment
rights will be violated by having their cases adjudicated
while incompetent, while still recognizing the govern-
ment’s and society’s legitimate interest in adjudicating
these cases? The answer may lie within modifying pol-
icy. Grisso et al. (2003) suggest implementing a “sliding
scale” of competence for juvenile court. That is, if
a juvenile defendant’s potential jeopardy is limited,
a basic understanding of the legal system and an ability
to assist counsel to some degree should be sufﬁcient. If
the charges and potential penalties are more serious,
the “bar” for competence should be set somewhat
higher. Another potential improvement would be to
afford juveniles a “non-waivable” right to counsel to
allow “assisted competence.” If a juvenile defendant
develops trust in his/her attorney and understands
that the attorney will zealously advocate for the defen-
dant’s best interests, the minor’s ability to understand
other, more subtle aspects of the adjudicative process
become somewhat less crucial.

Other policy change may include ensuring that
attorneys for juveniles have (at least) elementary train-
ing in the relevant principles of child and adolescent
psychological development. This would not only help
attorneys identify potentially incompetent clients, but
would also improve competent juveniles’ effectiveness
of participation in the adjudicative process. Another
option would involve instituting a rebuttable presump-
tion of incompetence for all juveniles waived to adult
criminal court. The prosecution would then be
required to prove the defendant is competent by
a preponderance of the evidence. If juveniles are sub-
sequently found incompetent based on adult criminal
court standards, they would be returned to juvenile
court for adjudication and disposition. Finally, more
frequent use of informal, pre-adjudicative dispositions

66 A Adjudicative Competence

or plea agreements, such as placement, mandatory
outpatient treatment, dependency court, etc., may
also help preserve the rights of the juvenile offender.
Although this does not address the problem of
potential “incompetence to plead,” this may reduce
the number of cases that require formal adjudication.
Public policy related to the adjudication of minors
in juvenile court or adult criminal court needs to evolve
as evidence base on juvenile adjudicative competence
increases. Such evolution will help preserve both juve-
nile defendants’ trial-related rights and the integrity
of the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems as
a whole.

Adjustment

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

In developmental science, adjustment is an often used
term that refers to reactions to identiﬁable stressors,
with adjustment involving adapting the self to the
situation, changing the situation, or both. Studies
examining adjustment range widely, such as adjust-
ment to school, parental conﬂict, chronic illnesses,
adoption, victimization, or even to adolescence itself.
Adjustment can also refer to the relative presence or
absence of diagnosed psychological disorders, symp-
toms, or negative mood. The broad scope of what
constitutes adjustment is reﬂected in the wide range
of ways that it is measured, ranging from a focus on
depressive systems to how one generally copes with
a situation. The most speciﬁc way that adjustment is
used arguably is in the contexts of adjustment disor-
ders, but even those have been criticized as being too
vague, poorly deﬁned, and constituting indeﬁnite
symptomatology (see Strain and Diefenbacher 2008).
As a construct, adjustment has not been the subject
of much commentary in and of itself; it is simply
assumed to cover a broad range of factors. The notable
exception to lack of effort to conceptualize adjustment
appeared in 1940 by Sarbin (1940), who viewed adjust-
ment as focusing on conformity to cultural norms,
mores, and traditions, or as focusing on a mastery of

one’s environment in ways that are adequate and satis-
fying to individuals, or as a compromise of one’s beliefs
or needs in ways that remain satisfying, such as chang-
ing one’s standards. Although considerably dated,
more current uses of the term adjustment do seem to
fall in those three broad categories.

constitutes

Two reasons may explain the lack of effort to better
conceptualize the nature of adjustment. One reason is
that, rather than focus on adjustment itself, research on
adjustment has focused on what stress or factor adjust-
ment speciﬁcally referred to. For example, one of the
most fruitful areas of research involves adjustment to
chronic illnesses and diseases. That area has led to
adjustment.
multiple views of what
A leading example conceptualized adjustment
to
diseases as focusing on mastery of disease-related
tasks, preserving functional status, having low negative
affect and no psychological disorder, and addressing
issues of quality of life in multiple domains (such as
physical,
functional, social, sexual, and emotional
domains) (see Stanton et al. 2001). Other conceptual-
izations also have emerged to describe adjustment to
illnesses, some of which add a focus on retaining
a purpose in life, regulating distress, restoring relation-
ships with others, and maintaining a positive mood
and self-worth (for a review, see Stanton et al. 2007).
Importantly and although this area of research has
centered more on adults than on youth, it reveals how
a multitude of factors inﬂuence adjustment, such as
socioeconomic status, culture and ethnicity, gender,
as well as personality attributes and coping mecha-
nisms. This area of research also shows, however, that
the study of adjustment has become much more
specialized and focused.

Another reason for a lack of focus on a more general
concept of adjustment is a continued focus on its
extremes. Notably, there is considerable focus on mal-
adjustment, in the sense of focusing on pathology and
problem behavior. This broad focus is of signiﬁcance
even though research on the formal diagnosis of adjust-
ment disorder in adolescence is a common diagnosis
for nonpsychotic youth and research relating to it
remains quite scarce (see Pelkonen et al. 2007). Equally
importantly, research increasingly focuses on positive
adjustment, as highlighted by the positive youth devel-
opment movement. Both of these extremes of adjust-
ment provide important understandings of the nature

68 A Adjustment Disorder

of adolescence as well as factors that do contribute to
effective adjustment, although more of a focus has been
placed on the more negative side of adjustment as
opposed to the optimal side. That research, much of
which has been conducted in the United States, has
shown that most adolescents appear “adjusted” in
that they take pleasure in many aspects of their lives
and are satisﬁed with most of their relationships most
of the time (Offer and Schonert-Reichl 1992). Adoles-
cents also appear adjusted in that large national sam-
ples report that the vast majority of youth in the United
States do not show signs of psychopathology, with one
leading study showing, for example, that 78% of youth
in its national sample were deemed adjusted, with 44%
being well or adequately adjusted, and the other 34%
marginally adjusted (McDermott and Weiss 1995).
These may appear to be impressive and positive ﬁnd-
ings, but the converse is also true: approximately 20%
of youth suffer from psychopathology and are deemed
in need of mental health care. This line of research,
although focusing on the negative, highlights well the
beneﬁts that can come from research focusing on
adjustment.

Adjustment Disorder

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Adjustment Disorder is an imprecise term for a variety
of symptoms that develop in response to an identiﬁable
stressor, such as a school transition (American Psychi-
atric Association 2000). The focus tends to be on an
individual’s
reaction to an overwhelming stress;
indeed, the disorder used to be labeled “adjustment
reaction.” When the stressor is not a traumatic event,
the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is used rather than
that of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Psychi-
atric classiﬁcatory systems require that symptoms
occur within 1–3 months of an identiﬁed stressor.
Symptoms can include anxiety, depressed mood, dis-
turbance of conduct, physical complaints, withdrawal,
or academic inhibition. The disorder’s duration is typ-
ically brief, less than 6 months. If it lasts longer than
that, the diagnosis is reevaluated and the individual is
perhaps designated into a different diagnostic category
or the diagnosis is speciﬁed as chronic, acute, or
persistent adjustment disorder.

Adjustment disorders are deemed common, and
may be the most common single psychiatric diagnosis
for adolescents and children. They occur in 2–8% in
community samples of children and adolescents and
10–30% of those in mental health outpatient settings
(see Rodgers and Tennison 2009). The disorders also
have signiﬁcant implications. Adolescents with adjust-
ment disorder are deemed at risk to abusing toxic
substances and for suicidal acts (Portzky et al. 2005).
Despite the frequency and apparent signiﬁcance of the
diagnosis, reviews reveal a pervasive lack research on
the nature and management of adjustment disorder
(Laugharne et al. 2009). Debate also continues regard-
ing the conceptual basis of the disorder and its usefulness
as a diagnostic entity (Baumeister and Kufner 2009).

personas and role that results in the series of crises
taking place during this period (see Boyes and
Chandler 1992). Certainly, the task of undergoing
biological changes, concerning both physiological and
psychological dimensions of one’s self, results in the
adolescent sense of self being confronted with seeming
insurmountable difﬁculties. Arguably,
emotional
changes happening in this period prove the most
salient
in an individual’s
personality as they confront the problems inherent in
growth and development. Some have viewed the ado-
lescent crisis as helping to account for why some youth
may tend toward poor social
including
rebellious and hostile attitudes toward parents and
other authority ﬁgures, whom they tend to blame for
their own problems (see Kidwell et al. 1995). That
pattern may then persist into, or at least highly inﬂu-
ence, later developmental periods.

judgment,

Adolescent crisis can be deﬁned in many ways. Typi-
cally, it refers to the upheaval that happens during this
period, such as the changes that can take place in
multiple dimensions,
including emotional compo-
nents, psychological factors, and physical development.
The adolescent period has been conceptualized as rife
with often dramatic shifts leading to viewing psycho-
logical events during this period as crises in and of
themselves due to their being important to address
before reaching maturity. This view was one adopted
by Erik Erikson who conceived of a psychological the-
ory proposing that exploration was at the heart of the
identity crisis that needed to be resolved before youth
could address other psychosocial tasks (Erikson 1968).
Importantly, however, his view of crisis was not the one
typically associated with the term “crisis”; rather it was
a much tamer one involving the need to come to terms
with key developmental issues, and those “crises” con-
tinued throughout the life span as individuals sought to
address different issues that come with different stages
of life.

The developmental understanding of the adoles-
cent crisis is one in which adolescents are engaged in
the exploration of becoming adults, a process that may
as easily involve an ongoing, energetic,
impulsive
approach at some points and the opposite, bored,
withdrawn, seclusive response at other times. Several
have shown how it is the challenge and responsibility
that adolescents face in needing to establish their adult

Adolescent Turmoil

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE

Adolescent turmoil is an imprecise label applied to
adolescents during the 1970s, and which proposed
that adolescence universally involved a time of emo-
tional turmoil of ▶ storm and stress (Larson and Ham
1993). Behavioral patterns or characteristics typically
associated with this view of turmoil include rebellious-
ness, concern about identity and role, unstable moods,
and unpredictable and highly mercurial behavior. This
belief has since been disconﬁrmed, as Offer asserts
that only a minority of adolescents experience adoles-
cent turmoil (perhaps approximately 20%) and ado-
lescents typically sustain enjoyable relationships with
their families and peers, and are comfortable with their

70 A Adoption

social and cultural values (see Offer and Schonert-
Reichl 1992). However, even though most child coun-
selors and psychologists remain aware that only a small
percentage of adolescents are afﬂicted by this state, it
appears that parents, teachers, and even mental health
professionals tend to adhere to the belief that adoles-
cence is still the “terrible teens” (Offer and Schonert-
Reichl 1992). The lingering dimension of this inaccu-
rate belief, coupled with the research ﬁndings that
teenagers in the United States and other countries
experience a higher rate of negative affect and increased
rates of some behavioral and psychological problems
(Larson and Ham 1993), prompted researchers to
engage in efforts to uncover the sources of this negative
affect and these adjustment problems. In the past few
decades,
the recognition that adolescents are not
necessarily in turmoil has led to a renewed focus on
the positive aspects of development and supportive
environments (see Larson 2000).

Adoption

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Adoption refers to the end of a process through which
an adult formally assumes the guardianship of a child
and incurs the rights and responsibilities of a parent.
Adoption is more than guardianship, with guardian-
ship being designed for the care of the young and
adoption effecting a permanent change in status that
requires formal legal recognition (see, e.g., Hansen and

Gupta-Kagan 2009). In the United States, that legal
recognition generally involves state law. In regulating
adoptions, states may permit them to be either open or
closed. Closed adoptions involve the total relinquish-
ment of the natural parents’ rights, while open adop-
tions permit natural parents to select adoptive parents
as well as, in some instances, negotiate visitation and
other rights (see, e.g., Gaddie 2009). States also limit
who can adopt as well who can be adopted. Thus, for
example, states permit the adoption of minors and not
necessarily adults, and they regulate who can adopt
(e.g., some states restrict adoptions by some couples,
such as same sex couples; see, e.g., Cooper 2004).
Although various ways of adopting youth have been
practiced throughout history,
research examining
adoption’s relationship to adolescent development is
quite recent. Indeed, researchers have tended not to
focus on adolescents. This essay examines key themes
emerging from research in this area of study, especially
as they relate to adolescents.

Two theoretical models particularly offer insight
into adoption’s effect on children’s development. The
ﬁrst model focuses on stress and coping, as it begins
with the assumption that adopted youth are at a higher
risk for psychological and educational difﬁculties
(Brodzinsky 1990). This approach contends that fac-
tors such as genetics, family relationships, and social
environments have an effect on children’s levels of
trust, self-conﬁdence, sense of control, personal values,
and personal awareness, which then impact their atti-
tudes about adoption and that this attitude directly
effects their adjustment. The model focuses on the
grief that most adopted adolescents experience after
realizing the meaning of their biological parents’ deci-
sion to release them for adoptions. It generally shows
that families who can navigate this phase with open
communication about the adoption generally have
more well-adjusted children. The second model is the
well-known ecological model of development. That
model focuses on children’s unique relationships with
their environment. Children’s environments involve
a number of systems like family, home, culture, and
society, all of which interact with one another and
change over time (Bronfenbrenner 1979). Each system
inﬂuences the other and thus impacts child develop-
ment. For example, the culture of a society inﬂuences
the government institutions that create adoption poli-
cies. These policies then dictate the adoption process

Adoption A 71

A

and some of the family functioning post adoption. The
way the family functions, which relates to several social
forces as well as individuals within the family, directly
impacts the adopted youth. Although focusing on dif-
ferent factors, these models highlight well how several
factors likely impact adopted youths’ development and
how understanding and responding to adolescents’
experiences requires considering multiple individual
and social inﬂuences.

Although the models that often are used to under-
stand the effects of adoption on youth have made
important contributions, few studies actually focus on
adolescents’ experiences. The small body of research
functioning has produced
on adopted adolescent
inconclusive and contradictory results. Earlier studies
had reported the percentage of adopted adolescents
residing in mental health settings as higher than their
percentage in the general population, indicating that
adopted youth are at a higher risk for disorders
(Schechter 1961). More recent research, however,
indicates this to no longer be the case or, if not, then
a considerably more nuanced picture of adopted youth
emerges. A more recent study used community-based
data and found that adopted youth were only at slightly
higher risk for maladjustment, with the risk measuring
even less in families with two parents (Miller et al.
2000). Importantly, a study from a leading research
group found adopted youth to be better adjusted than
youth in single parent homes by a biological mother
(Fergusson et al. 1995). These conﬂicting ﬁndings are
mirrored by longitudinal studies from around the
globe. Some studies have been unable to discern
patterns in the adjustment of adopted youth, while
others have found maladjustment to peak at age 11
and completely disappear by early adulthood (see,
e.g., Maughan and Pickles 1990). Yet, other studies
have found consistent differences. In the United States,
for example, a large-scale study using a representative
sampling of 90,000 US adolescents from 12 to 17 years
of age examined differences in psychological and aca-
demic adjustment among adopted and nonadopted
youth by using both adolescent
self-report and
parent-report data; the results showed group differ-
ences consistently favoring nonadopted over adopted
adolescents in areas related to school performance,
psychological well-being, and substance use (Miller
et al. 2000). In addition, several studies that have
registrar
taken advantage of Sweden’s national

containing sociodemographic and health data of all
citizens have found results that disfavor adopted
youth; although countries of origin may mask impor-
tant differences,
the general ﬁndings have shown
adopted youth to be at increased risk for psychiatric
hospitalization, suicidal behavior, severe social prob-
lems, lower cognitive functioning, and poorer school
performance (see Palacios and Brodzinsky 2010).
Despite these differences, it is important to highlight
that the magnitude of the differences is not large, and
that the differences may be due to the extreme ends of
functioning. Although adopted youth may reveal
statistically
and academic
problems than nonadopted youth, the vast majority
of adopted youth tend to be within the normal range
of adjustment (see Haaguard 1998).

greater psychological

Rather than simply comparing potential differences
in the mental health and other outcomes of adopted
youth with youth who remain with their biological
families, other research focuses on the risk factors that
can lead to adoptee’s maladjustment. Some researchers
identify prior treatment, including abuse and neglect,
as potential causes for this maladjustment (Logan et al.
1998). Other studies indicate that having adopted sib-
lings in the home lessens the risk for behavioral prob-
lems while parents’ biological children in the home
increases this risk (Howe 1997). It also has been theo-
rized that open adoptions alleviate the psychological
strain associated with the enigmatic nature of tradi-
tional adoption practices, and that it thus increases the
chances of more positive outcomes (Baran and Pannor
1990). Finally, it has been proposed that transracial
adoptions keep the adoptee from forming a cultural
identity, thus creating a heightened risk for adjustment
problems; but some research has not found such
behavioral difﬁculties between transracial adoptees
and youth raised by parents from their ethnic back-
ground (Cederblad et al. 1999). This area of research
points to the important conclusion that adjustment
problems cannot be generalized to the entire adoptive
population. Disruptions have been associated with the
age of the adoptee upon placement, length of time in
care, number of moves, number of returns to the birth
home, level of behavioral problems, overactivity, pres-
ence of preferential treatment, and the ability to show
signs of attachment. Traumatic or abusive childhoods
also cause children to adopt coping skills that reﬂect
their environment, and which unfortunately do not

transfer well to more stable environments. These ﬁnd-
ings have emerged from classic studies examining the
experiences of institutionalized children as well as more
contemporary studies that lead reviewers of these
studies to ﬁnd both signiﬁcant continuity as well as
noteworthy recovery from most of children’s experi-
ences (see Palacios and Brodzinsky 2010).

healthy

adopted

adolescents’

The understanding of risks and challenges facing
youth who have been adopted has led to suggestions for
helping youth adjust positively and avoid negative
outcomes. Though no robust research exists to support
the following approaches, their basis in the preceding
theoretical models and existing research indicates
potential for success. The stress and coping model of
adoption stresses the importance of trust and control
for
adjustment
(Brodzinsky 1990). Parents can promote this trust
and sense of control by being forthcoming with their
adopted children about the speciﬁcs of their adoption.
If an open adoption is in place, for example, parents
can involve their children in making decisions
concerning contact with their birth parents. The eco-
logical perspective also encompasses the areas beyond
the adolescent and their family that affect adolescents’
psychological health (see Bronfenbrenner 1979).
Adopted youth can sometimes feel excluded from
other adoptees or their native cultures. Parents can
arrange for these children to attend support groups
with other adopted youth, take classes in their native
language, connect with the local community from their
home country, or even visit their birth place. Parents
also can take part in the process by making connections
with other adoptive parents. Other areas affecting
adoptive youths’ lives like their school, church, and
local and national policy can be addressed by enlight-
ening teachers, church leaders, and local- and state-
elected ofﬁcials on ways they can help with issues
affecting adopted children and their families. The
emergence and recognition of these types of responses
to address adopted youths’ needs provide increasing
conﬁdence that youth can enjoy positive environments
supportive of healthy developmental outcomes.

Although there may be an increased need for adop-
tive parents, especially for adolescents who are deemed
less adoptable compared to younger children, contro-
versies continue even despite research revealing how
different family formations can provide the needed
nurturing environments. Considerable controversy

continues regarding the eligibility of some parents to
become parents. For example, transracial adoption
continues to be a topic of debate among the commu-
nity and some minority groups, despite research
demonstrating that there may not be a need for concern
if adoptions are conducted with awareness and respon-
siveness to cultural issues and those relating to diversity
(Campbell 2000). Similarly and although non-
traditional families are increasingly becoming accepted
as options for adoptees, they still experience difﬁculty
when they choose to adopt. In some cases, for example,
gay and lesbian families only are eligible to adopt older
or special-needs children (see Cooper 2004). Despite
an apparent favoring of traditional families as best
suitable for adopting youth, nontraditional families
increasingly are becoming accepted as options for
adoptees. Single men or women are choosing to
adopt children through traditional means, artiﬁcial
reproductive technology, or using a surrogate parent.
International adoptions continue to increase as societal
changes limit the pool of children domestically; for
example, effective contraception,
legalized abortion,
and a decrease in the stigma associated with unwed
motherhood, has caused the number of children
adopted from unwed mothers to drop from 80% in
1970 to 4% in 1983 (see Cole and Donley 1990); and
shifts in child welfare laws now mean that children may
not be reunited with their families or stay in foster care
drift but, instead, be placed for adoption (most likely
by their foster parents) (see Levesque 2008). With this
marked reduction in domestic adoptions, international
adoptions have skyrocketed. These different family
formations, both in terms of the adoptees and the
adopting families, still may face challenges, but it is
notable that laws, policies, and society increasingly
embrace different family formations.

The above changes are of particular signiﬁcance to
adolescents. The changes not only provide them with
families but also provide them with different issues to
address. For example, several of these changes, such as
those across countries or those dealing with open
adoptions,
likely create different opportunities and
challenges relating to birth parents. Arguably, a key
issue that coincides with the development of adoles-
cents for adopted youth is the normative focus on
discerning a healthy sense of
self and identity.
For adoptees, this normative transition has been linked
their
to an inner search involving reﬂections of

adoption (see Irhammar and Cederblad 2000), which
has been noted as a normative experience that begins in
middle childhood in the context of the developmental
changes in their understanding of adoption, eventually
translates into an outer search, typical of adolescent
and youth periods, which in turn translates into the
desire to gain more information or contact with bio-
logical parents (see Wrobel and Dillon 2009). Reviews
of research in this area reveal conﬂicting results, espe-
cially along dimensions of who searches (e.g., in terms
of their gender, mental health) (see Palacios and
Brodzinsky 2010). Given the challenge of conducting
research in this area, and the new focus on this aspect of
research, it is not surprising to ﬁnd a need for more
research to understand nuances in the experience of
being adopted.

Adoption has become a common phenomenon,
which has resulted in important research and policies.
Research has focused more on young children. As a
result, for example, while open adoption has worked
for adopted infants and there is reason to believe that it
also could work well for older youth, the beneﬁts of this
system still need to be assessed for older adoptees.
Models that have been developed to understand
adolescents’ adjustments to adoption have provided
important insights, but they also have shown how con-
siderable research needs to be conducted. As a result,
research shows a need to consider resources beyond the
family, but systematic study of post-adoption resources
must be established to make available a continuity of
care for adopters and adoptees. Indeed, more research
still is needed as more and more families choose adop-
tion as a viable means to form their families and as the
composition of adopted families continues to reﬂect
considerable diversity in response to the pressing need
for more families to adopt adolescents.

74 A Adoption and Safe Families Act

Adoption and Safe Families Act

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

When a state fears for the endangerment of a child’s
health or safety, it can intervene in an otherwise auton-
omous family to resolve the threat or remove the child.
The state’s efforts to resolve the threat before removing
the child or to permit the child to return home after the
threat is removed are parts of a “reasonable efforts”
mandate. When the state retains custody of the child,
the court often orders the state to provide certain
services for the parents or orders the parents to obtain
needed services. Such services may include psycholog-
ical counseling, substance-abuse treatment, parenting
classes, homemaker assistance, and other services to
remedy deﬁciencies that led to the child’s removal
from the home. Such services serve to facilitate the
reuniﬁcation of the family. However, in certain situa-
tions, the court may relieve the state from making
reasonable efforts to reunify a family. Once a child has
been placed in foster care, the court holds periodic
reviews with the parties. Various rationales support
the need for reviews, but the major reason for their
use rests on the manner the foster care system operates
on the assumption that it provides temporary shelters
meant either to expedite children’s return to their
homes or to successful adoptions. The length of time
a particular child stays away from the family and the
ultimate decision regarding the child’s long-term care
largely depend on the nature of the state’s response, the
manner it deﬁnes and implements its reasonable efforts
mandates.

Although it may seem that children’s needs would
dictate a state’s response, the nature of the state’s
response generally depends on self-imposed burdens.
Individual states design and maintain prevention and
foster care programs. Although the states play an
important role, they are guided by the federal govern-
ment. The federal government plays a key role since it
uses the power of the purse (federal subsidies) to guide
state policies toward its preferred ways of designing
child welfare programs. Congress grants funds to states
only when their laws comply with congressional man-
dates. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA)

(Adoption and Safe Families Act 1997) currently
serves as the major federal mandate guiding the struc-
ture and implementation of foster care systems and
responses to families and children who may have need
for them.

Although AFSA now primarily regulates the imple-
mentation of efforts that seek to prevent and, where
necessary, provide alternative care, the statute is best

groundbreaking Adoption
ASFA amended
Assistance and Child Welfare Act (“Child Welfare Act”)
(Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act 1980). The
Child Welfare Act was Congress’s ﬁrst major effort,
through its spending powers, to help states provide
services to keep children in their homes and secure
adoptions for children who cannot return home after
having entered the foster care system. Before 1980, the
federal government had reimbursed states for foster
care expenses but had not offered comparable ﬁnancial
support for adoption or prevention and reuniﬁcation
services. As passed in 1980, the Child Welfare Act con-
tinued to reimburse states for foster care maintenance
payments but it also offered additional funding for
child protection, family intervention, and adoption
services for children with special needs. The federal
government conditioned each state’s funding, however,
on their compliance with federal requirements. ASFA
pushed federal mandates into somewhat different
directions, most notably toward a more obvious focus
on ensuring child safety and hastening stability.
Together, these two statutes reveal the remarkable
extent to which federal mandates can shape responses
to children at risk.

A requirement that eventually became most rele-
vant to discussions of ASFA was Part E of the Child
Welfare Act. That part required states to have an
approved plan for administering child protective
services. Each state’s plan must provide, among other
things, that “in each case, reasonable efforts will be
made (A) prior to placement of a child in foster care,
to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the
child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for
the child to return to his home.” This mandate has
become commonly known as the “reasonable efforts”
provision. The Child Welfare Act had sought to provide
adequate services early in order to diminish the need
for more costly foster care placements. By requiring
states to provide adequate services, the reasonable

Adoption and Safe Families Act A 75

A

efforts provision narrowed the criteria for entering
foster care to those children who could not sufﬁciently
beneﬁt
from family preservation services. Once
children entered foster care, the reasonable effort
provision narrowed the criteria for remaining in foster
care to those children who could not sufﬁciently beneﬁt
from reuniﬁcation services. The reasonable efforts
mandate, then, encouraged states to reduce the use,
especially the extended use, of the child welfare system.
The mandate did so by reducing the need for the foster
care system through family preservation efforts and
promoting
adoption incentives whose primary
economic purpose consisted of expediting exits from
the foster care system.

The general understanding of reasonable efforts as
a service enforcement provision made theoretical sense,
but it had and continues to face many practical chal-
lenges. The federal requirement to make reasonable
efforts was not guided by standards to assess reasonable
efforts. This eventually led to criticisms that the focus
on reuniﬁcation inhibited child safety and protection
and that too many children were caught in “foster care
drift” without a sense of permanency. These and
similar criticisms led to a major overhaul of the Child
Welfare Act. That overhaul took the form of the
Adoption and Safe Families Act. As the title suggests,
the focus of the new and still controlling legislative
mandates sought to promote permanency and priori-
tize child safety. Congress sought to reach the goals of
these mandates by modifying the reasonable efforts
requirement and by setting strict deadlines
for
implementing placement plans (the case plans the
state must have in place for every child under state
supervision).

Among other changes, ASFA urged two important
changes especially worth considering. The ﬁrst change
dealt with the act’s new timelines regulating the
amount of time children can remain in foster care
before being placed for adoption. The Child Welfare
Act had required that every child in foster care receive
a dispositional hearing within the ﬁrst 18 months in
state custody. ASFA reduced that time frame as it, quite
tellingly, relabeled “dispositional” hearings as “perma-
nency” hearings. ASFA required states to hold perma-
nency hearings within the child’s ﬁrst 12 months in
foster care and at least once every 12 months as long as
the child remained in state custody. ASFA also required
every child in foster care to receive a permanent plan

within 12 months. Signiﬁcantly, ASFA directed states to
petition a court for termination of parental rights once
a child had resided in state custody for 15 of the most
recent 22 months. Importantly, a state could be excused
from this obligation if: (1) the state has placed the child
in the care of a relative, (2) the state can provide
a compelling reason for maintaining the parental
relationship, or (3) the state has failed to provide
reasonable efforts to reunite the family. By establishing
a new and shortened timeline for termination of
parental
this amendment would become
rights,
ASFA’s hallmark provision.

The second change brought by ASFA involved
clarifying what was meant by reasonable efforts. The
amended section 671(a)(15) has six subparts. Subpart
(A) requires that, in making reasonable efforts and in
determining whether reasonable efforts had been
made, “the child’s health and safety shall be the
paramount concern.” Subpart (A) explicitly requires
reasonable efforts to not compromise children’s safety.
Unlike prior legislation, this mandate provides that
“reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and
reunify families: (i) prior to the placement of a child
in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for
removing the child from the child’s home; and (ii) to
make it possible for a child to safely return to the child’s
home.” This subpart essentially preserves the reason-
able efforts language under the 1980 Child Welfare Act.
However, subpart (C) extends the reasonable efforts
mandate beyond family preservation and reuniﬁcation
to include permanency. Under this part, the state must
make reasonable efforts “to place the child in a timely
manner in accordance with the permanency plan, and
to complete whatever steps are necessary to ﬁnalize the
permanent placement of
the child.” Subpart (D)
excuses states from making reasonable efforts based
largely on a parent’s current and previous conduct.
This shift in focus away from preservation permits
states to not make reasonable efforts where the parent
has performed any of several speciﬁc acts: (1) subjected
the child to aggravated circumstances (as deﬁned
by state law), (2) committed murder or voluntary
manslaughter of another child of the parent, (3) aided
or abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to com-
mit such murder or manslaughter, or (4) committed
a felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to
the child or another child of the parent. Subpart (E)
holds that a state that adopts subpart (D)’s approach

76 A Adrenarche

must provide a permanency hearing within 30 days
rather than the usual 18 months under the Child
Welfare Act. Finally, subpart (F) explicitly authorizes
concurrent planning, a form of case management that
permits states to make, simultaneously, reasonable
efforts toward a permanent out-of-home placement
and reasonable efforts toward reuniﬁcation at the
same time. The reasonable efforts amendments and
the revised timelines signiﬁcantly redeﬁne and reduce
the force of the reasonable efforts standard that had
been meant to secure efforts to reunify children with
their families. To a large extent, by focusing on child
safety, federal legislative mandates tend to encourage
out-of-home care.

Reviews of state legislative mandates reveal that
nearly all states have enacted legislation requiring
state agencies to make reasonable efforts to preserve
or reunify families (for a comprehensive review, see
Levesque 2008). The extent to which states incorpo-
rated ASFA’s mandates in their legislation suggests a
softening of the signiﬁcance of reasonable efforts after
ASFA. This weakening of the reasonable efforts clause
can be seen in the strong emphasis states have placed on
making health and safety the paramount concern
and the relatively weak emphasis states have given to
requiring reasonable efforts to ﬁnalize a permanent
placement. The vast majority of states have enacted
legislation emphasizing the “paramount” nature of the
child’s health and safety in dependency proceedings.
Neither the “health and safety” provision nor the
provision permitting states to waive their reasonable
efforts obligation impose on states an afﬁrmative duty
to provide services. Indeed, both provisions arguably
encourage the opposite. In addition, it is important to
note that state courts have discretion to waive reason-
able efforts to protect a child’s health and safety, even if
none of the conditions that waive reasonable efforts
exists. State courts need such ﬂexibility to respond
appropriately to individual cases. Yet, granting such
ﬂexibility unintentionally weakens the requirements of
the reasonable efforts clause, as further demonstrated by
the relatively soft legislative emphasis states have placed
on reasonable efforts toward permanency and the
comparably heavy emphasis they have placed on the
provisions that waive reasonable efforts. This suggests
that states view ASFA’s clariﬁcation of reasonable efforts
primarily as legislation diluting the obligation to make
reasonable efforts to reunify families. The legislatures

thus appear to agree with the primacy ASFA accords to
the health and safety of the child.

Adrenarche

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Adrenarche refers to the increase in activity of the
adrenal glands that occurs just before puberty. It typi-
cally begins approximately at 7 or 8 years of age, before
the signs of puberty, and continues
throughout
puberty. In humans, for both boys and girls, increases
in adrenal androgens during adrenarche are associated
with the development of pubic and axillary hair, as well
as with an acceleration in the rate of bone maturation
and skeletal growth and an increase in body odor
(Spear 2000). Androgens associated with adrenarche
are thought to be important for brain maturation
(Campbell 2006), and, as has been shown for puberty
itself, environmental conditions (such as parenting)
inﬂuence the onset of adrenarche (Ellis and Essex
2007). Levels of these androgens during the transition
through puberty have been linked to adjustment and
behavioral problems (Spear 2000).

Overview
The speciﬁc problem this essay addresses is “How do
adolescents resist advertising?” A brief review of
research about the effects of advertising on adolescents
focuses on concerns of parents regarding the dangers to
adolescents resulting from exposure to print, broad-
cast, and Internet advertising. Research on mechanisms
that facilitate adolescents’ ability to resist these effects
is reviewed. Speciﬁc programs designed to facilitate
critical thinking about advertising are explored, as are
family talk about media and the emerging social media
as aspects of advertising resistance. Suggestions for
future research are offered.

Do Not Buy That: Reducing the Impact
of Advertising on Adolescents
Adolescents are an incredibly attractive target for mar-
keters of products and services. This targeting occurs
because advertising is a $300 billion/year industry
featuring 900,000 brands, and children and adolescents
are attractive consumers: Teenagers spend over $150
billion/year on consumer products, and have a major
inﬂuence on many of their parents’ purchases (Shifrin
2006). In light of increasing media use by adolescents
and the rise of social media and other advertising
vehicles, concern about the behavioral and cognitive
effects of advertising on viewers, readers, and users of
mediated entertainment is now as severe for adoles-
cents as it has been on young children in the social
this essay is on
science literature. The focus of
populations of young men and women aged 12–17.

The speciﬁc problem this essay addresses is “How
do adolescents resist advertising?” Much of the writing

and research in advertising as media effect begins with
an often unstated premise: Since adolescents are the
target of numerous marketing campaigns, there must
be evidence of their effectiveness. A good deal of
research in the social science literature takes effective-
ness for granted. Here, I explore those areas where
adolescents resist advertising messages. Some questions
include: When and under what conditions do adoles-
cents reject advertising appeals? What is the role of
parents, siblings, and peers in encouraging resistance?
How effective are speciﬁc media and school campaigns
in raising cognitive thresholds against persuasion
designed to elicit consumer behavior?

There is scarcely a parent who does not have
a complaint about marketing to children and adoles-
cents in general as well as a host of anecdotes about
particular advertising campaigns. Not surprisingly, the
scientiﬁc literature regarding risks to these populations
reﬂects these complaints and supports many of the
suspicions of parents, teachers, and other adult ﬁgures
about the role of advertising in the lives of young
people. They include: concerns about advertising as
a factor in alcohol and tobacco use, the relationships
among drug advertising and the belief that there is
a drug that can cure all pains and worries, and subse-
quent drug abuse by adolescents. Over a decade of
research supports the signiﬁcant association between
adolescent advertising exposure and tobacco use
(Biener and Siegel 2000). A number of investigations
have reinforced the correlations among exposure to
drug advertising and adolescent beliefs in the efﬁcacy
of drugs as problem solvers (Strasburger 2001).

Parents and caregivers also worry about the por-
trayal of unrealistically trim and attractive ﬁgures as
contributing factors to low self-esteem and the rise of
eating disorders among those who are exposed to these
stereotypes in commercials and ads. Also of concern is
the dramatic increase of adolescent obesity in the past
2 decades. Young people are exposed to thousands of
ads for fast foods, sodas, and snacks containing high
levels of salt and sugar and their weights have increased
as a function of this exposure (Davies and Fitzgerald
2008).

Parents also express concern about recent research
that supports a link between advertising and earlier
onset of sexual intercourse in adolescents. Sex is used
to sell almost every product in contemporary ads,
and commercials for products to remedy erectile

78 A Advertising: Do Not Buy That

dysfunction are common in prime time TV viewing.
The multiplication of messages about these products,
in the absence of advertising for birth control products,
may send inappropriate messages
to adolescents
especially as they are not being taught well in school
sex education programs.

Research on all of these problems has supported
and extended our knowledge about all of these issues;
exposure to advertising has been connected to adoles-
cent self-image, eating disorders and obesity, drug,
alcohol and tobacco use, and early onset of sexual
experiences in the absence of information about birth
control. See, for example (Strasburger, Wilson and
Jordan 2002).

The Development of Skepticism and
Cynicism About Advertising
The teen years are a time of suspicion and rejection of
many aspects of society. Investigations of skepticism –
the degree to which young people disbelieve the claims
in advertising – have found that this disbelief is reliably
associated with education. As teachers and other role
models expose fallacies and exaggerations in argu-
ments, advertising is a natural target for questioning
the truth of advertising claims. While some members of
the educational community have gone as far as to
advocate teaching adolescents
to be skeptical of
advertising, their critics counter that this would be
intellectually dishonest in that truthful advertising
would be needlessly discounted. Apart from results
regarding education, skepticism is also an outcome of
simple maturation and the concomitant role of tradi-
tional socializing agents such as peers and the family.
Skepticism has been shown to be negatively correlated
with adolescents’ receptivity to and liking for advertis-
ing as well as onset of early alcohol and tobacco use
among youth aged 9–17 (Austin et al. 2006).

Market research on adolescent populations is regu-
larly conducted by research ﬁrms and advertising agen-
cies (HarrisInteractive 2004). Much of this qualitative
research is based on focus group studies of approxi-
mately ten adolescent subjects, guided by professionals
who record comments made by subjects. This research
reveals that while teens say that advertising has little
impact on them, they frequently discuss TV commer-
cials with their friends and are especially fond of
humorous ads and commercials that feature popular
music that they like. Similarly, they deny that Internet

banner ads inﬂuence them to purchase products, but
they spend more time on the computer than they do on
other electronic media. Word-of-mouth is a strong
factor in marketing to this population; the majority of
focus group participants admit that they learn about
new Web sites primarily from their peers. They strongly
deny that celebrity spokespersons in advertising are
effective and assert that no ad can make an unattractive
product seem to be worth buying.

From relatively recent investigations, we know that
there are two variables that predict adolescent tobacco
use beyond mere exposure to advertising: susceptibility
to advertising and novelty-seeking. Novelty-seeking
has been used as a personality trait construct in several
studies and has been shown to be positively related
to the onset of smoking in young adulthood. Several
longitudinal studies have found the relationship is
especially strong when combined with advertising
susceptibility, the ability to vividly recall speciﬁc ciga-
rette promotions and possession of tobacco-related
promotional items (Audrain-McGovern et al. 2003).

The central effect of tobacco advertising may be in
its relationship to adolescent perceptions of prevalence.
If teens think that a large portion of the population
smokes, that perception may override adolescent skep-
ticism about advertising. One study found that eighth
and ninth graders who saw a depicted convenience
store loaded with tobacco ads and products were
much higher in their estimates of how many people
smoked than were their peers who saw stores without
promotions or ads (Henricksen et al. 2002). Clearly,
advertising has the potential to suggest that more people
smoke than actual populations surveys would suggest.

Intervention Programs
While proponents of media education programs have
focused on advertising issues surrounding susceptibil-
ity to persuasive appeals for at least 30 years, the
speciﬁc use of these programs to reduce unhealthful
behaviors is more recent. Many programs have been
designed for young children, rather than adolescents.
A typical
investigation in this tradition is Austin’s
(Austin and Johnson 1997) investigation of third-
graders’ training in alcohol advertising. She trained
teachers to facilitate analysis of alcohol ads and found
that the treatment had both immediate and delayed
effects (3 weeks). Immediate effects included the
children’s increased understanding of persuasive intent

of the ads, viewing of characters as less similar to people
they knew in real life and less desirable as friends. More
importantly,
there was
in the treatment group,
decreased desire to be like the characters, decreased
expectation of positive consequences from drinking
alcohol, and decreased likelihood of choosing an
alcohol-related product as a reward over a non-themed
product.
investigation of adolescents
regarding the effects of an alcohol education, an inter-
vention centered on television advertising found that
adolescents’ counter arguing of alcohol advertisements
were present a year after the intervention (Metrik
et al. 2003).

In another

In terms of adolescent populations, four investiga-
tions have afﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of the Lions Club
International’s Skills For Adolescents (SFA) program in
preventing or reducing drug and alcohol use, and
students (Crano and
smoking by middle school
Burgoon 2002). The 40-session SFA program includes
media education but also more global critical thinking
instruction about a number of life decisions related to
physical and mental health. Among the ﬁndings are
that the curriculum can help deter the initiation of
regular cigarette smoking and experimental use of
marijuana through the end of the seventh grade and
deter the initiation of regular alcohol use and binge
drinking. The data also indicate that the program can
delay the progression to regular cigarette smoking and
to experimental marijuana use among students who
had initiated regular alcohol use or binge drinking but
not regular cigarette smoking by the end of the sixth
grade. Although the program is available at no cost,
many communities do not use it because of the preva-
lence of DARE programs in school, which have not been
supported by systematic programs of research.

Family Communication and
Advertising
In the past 25 years, a good deal of research has focused
on patterns of parent–child and sibling-to-sibling
communication about media content. This tradition
is known as mediation. The majority of investigations
in mediation have focused on parent–child communi-
cation about television programming, as television is
the most-used medium used by children prior to
adolescence, and parents are the dominant agents of
socialization for young children. Mediation is the
pattern of communication by which parents comment

on television content either during or subsequent to the
child’s viewing, and communicate information about
the meaning of televised behavior, the parent’s approval
or disapproval of content, and speciﬁc rule-making by
parents about the amount and kind of television use
that they permit.

Parental mediation efforts have been conceptual-
ized as the extent of critical comments about behaviors
witnessed on television or ﬁlm (active mediation),
setting rules about how much, when, and which types
of television can be viewed (restrictive mediation), and
the presence of parents during children’s television
viewing (co-viewing) (Nathanson 2001). Active medi-
ation may take place while the child is viewing with
a parent, or after the viewing occurs, e.g., “Do you
think the toy is really as big as it looks on TV?” Restric-
tive mediation frequently occurs
in non-viewing
moments: “You are not allowed to watch that program,
it’s too violent.”

Research exploring the impact of active and restric-
tive mediation has found that it can decrease aggressive
behavior, improve children’s comprehension of televi-
sion, foster reﬁned consumer behavior, and develop
critical thinking about television’s representation of
the real world (Desmond et al. 1985).

Children and adolescents whose parents set rules
about television viewing (restrictive mediation) exhibit
higher reading scores than do unregulated viewers
(Roberts et al. 1984), tend to be more skeptical about
television reality (Desmond et al. 1985), are less likely
to ask for products advertised on television, and are less
physically aggressive (Nathanson 2001). Not all medi-
ation is positive, however, in that if children perceive
parents’ mere co-viewing as parental endorsement of
content, they may behave aggressively after watching an
aggressive wrestling program or a violent cartoon
(Desmond et al. 1990).

Both survey research and direct observation have
been used to investigate how frequently parents
actually mediate television content. While direct obser-
vations in the home suggest that active mediation
occurs less than 5% of the time, surveys indicate greater
frequency when parents self-report, or when children
corroborate parents’ estimates. Nathanson (2001)
found that parental mediation is strongly related to
parental attitudes about TV content, with parents
who dislike violent content reporting more restrictive
mediation. There is some evidence that use of the

80 A Advertising: Do Not Buy That

network’s parental advisory system and family media-
tion occurs most frequently in families with gifted or
high-achieving children who watch small or moderate
amounts of TV producing what one investigator has
labeled the “preaching to the choir” effect (Abelman
1999).

Apart from mediation, family patterns of commu-
nication have received some research attention. One
dimension of parent–adolescent interaction that is
typically associated with conversations about alcohol
and drugs is the demand/withdraw pattern, where one
party utters a demand or a threat “I’d better not catch
you drinking before you are 21” and the other interac-
tant withdraws “Ok-Leave me alone.” One study of
parents talking to adolescents found that frequent
demand/withdraw patterns in conversations were asso-
ciated with low self-esteem and high alcohol and drug
use – for both adolescents and parents (Cauglin and
Malis 2004). These health outcomes were associated
with demand/withdraw scenarios from either side’s
punctuation – that is, whether it was the parents who
were demanding and the children who were withdraw-
ing, or vice versa. They also found that criticisms and
avoidance were related to adolescents’ drug use. This
pattern held even when the topic of conversation was
about relatively bland topics, such as adolescents being
too noisy or not cleaning their bedrooms. Clearly, this
investigation suggests that parent mediation about
media content should probably take the form of posi-
tive-active mediation, such as pointing out the teens
depicted in a ﬁlm as being happy, successful, and
substance-free, rather than to initiate mediation that
may result in withdrawal and avoidance: “Don’t be like
those kids who think drinking is o.k.” Ongoing research
on family communication is promising, in that it has
the potential to provide information for parents on
how to approach the topic of advertising in a manner
that may produce critical thinking by adolescents.

The New Media Landscape
Social media is a global term meaning software that
facilitates one-to-many (and many-to-one) message
exchanges among users, and includes sites such as
Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and others now evolving
in the early twenty-ﬁrst century. Adolescents who use
these media talk about their social lives including rela-
tionships, interactions with family and friends, and
a variety of topics germane to their current concerns.

Several recent investigations revealed that a large per-
centage (in one survey nearly 50%) of posts to these
sites by adolescents mention drinking, risky sexual
activity, and drug use. While adolescents have always
enjoyed talking about sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll with
their peers, these new media provide opportunities for
pre-adolescents to monitor what their older counter-
parts are saying about these topics.

Author of one of

these investigations, Megan
Moreno, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, has found that,
regardless of whether teen postings reveal true behav-
ior, kids do think that what they see on social media
sites is real, and the younger they are, the more they
believe (Moreno et al. 2009). This is important,
Moreno writes, “because teenagers are powerfully
inﬂuenced by the behavior of their peers. Teenagers’
behavior also is inﬂuenced by seeing behavior on tele-
vision and hearing about it on the radio and in
music. Social media combines those two inﬂuences”
(p. 422). Therefore, attractive, popular kids who talk
about drinking and drug use may be models for
younger adolescent’s behavior.

While social media may exacerbate problems
resulting from exposure to advertising, they also have
the potential to reach adolescents in ways that were not
possible 20 years ago in prosocial ways. Marketers of
products purchased by teens are ratcheting up cam-
paigns to use Facebook, Twitter, and numerous other
Internet-based media to promote beverages, complex-
ion creams, and computer games. In recent years,
health-based social marketing campaigns have applied
these media to encourage adoption of healthy behav-
iors and avoidance of risk-taking among adolescents.
One of the most investigated campaigns is the Truth,
a campaign to prevent adolescent tobacco use. Based
on the success of a Florida campaign in the 1990s, the
TRUTH, funded by the tobacco industry’s American
Legacy Foundation campaign, became a national effort
in 2000. While not strictly a “new media” campaign,
the TRUTH employed broadcast and Internet counter-
advertising to initiate adolescent conversations about
tobacco and the industry that markets it. The primary
objectives of the truth campaign were to (1) expose
youth to truth messages and promote positive reactions
to those messages, (2) change attitudes about tobacco
use and the tobacco industry, and (3) reduce tobacco
use among youth. These three objectives led to an

Advertising: Do Not Buy That A 81

A

evaluation plan that aimed to develop measures of
adolescent exposure to the campaign and to assess the
relationship between campaign exposure and related
knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about tobacco.

The campaign was the ﬁrst to take into account the
pleasure taken by teenagers when they expose the
hypocrisies of adults, and especially regarding their
institutions. A large component of the TRUTH effort
is to facilitate adolescents’ perceptions of the tobacco
industry as an institution that not only produces prod-
ucts that cause death and disease, but also lies about the
dangers to the public. As an early social media cam-
paign, the TRUTH fared well in evaluation research.
One published study found that from 2000 to 2002 US
adolescent smoking prevalence declined from 25.3% to
18% and that TRUTH accounted for approximately
22% of that decline (Wakeﬁeld et al. 2006). This
study demonstrated that the campaign had a large
and statistically signiﬁcant
impact on adolescent
smoking, above and beyond a marked trend of declin-
ing smoking among this population. It also showed
that while most social marketing campaigns have mod-
est effect sizes by clinical standards, some campaigns
can achieve relatively large effects. The campaign-
attributable decline in smoking prevalence represents
some 300,000 fewer adolescent smokers during the
study period.

Conclusion
In many ways, parents have good reasons for their
concerns about the risks of advertising outcomes on
their children. A convincing body of research points to
negative effects of advertising in areas of health, sub-
stance abuse, sexuality, and other areas of adolescent
life. New media are being created every few years, each
with the potential to add more advertising to the
landscape with all of the concomitant risks.

Clearly, there are mechanisms that help adolescents
to ignore or reject advertising messages. Some speciﬁc
anti-advertising campaigns work to elevate adolescent
resistance to advertising. How do they do this? The
thread that unites the programs and parent efforts is
critical thinking. While adolescents like and remember
ads and commercials with humor and characters that
they admire, the development of skepticism about
the motives of advertisers in the early teen years helps
them to reject unbelievable claims about advertised
products.

Speciﬁc intervention programs help adolescents to
apply critical thinking skills to evaluating the claims of
advertising. Programs such as the Lion’s Club “Skills
For Adolescents” and the TRUTH elevate awareness of
the motives and mechanisms of advertisers for teen
audiences. Accompanied by programs of formative
evaluation, these interventions are providing young
readers and viewers with tools to evaluate advertising
and to reduce risks. Further research should investigate
how cost-effective programs can be developed for
within-and-outside of school classroom use. The pop-
ularity of the Internet among this audience may provide
a new way for the delivery of “teachable moments.”

Family communication about advertising begun
early in a child’s life can help to provide more critical
skills for adolescent audiences. A pattern of family talk,
also known as mediation, about advertising helps
a growing mind to appreciate how music, animation,
pop culture heroes, and exaggeration combine to form
powerful appeals in print, Internet, and television
messages. More work on how to help parents become
effective mediators is necessary, as is more research on
negative family patterns that may interfere with the
development of critical thinking about these topics.

In light of the popularity of social media, adoles-
cents have vast new opportunities for exposure to
advertising. As television drops lower in their media
diet, time on media like Facebook occupies a good deal
of adolescent leisure. Marketers are ratcheting up skills
to deliver commercial messages. Opportunities for
product placements are multiplied when media like
YouTube brings a smorgasbord of visual entertainment
at the click of a mouse; application of critical thinking
becomes more difﬁcult when all ads are nonverbal.
Both researchers and adolescent advocates will need
to develop new ways to counter-argue commercial
messages.

Finally, there is a huge need for integration of vari-
ables and approaches in research on these problems.
More messages and programs need to investigate, for
example, novelty-seeking and its relationship to other
aspects of advertising. Adolescents high in novelty-
seeking are more likely to be attracted to advertising
for alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. Can messages be
designed to counter ads that appeal to high novelty
seekers?

An example of research, which integrates several
dimension of the problem is an investigation of 12th

82 A Affirmation

graders media use and a construct termed “drive
thin)
for thinness” (a self-reported need to feel
(Carson, Rodriguez, and Audrain-McGovern, 2005).
Among the ﬁndings were that exposure to fashion,
entertainment, and gossip magazines had indirect,
positive effects on smoking through paths of drive for
thinness and tobacco advertisement receptivity. There
was a direct effect of health, ﬁtness, and sports maga-
zine reading on smoking. The authors of the study
concluded that adolescents who read fashion, enter-
tainment, and gossip magazines may be more likely to
smoke, in part, because of a higher drive for thinness
and greater receptivity to cigarette advertisements.
Adolescents reading Health and Fitness magazines
were less likely to report smoking. Integrative research
such as this example will help to target the need to be
thin and higher receptivity to advertising for future
interventions. It is clear that advertising to adolescents
will increase as will the media used to deliver it. Future
research needs to keep up with the avalanche.

Affirmation

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Although the term “afﬁrmation” may have multiple
meanings, all converge on the assertion that something

exists, is true, and has value. In the context of human
development, the term potentially relates to several
issues. Most notably, afﬁrmation relates
to how
individuals view themselves (as studied considerably
in research on self-afﬁrmation theory) and how
others view them (as exempliﬁed by research on the
Michelangelo Phenomenon). Although research has
yet to focus explicitly on how afﬁrmation relates to
adolescents, existing research does reveal its potential
signiﬁcance to understanding adolescent development,
especially the signiﬁcance of social interactions and the
inﬂuence they may have on adolescents’ sense of self
and mental health.

Individuals generally have a strong stake in thinking
and feeling positively about themselves. Indeed, they
tend to characterize their futures as brighter than those
of their peers; and they also engage in attributions that
are self-serving, such as overestimating how they rate
on most positive characteristics. When faced with
information that threatens the positive views they
have of themselves, they embark on types of thinking
meant to preserve their positive views, such as ignor-
ing, minimizing, or simply discrediting the signiﬁcance
of the threatening thoughts and information. People
are motivated to maintain the perceived worth and
integrity of their sense of self (Steele 1988). For exam-
ple, when an event or information threatens a valued
self-image, an individual likely will seek to maintain
a global sense of self-integrity instead of focusing on
the particular situation or domain that shows them to
be lacking. When individuals afﬁrm an unrelated
aspect of their self-worth, their self-evaluation becomes
less contingent on a particular problem area, which
has
the problem less
rendering
problematic. Thus, when faced with a psychological
threat that challenges their sense of self, individuals
can restore self-integrity by drawing on alternative
sources unrelated to the threat, such as reﬂecting on
another important value. This phenomenon has been
understood through self-afﬁrmation theory, which
explains how individuals can afﬁrm valued sources of
self-worth (such as
important personal qualities,
values, or relationships), which then serves as a way
to buffer threats to their sense of self and reduce the
impact of the threats (see Sherman and Cohen 2006 for
a review).

individuals’ sense of identity (see Drigotas et al. 1999;
Kumashiro and Sedikides 2005). For example, relation-
ships are part of an individual’s identity and, as such,
positive relationships likely play a key role in the main-
tenance of self-esteem. Afﬁrmation from partners may
reduce defensiveness and increase openness in light of
challenging situations. They also may increase compas-
sion, altruism, and positive emotionality. Afﬁrmation
from partners also can reduce stress and increase
coping efﬁcacy. In a real sense, social interactions,
such as those had through close personal relationships,
involve afﬁrmation that helps individuals move closer
to their ideal selves. That process has been described as
the “Michelangelo Phenomenon,” a process by which
an individual helps their partner develop into the
partner’s ideal self. Partners’ afﬁrmations aid in the
development of their ideal self because partners have
a strong inﬂuence on situations where their partners’
ideal self can ﬂourish. Partners can increase self-esteem,
life satisfaction, and emotional well-being, as well as
relationship satisfaction. Importantly, the opposite also
can be true. Partners can seek to cultivate their partners
in a different direction than their ideal self, which
results in negative emotional consequences when part-
ners misinterpret, ignore, or undermine their partner’s
goals. Social relationships marked by afﬁrmation, then,
can facilitate healthy development; and those without
appropriate afﬁrmation can foster unhealthy outcomes
or the relationships’ dissolution.

The period of adolescence is known for adoles-
cents’ increased concern about their place in society
and social relationships as well as their focus on
exploring their sense of self (e.g., concerns about
identity). These normative concerns highlight the
importance of understanding afﬁrmation’s place in
adolescent development, and they highlight how
understanding the place of afﬁrmation in the period
of adolescence can contribute to a better understand-
ing of afﬁrmation, especially its roots and its role in
identity development as well as relationship formation
and dissolution. Still, existing research on afﬁrmation
already shows well how friends and partners facilitate
movement toward an individual’s sense of self and
how they can inﬂuence their self-worth and personal
development. A focus on adolescence can help
the ﬁeld move toward a greater understanding of
afﬁrmation’s complexities and nuances as well as
adolescence itself.

“Afﬁrmative action” refers to formal efforts, including
a broad range of policies and practices, that consider an
individual’s membership in a protected group (such as
one based on race, disability, and sex) to achieve
diversity within an organization or for access to social
goods and services (e.g., schools and occupations).

steps,
than simply not discriminating in
rather
a passive way, afﬁrmative action seeks to promote
equality in ways not required by antidiscrimination
law. In the application of afﬁrmative action, individuals
from one of the select groups are preferred, when all
things are equal, over individuals who do not have
such characteristics. This approach tends to attract
considerable controversy when framed in terms of
being effected through quotas, but afﬁrmative actions
that give preferences need not necessarily use quotas.

essay examines the illustrative Supreme Court cases in
this area, which likely have a great effect on minority
youth as it inﬂuences their access to such important
resources as schools and occupations (as well as those
of their family members) and inﬂuences the type of
society in which all inhabit.

In the US, the modern history of afﬁrmative action
originated with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (1964) and
Executive Orders that directed agencies of the federal
government to employ a proportionate number of
minorities whenever possible. These efforts eventually
led to legal actions reaching the Supreme Court.

In deciding afﬁrmative action cases involving racial
preferences, the Court has used strict scrutiny analyses
because race is used to categorize individuals. Typically,
such categorizing violates the equal protection of laws
standard, since individuals are not treated equally.
However, differential treatment is permissible if the
classiﬁcation of the protected class is in furtherance of
a compelling state interest and the governmental action
relating to that class is narrowly tailored to achieve
that interest. In these cases, diversity is the compelling
state interest, and the concern is whether policies in
place to achieve afﬁrmative action impermissibly
infringe on others’ rights when they are, in effect, not
preferred over members of another group.

The Supreme Court in Bakke addressed a case
involving a white male’s rejection from the University
of California, Davis School of Medicine while other
“special applicants” were admitted with signiﬁcantly
lower academic scores than he had. These special
applicants were admitted under provisions that gave
preference to minority groups. The trial court ruled
that the special program operated as a racial quota (as
it reserved a set number of places for minority
applicants who were rated against one another, not
the entire pool of applicants) and that the quotas
were impermissible because they violated both Consti-
tutional equal protection rights and also Title VI of the

Affluent Youth A 85

A

Civil Rights Act of 1964. The California Supreme Court
similarly found the practice unconstitutional as it
noted that the special admissions program was not
the least intrusive means of achieving the goals of the
compelling state interests of integrating the medical
school and increasing the number of doctors serving
minority patients. The Supreme Court of the United
States supported the lower courts as it found racial
quotas unconstitutional. The Court, however, did so
while also ﬁnding that educational institutions could
use race as one of many factors to consider in their
admissions process. The Bakke case, however, was not
an entirely strong statement on the issue as it involved
multiple opinions from several of the justices who only
partly agreed with one another. Several years later, in
Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger, the Supreme
Court afﬁrmed the view that “quotas” were not
permissible but that race could be one factor of many
factors that could be used to meet the compelling
interest of diversity.

The Supreme Court may have settled the matter for
now, but controversies still remain (see Sanders 2003).
For example, those who argue for afﬁrmative action
adopt a group rights approach, where those who
beneﬁt from the actions need not be the ones who
were actual victims of invidious discrimination; they
get preference simply by being part of a protected class
on the grounds that afﬁrmative action programs are
a way to ensure equality to all. Opponents prefer to
have individual victims beneﬁt
from afﬁrmative
actions, and they do so on the grounds that using
classiﬁcations otherwise perpetuates stereotypes and
stigmas that afﬁrmative actions are supposed to
eradicate. Thus, rather than viewing afﬁrmative actions
as problematic for the dominant group, the actions are
seen as problematic for
the intended
beneﬁciaries. They are deemed problematic to the
extent that they run the risk of creating internal stigma
(doubt about one’s abilities) as well as external stigma
(dealing with others’ doubts of their qualiﬁcations).
Controversies are likely to continue, especially since
concerns about the effects of internal stigma are voiced
by members of protected groups, including Justice
Clarence Thomas, who belongs to a minority group
often targeted as in need of afﬁrmative action, who has
described afﬁrmative action programs as stamping
minorities with a badge of inferiority (see Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Pen˜a 1995).

some of

Broadly deﬁned, afﬁrmative action includes positive
steps to increase access to resources and opportunities
for individuals from historically excluded groups. These
actions become quite controversial when they result in
preferential selection, and they especially become con-
troversial when they seek equality in result rather than
equality in opportunity. These actions are problematic
in that they do not, by deﬁnition, treat people equally.
They create specially protected classes that society is
much more ready to accept as protected if it can be
shown that its members speciﬁcally suffered from invid-
ious discrimination than society is ready to accept as
deserving of special privileges without such a showing.

Overview
Among developmental
there has been
a growing awareness for the need to study the relation-
ship between contextual factors and child adaptation.
A substantial body of research exists documenting the
association between child development and socioeco-
nomic status. Within the academic literatures there is
a general consensus that children growing up in poor

86 A Affluent Youth

families tend to have worse physical and psychological
health, greater frequency of behavioral problems,
higher risk for drug and alcohol problems, and lower
cognitive development and academic achievement than
those who do not. Less, however, is known about youth
at the opposite end of the socioeconomic spectrum:
those who have grown up in afﬂuent families. Whether,
how and when wealth matters for child development
has been largely an unexplored area of inquiry. Posited
explanations for this research gap have included
difﬁculties understanding and collecting data on
wealth, as well as assumptions that afﬂuent youth are
a homogeneous group and at low risk for maladjust-
ment. Over the last decade, a growing body of empirical
research has begun to ﬁll this gap, pointing to many
similarities as well as important differences between the
impoverished and their afﬂuent counterparts.

Affluence: Definitional Issues
Afﬂuence is a nebulous classiﬁcation based upon
a combination of socioeconomic factors and normative
judgments, all of which can change over time and
locale. Within both the theoretical and empirical liter-
atures, operational deﬁnitions of wealth abound and
have included both absolute standards (e.g., income,
amount of property ownership/material goods, total
assets, etc.), as well as relative comparisons. Afﬂuence
has been measured at the individual, household, com-
levels, and several algorithms
munity, and national
exist that combine variables. This range of deﬁnitions
complicates cross-study comparisons and generaliza-
tions about afﬂuent youth, with sample characteristics
being indicative of afﬂuence in one study and middle
class status in another.

Affluence as a Context for Youth
Development
Ecological Systems Theory has been a leading framework
for understanding the lives of afﬂuent youth. Devel-
oped by Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979), a pioneering
the theory describes
developmental psychologist,
child development within the context of a complex
and dynamic web of nested environmental systems.
Across disciplines, discussions on afﬂuence as a
contextual variable have focused, to varying degrees,
on aspects of Bronfenbrenner’s ﬁve systems:
the
microsystem (family, peers, school, and neighborhood),
the mesosystem (the interaction of microsystems), the

exosystem (external environments), the macrosystem
(broader culture, society’s customs and values, includ-
ing socioeconomic factors), and the chronosystem
(socio-historical conditions). To date, the extent to
which these systems impact youth outcomes, however,
remains conﬂicting and difﬁcult to disentangle. While
some theoretical models have pointed to the positive
effects of afﬂuent parents and neighborhoods on youth
development (Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993), others have
argued that afﬂuence is a contextual risk factor for
maladaptation (Luthar 2003). Deﬁnitional and obser-
vational issues may explain these differing viewpoints,
as well as the possibility that the relationship between
afﬂuence and positive youth outcomes may be
nonlinear.

In 1946, renowned sociologist Max Weber intro-
duced the concept of “life chances” as the degree to
which a person has access to important societal
resources. From a Weberian perspective, wealth affects
a person’s life chances. By impacting access to a host of
valuable resources such as education, sociocultural
opportunities, healthy food, housing, healthcare, and
safe neighborhoods, wealth can create an environment
that maximizes positive developmental outcomes. For
example, afﬂuence provides parents with opportunities
to improve their children’s lives, with dollars spent
securing opportunities (e.g., private school education)
that can pave the way to additional opportunities (e.g.,
acceptance into a prestigious university, access to high-
powered social networks, etc.).

Others scholars have maintained that western
society’s overemphasis on wealth, possessions, appear-
ances (social and physical), and fame compromises
well-being. Laboring on a hedonic treadmill, theorists
have argued that as a person amasses more wealth,
expectations and desires rise in tandem. According to
economist Staffan Linder, consumers in afﬂuent coun-
tries can become single-minded in an attempt to
increase the productivity of their non-work time to
increase their wealth. The focus becomes one of relative
deprivation, with the afﬂuent perpetually assessing
their value relative to others in their environment –
colleagues at work, neighbors, and individuals in their
social circle. In this scenario, the relatively afﬂuent
feel poor in comparison with the very wealthy. As
ﬁnancially successful parents focus their attention on
career obligations and extrinsic goals,
less time is
then devoted to personal and familial relationships,

leisure time, spirituality, and community involvement.
Expecting excessively high levels of achievement, both
from themselves and their children, afﬂuent parents
may cultivate a family environment of perfectionism
in which markers of their children’s success include
high grades, trophies, and admission to prestigious
schools. According to this line of thinking, the dynamic
interaction of family pressure, social comparisons, and
emphasis on achievement places youth at risk for a host
of psychological difﬁculties.

Merging both viewpoints, a curvilinear relationship
may exist between wealth and positive youth outcomes.
According to Csikszentmihalyi (1999), after a certain
minimum threshold – which ﬂuctuates with resource
allocation in any given society – the beneﬁts of
afﬂuence are irrelevant and possibly deleterious.
Other variables may become potent in enhancing
positive outcomes beyond this threshold such as
establishing authentic relationships, achieving ﬂow
(a mental state in which a person is immersed in an
activity and experiences a sense of energized focus, full
involvement, and success in the process during which
everyday concerns are typically ignored), etc. To date,

Adjustment Disturbances Among
Affluent Youth: Empirical Findings
The work of Suniya S. Luthar, Professor of Psychology
and Education at Columbia University, and her col-
leagues comprises the majority of the empirical studies
available on afﬂuent youth. Their work has resulted in
studies spanning the past decade (1999–2009) with the
majority of the data coming from three cohorts of
secondary school students living in afﬂuent communi-
ties (n = 880); (Luthar and Becker 2002; Luthar and
D’Avanzo 1999; Luthar
and Latendresse 2005),
compared with two cohorts of inner-city students
(n = 524);
(Luthar and D’Avanzo; Luthar and
Latendresse). These researchers have operationally
deﬁned “afﬂuence” with community-level census
income data; median family incomes for their afﬂuent
samples range from $74,898 to $125,381 and median
family incomes for their inner-city comparison sam-
ples range from $27,388 to $34,658. Taken together,

this body of literature has contributed to an improved
understanding of externalizing behavior, internalizing
behavior, and academic achievement among afﬂuent
youth, and the extent to which these outcomes may be
related to both individual-level (e.g., youth gender)
and parenting-related characteristics (e.g., closeness
to parents). A brief description of ﬁndings within
these domains is provided below.

Externalizing Behavior
Findings have generally been consistent indicating that
rates of cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug
use among high school samples of afﬂuent youth are
higher than rates reported nationally and by low-
income youth in particular (e.g., Luthar and D’Avanzo
1999; Luthar and Goldstein 2008). In a longitudinal
study of 289 afﬂuent 10th graders tracked through
12th grade, McMahon and Luthar (2006) found that
their substance use trends could be grouped into ﬁve
typologies, very similar to those found in other inves-
tigations: (1) minimal to no use; (2) early onset of
escalating use; (3) later onset of escalating use;
(4) very early onset of persistently high use; (5) early
onset then decreasing use. Incidence of delinquent
behavior reported by afﬂuent youth in Luthar and
D’Avanzo’s (1999) study were similar to rates of prob-
lem behaviors reported by low-income youth of the
same age (Luthar and Ansary 2005). Urban youth
tended to endorse behaviors such as physical ﬁghts
and carrying weapons, while suburban youth endorsed
higher levels of petty theft. Correlations between levels
of delinquency and substance use have also been found
(McMahon and Luthar 2006).

Internalizing Behavior
Anxiety and depression have been the most widely
examined internalizing problems among afﬂuent
youth. Luthar and D’Avanzo (1999) documented levels
of anxiety among 10th grade afﬂuent youth that were
signiﬁcantly higher than their low-income counter-
parts and levels of depression that were marginally
higher. McMahon and Luthar (2006) found links
between both physiological anxiety (rather than social
anxiety) and depression levels and substance use. Of
the ﬁve substance use typologies derived by the inves-
tigators (see Externalizing Behavior), only the group of
persistently high substance users approached clinical
levels of depression. In contrast to these ﬁndings,

88 A Affluent Youth

Luthar and Becker (2002) and Luthar and Latendresse
(2005) found that clinical depression anxiety levels
among afﬂuent “preadolescents” (sixth graders) were
similar to or lower than levels in normative samples,
and also lower than their low-income counterparts. By
seventh grade, however, internalizing problems were
quite evident among the afﬂuent, especially among
girls (see Gender Differences).

Academic Achievement
Willie’s (2001) study of the effect of socioeconomic
context of the school community on standardized
achievement test scores among elementary and middle
school students found a gradual increase in achieve-
ment test scores corresponding to increases in the aver-
age income of their families, regardless of race. The
author reports that students in afﬂuent-concentrated
schools scored an average of 27 (Black students) and 20
(White students) points higher than their low-income
counterparts. Cross-sectional studies have found that
grades are negatively correlated with substance use and
positively correlated with academic motivation, within
both low-income and afﬂuent groups (e.g., Luthar and
D’Avanzo 1999; Luthar and Ansary 2005). McMahon
and Luthar’s (2006) longitudinal study further speci-
ﬁed that declines in academic performance occurred
prior to escalation of substance use among afﬂuent high
school students speciﬁcally (they did not include a low-
income comparison); moreover, marijuana users and
“multi-problem” youth (those who engage in multiple
problem behaviors such as substance use, delinquency,
and school disengagement)
exhibited the worst
academic outcomes in Ansary and Luthar’s (2009)
3-year investigation of afﬂuent high school students.

Parenting
Researchers have more recently begun to explore the
relationships between parenting-related factors and
youth outcomes among the afﬂuent. Parenting factors
that have received empirical attention include parental
containment (youths’ belief that deviant behavior will
elicit disciplinary consequences from parents), parental
monitoring, parental
to
parents, parental criticism, dinner with parents, paren-
tal expectations, and parental emphasis on personal
character versus achievements.

commitment,

closeness

Findings suggest that afﬂuent youth perceive fewer
repercussions for substance use compared to rudeness

to others, delinquent behavior, or academic disengage-
the perception of a more relaxed
ment. Further,
parental attitude toward substance use was strongly
predictive of greater levels of actual use, particularly
the use of alcohol (Luthar and Goldstein 2008).

Afﬂuent and low-income youth appeared to be very
similar in average levels of closeness to parents (mothers
in particular) and regularity of eating dinner with at least
one parent. Furthermore, lack of after-school supervision
was linked with externalizing problems in both samples
and dinner with parents was related to maladjustment
and school performance (Luthar and Latendresse 2005).
Although both afﬂuent and low-income youth reported
comparable levels of parent values that emphasize integ-
rity, afﬂuent youth interpreted this as implying val-
uation of “getting ahead” and achievement while
low-income youths’
interpretation focused on the
closeness of the parent–child relationships.

Parental criticism and after-school supervision have
emerged as important variables to consider in the
adjustment of afﬂuent youth. Although Luthar and
Latendresse (2005) found that
low-income youth
reported more parental criticism than afﬂuent youth
and the result of parents’ criticism may differ by
for
income groups. Preliminary evidence suggests,
example, that increased rates of nonsuicidal self-injury
in afﬂuent youth compared with a community sample
(a mix of lower-middle class and upper-middle class
students) appeared to be predicted by parental criti-
cism (Yates et al. 2008). Relationships between parental
criticism and internalizing symptoms and grades have
also been found among afﬂuent youth (Luthar et al.
2006). Further, lack of after-school supervision appears
to be related to indices of maladjustment for afﬂuent
youth (Luthar and Latendresse 2005; Luthar et al.
2006). Several gender differences have emerged with
regard to parental factors; please refer to the Gender
Differences section for additional information.

Peers
Another aspect of the youth’s microsystem included in
empirical studies relates to peer relationships. Becker
and Luthar (2007) examined afﬂuent and low-income
youth’s rebelliousness, problem behaviors (physical
aggression, academic disengagement, delinquency and
substance use), academic application (effort at school/
good grades), and physical attributes (attractiveness/
athletic ability) as predictors of peer regard and

Affluent Youth A 89

A

social preference. All youth, regardless of income group,
positively regarded classmates who showed pro-social
positive traits, but also admired some physical aggres-
sion. Both groups also showed admiration for substance
abusing boys (though not a social preference), strong
admiration for academic application (more so than
grades), and admiration and social preference for phys-
ical attractiveness (afﬂuent girls in particular), and ath-
letic ability (afﬂuent boys in particular). In Luthar and
Becker’s (2002) study, substance use was related to peer
ratings of their popularity (only for seventh grade boys)
and popularity also showed modest correlations with
delinquent behavior.

Gender Differences
Many of the empirical studies report gender differences
across a variety of outcomes. For example, afﬂuent girls
reported using cigarettes and marijuana at nearly twice
the normative rate while afﬂuent boys’ rule-breaking
behavior was three to four times national norms
(Luthar and Goldstein 2008) and many studies have
reported that afﬂuent girls experience high levels of
depression (see Ansary and Luthar 2009; Luthar and
D’Avanzo 1999; Luthar and Becker 2002).

Afﬂuent boys and girls also exhibit differential
behavioral reactions to perceived parenting. Girls
reported higher anticipated consequences from par-
ents for misbehavior overall than did boys, particu-
larly for rudeness and delinquency. Boys reported
an expectation of more serious parent consequences
for academic problems than for unkindness (Luthar
and Goldstein 2008). While closeness to parents,
particularly mothers, was found to be an important
factor in girls’ and boys’ substance use and boys’
delinquency levels; girls’ closeness to fathers, not
mothers, was related to academic grades. Also pre-
dictive of academic grades was problem-behavior
for boys and absenteeism for girls (Luthar and
Becker 2002).

Gender differences in afﬂuent youth’s reactions to
peer relationships have also been documented. For
example, signiﬁcant links have been found between
boys’ substance use and peer ratings of their popularity
and between peer regard/social preference and athletic
ability (Luthar and D’Avanzo 1999; Luthar and Becker
2002; Becker and Luthar 2007); for girls, peer regard/
social preference were strongly linked to physical
attractiveness (Becker and Luthar 2007).

Neighborhood Wealth and Positive
Outcomes
The work of Luthar and her colleagues has begun to
shed light on how family afﬂuence may put youth at
risk for psychological difﬁculties; alternatively, there
has been much less empirical work examining how
access to resources may be of beneﬁt to youth in afﬂu-
ent families. Brooks-Gunn and her colleagues have
studied neighborhood-level characteristics on youth
outcomes, ﬁnding that youth residing in neighbor-
hoods with higher income families relates to pre-
schoolers’ higher verbal ability, higher childhood IQ,
fewer teenage births, less dropping out of high school,
and fewer behavior problems, even after controlling for
family-level SES. Overall, some studies suggest that
neighborhood afﬂuence may be a protective factor for
youth across
the socioeconomic spectrum (e.g.,
Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993). In line with the suggestion
that a curvilinear relationship exists between wealth
and youth outcomes (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi 1999),
Carpiano et al. (2009) found that increasing concen-
trations of afﬂuence were related to better devel-
opmental outcomes
for kindergarten children in
neighborhoods characterized by more socioeconomic
heterogeneity; scores were lower at the opposite ends
of the continuum (i.e., neighborhoods with higher
proportions of wealthy families or higher proportions
of disadvantaged families). The implications of the
Carpiano et al. (2009) study for older children
remain uncertain.

Conclusions and Future Directions
Afﬂuence is a complex, socially constructed concept. To
date, theory and research on afﬂuent youth have been
limited and have mostly focused on the relationship
between afﬂuence and a limited set of youth outcomes.
With the notable exceptions of studies conducted on
neighborhood wealth, much of the empirical data on
afﬂuent youth has come from the samples recruited by
a very small group of scholars. In most of these studies,
study participants was

approximated based on community-level census data
rather than collected directly from the participants
themselves. The empirical data would be strengthened
by more precise operational deﬁnitions and measure-

as other factors that are likely to be important in
deﬁning wealth (amount of property ownership/

Age of Consent, Majority, and
License

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Adolescents occupy a unique place in law. Typically
deﬁned as persons between the ages of 14 and 18,
adolescents have
traditionally been regarded as
“minors” by law. Minors, as a group, are legally dis-
abled. This disability means that they are presumed to
lack the necessary skills for capable decision making
and presumed to beneﬁt from adults’ guidance and
protection. Adult-like decision making skills generally
are necessary for exercising legal rights. As a result, the
law regulates the decision making liberties of minors
far more extensively than those of adults. This
regulation results in a hodgepodge of laws that are
based on different perceptions of adolescents’ capaci-
ties for making different decisions, the state’s interests
in allowing them to make those decisions, and the
general need to respect the rights of parents to direct
their children’s upbringing.

Depending on their age, and sometimes other fac-
tors, adolescents typically are not yet considered adults
nor are they no longer children. For example, the law
sometimes treats adolescents as children in instances
that they are protected by not being able to receive the
death penalty, vote, purchase alcohol, or sign binding
contracts. Similarly, adolescents typically cannot marry,
join the military, or have surgery without parental
consent. Yet, the law sometimes does not distinguish
them from adults as it allows them to consent to certain

types of healthcare, be sexually active, purchase contra-
ceptives, and drive vehicles. The legal system also has
developed
different

approaches to adolescents. Some institutions typically
treat adolescents as children in need of special supervi-
sion and thus less able to control their own rights, such
as when they are in schools and seek to express them-
selves (see Levesque 2002). Some other institutions
treat them like children in some instances and adults
in others. For example, the justice system can treat
some adolescents as juveniles in need of special pro-
tections while the system can treat other adolescents as
adults without concern for protecting them differently
than they would someone who was a hardened, adult
criminal
(Levesque 2000). Adolescents occupy a
liminal and often conﬂicting position in law.

Understanding adolescents’ place in law requires
an understanding of their legal ability to exercise their
rights. In this regard, some legal concepts are important
to distinguish: age of consent, age of majority, and
age of license as well as general exceptions to them.
Although these ways to mark the end of adolescence are
often related, they help highlight the complexities and
sometimes conﬂicting ways that the law deems minors
as capable of exercising their own rights.

the age of consent

Age of consent denotes the age at which a minor
is deemed mature enough to consent to a speciﬁed act.
Examples of
include whether
the adolescent can engage in sexual intercourse, make
a contract, receive medical treatment, or join the
military. If adolescents fall below a prescribed age, the
law assumes that they are deemed incapable of fully
understanding the consequences of their actions and so
are unable to consent. Age of consent may be the same
or different from the age of majority.

The age of majority typically denotes the age at which
parents are no longer legally responsible for their
children. The age of legal majority, that is, of presumed
independence, has long been 18, rising to 21 for riskier
activities such as the consumption of alcohol. Even that
age, however, can vary. Numerous exceptions can be
made to this general rule, such as when adolescents are
emancipated from parents. These exceptions can be of
considerable signiﬁcance as they can provide adolescents
to those of adults and remove
with rights equal
protections that they would otherwise retain as minors.
The third legal concept, age of license, actually has
not been much recognized as a way to demark age but

Age of Consent, Majority, and License A 91

A

still certainly is of signiﬁcance. The age of license is the
age at which states give someone legal permission to do
something. Examples include the right to work, drive,
vote, get married, smoke, and drink alcohol. The age of
license can be either lower or higher than the age of
majority. In addition, the legal age of license may or
may not relate to the ability to consent to the extent
that a general rule can be made to assume that most
adolescents, once they have reached a certain age, are
presumed competent to make decisions relating to the
speciﬁed actions. For example, some states permit
marriage below the age of 18 for some youth while
other states place it at 18. Similarly, states do vary the
ages at which youth can earn a driver’s permit or the
conditions under which they can drive. Lastly, over
the past few decades, states have increased the age at
which individuals can purchase alcohol, raising it from
18 to 21, while states have reduced the required age to
vote, from 21 to 18.

The three general ways that adolescents’ age can
matter lead to considerable variation, and that varia-
tion can be even more pronounced in that there is
considerable variation within any of the three ways
that age marks the rights of adolescents. Laws vary
considerably in the power they give adolescents to
exercise their rights. Some states, for example, permit
adolescents to engage in sexual activity at the age of 12,
but they limit the age of their partners and the types of
sexual acts that they may engage in; other states simply
prohibit sexual activity until the age of 18 (see Levesque
2000). Some states permit sexual activity and the right
to obtain medical testing but not necessarily the right
consent.
to medical
Perhaps the most conﬂicting laws are those dealing
with juvenile offenders; these laws sometimes require
some adolescents to be treated as adults while some can
be treated as minors in need of special protection while
still others can be treated as either depending on
a prosecutor or judge’s discretion (Levesque 2000).

treatment without parental

The wide variation in laws becomes further varied
in the manner that important exceptions have been
developed to counter inadequacies of general rules.
The most important exception, and one that has
garnered much controversy,
the mature
minor doctrine. That doctrine applies, for example, to
sometimes limit parents’ right
to the
medical treatment for their minor children. In some
states, minors of a certain age have the right to give or

to consent

involves

92 A Agency

withhold consent to some forms of treatments, such as
medications or medical procedures. This principle is
known as the Mature Minor Doctrine. That doctrine,
a relatively recent development in the area of a minors’
right to consent to medical treatment, applies in
different situations where the service a minor seeks is
quite important and the parents’ interest, while still
important, can give way to the rights of minors to
exercise the rights needed to obtain the service. For
example, the doctrine permits minors to give legal
consent in a situation where their parents would be
abusive or neglectful and their involvement would be
detrimental to their well-being. Note that the mature
minor rule may require adolescents to seek judicial
intervention, a process typically known as a judicial
bypass (Bellotti v. Baird 1979). Permitting this type of
exception is deemed important to protect the rights of
parents, in case their child is not mature enough to
make decisions on its own, and it protects the minor in
that they could be deemed capable to make important
decisions on their own if they could demonstrate
sufﬁcient maturity. The mature minor exception
challenges the ﬁrmly rooted belief that minors univer-
sally lack the capacity to make decisions and it also
challenges the ﬁrmly rooted parental right to raise their
children as they see ﬁt (see Levesque 2000).

contexts of people’s actions. From this perspective,
agency refers to acts that are done with intentionality,
to individuals who are producers and shapers of their
experiences and circumstances. A sense of agency is
a sense that one can be more than reactive to one’s
environment, having a sense of agency means that one
can be generative, creative, proactive, and reﬂective.
Bandura (2000, 2001) has advanced arguably the
most inﬂuential perspective of agency in the psycho-
logical sciences.

Bandura (2001) proposed that agency consists of
several key factors. It involves intentionality, the ability
to represent a course of action to be performed, to
make plans of action. Agency also involves forethought,
which is the ability to represent expected outcomes and
to make plan accordingly. In addition, agency involves
self-reactivity, which is the ability for self-regulation by
acting deliberately to ensure that plans that were
conceived can be achieved. Lastly,
it also involves
self-reﬂectiveness, which is the ability to reﬂect upon
oneself and the adequacy of thoughts and actions.
Self-reﬂectiveness is key to self-efﬁcacy, the extent to
which individuals deem themselves capable of exercis-
ing some measure of control over their own function-
ing and over environmental events. While much
research focuses on agency in terms of, for example,
moral or sexual agency, much of it has been done under
the construct of self-efﬁcacy (see Holden et al. 1990).

aggression, with the two most common being reactive

aggression. Reactive aggression occurs as a response to
an aversive stimulus, such as a deliberate provocation.
Instrumental aggression is goal oriented; it is aimed to
achieve a reward, such as ﬁnancial gain (see Vitaro and
Brendgen 2005). Researchers now increasingly examine
less overt aggression, such as relational aggression
aimed at damaging peers’ relationships or reputations
(e.g., Crick and Grotpeter 1995). Still, the major thrust
of research remains on understanding the nature
of reactive and proactive aggression (see Hubbard
et al. 2010).

Agreeableness

ROGER J. R. LEVESQUE
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Agreeableness refers to a tendency to be compassionate,
generous, cooperative, and empathetic in social situa-
tions rather than suspicious or antagonistic. Rather
than being Machiavellian and overly concerned about
one’s own self-interests, people who score highly on
agreeableness traits tend to place more trust in others
and have a much more positive view of human nature.
Given its potential importance to the study of social
relationships, agreeableness has received increasing
attention. Indeed, it has long been proposed as one of

the ﬁve basic dimensions of personality, with the others
including conscientiousness, openness, extraversion,
and neuroticism (see McCrae and Costa 1987, 1997).
As with other personality traits, agreeableness is
thought to be relatively stable across development, as
one of the most enduring personality dimensions
(Roberts and DelVecchio 2000), but not with some
changes, as agreeableness has shown to increase as
people age (see Branje et al. 2007). Given that it has
been viewed as a personality disposition, much of the
research on the topic comes from personality research
and social development.

Research has examined well the numerous links
among agreeableness, personality development, and
social relationships. Agreeableness appears to emerge
developmentally from temperamental self-regulative
systems, particularly effortful control (see Rothbart
and Bates 1998). Normal development of effortful con-
trol leads to agreeableness that serves to regulate frus-
trations when dealing with social situations, with
agreeableness directly relating to the ability to control
anger (Ahadi and Rothbart 1994). This ability to
control anger helps to explain a well-noted, negative
relationship between agreeableness and adolescent
antisocial behavior and delinquency (see Robins et al.
1994). Adolescents who are agreeable are more willing
to suspend individual interests, control their negative
affect and frustration that would emerge from interac-
tions with others, and respond to conﬂict more
constructively (see Jensen-Campbell et al. 2002).
Disagreeable youth are not necessarily known to be
aggressive or violent; instead, they are likely to be
viewed as self-centered, manipulative, disputatious,
stubborn, and sometimes prone to negative outbursts
of
emotionality (Asendorpf and Wilpers 1998).
Disagreeableness appears as increasingly signiﬁcant
during adolescence when relationships during this
period begin to be dominated by voluntary afﬁliations
and difﬁculties with mutual exchanges challenge the
ability to establish and maintain friendships and gain
acceptance by peers.

In addition to being linked to less antisocial behav-
ior, agreeableness links to a higher likelihood of
prosocial behavior and more positive social relation-
ships. Although it could be argued that agreeable youth
would be agreeable and go along with peer behaviors
that are problematic, research indicates otherwise.
Prosocial youth readily understand the consequences

94 A Aid to Families with Dependent Children

that their behavior may have on others and, as a
result, are more likely to disapprove of inappropriate
or aggressive conduct and, consequently, act more
prosocially (see Nelson and Crick 1999). Other research
on agreeableness as a dimension of personality and
peer relationships reveals how agreeableness contrib-
utes to positive relationships. Agreeable peers receive
higher levels of peer acceptance and have more mutual
friends; and more agreeable youth are less likely to be
victimized over time, as they appear able to deﬂect
aggression by communicating to others that they are
liked (see Jensen-Campbell et al. 2002). Given that
victimization can lead to so many negative outcomes
and poor adjustment (see Hanish and Guerra 2002),
and that agreeableness can reduce victimization, this
line of research alone underscores the potentially deep
link between agreeableness and mental health.

Although research examining the place of agree-
ableness on mental health outcomes is scarce compared
to studies of other personality dispositions, research
that does exist reveals links between agreeableness and
greater subjective well-being (Steel et al. 2008) and
reduced risk for clinical symptoms, especially suicide
attempts (Brezo et al. 2006) and externalizing problems
(Malouff et al. 2005). One 25-year longitudinal study
found, for example, that the consequences for being
disagreeable during childhood and adolescence are pro-
found; once disagreeable youth reach middle-age they
present multiple problems when compared to the more
agreeable members of their cohort, with those negative
outcomes including elevated levels of alcoholism,
criminality, depression, and career instability (Laursen
et al. 2002). Adolescents who fail to navigate their social
world in a way that allows them to get along well with
others place themselves at higher risk of emotional,
behavioral, social, and host of other problems.

Aid to Families with Dependent
Children

Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

Aid to Families with Dependent Children (“AFDC”)
was a federal assistance program tied to the Social

Aid to Families with Dependent Children A 95

A

Security Act of 1935 (1935). AFDC emerged from the
Aid to Dependent Children (“ADC”) program that was
part of the original 1935 social security legislation that
served as the cornerstone of the “New Deal.” Like
AFDC, ADC was administered by the United States
Department of Health and Human Services and made
federal matching funds available to states that created
programs to aid children with a dead, disabled, or
absent parent. In 1968, the ADC program was renamed
AFDC, with the words “families with” added partly
because of concern that the ADC program had discour-
aged marriage. AFDC eventually became the major
program that provided ﬁnancial assistance to children
whose families had low or no income (see Ofﬁce of
Human Services Policy 2010). Although ADC had been
a minor part of federal social security legislation, the
program became more prominent and more contro-
versial as it became AFDC and became the major and
highly expensive antipoverty program. As the AFDC
program expanded and national politics
shifted,
Congress searched for ways to contain or reduce
costs. Although Congress engaged in extensive modiﬁ-
cations in the 1980s, it was in 1996 that a major shift
occurred and essentially resulted in the abolishment of
the program.

One of the important points about AFDC is what it
eventually became. The program was dramatically
remade as it became assimilated into the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWOA)
(1996). The new legislation drastically changed the
nature of federal programs aimed to provide for poor
children and their families. Among other notable
changes, the new legislation imposed a lifetime limit
of 5 years for the receipt of beneﬁts; it also increased
work participation rate requirements that states needed
to meet in order to receive federal assistance to pay for
their antipoverty programs. The focus on the limited
nature of the replacement program was reinforced by
calling AFDC’s successor Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families (“TANF”). Despite these dramatic
shifts, many continue to refer to TANF as “welfare” or
AFDC.

PRWOA sought to end the dependence of needy
parents on governmental beneﬁts by promoting job
preparedness, work, marriage, and several measures
aimed at controlling the behaviors of
recipients
(Smith 2007). The law focused on fostering a stable
home environment through marriage and paternal

involvement. This thrust came from studies indicating
that married households were less likely to fall into
distress or poverty. It was hoped that encouraging
current welfare recipients to form stable home lives
would hasten their transition off the welfare rolls into
work, and also would prevent future generations from
what many describe as a cycle of welfare dependency.
To achieve this end, for example, the law granted states
funding to promote marriage education and relation-
ship counseling for men and women, as well as funding
for state programs promoting responsible fatherhood.
The marriage initiatives became increasingly popular
in the early 2000s and continue in popularity, especially
in the form of premarital programs (Fawcett et al.
2010).

As expected from massive legislative reforms
addressing intractable issues, the reforms have won
praise as well as intense criticism. In terms of praise,
the reforms have accomplished their goal of reducing
direct dependence on governments. The composition
of welfare recipients has changed, with a tremendous
drop from 12.2 million recipients in 1996 to 4.5 million
in 2006, and with the number of families dropping by
over 50% (Goldin 2007). Still, critics argue that the
reforms focused on those physically and mentally
competent to seek employment and failed to provide
sufﬁcient funding for adequate child care services so
that parents could comply with work requirements
(Goldin 2007). Perhaps the strongest criticisms have
come from concern about the focus on marriage and
continued discrimination, especially against minority
women (Smith 2007) as well as the use of control
measures and enlistment of the welfare system to
control behaviors (like drug use or possession) that
historically were in the province of the criminal justice
system (see Gustafson 2009).

Overview
While alcohol use is normative among adults and is the
most commonly used drug among adolescents, adoles-
cent alcohol use is associated with multiple social,
behavioral, and developmental problems (Grant and
Dawson 1997), which can persist into adulthood. Use
of alcohol during adolescence can also affect brain
development,
impacting emotional regulation and
motivation, during a critical time when abstract think-
ing and reasoning become possible (Zucker 2006). The
factors that put adolescents at risk for alcohol use are
multilevel and encompass the home, peer, school,
social, and physical environment as well as personal
beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Several interventions
have been developed to prevent or reduce alcohol use;
however, alcohol use remains a prevalent behavior
among adolescents.

Prevalence of Alcohol Use
Although the rate of alcohol use has declined somewhat
since 1999 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC] 2004; Johnston et al. 2005), alcohol use among
adolescents continues to be prevalent. In 2008, 10.1
million or 26.4% of youth aged 12–20 reported using
alcohol in the last month and 6.6 million (17.4%)
reported binge drinking (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration 2009). In 2008, alcohol
use initiation, deﬁned as having ﬁrst used alcohol in the
past year, was reported by 4.5 million youth and adults

(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin-
istration 2009). Almost 85% (3.8 million) of the 4.5
million new alcohol initiates in 2008 were younger than
the legal age of 21 years old at the time of initiation
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin-
istration 2009).

Alcohol use begins early, with 23.8% of ninth
graders reporting drinking more than a few sips of
alcohol before the age of 13 (Eaton et al. 2008) and
3.4% of 12–13-year-olds currently using alcohol
(Substance abuse and Mental Health Services Admin-
istration 2009). By the ages of 14–15, the percentage of
youth who are currently using alcohol almost quadru-
ples to 13.1% (Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration 2009). Among adolescents in
the eighth grade, 38.9% report ever using alcohol and
18% have ever been drunk (Johnston et al. 2009).
Alcohol use in the last month is also prevalent with
15.9% of eighth graders reporting current alcohol use
and 5.4% reporting they had been drunk at least once
in the past 30 days (Johnston et al. 2009). Moreover, the
prevalence of alcohol use only increases as adolescents
get older. By 12th grade, 71.9% of adolescents reported
they had used alcohol and 54.7% had ever been drunk
(Johnston et al. 2009). In addition, alcohol use in the
past 30 days was reported by 43.1% of 12th graders and
27.6% reported having been drunk at least once during
that time (Johnston et al. 2009).

Excessive alcohol use among adolescents is also
a widespread problem. The Monitoring the Future
Study found that in the 2 weeks prior to the survey
8.1% of eighth graders reported having ﬁve or more
drinks in a row (Johnston et al. 2009) . For 12th
graders, this percentage more than tripled, rising to
24.6% (Johnston et al. 2009). Among students who
reported drinking alcohol in their lifetime, 4.2% of
8th graders and 20.5% of 12th graders drank on 40 or
more occasions (Johnston et al. 2009). In addition, of
all 12th graders surveyed, 8% drank 40 or more times in
the last year and 10.3% had been drunk 40 or more
times (Johnston et al. 2009). Attitudes toward binge
drinking have also been changing from 1991 to 2003
such that a smaller percentage of students consider
regular or binge drinking to be a great risk and
a smaller percentage disapprove of others who regularly
drink alcohol or binge drink (Newes-Adeyi et al. 2005).
Adolescent alcohol use occurs across all segments of
the adolescent population. However, alcohol use rates

Alcohol Use A 97

A

do vary by race/ethnicity and gender. Alcohol use by
age 13 is most common among Hispanics (29%), then
Blacks (26.7%), then Whites (21.5%) (Eaton et al.
2008). Across 9th through 12th graders, 77.9% of
Hispanic adolescents, 76.1% of White adolescents,
and 69.1% of Black adolescents will have had at least
one drink of alcohol in their lifetime. Lifetime alcohol
use is similar among females and males in 12th grade
(72.3%, 71.7% respectively), while in 8th grade, prev-
alence of lifetime alcohol use is slighter greater among
females (39.9%) than males (37.8%) (Johnston et al.
2009). Past year alcohol use is more common among
8th grade females (33.6%) than males (30.7%); how-
ever, in 12th grade rates are again similar (65.5%, 65.6
respectively) (Johnston et al. 2009). Alcohol use before
age 13, however, is more common among males with
27.4% of males and 20.0% of females reporting use
before 13 (Eaton et al. 2008). Rates of heavy drinking
among males and females show a similar pattern with
more males reporting heavy drinking than females
(10th grade: 25.5% vs. 21.8%; 12th grade: 40.4% vs.
32.8%) (Eaton et al. 2008).

Alcohol use among adolescents is prevalent even
among youth as young as 13 years. By the time
adolescents reach age 18, almost 75% will have tried
alcohol in their lifetime and almost half will have
used alcohol in the past month. Rates of alcohol use
vary by ethnicity with Hispanic youth using the most
alcohol at the youngest ages and White youth using the
most alcohol at the end of adolescence. Boys begin
using alcohol earlier than girls, but girls quickly catch
up and even surpass the boys by eighth grade. By 12th
grade, however, alcohol use rates among boys and girls
are similar.

Consequences of Alcohol Use

Short-Term Consequences
Alcohol has been found to be a “gateway drug,” a drug
that can lead to the initiation of other substance use,
including tobacco, marijuana, and other illicit drugs
(Kandel 2002; O’Malley et al. 1998). Adolescents who
drink in early adolescence may be more likely to begin
smoking (Jackson et al. 2002) and use marijuana or
other illicit drugs (Wilson et al. 2002) in middle ado-
lescence than adolescents who do not drink alcohol in
early adolescence. Additionally, alcohol use has been
found to cluster with other health risk behaviors such

as unhealthy weight control practices (Jackson et al.
2002; Petridou et al. 1997) and risky sexual behavior
(Bonomo et al. 2001; Halpern-Felsher et al. 1996; The
Henry Kaiser Family Foundation 2002). In a review of
several studies that addressed alcohol use and risky
sexual behavior, Halpern-Felsher et al. (1996), found
that high-risk sexual activity was more likely to result
after using alcohol. In another study, 36% of youth 15–24
who reported engaging in risky sexual behaviors indi-
cated that alcohol or drug use had inﬂuenced their
decisions regarding sex (The Henry Kaiser Family
Foundation 2002). In the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior
Surveillance Survey (YRBSS), 22.5% of sexually active
9th–12th grade students reported having used alcohol
or drugs before their last sexual intercourse (Eaton
et al. 2008). Alcohol-related fatalities are another seri-
ous consequence of alcohol use in adolescence. In 2006,
25% of underage drivers who were killed in car crashes
were intoxicated (National Highway Transportation
and Safety Administration 2010). The YRBSS found
that 29.1% of 9th–12th graders had ridden with
a driver who had been drinking alcohol and 10.7%
had driven after drinking (Eaton et al. 2008).

Adolescents of ages 12–17, who reported heavy alco-
hol use (deﬁned as drinking ﬁve or more drinks in a row
at least 5 days in the past month) were the most likely to
have a serious ﬁght at work or school, take part in
a group ﬁght, attack someone with the intent to seri-
ously hurt them, steal or try to steal something worth
more than $50, sell illegal drugs, and carry a handgun in
the past year compared to any other level of drinking
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration 2005). In addition to violent and deviant behav-
ior, adolescents who use alcohol are also more likely to
be depressed than adolescents who do not use alcohol.
In a study by Windle and Davies (1999), between 24%
and 27% of adolescents who were identiﬁed as
depressed met the criteria for heavy drinking and
between 23% and 27% identiﬁed as heavy drinkers
also met the criteria for depression. Among those iden-
tiﬁed as depressed 33–37% of boys also met the criteria
for heavy drinking whereas only 16–18.5% of depressed
girls met the criteria (Windle and Davies 1999). Suicide
is also more common among those who use alcohol
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin-
istration 2002). Adolescents of ages 12–17 who
reported any alcohol use in the past year were more
than two times more likely than adolescents who did

98 A Alcohol Use

not report any alcohol use to be at risk for suicide
(thought about or tried to kill themselves) in the past
year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration 2002). Additionally, adolescents who
had their ﬁrst drink of alcohol before age 13 were
more likely to have reduced life satisfaction than
those who had their ﬁrst drink of alcohol after 13
(Zullig et al. 2001). Excessive alcohol use in adolescence
has also been associated with altered, delayed, or
such as cognitive
disrupted developmental
maturation, moral development, social competence,
and school performance (Brody et al. 1998).

tasks

Long-Term Consequences
Early onset of drinking has been found to be a strong
predictor of lifetime drinking and the development of
alcohol use disorders and alcohol problems (Grant
1998). A younger age of ﬁrst alcohol use has been
related to a greater level of alcohol misuse in later
adolescence (Hawkins et al. 1997). In addition, the
earlier a person uses alcohol, the intensity of alcohol
use, and the frequency of heavy drinking all contribute
to later problems with alcohol use and dependence
(Guo et al. 2000, 2001). Adolescents who began drink-
ing before age 14 have been found to be more likely to
ever experience alcohol dependence and to experience
alcohol dependence within 10 years of ﬁrst drinking
(Hingson et al. 2006). Early adolescent alcohol initia-
tion is also associated with an increased adulthood risk
of drinking and driving, being in a car crash due to
drinking (Hingson et al. 2002), driving after ﬁve or
more drinks, and riding with a driver who was high
or drunk (Hingson et al. 2003b). Adults who began
drinking at earlier ages in adolescence were also more
likely to have been injured while drinking (Hingson
et al. 2003b, 2006); and to have been in a ﬁght after
drinking (Hingson et al. 2001). College students, who
currently drink and who had their ﬁrst drink of alcohol
before age 13, have been shown to be at increased risk
for having unplanned sexual intercourse as well as
having unplanned intercourse due to drinking as
compared to college students who initiated alcohol
use at age 19 or older (Hingson et al. 2003a).

In summary, alcohol use among adolescents leads
to problems with future alcohol and other drug use
including marijuana and other illicit drugs. In addi-
tion, risk behaviors such as risky sexual behavior, driv-
ing after drinking, riding in a car with someone who

has been drinking, delinquency, and violence are more
common among those adolescents who use alcohol and
these behaviors can persist into adulthood. Alcohol use
is also related to depression, increased risk for suicide,
developmental problems, and social problems.

Early Adolescent Alcohol Use
Early adolescent alcohol use is related to signiﬁcant
problems later in life. Gruber et al. (1996), found that
onset of alcohol use by age 12 was associated with
subsequent use of alcohol and problem behaviors in
later adolescence including alcohol-related violence,
injuries, drinking and driving, and absenteeism from
school or work, as well as being at increased risk for
using other drugs. Early initiation of alcohol use also
mediates nearly all of the identiﬁed risk factors for
subsequent alcohol use including parental drinking,
proactive parenting, school bonding, peer alcohol
initiation, and ethnicity (Hawkins et al. 1997). Youth
who drink before age 15 are estimated to be four times
more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those
who begin drinking after age 18 (Grant and Dawson
1997). The odds of alcohol dependence decreases by
14% with each increasing year of age at onset of use and
the odds of abuse decreases by 8% (Grant and Dawson
1997). Notably, of those adults of who began to drink
before age 12, 16% report being dependent on alcohol
in the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration 2004).

Research has shown that early users of alcohol,

socio-
environmental, behavioral, and personal risk factors
examined, underscoring the need to intervene earlier
and across a wide spectrum of behavioral, intraper-
sonal and socio-environmental factors (Pasch et al.
2009). Early users of alcohol (approximately 17% of
the sample) were especially more likely to engage in
delinquent and violent behaviors and to have lower
self-efﬁcacy, positive outcome expectations, and expec-
tancies concerning alcohol use, greater access to alco-
hol, higher normative estimates of alcohol use, and
a greater number of

in sixth grade. This research
suggests that universal prevention programs targeting
students at the start of sixth grade may have already
missed a signiﬁcant portion of students who have
already begun using alcohol. Therefore, given that

“users” are a substantial proportion of the sixth grade
it may be important, then, to design
population,
a primary prevention program for teens, prior to
sixth grade, that focuses not only on speciﬁc alcohol-
related risk factors, but also on the important develop-
mental tasks of that age group – academic achievement,
appropriate conduct, and pro-social peer relationships.
This approach, intervening at earlier ages, would allow
for universal messages about alcohol use and yet also
provide support for high-risk students who may be
lagging developmentally. A developmental approach
to reducing adolescent alcohol use was also proposed
by several researchers (Brown et al. 2008; Masten et al.
2008; Windle et al. 2008; Zucker et al. 2008).

Determinants of Alcohol Use
Alcohol use in adolescence has been conceptualized as
an interaction of social, environmental, intrapersonal,
and behavioral factors (Epstein et al. 1995a, b; Hawkins
et al. 1992; Newcomb 1995). The most consistent
socio-environmental risk factors for early alcohol use
are peer and parental factors (Donovan et al. 2004).
Regular and consistent parental monitoring, knowing
where the child is and who he or she is with, predicts
less subsequent onset of alcohol and other drug use
(Beck et al. 1999, 2004; Borawski et al. 2003; Cottrell
et al. 2003; Donovan 2004; Grifﬁn et al. 2000; Stattin
and Kerr 2000), while lower levels of parental monitor-
ing predicts increases in early alcohol use among
adolescents (Borawski et al. 2003; Duncan et al. 1998;
Ledoux et al. 2002; Li et al. 2000; Pettit et al. 2001).

Authoritative parenting, parenting that is highly
demanding and responsive, with discipline that is
reasoned, consistent and democratic, with mutual
respect and reciprocity between the parent and child,
has been found to have an inverse association with
deviant behaviors (Simons-Morton and Hartos 2002)
and alcohol use (Jackson et al. 1998). Parental support
and connectedness, dimensions of
authoritative
parenting, are protective of alcohol use (Simantov
et al. 2000), and involved parents have children who
are less likely to initiate alcohol use (Simons-Morton
et al. 2001). Unsupportive and demanding family
environments and family dysfunction also increase
the likelihood of adolescent alcohol use (Colder and
Chassin 1999).

Parent–child communication that

is open and
frequent has been suggested to be protective against

adolescent alcohol use (Kelly et al. 2002; Wills et al.
2003). Brody et al. (1998) found that frequent parent–
child conversations where both parents’ and children’s
perspectives were expressed helped to orient children
to more conservative norms for alcohol use (Brody
et al. 1998). In addition, frequent and bidirectional
parent–child conversations were
associated with
children’s abstinence-based alcohol use norms (Brody
et al. 1998). Wills and colleagues also found that
parent–child communication about drugs was related
to youth having less favorable views of substance users
(Wills et al. 2003). Project Northland, an alcohol
prevention intervention sixth to eighth graders, found
that parent–child alcohol-related communication was
an important mediator of the intervention’s effective-
ness in reducing alcohol use (Komro et al. 2001).

Parents are important role models for their chil-
dren. As such, parents who drink alcohol in the home
may be modeling that behavior for their children. In
fact, parental drinking has been associated with ado-
lescent alcohol use (Dielman et al. 1993; Nash et al.
2005; van der Vorst et al. 2005; White et al. 2000).
Mother’s alcohol use in particular has been found to
put adolescents at increased risk for binge drinking
(Reifman et al. 1998) and alcohol use (White et al.
2000). Ennett et al. (2001) found that the nonverbal
communication of parent modeling of substance use
behavior was a more powerful form of communication
substance use
than verbal communication about
(Ennett et al. 2001). Parental role modeling also
includes modeling beliefs about alcohol use as well as
overt behavior. Students whose parents
reported
greater disapproval of adolescent alcohol use reported
increased levels of parental warmth and acceptance,
increased parental monitoring, better communication,
greater self-efﬁcacy to refuse alcohol, less approval of
alcohol use among friends, fewer friends and peers who
used alcohol,
less personal alcohol use, and fewer
consequences from alcohol than those students who
reported less parental disapproval of adolescent alcohol
use (Nash et al. 2005).

Alcohol use by peers, perceptions of peer use, and
perceptions of peer inﬂuence to use, all signiﬁcantly
increase the likelihood of early alcohol use initiation
(Donovan 2004). Hawkins and colleagues found that
those children who had alcohol-using peers at ages
10–11 were more likely to initiate early alcohol use
and to misuse alcohol when they were older than

100 A Alcohol Use

children who did not have alcohol-using peers (Haw-
kins et al. 1997). It has been suggested that adolescents
with alcohol and drug use problems are more likely to
have had problematic peer relationships in childhood
(Hops et al. 1999) or associated with antisocial peers
(Patterson et al. 2000) thus increasing their risk of
alcohol problems. In fact, one longitudinal study
found that children aged 10–11 with antisocial peers
were at increased risk for alcohol abuse and dependence
at age 21 (Guo et al. 2001). Additionally, associations
with antisocial peers in fourth or ﬁfth grades have been
found to directly inﬂuence substance use initiation in
the ﬁfth or sixth grades (Oxford et al. 2000).

In addition to peer and parent factors, access to
alcohol, offers of alcohol, and normative expectations
help to create an environment that is either conducive
or prohibitive of alcohol use. Access to alcohol in the
home has been related to alcohol use among adoles-
cents (Komro et al. 2007; Resnick et al. 1997). Adoles-
cents can get access to alcohol through many sources,
from
directly from parents, taking it from home,
friends, from older adults, from other relatives or
adults, and through commercial sources. However, for
underage youth, the most common sources of alcohol
are from parents’ supplies or older friends (Hearst et al.
2007; Smart et al. 1996; Wagenaar et al. 1993). Almost
30% of adolescents in the USA report having easy
access to alcohol in the home (Swahn et al. 2002).
Intrapersonal factors such as normative beliefs and
normative estimates are also important predictors of
alcohol use (Komro et al. 2001).

Self-efﬁcacy has also been associated with drinking
behavior and positive expectations or expectancies
about drinking, may also predispose a child to early
use (Donovan 2004; Hipwell et al. 2005). Adolescents
are more likely to use alcohol at earlier ages when
they have fewer negative expectations concerning alco-
hol use (Hipwell et al. 2005). Additionally,
lower
levels of achievement and bonding to school have
been associated with increased adolescent alcohol use
(Guo et al. 2001; Hops et al. 1999). Prior research has
also shown an association between early conduct
problems at ages 7–9 and alcoholism 25 years later
(Fergusson et al. 2005). Early use of other substances
such as tobacco or marijuana, feelings of depression, and
engaging in deviant or violent behaviors also increase
the likelihood of early alcohol initiation among youth
(Donovan 2004). Time spent with family members

(Sweeting et al. 1998), participation in extracurricular
activities and sports (Harrison and Narayan 2003), and
in religious activities (Sinha et al. 2006), have all been
found to reduce the likelihood of alcohol use among
adolescents.

An important environmental inﬂuence for adoles-
cent alcohol use is exposure to alcohol advertising. Alco-
hol advertising has been found to shape adolescent’s
beliefs, attitudes, and alcohol behaviors (Anderson
et al. 2009; Ellickson et al. 2005; Grube and Waiters
2005; Pasch et al. 2007; Smith and Foxcroft 2009;
Snyder et al. 2006; Stacy et al. 2004). Exposure to
alcohol advertising leads to better brand recall, and
youth who have increased exposure are more likely to
have positive beliefs about social and ritual uses of
alcohol (Committee on Substance Abuse 2001). Alcohol
advertisements also shape knowledge, attitudes, and
perceptions about alcohol use, which in turn are pre-
dictive of positive expectancies and intentions to drink
(Fleming et al. 2004; Grube and Wallack 1994).

Increased alcohol marketing receptivity, which has
been deﬁned as owning an item or wanting to own an
item with an alcohol brand name, has been associated
with increased likelihood of initiating alcohol use and
increased current drinking among teens (Henriksen
et al. 2008; Hurtz et al. 2007; McClure et al. 2009).
Additionally, alcohol-branded merchandise ownership
has been related to alcohol use susceptibility and
predicted the initiation of alcohol use among those
who were nondrinkers at baseline (Fisher et al. 2007;
McClure et al. 2009).

Interventions to Prevent Adolescent
Alcohol Use
Adolescent alcohol use is one of the most difﬁcult
behaviors to change because of the acceptability and
normative nature of its use (National Research Council
and Institute of Medicine 2004) as well as the multilevel
nature of the risk factors. Many interventions have been
developed to prevent and reduce alcohol use among
adolescents. Project ALERT, a 2-year school-based drug
use prevention program with students in seventh to
eighth grades, found positive results noted for both
cigarette and marijuana use, but not for alcohol use
(Ellickson et al. 1993). However, a long-term follow-up
showed no signiﬁcant intervention effects at end of
12th grade. In a replication with 55 middle schools in
South Dakota, signiﬁcant intervention effects were
