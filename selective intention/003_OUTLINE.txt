Apprenticeship 

Apprenticeship is post-secondary education with a difference.  Apprenticeship begins with finding a sponsor.  
Sponsors guide apprentices, and support on-the-job learning through provision of mentorship. Approximately 80 
per cent of an apprentice’s time is spent on the job under the supervision of a certified journeyperson or qualified 
tradesperson.  The other 20 per cent involves technical training provided at, or through, a post-secondary 
institution (PSI) – usually a college or technical institute. 

To receive their post-secondary credential, apprentices must learn theory and skills, and they must pass 
examinations.  Criteria for the program—including the content and delivery of technical training—are developed 
and updated by the Registrar. 

The graduate of the Electrician apprenticeship education program is an individual who will be able to: 

•  have a thorough knowledge and understanding of electrical theory and its application to lighting, power 

• 

and control equipment 
layout and install the various electrical circuits in residential, commercial, industrial and institutional 
complexes and buildings 
implement the instructions given in plans and specifications pertaining to electrical installations 

• 
•  be thoroughly familiar with the safety requirements for electrical installations 
•  be capable of trouble shooting and maintaining electrical systems and equipment 
• 
•  be familiar with the work of other tradespeople in the construction industry and with the different types of 

competently use the test instruments and various tools necessary to perform tasks 

building construction 

•  perform assigned tasks in accordance with quality and production standards required by industry 

Apprenticeship and Industry Training System 

Alberta’s apprenticeship programs are supported by industry stakeholders that ensures a highly skilled, 
internationally competitive workforce in the province. The Registrar establishes the educational standards and 
provides direction to the system supported by industry and the PSI’s. The Ministry of Advanced Education 
provides the legislative framework and administrative support for the apprenticeship and industry training system. 

Special thanks are offered to the following industry members who contributed to the development of the 
standard:  

Mr. D. Tangedal............. Athabasca 
Mr. M. Engler…………..  Slave Lake 
Mr. D. Kinley .................. Calgary 
Mr. C. Lofthaug.............. Edmonton

Alberta Government 

Alberta Advanced Education works with industry, sponsor and employee organizations and technical training 
providers to: 
• 
• 
• 
• 

facilitate industry’s development and maintenance of training and certification standards 
provide registration and counselling services to apprentices and sponsors 
coordinate technical training in collaboration with training providers 
certify apprentices and others who meet industry standards 

Apprentice Safety 

Safe working procedures and conditions, incident/injury prevention, and the preservation of health are of primary 
importance in apprenticeship programs in Alberta.  These responsibilities are shared and require the joint efforts 
of government, sponsors, employees, apprentices and the public.  Therefore, it is imperative that all parties are 
aware of circumstances that may lead to injury or harm. 

Safe learning experiences and healthy environments can be created by controlling the variables and behaviours 
that may contribute to or cause an incident or injury.  By practicing a safe and healthy attitude, everyone can 
enjoy the benefit of an incident and injury free environment. 

Occupational Health and Safety 

Persons engaged in, or supporting an individual in an experiential learning environment are often exposed to 
more worksite hazards than in other forms of traditional post-secondary education and therefore should be 
familiar with and apply the Occupational Health and Safety Act, Regulations and Code when dealing with 
personal safety and the special safety rules that apply to all daily tasks.  

Occupational Health and Safety-OHS (a division of Alberta Labour and Immigration) conducts periodic 
inspections of workplaces to ensure that safety regulations for industry are being observed. 

Additional information is available at www.alberta.ca/occupational-health-safety.aspx  

Technical Training 

Apprenticeship technical training is delivered by the PSI’s throughout Alberta.  The PSI’s are committed to 
delivering the technical training component of Alberta apprenticeship programs in a safe, efficient and effective 
manner.  All PSI’s place a strong emphasis on safety that complements safe workplace practices towards the 
development of a culture of safety for all professions. 

The PSI’s work with industry and Alberta Advanced Education to enhance access and responsiveness to industry 
needs through the delivery of the technical training component of apprenticeship programs across the province.  
They develop curriculum from the curriculum guides established by the Registrar in consultation with the PSI’s 
and industry and provide the technical training to apprentices.  

The following PSI’s deliver Electrician trade apprenticeship technical training: 

Northern Alberta Institute of Technology 
Lakeland College 
Keyano College 
Southern Alberta Institute of Technology 
Northern Lakes College 

Grande Prairie Regional College 
Lethbridge College 
Medicine Hat College (Brooks Campus) 
Red Deer College 
Portage College
