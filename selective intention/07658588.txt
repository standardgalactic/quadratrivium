Summary: The Hirota and Maxwell-Bloch (H-MB) system is a mathematical model that can be used
to describe the wave propagation in an erbium-doped nonlinear ﬁber with higher-order dispersion. By
extending the parameter ω in the H-MB system to the complex domain, all the nonlocal forms of the
H-MB system, including the reverse-space-time, complex reverse-space, complex reverse-time, complex
reverse-space-time H-MB systems, are found. Then the Riemann-Hilbert problem of the nonlocal H-
MB system is established to analyze the corresponding inverse scattering problem and construct the
corresponding soliton solutions. When N = 1, the singularity of the one-soliton solutions of each nonlocal
H-MB system is analyzed. When N = 2, we take the nonlocal reverse-space-time H-MB system and the
nonlocal complex reverse-time H-MB system as examples, showing that a two-soliton can also be regarded
as a superposition of two single-soliton in the nonlocal cases as |t| → ∞.
