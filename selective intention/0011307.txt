Abstract

Continuing previous work, a model independent analysis of the solar neutrino anomaly is
performed in terms of neutrino oscillations, allowing a comparison with the predictions
of the Standard Solar Model. SMA and LMA solutions emerge also in this case, although
somewhat diﬀerent from the standard ones. The signiﬁcance of the NC/CC double ratio
measurable in SNO is illustrated in this context.

Introduction and motivations

Flavour neutrino oscillations continue to be a pretty con-
troversial matter. It is fair to recall that, so far, no direct
signal of them, like neutrino appearance or explicit os-
cillation patterns, have been observed either in solar or
in atmospheric neutrinos. The up/down asymmetry of
the ﬂux of the atmospheric νµ and (cid:22)νµ neutrinos gives,
however, an indisputable evidence for the presence of
an atmospheric neutrino anomaly. No equally clear ev-
idence has been found, on the other hand, for the solar
neutrino anomaly [1, 2, 3, 4], since its standard interpre-
tation relies on a combination of many di(cid:11)erent exper-
imental and theoretical ingredients. Furthermore, the
LNSD result still awaits for an independent con(cid:12)rma-
tion.

On the solar neutrinos, which are the subject of this
paper, quite di(cid:11)erent attitudes can be taken, depending
on the weight one gives to the input of the Standard
Solar Model (SSM) [5]. On one side, it does not look
reasonable to consider the solar neutrino anomaly as an
artifact due to a large unknown error in solar models or
in solar neutrino experiments. The other extreme atti-
tude is to assume that all the ingredients of the analy-
sis are correct, thus obtaining a rather precise determi-
nation of the neutrino oscillation parameters. As well
known, the best (cid:12)ts of the solar neutrino de(cid:12)cit in this
framework are given by few peculiar energy-dependent
survival probabilities.

The truth is that unfortunately, so far, SuperKamio-
kande (SK) has not found any evidence for a distortion
of the energy spectrum, nor for Earth regeneration ef-
fects, nor for seasonal variations of the neutrino ﬂux.
Furthermore, the most recent SK data [2, 4] worsen the
quality of the best (cid:12)t, with the net result that the new
best (cid:12)t regions now include values of the oscillation pa-

rameters previously discarded on the basis of the sole
neutrino rates. Recent analyses found that all the dis-
tinct best (cid:12)t solutions have a high goodness-of-(cid:12)t prob-
ability [6]. However, at least in part, this is just a re-
ﬂection of having (cid:12)tted the few really problematic data
together with many other ‘degrees of freedom’ that have
not much to do with the problem. To really judge the
quality of the (cid:12)t one should perform a more complete
statistical analysis or rewrite the data in terms of a min-
imal set of ‘optimal’ observables(cid:3).

In view of this situation, we (cid:12)nd it useful to come
back to an analysis which has minimal dependence upon
the SSM inputs. This is the purpose of this paper,
continuing previous work along similar lines. From an
experimental point of view, the main new information
comes from the SK measurements, mentioned above, of
the energy spectrum and of day/night or seasonal varia-
tions of the neutrino ﬂux. Their interpretation has little
to do with the theoretical input of the SSM.

The SSM independent analysis is performed in sec-
tion 2. In section 3 we discuss its implications for new
solar experiments. Conclusions are drawn in section 4.
In appendix A we describe the details of the computa-
tion. In appendix B we discuss how KamLand and neu-
>(cid:24) 10−4 eV2,
trino factories can test a high value of (cid:1)m2
12
allowed by solar data in presence of an undetected sys-
tematic error in the Chlorine experiment.

Fitting the solar, atmospheric and LSND anomalies
with neutrino oscillations consistently with all bounds
would require more than 3 neutrinos and peculiar mod-
els. We limit ourselves to oscillations between the 3 SM
active neutrinos and we await for a con(cid:12)rmation of the
LSND result [7], disregarded in the following. We use

(cid:3)A similar comment can be done for atmospheric neutrinos.
It is hard to judge if the ντ ! νsterile interpretation gives an
acceptable (cid:12)t by looking only at the minimal χ2 of a global (cid:12)t
that includes electron data, low energy data and too many zenith
angle bins.

2 SSM independent analysis

One can perform a useful almost SSM independent anal-
ysis [9, 8] by just treating the overall 8B and 7Be ﬂuxes
as unknown quantities, to be extracted from the data.
Here we brieﬂy recall how this procedure is justi(cid:12)ed
(see [8] for explanations and references). First, it is safe
to use the standard spectral functions for the energy
distributions of the single components

i = fpp, pep,

7Be,

13N,

15O,

17F,

8B, hepg

This kind of analysis is useful because solar neu-
trino rates have been measured by three di(cid:11)erent kinds
of experiments. For any given oscillation pattern, each
measured rate gives an allowed band in the ((cid:8)8B, (cid:8)7Be)
plane (few examples are shown in (cid:12)g. 2). Requiring
a crossing of all the three experimental bands selects
speci(cid:12)c oscillation patterns.
In this way one converts
experimental data into informations on the oscillation
parameters and on the neutrino ﬂuxes (cid:8)8B and (cid:8)7Be.
This kind of analysis will become more powerful when
the SNO and Borexino experiments will present their
data. Already now the results are much more restric-
tive than two years ago [8]. SK and Gallium experiments
have measured more precisely their ﬂuxes and the new
SK data now exclude in a SSM independent way a large
part of the oscillation parameter space where MSW ef-
fects are large.

Furthermore, the CHOOZ bound on (cid:22)νe disappear-
ance [10] now holds for all values of the mass splitting
(cid:1)m2
13 allowed by the SK atmospheric data. This was
not the case one year ago, and implies that θ13 is small,
θ13 < 15(cid:14) at 95% C.L. Therefore θ13 can only have a mi-
nor impact on solar neutrino experiments. Unless oth-
erwise indicated we will assume that θ13 = 0.

The best-(cid:12)t values of the neutrino ﬂuxes (cid:8)8B and
(cid:8)7Be are shown in (cid:12)g. 1. The regions delimited by con-
tinuous (dashed) lines give the best (cid:12)t at 90% (99%)
C.L.y The ellipses represent the 90% and 99% C.L. SSM
prediction for these ﬂuxes [5]:

(cid:8)8BjSSM = 5.15 (1+0.19
−0.14) (cid:1) 106/ cm2s,
(cid:8)7BejSSM = 4.8(1 (cid:6) 0.09) (cid:1) 109/ cm2s

(2a)

(2b)

A standard analysis would include these theoretical con-
straints in the χ2, forcing (cid:8)8B and (cid:8)7Be to be close to
the SSM predictions.

Fig. 1 shows that the best (cid:12)t regions are neither far
from the SSM predictions of eq. (2) nor peaked around
them. This reﬂects the fact that oscillation patterns
that gave the best standard (cid:12)ts of the measured neutrino
rates are now disfavoured by the SK SSM-independent
data. Basically there are two distinct best-(cid:12)t regions in
(cid:12)g. 1:

(cid:15) A region with (cid:8)8B > 5 (cid:1) 106/ cm2s and (cid:8)7Be <
5 (cid:1) 109/ cm2s produced by values of the mixing pa-
rameters around the LMA solution. Fig. 2b shows
how a perfect crossing of the three experimental
bands occur around (cid:8)8B (cid:25) 7.5 (cid:1) 106/ cm2s and
(cid:8)7Be (cid:25) 3 (cid:1) 109/ cm2s. This crossing is obtained for
12 = 4 (cid:1) 10−5 eV2 and θ12 = 0.42. The stan-
(cid:1)m2
dard analysis requires a crossing centered around
the SSM prediction: the best (cid:12)t is obtained for

of the solar neutrino ﬂux, while the total ﬂux (cid:8)i of each
component is regarded as unknown. Second, it is safe
to set to their standard values the ratios (cid:8)13N/(cid:8)15O and
(cid:8)pep/(cid:8)pp, to neglect 17F neutrinos and to consider hep
neutrinos only when computing the upper tail of the en-
ergy spectrum of recoil electrons in SK. Although to a
somewhat lesser extent, it is also safe to set (cid:8)13N/(cid:8)7Be
to its standard value. Finally the solar luminosity con-
straint allows to express the pp ﬂux in terms of the re-
maining free parameters (cid:8)7Be and (cid:8)8B.

yThe contour lines are drawn at (cid:1)χ2 levels that correspond to
90% and 99% C.L., if one converts values of (cid:1)χ2 into \best (cid:12)t
probabilities" p using the standard expressions valid for a gaussian
probability distribution. This is not a good approximation since,
as frequently happens in solar neutrino (cid:12)ts, one (cid:12)nds few separate
best-(cid:12)t solutions, while a gaussian would have only one peak. A
proper treatment would shift the values of 1 − p by relative O(1)
factors. A comparable shift would arise if we performed an exact
marginalization of the joint probability distribution with respect
to the oscillation parameters. We neglect such corrections, since
they are comparable to the uncertainties of Bayesian inference
arising from the need of choosing some prior distribution function.

the Gallium experiment (dashed lines) and by the SuperKamiokande experiment (long dashed lines) assuming four

crossing shown in (cid:12)g. 2a.

(cid:15) A region with (cid:8)8B 2 [2.5 . . . 4] (cid:1) 106/ cm2s pro-
duced by values of the mixing parameters around

12 = 0.5 (cid:1) 10−5 eV2 is shown
θ12 = 0.025 and (cid:1)m2
in (cid:12)g. 2c. It also gives the best standard (cid:12)t. The
previous best standard (cid:12)t had larger θ12 = 0.04
and gave a crossing perfectly centered on the SSM
prediction (see (cid:12)g. 1c in [8]), but is incompatible
with the day/night and spectral SK data.

Oscillation patterns around the LOW region (i.e. the
one with large θ12 and (cid:1)m2 <(cid:24) 10−7 eV2) give a modest
(cid:12)t with (cid:8)8B (cid:25) (4 (cid:4) 5) (cid:1) 106/ cm2s (see (cid:12)g. 2d).

Before going on, it is useful to consider the region
around (cid:8)8B (cid:25) 3 (cid:1) 106/ cm2s and (cid:8)7Be (cid:25) 0. This re-
gion appears due to a unfortunate weakness of our SSM-
independent analysis: assuming no oscillations, the three
bands perfectly cross at (cid:8)8B (cid:25) 3 (cid:1) 106/ cm2s and (cid:8)7Be
slightly negative. Therefore the no-oscillation case can-
not be excluded at a high con(cid:12)dence level and vari-
ous oscillations patterns not much di(cid:11)erent from the
no-oscillation case provide acceptable (cid:12)ts. We consider
such crossings as unfortunate accidents. Before (cid:12)tting
the mixing angles, we exclude by hand such cases by im-
posing (cid:8)8B > 0 and (cid:8)7Be > 1.5 109/cm2 s rather than
(cid:8)7Be > 0. This does not conﬂict much with our purpose
of performing a SSM-independent analysis, since very
low values of the 7Be ﬂux are unphysical, as the Boron
neutrinos, seen in SK, originate from the Berillium ones
to a large extent.

Fig. 3 shows the (cid:12)t in the usual plane of the mixing
parameters θ12 and (cid:1)m2
12: the standard (cid:12)t is shown
in (cid:12)g. 3a and the the solar-model independent (cid:12)t in
(cid:12)g. 3b. The best (cid:12)t regions are not entirely restricted
to θ12 < π/4 [11].

Concerning the standard (cid:12)t, we mention an impor-
tant detail not immediately apparent from the (cid:12)gure.
Like other standard (cid:12)ts [6], our (cid:12)t still contains a SMA
region, even if the SK spectrum and day/night data have
excluded the ‘old SMA’ region with larger θ12. The ‘old

SMA’ gave such a good standard (cid:12)t of solar rates that
values of θ12 previously regarded as ‘too small’ now give
an acceptable standard (cid:12)t of solar rates. This is why we
obtain a new best-(cid:12)t SMA region, more SMA than the
old one (see (cid:12)g. 4a). Fig. 2c explains why such smaller
values of θ12 were discarded in old standard (cid:12)ts but not
in old SSM-independent (cid:12)ts: they give a good crossing
of the three experimental bands, but at a value of the
Boron ﬂux smaller than the one predicted by the SSM.
This means that the SK spectrum and day/night data
are not a problem for the solar-model independent SMA
region.z. Non-zero values of θ13 just below the CHOOZ
bound slightly shift the crossing point towards higher
Boron ﬂuxes, and therefore slightly improve the quality
of the standard (cid:12)t in the SMA region.

Presently the LOW solution gives a better standard
(cid:12)t than the SMA solution [6]. Fig. 2d shows how the
three experimental bands cross in the case of the ‘best
standard (cid:12)t’ LOW solution, θ12 = 0.66 and (cid:1)m2
12 =
0.8 10−7 eV2. The crossing is not good, but roughly
centered on the SSM prediction. A solar-model inde-
pendent analysis does not reward this property. The
best SSM-independent (cid:12)t in the LOW region has larger
θ12 and lower (cid:8)7Be than in the standard (cid:12)t.

The band corresponding to the Ga experiment in
(cid:12)g. 2d (the almost horizontal one) is not unacceptably
high because Earth-regeneration e(cid:11)ects strongly a(cid:11)ect
neutrinos with energies Eν (cid:25) MeV((cid:1)m2/4 10−7 eV2).
Unfortunately radiochemical experiments, which detect
such neutrinos, cannot study day/night e(cid:11)ects. Earth-
regeneration gives a <(cid:24) 10% seasonal variation of the
capture rate in GNO, since at Gran Sasso nights are
longer in winter than in summer [12]. Gallex does not
see such an e(cid:11)ect. Present data from all Gallium exper-
iments could be sensitive to a 10% seasonal variation.

zThis discussion implies that the sterile neutrino interpretation
of the solar neutrino anomaly is disfavoured by SK only if one
imposes the SSM value of the Boron ﬂux.

3 Expectations for SNO

The fact that the SMA solution has migrated toward
smaller values of θ12, previously considered only in SSM-
independent analyses [8], has signi(cid:12)cant implications for
the SNO experiment. Previous studies of the signi(cid:12)-
cance of the SNO experiment [13] found that only a
global (cid:12)t of various SNO precision observables could
eventually discriminate between the SMA and the LMA
solutions.

On the contrary, we think that it is quite possible at
SNO to discriminate between the new LMA and the new
SMA solutionx or even (cid:12)nd evidence for oscillation pat-
terns suggested by our solar-model independent analysis
by making use of the NC/CC double ratio

r (cid:17)

(NC rate)/(CC rate)
(NC rate)/(CC rate)no oscillation

.

r is an interesting observable because dominant theo-
retical uncertainties cancel out when taking the double
ratio, and because expected oscillation e(cid:11)ects can be
very large so that one does not need a very precise de-
termination.

In order to perform a quantitative analysis, we com-

pute the values of r and of the χ2-probability

p (cid:17) exp(−(cid:1)χ2/2)

In (cid:12)g. 4b,c we plot p(r), the maximal value of p at
which any value of r can be reached in the LMA and
in the SMA region. The χ2 is computed performing a
standard analysis. In (cid:12)g. 4b we have included the most
recent SK data, while in (cid:12)g. 4c we have not included
them. Fig. 4b shows that there is now a neat separation
between SMA and LMA predictions: measuring r < 2
or r > 2 would have clear implications. A measurement
of r can also provide a signal for non standard solutions.
Dividing the possible values of r in 5 distinct ranges, we
can summarize the situation in the following way:

1. values of r very close to 1 are allowed in the non
standard part of the SSM-independent SMA re-
gion (with smaller θ12 and low 8B ﬂux). Oscilla-
tions into sterile neutrinos would also give r = 1.

2. 1 < r < 2 is allowed in the standard or SSM-

independent SMA region.

3. r very close to 2 is the value predicted by the
non standard solution with high (cid:1)m2
12 and θ12 (cid:25)
π/4 [8, 15], allowed in presence of an undetected
systematic error in the Chlorine experiment.

4. 2 < r < 4 is allowed in the standard or SSM-

independent LMA region;

5. 4 < r < 5 is still allowed in the non standard part

of the LMA region;

for a grid of oscillation patterns in the SMA and in the
LMA regions. The (cid:1)χ2 is computed with respect to the
local LMA or SMA minimal χ2, so that p = 1 in the
best-(cid:12)t SMA point and in the best-(cid:12)t LMA point. We
assume an energy threshold Te > 5 MeV on the recoil
electrons originating from CC interactions νed ! ppe,
but our (cid:12)nal results do not depend on this choice.
xThis observation was also made in a recent paper [14].

For completeness it should be said that values of r be-
tween 1.5 and 3 are expected also in the standard LOW
region.

The SNO experiment will improve also the experi-
mental knowledge of the solar neutrino ﬂuxes. The NC
rate is not a(cid:11)ected by oscillations between active neutri-
nos, and therefore provides a measurement of the Boron
ﬂux. It is expected to have a <(cid:24) 10% systematic error,

Figure 4: Fig 4a: how the SK bounds on spectral and day/night e(cid:11)ects (continuous line) shift the best-(cid:12)t SMA
region: the dashed area shows the old SMA, the gray area the new SMA. All lines correspond to best (cid:12)t-bounds at
90% C.L. Fig.s 4b,c show the probability distributions (see text) for the double NC/CC ratio in the new ((cid:12)g. 4b)

mainly due to the uncertainty in the detection cross sec-
tion [13]. Due to the large spread between the values of
the Boron ﬂux required by the di(cid:11)erent oscillation pat-
terns (see (cid:12)g. 1) this measurement will also have a sig-
ni(cid:12)cant impact. In particular the SMA solution requires
low values of the Boron ﬂux.

The Borexino experiment will be mainly sensitive
to the Berillium component of the solar neutrino ﬂux.
Therefore its data will be represented by one quasi-
horizontal band in (cid:12)g.s 2, at a level dependent on the ac-
tual oscillation pattern. Although the main features can
be seen already from (cid:12)g.s 1 and 2, a true understanding
of the impact of Borexino data on a SSM-independent
analysis will require a combined (cid:12)t of the oscillation pa-
rameters and of the neutrino ﬂuxes.

The KamLand reactor experiment [21] will measure
accurately the oscillation parameters, if they lie in the
LMA region (see (cid:12)g. 8). In this case, the solar neutrino
data will give the 8B and 7Be solar ﬂuxes.
In partic-
ular, the Borexino data will be crucial for an accurate
determination of the 7Be ﬂux.

4 Conclusions

The SK measurements of the energy spectrum and of
day/night and seasonal variations of the neutrino ﬂux
have not realized, so far, any \smoking gun" in the study
of the solar neutrino problem. Nevertheless these mea-
surements provide signi(cid:12)cant information, since inde-
pendent from theoretical models. Their use, combined
with a proper treatment of all the di(cid:11)erent rate mea-
surements allows an almost direct determination of the
preferred values of the 8B and 7Be solar neutrino ﬂuxes.
In turn these values can be compared with the SSM ex-
pectations.

This comparison at present is encouraging but far
from conclusive, as illustrated in (cid:12)g 1.
In particular,
also in view of (cid:12)g. 2, it makes it clear how premature it
is to select one speci(cid:12)c pattern of neutrino oscillations to
explain the solar neutrinos. Nevertheless, data expected
in the near future especially from SNO or from Borex-

solar neutrino oscillations and can also provide, at the
same time, an independent validation of the SSM from
neutrino physics.

5 Addendum: SNO results

In this addendum, we update our results by adding the
(cid:12)rst SNO [25] data. The SK collaboration published the
day + night spectral data [26] as 19 + 19 energy bins,
so that we can now include this information in the (cid:12)t.

disfavour values of (cid:1)m2
mixing θ12 (cid:24) π/4. Finally, we improved the numerical
accuracy of our computation, and extended it to include
vacuum oscillations [27].

As pointed out in section 3, the measurement of the
NC/CC ratio alone was expected to discriminate be-
tween LMA and SMA. The measured value happens to
fall into case 4. (cases 3. and 5. are not signi(cid:12)cantly dis-
favoured). Therefore the SMA region is now strongly
disfavoured, even from a solar-model-independent point
of view. Furthermore, the solar-model-independent LMA
region (case 5.) no longer gives a best χ2 signi(cid:12)cantly
lower than the standard (cid:12)t. These results are con(cid:12)rmed
by an updated analysis, as shown in (cid:12)g. 5 and 6.

In (cid:12)g. 5 we show the updated (cid:12)t of the solar neutrino
ﬂuxes. Values of the 8B ﬂux detectably di(cid:11)erent from
the SSM prediction no longer give good (cid:12)ts. On the
contrary, a discrepancy between the 7Be ﬂux and its
SSM prediction could still have signi(cid:12)cant e(cid:11)ects. The
best-(cid:12)t region at 90% CL in (cid:12)g. 5 is composed by two
disjoint regions. The one with smaller ﬂuxes is obtained
from vacuum oscillations (but can also be obtained with
LMA, LOW, SMA oscillations with a worse CL). The
one with larger ﬂuxes is obtained from LMA oscillations.
In (cid:12)g. 6 we show the updated global (cid:12)ts for the os-
cillation parameters: (cid:12)g. 6a shows a standard (cid:12)t, while
(cid:12)g. 6b is the solar model independent (cid:12)t described in
section 2. In (cid:12)g. 6c we perform a standard (cid:12)t, but drop-
ping the uncalibrated Chlorine rate from the (cid:12)t. The
results of (cid:12)g.s 6a,b,c are quite similar: more or less ac-
ceptable (cid:12)ts can be obtained for a large range of (cid:1)m2
and large mixing angle, while the SMA solution is al-
ways disfavoured.

Finally, we mention another important aspect of so-
It is sometimes said
lar model independent analyses.
that it is useless to measure the Gallium rate with an
error much smaller than the solar model uncertainty.
As explained in section 2 and illustrated in (cid:12)g.s 2, this
is not true. Fig.s 2 in fact shows that the amount of
information that can be extracted in a solar model in-
dependent way from the solar rates is today limited by
the accuracy of the Chlorine experiment. This limita-

tion will disappear when Borexino will measure the 7Be
ﬂux. Fig.s 6 show that solar model independent con-
siderations already now give useful informations on the
oscillation parameters.

A Details of the computation

The energy spectra for the independent components of
the solar neutrino ﬂux have been obtained from [16].
The neutrino production has been averaged for each
ﬂux component over the position in the sun as predicted
in [5, 16]. This averaging does not give signi(cid:12)cant correc-
tions. MSW oscillations inside the sun have been taken
into account in the following way. The 3 (cid:2) 3 density ma-
trix ρS for neutrinos exiting from the sun is computed
using the Landau-Zener approximation with the level-
crossing probability appropriate for an exponential den-
sity pro(cid:12)le [17, 18]. The density pro(cid:12)le has been taken
from [16] and is quasi-exponential: small corrections to
ρS have been approximately included. Oscillation e(cid:11)ects
outside the sun are described by the evolution matrix U ,
so that at the detection point ρE = U ρSU y. In particu-
lar, earth regeneration e(cid:11)ects have been computed nu-
merically using the mantle-core approximation for the
earth density pro(cid:12)le. We have used the tree level Stan-
dard Model expression for the neutrino/electron cross
section at SK. The CC and NC cross sections at SNO
have been taken from [19]. The experimental resolution
at SK and SNO has been included as suggested in [19].
The total neutrino rates measured with the three

kind of experimental techniques are [1, 2, 3, 4]

(cid:8)Cljexp = (2.56 (cid:6) 0.22) 10−36s−1
(cid:8)Gajexp = (74.7 (cid:6) 5) 10−36s−1
(cid:8)SKjexp = (2.40 (cid:6) 0.08) (cid:1) 106 cm−2s−1

having combined systematic errors in quadrature with
statistical errors. The SuperKamiokande experimental-
ists give directly the value of the ﬂux they measure.

6

The other experiments involve more uncertain neutrino
cross sections and prefer to give the frequency of events
measured per target atom in their detector.

The solar model independent SK data included in
the (cid:12)t are: the energy spectrum of the recoil electrons
(divided in 18 energy bins between 5.5 MeV and 15 MeV)
and the total ﬂux measured at SK during the day and
during (cid:12)ve night bins (de(cid:12)ned according to the value of
the cosine of the zenith angle) [2, 4]. The SK collab-
oration can include in their (cid:12)t data about the zenith
angle variation of the recoil electron spectrum and ex-
clude the old SMA at 95% C.L. With these unpublished
data the standard and the SSM-independent SMA so-
lution would be less attractive and (cid:12)g. 1 would show a
more neat separation into two distrinct regions.

B Large ∆m2

12 and nu-factories

The standard interpretation of the solar neutrino anomaly
is based on many experimental and theoretical ingredi-
ents. We have discussed how the SSM predictions can be
tested. There is one other ingredient that could be not
solidly founded and that has a signi(cid:12)cant impact on the
(cid:12)nal result [8, 15]. Only a single experiment, the Homes-
take one, has detected neutrinos with the Chlorine tech-
nique (with the other techniques, data come from two
water Cerenkov and two Gallium experiments). Fur-
thermore Homestake is the only experiment that ob-
serves a rate di(cid:11)erent than one half of the SSM pre-
diction in absence of oscillations, therefore excluding an
energy-independent survival probability Pee(Eν ) (cid:25) 1/2.
This important conclusion could be the result of an
under-estimation of the systematic error, that according
to the Chlorine collaboration [1] is equal to the statis-
tical error. It would be interesting to perform a direct
calibration of the Chlorine detector [20].

Pee(Eν ) (cid:25) 1/2 can be obtained with θ12 (cid:25) π/4 and
>(cid:24) 10−4 eV2. This oscillation pattern has no prob-
(cid:1)m2
12
lems with the recent SuperKamiokande data so that,
even in a standard analysis, it is no longer signi(cid:12)cantly
worse that the new best (cid:12)ts.

The KamLand experiment [21] will test the LMA
region looking at disappearance of (cid:22)νe reactor neutrinos.
If (cid:1)m2
12 and θ12 lie inside the LMA region, KamLand
>(cid:24) 2 (cid:1)
can accurately measure them [22]. If instead (cid:1)m2
12
10−4 eV2, (cid:22)νe oscillations are averaged so that a measure-
ment of (cid:1)m2
12 needs a good energy resolution, a precise
knowdlege of the un-oscillated spectra, high statistics
and low background. Assuming that these conditions
can be satis(cid:12)ed, (cid:12)g. 8 shows the accuracy at which Kam-
Land can measure few values of (cid:1)m2
12 and θ12 (repre-
sented by the dots) after three years of running (i.e. with
2400 events if no oscillation occur). If (cid:1)m2
12 is too large
statistical ﬂuctuations often lead to discrete ambigui-
ties in its determination. A reactor experiment with a
shorter baseline would not have this problem.
Here, we study the impact of a large (cid:1)m2

12 at a neu-
trino factory [23]. Due to the high beam purity, a neu-
trino factory will allow to study νe ! νµ and (cid:22)νe ! (cid:22)νµ
oscillations down to small values of the oscillation prob-
ability. Extensive studies [23, 24] have determined the
optimal energy and pathlength that give the maximal
sensitivity to a small θ13. If θ13 = 0 ‘solar’ oscillations

we clearly see in an analytical way how signi(cid:12)cant (cid:1)m2

for (cid:22)νe ! (cid:22)νµ signals.

At baselines L >(cid:24) 103 km matter e(cid:11)ects become signif-
icant. Using eq. (4), the number of events due to (cid:1)m2

ering (cid:1)m2

12 e(cid:11)ects.

By performing a global (cid:12)t of simulated nu-factory
data we (cid:12)nd that it will be di(cid:14)cult to distinguish (cid:1)m2
12
e(cid:11)ects from θ13 e(cid:11)ects at a good C.L. by comparing data
taken at di(cid:11)erent pathlengths and/or di(cid:11)erent neutrino
energies, as suggested in [24]. For certain values of the
CP violating phase a comparison between νe ! νµ and
(cid:22)νe ! (cid:22)νµ rates allows a better discrimination. Such ‘pre-
cision studies’ are statistically signi(cid:12)cant only with a
su(cid:14)cient number of events. For example, observing few
events only would not allow to say if they are due to a
θ13 (cid:25) 0.007 around its nominal sensitivity, or due to a
12 (cid:25) 3 10−4 eV2. In conclusion, if (cid:1)m2 >(cid:24) 2 10−4 eV2
(cid:1)m2
so that KamLand cannot measure it, an accurate mea-
surement of (cid:1)m2 cannot even be obtained with a neu-
trino factory: a new reactor experiment with intermedi-
ate baseline (cid:24) 10 km would be necessary.

If KamLand will give a precise measurement of (cid:1)m2
12
free from discrete ambiguities (this could not be the case
>(cid:24) 2 (cid:1) 10−4 eV2), by combining KamLand data
if (cid:1)m2
12
with nu-factory data one can usually obtain a satisfac-
tory (cid:12)t of θ13 and of the CP violating phase.
