PREFACE

This book is particularly intended for the student with a year (or a year and a half)
of calculus who wants to develop, in a short time, a basic competence in each of the
many areas of mathematics needed in junior to senior-graduate courses in physics,
chemistry, and engineering. Thus it is intended to be accessible to sophomores (or
freshmen with AP calculus from high school). It may also be used eﬀectively by
a more advanced student to review half-forgotten topics or learn new ones, either
by independent study or in a class. Although the book was written especially
for students of the physical sciences, students in any ﬁeld (say mathematics or
mathematics for teaching) may ﬁnd it useful to survey many topics or to obtain
some knowledge of areas they do not have time to study in depth. Since theorems
are stated carefully, such students should not need to unlearn anything in their later
work.

The question of proper mathematical training for students in the physical sci-
ences is of concern to both mathematicians and those who use mathematics in appli-
cations. Some instructors may feel that if students are going to study mathematics
at all, they should study it in careful and thorough detail. For the undergradu-
ate physics, chemistry, or engineering student, this means either (1) learning more
mathematics than a mathematics major or (2) learning a few areas of mathematics
thoroughly and the others only from snatches in science courses. The second alter-
native is often advocated; let me say why I think it is unsatisfactory. It is certainly
true that motivation is increased by the immediate application of a mathematical
technique, but there are a number of disadvantages:

1. The discussion of the mathematics is apt to be sketchy since that is not the

primary concern.

2. Students are faced simultaneously with learning a new mathematical method
and applying it to an area of science that is also new to them. Frequently the

vii

viii

Preface

diﬃculty in comprehending the new scientiﬁc area lies more in the distraction
caused by poorly understood mathematics than it does in the new scientiﬁc ideas.

3. Students may meet what is actually the same mathematical principle in two
diﬀerent science courses without recognizing the connection, or even learn ap-
parently contradictory theorems in the two courses! For example, in thermody-
namics students learn that the integral of an exact diﬀerential around a closed
dθ, which
path is always zero. In electricity or hydrodynamics, they run into
is certainly the integral of an exact diﬀerential around a closed path but is not
equal to zero!

Now it would be ﬁne if every science student could take the separate mathematics
courses in diﬀerential equations (ordinary and partial), advanced calculus, linear
algebra, vector and tensor analysis, complex variables, Fourier series, probability,
calculus of variations, special functions, and so on. However, most science students
have neither the time nor the inclination to study that much mathematics, yet they
are constantly hampered in their science courses for lack of the basic techniques of
these subjects. It is the intent of this book to give these students enough background
in each of the needed areas so that they can cope successfully with junior, senior,
and beginning graduate courses in the physical sciences. I hope, also, that some
students will be suﬃciently intrigued by one or more of the ﬁelds of mathematics
to pursue it futher.

It is clear that something must be omitted if so many topics are to be compressed
into one course. I believe that two things can be left out without serious harm at
this stage of a student’s work: generality, and detailed proofs. Stating and proving
a theorem in its most general form is important to the mathematician and to the
advanced student, but it is often unnecessary and may be confusing to the more
elementary student. This is not in the least to say that science students have no
use for careful mathematics. Scientists, even more than pure mathematicians, need
careful statements of the limits of applicability of mathematical processes so that
they can use them with conﬁdence without having to supply proof of their validity.
Consequently I have endeavored to give accurate statements of the needed theorems,
although often for special cases or without proof. Interested students can easily ﬁnd
more detail in textbooks in the special ﬁelds.

Mathematical physics texts at the senior-graduate level are able to assume a
degree of mathematical sophistication and knowledge of advanced physics not yet
attained by students at the sophomore level. Yet such students, if given simple and
clear explanations, can readily master the techniques we cover in this text. (They
not only can, but will have to in one way or another, if they are going to pass
their junior and senior physics courses!) These students are not ready for detailed
applications—these they will get in their science courses—but they do need and
want to be given some idea of the use of the methods they are studying, and some
simple applications. This I have tried to do for each new topic.

For those of you familiar with the second edition, let me outline the changes for

the third:

1. Prompted by several requests for matrix diagonalization in Chapter 3, I have
moved the ﬁrst part of Chapter 10 to Chapter 3 and then have ampliﬁed the
treatment of tensors in Chapter 10. I have also changed Chapter 3 to include
more detail about linear vector spaces and then have continued the discussion of
basis functions in Chapter 7 (Fourier series), Chapter 8 (Diﬀerential equations),

Preface

ix

Chapter 12 (Series solutions) and Chapter 13 (Partial diﬀerential equations).
2. Again, prompted by several requests, I have moved Fourier integrals back to the
Fourier series Chapter 7. Since this breaks up the integral transforms chapter
(old Chapter 15), I decided to abandon that chapter and move the Laplace
transform and Dirac delta function material back to the ordinary diﬀerential
equations Chapter 8. I have also ampliﬁed the treatment of the delta function.
3. The Probability chapter (old Chapter 16) now becomes Chapter 15. Here I have
changed the title to Probability and Statistics, and have revised the latter part
of the chapter to emphasize its purpose, namely to clarify for students the theory
behind the rules they learn for handling experimental data.

4. The very rapid development of technological aids to computation poses a steady
question for instructors as to their best use. Without selecting any particular
Computer Algebra System, I have simply tried for each topic to point out to
students both the usefulness and the pitfalls of computer use. (Please see my
comments at the end of ”To the Student” just ahead.)

The material in the text is so arranged that students who study the chapters
in order will have the necessary background at each stage. However, it is not
always either necessary or desirable to follow the text order. Let me suggest some
rearrangements I have found useful. If students have previously studied the material
in any of chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8 (in such courses as second-year calculus,
diﬀerential equations, linear algebra), then the corresponding chapter(s) could be
omitted, used for reference, or, preferably, be reviewed brieﬂy with emphasis on
problem solving. Students may know Taylor’s theorem, for example, but have little
skill in using series approximations; they may know the theory of multiple integrals,
but ﬁnd it diﬃcult to set up a double integral for the moment of inertia of a spherical
shell; they may know existence theorems for diﬀerential equations, but have little
skill in solving, say, y(cid:1)(cid:1) + y = x sin x. Problem solving is the essential core of a
course on Mathematical Methods.

After Chapters 7 (Fourier Series) and 8 (Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations) I like
to cover the ﬁrst four sections of Chapter 13 (Partial Diﬀerential Equations). This
gives students an introduction to Partial Diﬀerential Equations but requires only the
use of Fourier series expansions. Later on, after studying Chapter 12, students can
return to complete Chapter 13. Chapter 15 (Probability and Statistics) is almost
independent of the rest of the text; I have covered this material anywhere from the
beginning to the end of a one-year course.

It has been gratifying to hear the enthusiastic responses to the ﬁrst two editions,
and I hope that this third edition will prove even more useful. I want to thank many
readers for helpful suggestions and I will appreciate any further comments. If you
ﬁnd misprints, please send them to me at MLBoas@aol.com. I also want to thank
the University of Washington physics students who were my LATEX typists: Toshiko
Asai, Jeﬀ Sherman, and Jeﬀrey Frasca. And I especially want to thank my son,
Harold P. Boas, both for mathematical consultations, and for his expert help with
LATEX problems.

Instructors who have adopted the book for a class should consult the publisher
about an Instructor’s Answer Book, and about a list correlating 2nd and 3rd edition
problem numbers for problems which appear in both editions.

TO THE STUDENT

As you start each topic in this book, you will no doubt wonder and ask “Just why
should I study this subject and what use does it have in applications?” There is a
story about a young mathematics instructor who asked an older professor “What do
you say when students ask about the practical applications of some mathematical
topic?” The experienced professor said “I tell them!” This text tries to follow
that advice. However, you must on your part be reasonable in your request. It
is not possible in one book or course to cover both the mathematical methods
and very many detailed applications of them. You will have to be content with
some information as to the areas of application of each topic and some of the
simpler applications. In your later courses, you will then use these techniques in
more advanced applications. At that point you can concentrate on the physical
application instead of being distracted by learning new mathematical methods.

One point about your study of this material cannot be emphasized too strongly:
To use mathematics eﬀectively in applications, you need not just knowledge but skill.
Skill can be obtained only through practice. You can obtain a certain superﬁcial
knowledge of mathematics by listening to lectures, but you cannot obtain skill this
way. How many students have I heard say “It looks so easy when you do it,” or “I
understand it but I can’t do the problems!” Such statements show lack of practice
and consequent lack of skill. The only way to develop the skill necessary to use this
material in your later courses is to practice by solving many problems. Always study
with pencil and paper at hand. Don’t just read through a solved problem—try to
do it yourself! Then solve some similar ones from the problem set for that section,

xi

To the Student

trying to choose the most appropriate method from the solved examples. See the
Answers to Selected Problems and check your answers to any problems listed there.
If you meet an unfamiliar term, look for it in the Index (or in a dictionary if it is
nontechnical).

My students tell me that one of my most frequent comments to them is “You’re
working too hard.” There is no merit in spending hours producing a solution to
a problem that can be done by a better method in a few minutes. Please ignore
anyone who disparages problem-solving techniques as “tricks” or “shortcuts.” You
will ﬁnd that the more able you are to choose eﬀective methods of solving problems
in your science courses, the easier it will be for you to master new material. But
this means practice, practice, practice! The only way to learn to solve problems is
to solve problems. In this text, you will ﬁnd both drill problems and harder, more
challenging problems. You should not feel satisﬁed with your study of a chapter
until you can solve a reasonable number of these problems.

You may be thinking “I don’t really need to study this—my computer will solve
all these problems for me.” Now Computer Algebra Systems are wonderful—as you
know, they save you a lot of laborious calculation and quickly plot graphs which
clarify a problem. But a computer is a tool; you are the one in charge. A very
perceptive student recently said to me (about the use of a computer for a special
project): “First you learn how to do it; then you see what the computer can do
to make it easier.” Quite so! A very eﬀective way to study a new technique is to
do some simple problems by hand in order to understand the process, and compare
your results with a computer solution. You will then be better able to use the
method to set up and solve similar more complicated applied problems in your
advanced courses. So, in one problem set after another, I will remind you that the
point of solving some simple problems is not to get an answer (which a computer
will easily supply) but rather to learn the ideas and techniques which will be so
useful in your later courses.

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

1. THE GEOMETRIC SERIES

As a simple example of many of the ideas involved in series, we are going to consider
the geometric series. You may recall that in a geometric progression we multiply
each term by some ﬁxed number to get the next term. For example, the sequences

(1.1a)

(1.1b)

(1.1c)

2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . . ,
1, 2
8
81 , . . . ,
a, ar, ar2, ar3, . . . ,

27 , 16

3 , 4
9 ,

are geometric progressions. It is easy to think of examples of such progressions.
Suppose the number of bacteria in a culture doubles every hour. Then the terms of
(1.1a) represent the number by which the bacteria population has been multiplied
after 1 hr, 2 hr, and so on. Or suppose a bouncing ball rises each time to 2
3 of
the height of the previous bounce. Then (1.1b) would represent the heights of the
successive bounces in yards if the ball is originally dropped from a height of 1 yd.
In our ﬁrst example it is clear that the bacteria population would increase with-
out limit as time went on (mathematically, anyway; that is, assuming that nothing
like lack of food prevented the assumed doubling each hour). In the second example,
however, the height of bounce of the ball decreases with successive bounces, and we
might ask for the total distance the ball goes. The ball falls a distance 1 yd, rises
a distance 2
9 yd and falls a distance
4
9 yd, and so on. Thus it seems reasonable to write the following expression for the
total distance the ball goes:

3 yd and falls a distance 2

3 yd, rises a distance 4

where the three dots mean that the terms continue as they have started (each one
being 2
3 the preceding one), and there is never a last term. Let us consider the

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

This expression is an example of an inﬁnite series, and we are asked to ﬁnd its sum.
Not all inﬁnite series have sums; you can see that the series formed by adding the
terms in (1.1a) does not have a ﬁnite sum. However, even when an inﬁnite series
does have a ﬁnite sum, we cannot ﬁnd it by adding the terms because no matter
how many we add there are always more. Thus we must ﬁnd another method. (It
is actually deeper than this; what we really have to do is to deﬁne what we mean
by the sum of the series.)

Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the sum of n terms in (1.3). The formula (Problem 2) for the

sum of n terms of the geometric progression (1.1c) is

(1.4)

Sn =

a(1 − rn)
1 − r

.

Using (1.4) in (1.3), we ﬁnd

(1.5)

As n increases, ( 2
3 )n decreases and approaches zero. Then the sum of n terms
approaches 2 as n increases, and we say that the sum of the series is 2. (This is
really a deﬁnition: The sum of an inﬁnite series is the limit of the sum of n terms
as n → ∞.) Then from (1.2), the total distance traveled by the ball is 1 + 2 · 2 = 5.
This is an answer to a mathematical problem. A physicist might well object that
a bounce the size of an atom is nonsense! However, after a number of bounces, the
remaining inﬁnite number of small terms contribute very little to the ﬁnal answer
(see Problem 1). Thus it makes little diﬀerence (in our answer for the total distance)
whether we insist that the ball rolls after a certain number of bounces or whether
we include the entire series, and it is easier to ﬁnd the sum of the series than to ﬁnd
the sum of, say, twenty terms.

Series such as (1.3) whose terms form a geometric progression are called geo-

metric series. We can write a geometric series in the form

(1.6)

a + ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−1 + · · · .

The sum of the geometric series (if it has one) is by deﬁnition

(1.7)

S = lim

Sn,

where Sn is the sum of n terms of the series. By following the method of the exam-
ple above, you can show (Problem 2) that a geometric series has a sum if and only
if |r| < 1, and in this case the sum is

(1.8)

S =

using (1.8) may be simpler. (Also see Problem 14.)

Chapter 1

Suppose a large number of particles are bouncing back and forth between x = 0 and
x = 1, except that at each endpoint some escape. Let r be the fraction reﬂected
each time; then (1 − r) is the fraction escaping. Suppose the particles start at x = 0
heading toward x = 1; eventually all particles will escape. Write an inﬁnite series
for the fraction which escape at x = 1 and similarly for the fraction which escape at
x = 0. Sum both the series. What is the largest fraction of the particles which can
escape at x = 0? (Remember that r must be between 0 and 1.)

In general, an inﬁnite series means an expression of the form

(2.2)

a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an + · · · ,

where the an’s (one for each positive integer n) are numbers or functions given by
some formula or rule. The three dots in each case mean that the series never ends.
The terms continue according to the law of formation, which is supposed to be
evident to you by the time you reach the three dots. If there is apt to be doubt
about how the terms are formed, a general or nth term is written like this:

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

12 + 22 + 32 + · · · + n2 + · · · ,

x − x2 +

x3
2

+ · · · +

(−1)n−1xn
(n − 1)!

+ · · · .

(The quantity n!, read n factorial, means, for integral n, the product of all integers
from 1 to n; for example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120. The quantity 0! is deﬁned to be
1.) In (2.3a), it is easy to see without the general term that each term is just the
square of the number of the term, that is, n2. However, in (2.3b), if the formula for
the general term were missing, you could probably make several reasonable guesses
for the next term. To be sure of the law of formation, we must either know a good
many more terms or have the formula for the general term. You should verify that
the fourth term in (2.3b) is −x4/6.
(cid:7)

We can also write series in a shorter abbreviated form using a summation sign
followed by the formula for the nth term. For example, (2.3a) would be written

(2.4)

12 + 22 + 32 + 42 + · · · =

∞(cid:8)

(read “the sum of n2 from n = 1 to ∞”). The series (2.3b) would be written

For printing convenience, sums like (2.4) are often written

In Section 1, we have mentioned both sequences and series. The lists in (1.1)
are sequences; a sequence is simply a set of quantities, one for each n. A series is
an indicated sum of such quantities, as in (1.3) or (1.6). We will be interested in
various sequences related to a series: for example, the sequence an of terms of the
series, the sequence Sn of partial sums [see (1.5) and (4.5)], the sequence Rn [see
(4.7)], and the sequence ρn [see (6.2)]. In all these examples, we want to ﬁnd the
limit of a sequence as n → ∞ (if the sequence has a limit). Although limits can be
found by computer, many simple limits can be done faster by hand.

Example 1. Find the limit as n → ∞ of the sequence

(2n − 1)4 +

We divide numerator and denominator by n4 and take the limit as n → ∞. Then

Comment: Strictly speaking, we can’t diﬀerentiate a function of n if n is an integer,
but we can consider f (x) = (ln x)/x, and the limit of the sequence is the same as
the limit of f (x).

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

3. APPLICATIONS OF SERIES

In the example of the bouncing ball in Section 1, we saw that it is possible for the
sum of an inﬁnite series to be nearly the same as the sum of a fairly small number of
terms at the beginning of the series (also see Problem 1.1). Many applied problems
cannot be solved exactly, but we may be able to ﬁnd an answer in terms of an
inﬁnite series, and then use only as many terms as necessary to obtain the needed
accuracy. We shall see many examples of this both in this chapter and in later
chapters. Diﬀerential equations (see Chapters 8 and 12) and partial diﬀerential
equations (see Chapter 13) are frequently solved by using series. We will learn
how to ﬁnd series that represent functions; often a complicated function can be
approximated by a few terms of its series (see Section 15).

But there is more to the subject of inﬁnite series than making approximations.
We will see (Chapter 2, Section 8) how we can use power series (that is, series
whose terms are powers of x) to give meaning to functions of complex numbers,
and (Chapter 3, Section 6) how to deﬁne a function of a matrix using the power
series of the function. Also power series are just a ﬁrst example of inﬁnite series. In
Chapter 7 we will learn about Fourier series (whose terms are sines and cosines). In
Chapter 12, we will use power series to solve diﬀerential equations, and in Chapters
12 and 13, we will discuss other series such as Legendre and Bessel. Finally, in
Chapter 14, we will discover how a study of power series clariﬁes our understanding
of the mathematical functions we use in applications.

4. CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT SERIES

We have been talking about series which have a ﬁnite sum. We have also seen that
there are series which do not have ﬁnite sums, for example (2.1a). If a series has a
ﬁnite sum, it is called convergent. Otherwise it is called divergent. It is important
to know whether a series is convergent or divergent. Some weird things can happen
if you try to apply ordinary algebra to a divergent series. Suppose we try it with
the following series:

(4.1)

Then,

S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + · · · .

2S = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + · · · = S − 1,
S = −1.

This is obvious nonsense, and you may laugh at the idea of trying to operate with
such a violently divergent series as (4.1). But the same sort of thing can happen in
more concealed fashion, and has happened and given wrong answers to people who
were not careful enough about the way they used inﬁnite series. At this point you
probably would not recognize that the series

Convergent and Divergent Series

is convergent as it stands, but can be made to have any sum you like by combining
the terms in a diﬀerent order! (See Section 8.) You can see from these examples
how essential it is to know whether a series converges, and also to know how to
apply algebra to series correctly. There are even cases in which some divergent
series can be used (see Chapter 11), but in this chapter we shall be concerned with
convergent series.

Before we consider some tests for convergence, let us repeat the deﬁnition of
convergence more carefully. Let us call the terms of the series an so that the series
is

(4.4)

a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + · · · + an + · · · .

Remember that the three dots mean that there is never a last term; the series goes
on without end. Now consider the sums Sn that we obtain by adding more and
more terms of the series. We deﬁne

(4.5)

S1 = a1,
S2 = a1 + a2,
S3 = a1 + a2 + a3,

· · ·

Sn = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an.

Each Sn is called a partial sum; it is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the series. We
had an example of this for a geometric progression in (1.4). The letter n can be
any integer; for each n, Sn stops with the nth term. (Since Sn is not an inﬁnite
series, there is no question of convergence for it.) As n increases, the partial sums
may increase without any limit as in the series (2.1a). They may oscillate as in the
series 1 − 2 + 3− 4 + 5− · · · (which has partial sums 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, · · · ) or they may
have some more complicated behavior. One possibility is that the Sn’s may, after
a while, not change very much any more; the an’s may become very small, and the
Sn’s come closer and closer to some value S. We are particularly interested in this
case in which the Sn’s approach a limiting value, say

(4.6)

lim
n→∞

Sn = S.

(It is understood that S is a ﬁnite number.) If this happens, we make the following
deﬁnitions.

a. If the partial sums Sn of an inﬁnite series tend to a limit S, the series is called

convergent. Otherwise it is called divergent.

b. The limiting value S is called the sum of the series.

c. The diﬀerence Rn = S − Sn is called the remainder (or the remainder after n

terms). From (4.6), we see that

(4.7)

lim
n→∞

Rn = lim
n→∞

(S − Sn) = S − S = 0.

Then Sn = − ln(n + 1) which → −∞ as n → ∞, so the series diverges. However,
note that an = ln n
n+1 → ln 1 = 0 as n → ∞, so we see that even if the terms tend
to zero, a series may diverge.

Testing Series for Convergence; The Preliminary Test

5. TESTING SERIES FOR CONVERGENCE; THE PRELIMINARY TEST

It is not in general possible to write a simple formula for Sn and ﬁnd its limit as
n → ∞ (as we have done for a few special series), so we need some other way to ﬁnd
out whether a given series converges. Here we shall consider a few simple tests for
convergence. These tests will illustrate some of the ideas involved in testing series
for convergence and will work for a good many, but not all, cases. There are more
complicated tests which you can ﬁnd in other books. In some cases it may be quite
a diﬃcult mathematical problem to investigate the convergence of a complicated
series. However, for our purposes the simple tests we give here will be suﬃcient.

First we discuss a useful preliminary test. In most cases you should apply this

to a series before you use other tests.

Preliminary test.
if limn→∞ an (cid:4)= 0), the series diverges. If limn→∞ an = 0, we must test further.

If the terms of an inﬁnite series do not tend to zero (that is,

This is not a test forconvergence; what it does is to weed out some very badly
divergent series which you then do not have to spend time testing by more com-
plicated methods. Note carefully: The preliminary test can never tell you that a
series converges. It does not say that series converge if an → 0 and, in fact, often
they do not. A simple example is the harmonic series (4.2); the nth term certainly
n=1 1/n is divergent. On

6. CONVERGENCE TESTS FOR SERIES OF POSITIVE TERMS;

ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE

We are now going to consider four useful tests for series whose terms are all positive.
If some of the terms of a series are negative, we may still want to consider the related
series which we get by making all the terms positive; that is, we may consider the
series whose terms are the absolute values of the terms of our original series. If
this new series converges, we call the original series absolutely convergent. It can be
proved that if a series converges absolutely, then it converges (Problem 7.9). This
means that if the series of absolute values converges, the series is still convergent
when you put back the original minus signs. (The sum is diﬀerent, of course.) The
following four tests may be used, then, either for testing series of positive terms, or
for testing any series for absolute convergence.

A. The Comparison Test

This test has two parts, (a) and (b).

(a) Let

m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + · · ·

be a series of positive terms which you know converges. Then the series you are
testing, namely

a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + · · ·
is absolutely convergent if |an| ≤ mn (that is, if the absolute value of each term of
the a series is no larger than the corresponding term of the m series) for all n from
some point on, say after the third term (or the millionth term). See the example
and discussion below.

(b) Let

d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + · · ·

be a series of positive terms which you know diverges. Then the series

|a1| + |a2| + |a3| + |a4| + · · ·

diverges if |an| ≥ dn for all n from some point on.

Warning: Note carefully that neither |an| ≥ mn nor |an| ≤ dn tells us anything.
That is, if a series has terms larger than those of a convergent series, it may still
converge or it may diverge—we must test it further. Similarly, if a series has terms
smaller than those of a divergent series, it may still diverge, or it may converge.

of terms) in a series, because they can aﬀect the sum of the series but not whether

it converges. When we ask whether a series converges or not, we are asking what
happens as we add more and more terms for larger and larger n. Does the sum
increase indeﬁnitely, or does it approach a limit? What the ﬁrst ﬁve or hundred or
million terms are has no eﬀect on whether the sum eventually increases indeﬁnitely
or approaches a limit. Consequently we frequently ignore some of the early terms
in testing series for convergence.

In our example, the terms of

n=1 1/n! are smaller than the corresponding
n=1 1/2n for all n > 3 (Problem 1). We know that the geometric series

The comparison test is really the basic test from which other tests are derived.
It is probably the most useful test of all for the experienced mathematician but it
is often hard to think of a satisfactory m series until you have had a good deal of
experience with series. Consequently, you will probably not use it as often as the
next three tests.

B. The Integral Test

We can use this test when the terms of the series are positive and not increasing,
that is, when an+1 ≤ an. (Again remember that we can ignore any ﬁnite number of
terms of the series; thus the test can still be used even if the condition an+1 ≤ an
does not hold for a ﬁnite number of terms.) To apply the test we think of an as a

12

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

function of the variable n, and, forgetting our previous meaning of n, we allow it to
take all values, not just integral ones. The test states that:

If 0 < an+1 ≤ an for n > N , then
an dn is ﬁnite and
diverges if the integral is inﬁnite. (The integral is to be evaluated only at the
upper limit; no lower limit is needed.)

an converges if

(cid:7)∞

(cid:9) ∞

To understand this test, imagine a graph sketched of an as a function of n. For
(cid:7)∞
n=1 1/n, we consider the graph of the
example, in testing the harmonic series
function y = 1/n (similar to Figures 6.1 and 6.2) letting n have all values, not just
integral ones. Then the values of y on the graph at n = 1, 2, 3, · · · , are the terms
of the series. In Figures 6.1 and 6.2, the areas of the rectangles are just the terms
of the series. Notice that in Figure 6.1 the top edge of each rectangle is above
the curve, so that the area of the rectangles is greater than the corresponding area
under the curve. On the other hand, in Figure 6.2 the rectangles lie below the
curve, so their area is less than the corresponding area under the curve. Now the
areas of the rectangles are just the terms of the series, and the area under the curve
is an integral of y dn or an dn. The upper limit on the integrals is ∞ and the lower
limit could be made to correspond to any term of the series we wanted to start
(cid:9) ∞
3 an dn is less than the sum of the series from
with. For example (see Figure 6.1),
a3 on, but (see Figure 6.2) greater than the sum of the series from a4 on. If the
integral is ﬁnite, then the sum of the series from a4 on is ﬁnite, that is, the series
converges. Note again that the terms at the beginning of a series have nothing to
do with convergence. On the other hand, if the integral is inﬁnite, then the sum of
the series from a3 on is inﬁnite and the series diverges. Since the beginning terms
are of no interest, you should simply evaluate

an dn. (Also see Problem 16.)

C. The Ratio Test

The integral test depends on your being able to integrate andn; this is not always
easy! We consider another test which will handle many cases in which we cannot
evaluate the integral. Recall that in the geometric series each term could be obtained
by multiplying the one before it by the ratio r, that is, an+1 = ran or an+1/an = r.
For other series the ratio an+1/an is not constant but depends on n; let us call
the absolute value of this ratio ρn. Let us also ﬁnd the limit (if there is one) of
the sequence ρn as n → ∞ and call this limit ρ. Thus we deﬁne ρn and ρ by the
equations

If you recall that a geometric series converges if |r| < 1, it may seem plausible that
a series with ρ < 1 should converge and this is true. This statement can be proved
(Problem 30) by comparing the series to be tested with a geometric series. Like a ge-
ometric series with |r| > 1, a series with ρ > 1 also diverges (Problem 30). However,
if ρ = 1, the ratio test does not tell us anything; some series with ρ = 1 converge

14

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

and some diverge, so we must ﬁnd another test (say one of the two preceding tests).
To summarize the ratio test:

Here the test tells us nothing and we must use some diﬀerent test. A word of
warning from this example: Notice that ρn = n/(n + 1) is always less than 1. Be
careful not to confuse this ratio with ρ and conclude incorrectly that this series
converges. (It is actually divergent as we proved by the integral test.) Remember
that ρ is not the same as the ratio ρn = |an+1/an|, but is the limit of this ratio as
n → ∞.

D. A Special Comparison Test

This test has two parts: (a) a convergence test, and (b) a divergence test. (See
Problem 37.)

(cid:7)∞

(cid:7)∞

(a) If

n=1 bn is a convergent series of positive terms and an ≥ 0 and an/bn

(cid:7)∞

tends to a (ﬁnite) limit, then

n=1 an converges.

(b) If

n=1 dn is a divergent series of positive terms and an ≥ 0 and an/dn

tends to a limit greater than 0 (or tends to +∞), then

n=1 an diverges.

(cid:7)∞

There are really two steps in using either of these tests, namely, to decide on a
comparison series, and then to compute the required limit. The ﬁrst part is the most
important; given a good comparison series it is a routine process to ﬁnd the needed
limit. The method of ﬁnding the comparison series is best shown by examples.

Remember that whether a series converges or diverges depends on what the
terms are as n becomes larger and larger. We are interested in the nth term as
n → ∞. Think of n = 1010 or 10100, say; a little calculation should convince you
that as n increases, 2n2 − 5n + 1 is 2n2 to quite high accuracy. Similarly, the
denominator in our example is nearly 4n3 for large n. By Section 9, fact 1, we see
2/4 in every term does not aﬀect convergence. So we consider as

Since this is a ﬁnite limit, the given series converges. (With practice, you won’t

see that, for large n, the terms are essentially 1/n2, so the series converges.)

Example 2. Test for convergence

Here we must ﬁrst decide which is the important term as n → ∞; is it 3n or
n3? We can ﬁnd out by comparing their logarithms since ln N and N increase or
decrease together. We have ln 3n = n ln 3, and ln n3 = 3 ln n. Now ln n is much
smaller than n, so for large n we have n ln 3 > 3 ln n, and 3n > n3. (You might like
to compute 1003 = 106, and 3100 > 5 × 1047.) The denominator of the given series
is approximately n5. Thus the comparison series is
n=2 3n/n5. It is easy to prove
this divergent by the ratio test. Now by test (b)

7. ALTERNATING SERIES

So far we have been talking about series of positive terms (including series of abso-
lute values). Now we want to consider one important case of a series whose terms

is the harmonic series (6.1), which diverges. We say that the series (7.1) is not
absolutely convergent. Next we must ask whether (7.1) converges as it stands. If it
had turned out to be absolutely convergent, we would not have to ask this question
since an absolutely convergent series is also convergent (Problem 9). However, a
series which is not absolutely convergent may converge or it may diverge; we must
test it further. For alternating series the test is very simple:

Test for alternating series. An alternating series converges if the absolute
if |an+1| ≤ |an| and
value of the terms decreases steadily to zero, that is,
limn→∞ an = 0.

8. CONDITIONALLY CONVERGENT SERIES

A serieslike (7.1) which converges, but does not converge absolutely, is called con-
ditionally convergent. You have to use special care in handling conditionally con-
vergent series because the positive terms alone form a divergent series and so do
the negative terms alone. If you rearrange the terms, you will probably change the
sum of the series, and you may even make it diverge! It is possible to rearrange the
terms to make the sum any number you wish. Let us do this with the alternating
harmonic series 1 − 1
4 + · · · . Suppose we want to make the sum equal to
1.5. First we take enough positive terms to add to just over 1.5. The ﬁrst three
positive terms do this:

3 − 1

2 + 1

1 +

1
3

+

1
5

= 1

8
15

> 1.5.

Then we take enough negative terms to bring the partial sum back under 1.5; the
one term − 1
2 does this. Again we add positive terms until we have a little more than
1.5, and so on. Since the terms of the series are decreasing in absolute value, we are
able (as we continue this process) to get partial sums just a little more or a little less
than 1.5 but always nearer and nearer to 1.5. But this is what convergence of the
series to the sum 1.5 means: that the partial sums should approach 1.5. You should
see that we could pick in advance any sum that we want, and rearrange the terms
of this series to get it. Thus, we must not rearrange the terms of a conditionally
convergent series since its convergence and its sum depend on the fact that the
terms are added in a particular order.

Here is a physical example of such a series which emphasizes the care needed
in applying mathematical approximations in physical problems. Coulomb’s law
in electricity says that the force between two charges is equal to the product of
the charges divided by the square of the distance between them (in electrostatic
units; to use other units, say SI, we need only multiply by a numerical constant).
8, · · · , and unit
Suppose there are unit positive charges at x = 0,
4,
7, · · · . We want to know the total force acting
negative charges at x = 1,
on the unit positive charge at x = 0 due to all the other charges. The negative
charges attract the charge at x = 0 and try to pull it to the right; we call the
forces exerted by them positive, since they are in the direction of the positive x
axis. The forces due to the positive charges are in the negative x direction, and we
call them negative. For example, the force due to the positive charge at x =
2 is
− (1 · 1) /

= −1/2. The total force on the charge at x = 0 is, then,

+ · · · .

Now we know that this series converges as it stands (Section 7). But we have also
seen that its sum (even the fact that it converges) can be changed by rearranging
the terms. Physically this means that the force on the charge at the origin depends
not only on the size and position of the charges, but also on the order in which we
place them in their positions! This may very well go strongly against your physical
intuition. You feel that a physical problem like this should have a deﬁnite answer.
Think of it this way. Suppose there are two crews of workers, one crew placing the
positive charges and one placing the negative. If one crew works faster than the
other, it is clear that the force at any stage may be far from the F of equation (8.1)
because there are many extra charges of one sign. The crews can never place all the

Section 9

Useful Facts About Series

19

charges because there are an inﬁnite number of them. At any stage the forces which
would arise from the positive charges that are not yet in place, form a divergent
series; similarly, the forces due to the unplaced negative charges form a divergent
series of the opposite sign. We cannot then stop at some point and say that the
rest of the series is negligible as we could in the bouncing ball problem in Section
1. But if we specify the order in which the charges are to be placed, then the sum
S of the series is determined (S is probably diﬀerent from F in (8.1) unless the
charges are placed alternately). Physically this means that the value of the force
as the crews proceed comes closer and closer to S, and we can use the sum of the
(properly arranged) inﬁnite series as a good approximation to the force.

9. USEFUL FACTS ABOUT SERIES

We state the following facts for reference:

1. The convergence or divergence of a series is not aﬀected by multiplying every
term of the series by the same nonzero constant. Neither is it aﬀected by
changing a ﬁnite number of terms (for example, omitting the ﬁrst few terms).
(cid:7)∞

n=1 bn may be added (or subtracted)
term by term. (Adding “term by term” means that the nth term of the sum
is an + bn.) The resulting series is convergent, and its sum is obtained by
adding (subtracting) the sums of the two given series.

n=1 an and

2. Two convergent series

(cid:7)∞

3. The terms of an absolutely convergent series may be rearranged in any order
without aﬀecting either the convergence or the sum. This is not true of
conditionally convergent series as we have seen in Section 8.

10. POWER SERIES; INTERVAL OF CONVERGENCE

We have been discussing series whose terms were constants. Even more important
and useful are series whose terms are functions of x. There are many such series,
but in this chapter we shall consider series in which the nth term is a constant times
xn or a constant times (x − a)n where a is a constant. These are called power series,
because the terms are multiples of powers of x or of (x − a). In later chapters we
shall consider Fourier series whose terms involve sines and cosines, and other series
(Legendre, Bessel, etc.) in which the terms may be polynomials or other functions.

By deﬁnition, a power series is of the form

∞(cid:8)

anxn = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · ·

or

Whether a power series converges or not depends on the value of x we are
considering. We often use the ratio test to ﬁnd the values of x for which a series
converges. We illustrate this by testing each of the four series (10.2). Recall that
in the ratio test we divide term n + 1 by term n and take the absolute value of this
ratio to get ρn, and then take the limit of ρn as n → ∞ to get ρ.

Power Series; Interval of Convergence

21

The series converges for ρ < 1, that is, for |x/2| < 1 or |x| < 2, and it diverges
for |x| > 2 (see Problem 6.30). Graphically we consider the interval on the x axis
between x = −2 and x = 2; for any x in this interval the series (10.2a) converges.
The endpoints of the interval, x = 2 and x = −2, must be considered separately.
When x = 2, (10.2a) is

1 − 1 + 1− 1 + · · · ,
which is divergent; when x = −2, (10.2a) is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · , which is divergent.
Then the interval of convergence of (10.2a) is stated as −2 < x < 2.

The series converges for |x| < 1. Again we must consider the endpoints of the
interval of convergence, x = 1 and x = −1. For x = 1, the series (10.2b) is
1 − 1
3 − 1
4 + · · · ; this is the alternating harmonic series and is convergent. For
x = −1, (10.2b) is −1 − 1
4 − · · · ; this is the harmonic series (times −1) and
is divergent. Then we state the interval of convergence of (10.2b) as −1 < x ≤ 1.
Notice carefully how this diﬀers from our result for (10.2a). Series (10.2a) did not
converge at either endpoint and we used only < signs in stating its interval of
convergence. Series (10.2b) converges at x = 1, so we use the sign ≤ to include
x = 1. You must always test a series at its endpoints and include the results in your
statement of the interval of convergence. A series may converge at neither, either
one, or both of the endpoints.

Example 3.

In (10.2c), the absolute value of the nth term is |x2n−1/(2n − 1)!|. To get
term n + 1 we replace n by n + 1; then 2n − 1 is replaced by 2(n + 1) − 1 = 2n + 1,
and the absolute value of term n + 1 is

11. THEOREMS ABOUT POWER SERIES
(cid:7)∞

(cid:7)∞

n=0 anxn converges in some interval with center
We have seen that a power series
at the origin. For each value of x (in the interval of convergence) the series has a
ﬁnite sum whose value depends, of course, on the value of x. Thus we can write the
n=0 anxn. We see then that a power series (within
sum of the series as S(x) =
its interval of convergence) deﬁnes a function of x, namely S(x). In describing the
relation of the series and the function S(x), we may say that the series converges
to the function S(x), or that the function S(x) is represented by the series, or that
the series is the power series of the function. Here we have thought of obtaining
the function from a given series. We shall also (Section 12) be interested in ﬁnding
a power series that converges to a given function. When we are working with
power series and the functions they represent, it is useful to know the following
theorems (which we state without proof; see advanced calculus texts). Power series
are very useful and convenient because within their interval of convergence they can
be handled much like polynomials.

1. A power series may be diﬀerentiated or integrated term by term; the resulting
series converges to the derivative or integral of the function represented by the
original series within the same interval of convergence as the original series
(that is, not necessarily at the endpoints of the interval).

2. Two power series may be added, subtracted, or multiplied; the resultant series
converges at least in the common interval of convergence. You may divide two
series if the denominator series is not zero at x = 0, or if it is and the zero
is canceled by the numerator [as, for example, in (sin x)/x; see (13.1)]. The
resulting series will have some interval of convergence (which can be found
by the ratio test or more simply by complex variable theory—see Chapter 2,
Section 7).

3. One series may be substituted in another provided that the values of the

substituted series are in the interval of convergence of the other series.

4. The power series of a function is unique, that is, there is just one power series
n=0 anxn which converges to a given function.

12. EXPANDING FUNCTIONS IN POWER SERIES

Very often in applied work, it is useful to ﬁnd power series that represent given
functions. We illustrate one method of obtaining such series by ﬁnding the series
for sin x. In this method we assume that there is such a series (see Section 14 for
discussion of this point) and set out to ﬁnd what the coeﬃcients in the series must
be. Thus we write

(12.1)

sin x = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn + · · ·

and try to ﬁnd numerical values of the coeﬃcients an to make (12.1) an identity
(within the interval of convergence of the series). Since the interval of convergence
of a power series contains the origin, (12.1) must hold when x = 0. If we substitute
x = 0 into (12.1), we get 0 = a0 since sin 0 = 0 and all the terms except a0 on the

24

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

right-hand side of the equation contain the factor x. Then to make (12.1) valid at
x = 0, we must have a0 = 0. Next we diﬀerentiate (12.1) term by term to get

(12.2)

cos x = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + · · · .

(This is justiﬁed by Theorem 1 of Section 11.) Again putting x = 0, we get 1 = a1.
We diﬀerentiate again, and put x = 0 to get

(12.3)

− sin x = 2a2 + 3· 2a3x + 4· 3a4x2 + · · · ,

0 = 2a2.

Continuing the process of taking successive derivatives of (12.1) and putting x = 0,
we get

− cos x = 3 · 2a3 + 4· 3 · 2a4x + · · · ,

(12.4)

−1 = 3! a3,

a3 = − 1

0 = a4;

cos x = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2a5 + · · · ,

1 = 5! a5, · · · .

We substitute these values back into (12.1) and get

(12.5)

− · · · .

You can probably see how to write more terms of this series without further com-
putation. The sin x series converges for all x; see Example 3, Section 10.

Series obtained in this way are called Maclaurin series or Taylor series about
the origin. A Taylor series in general means a series of powers of (x − a), where a is
some constant. It is found by writing (x − a) instead of x on the right-hand side of
an equation like (12.1), diﬀerentiating just as we have done, but substituting x = a
instead of x = 0 at each step. Let us carry out this process in general for a function
f (x). As above, we assume that there is a Taylor series for f (x), and write

(12.6)

f (x) = a0 + a1(x − a) + a2(x − a)2 + a3(x − a)3 + a4(x − a)4 + · · ·

+ an(x − a)n + · · · ,

f (cid:3)(x) = a1 + 2a2(x − a) + 3a3(x − a)2 + 4a4(x − a)3 + · · ·

+ nan(x − a)n−1 + · · · ,

f (cid:3)(cid:3)(x) = 2a2 + 3· 2a3(x − a) + 4 · 3a4(x − a)2 + · · ·
+ n(n − 1)an(x − a)n−2 + · · · ,

f (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(x) = 3! a3 + 4· 3 · 2a4(x − a) + · · ·

+ n(n − 1)(n − 2)an(x − a)n−3 + · · · ,
...

f (n)(x) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 1 · an + terms containing powers of (x − a).

Section 13

Techniques for Obtaining Power Series Expansions

25

[The symbol f (n)(x) means the nth derivative of f (x).] We now put x = a in each
equation of (12.6) and obtain

(12.7)

f (a) = a0,

f (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(a) = 3! a3,

f (cid:3)(a) = a1,

f (cid:3)(cid:3)(a) = 2a2,
· · · , f (n)(a) = n! an.

[Remember that f (cid:3)(a) means to diﬀerentiate f (x) and then put x = a; f (cid:3)(cid:3)(a) means
to ﬁnd f (cid:3)(cid:3)(x) and then put x = a, and so on.]

We can then write the Taylor series for f (x) about x = a:

(12.8) f (x) = f (a) + (x − a)f (cid:3)(a) +

(x − a)2f (cid:3)(cid:3)(a) + · · · +

1
2!

1
n!

(x − a)nf (n)(a) + · · · .

The Maclaurin series for f (x) is the Taylor series about the origin. Putting

a = 0 in (12.8), we obtain the Maclaurin series for f (x):

(12.9)

f (x) = f (0) + xf (cid:3)(0) +

f (n)(0) + · · · .

We have written this in general because it is sometimes convenient to have the
formulas for the coeﬃcients. However, ﬁnding the higher order derivatives in (12.9)
for any but the simplest functions is unnecessarily complicated (try it for, say, etan x).
In Section 13, we shall discuss much easier ways of getting Maclaurin and Taylor
series by combining a few basic series. Meanwhile, you should verify (Problem 1,
below) the basic series (13.1) to (13.5) and memorize them.

PROBLEMS, SECTION 12

1. By the method used to obtain (12.5) [which is the series (13.1) below], verify each

of the other series (13.2) to (13.5) below.

13. TECHNIQUES FOR OBTAINING POWER SERIES EXPANSIONS

(cid:7)∞

There are often simpler ways for ﬁnding the power series of a function than the
successive diﬀerentiation process in Section 12. Theorem 4 in Section 11 tells us
that for a given function there is just one power series, that is, just one series of the
n=0 anxn. Therefore we can obtain it by any correct method and be sure
form
that it is the same Maclaurin series we would get by using the method of Section
12. We shall illustrate a variety of methods for obtaining power series. First of all,
it is a great timesaver for you to verify (Problem 12.1) and then memorize the basic
series (13.1) to (13.5). We shall use these series without further derivation when we
need them.

When we use a series to approximate a function, we may want only the ﬁrst few
terms, but in derivations, we may want the formula for the general term so that we
can write the series in summation form. Let’s look at some methods of obtaining
either or both of these results.

A. Multiplying a Series by a Polynomial or by Another Series

Example 1. To ﬁnd the series for (x + 1) sin x, we multiply (x + 1) times the series (13.1)

There are two points to note here. First, as you multiply, line up the terms
involving each power of x in a column; this makes it easier to combine them. Second,
be careful to include all the terms in the product out to the power you intend to
stop with, but don’t include any higher powers. In the above example, note that
we did not include the x3 · x2 terms; if we wanted the x5 term in the answer, we
would have to include all products giving x5 (namely, x · x4, x3 · x2, and x5 · 1).

Also see Chapter 2, Problem 17.30, for a simple way of getting the general term

of this series.

B. Division of Two Series or of a Series by a Polynomial

C. Binomial Series

If you recall the binomial theorem, you may see that (13.5) looks just like the
beginning of the binomial theorem for the expansion of (a + b)n if we put a = 1,
b = x, and n = p. The diﬀerence here is that we allow p to be negative or fractional,
and in these cases the expansion is an inﬁnite series. The series converges for |x| < 1
as you can verify by the ratio test. (See Problem 1.)

From (13.5), we see that the binomial coeﬃcients are:

rized Maclaurin series instead of the formulas or method of Section 12.

Example 1. Find the ﬁrst few terms of the Taylor series for ln x about x = 1. [This means

a series of powers of (x − 1) rather than powers of x.] We write

and use (13.4) with x replaced by (x − 1):

G. Using a Computer

You can also do problems like these using a computer. This is a good method
for complicated functions where it saves you a lot of algebra. However, you’re not
saving time if it takes longer to type a problem into the computer than to do it
in your head! For example, you should be able to just write down the ﬁrst few
terms of (sin x)/x or (1 − cos x)/x2. A good method of study is to practice doing
problems by hand and also check your results using the computer. This will turn
up errors you are making by hand, and also let you discover what the computer
will do and what it won’t do! It is very illuminating to computer plot the function
you are expanding, along with several partial sums of the series, in order to see how
accurately the partial sums represent the function—see the following example.

Accuracy of Series Approximations

14. ACCURACY OF SERIES APPROXIMATIONS

The thoughtful student might well be disturbed about the mathematical manipula-
tions we have been doing. How do we know whether these processes we have shown
really give us series that approximate the functions being expanded? Certainly some
functions cannot be expanded in a power series; since a power series becomes just
a0 when x = 0, it cannot be equal to any function (like 1/x or ln x) which is inﬁnite
at the origin. So we might ask whether there are other functions (besides those that
become inﬁnite at the origin) which cannot be expanded in a power series. All we
have done so far is to show methods of ﬁnding the power series for a function if it
has one. Now is there a chance that there might be some functions which do not
have series expansions, but for which our formal methods would give us a spurious
series? Unfortunately, the answer is “Yes”; fortunately, this is not a very common
diﬃculty in practice. However, you should know of the possibility and what to do
about it. You may ﬁrst think of the fact that, say, the equation

1
1 + x

= 1 − x + x2 − x3 + · · ·

is not valid for |x| ≥ 1. This is a fairly easy restriction to determine; from the
beginning we recognized that we could use our series expansions only when they
converged. But there is another diﬃculty which can arise.
It is possible for a
series found by the above methods to converge and still not represent the function
being expanded! A simple example of this is e−(1/x2) for which the formal series is
0 + 0 + 0 + · · · because e−(1/x2) and all its derivatives are zero at the origin (Problem
15.26). It is clear that e−(1/x2) is not zero for x2 > 0, so the series is certainly not
correct. You can startle your friends with the following physical interpretation of
this. Suppose that at t = 0 a car is at rest (zero velocity), and has zero acceleration,
zero rate of change of acceleration, etc. (all derivatives of distance with respect to
time are zero at t = 0). Then according to Newton’s second law (force equals mass
times acceleration), the instantaneous force acting on the car is also zero (and, in
fact, so are all the derivatives of the force). Now we ask “Is it possible for the car
to be moving immediately after t = 0?” The answer is “Yes”! For example, let its
distance from the origin as a function of time be e−(1/t2).

This strange behavior is really the fault of the function itself and not of our
method of ﬁnding series. The most satisfactory way of avoiding the diﬃculty is to
recognize, by complex variable theory, when functions can or cannot have power
series. We shall consider this in Chapter 14, Section 2. Meanwhile, let us consider
two important questions: (1) Does the Taylor or Maclaurin series in (12.8) or (12.9)
actually converge to the function being expanded? (2) In a computation problem, if
we know that a series converges to a given function, how rapidly does it converge?
That is, how many terms must we use to get the accuracy we require? We take up
these questions in order.

The remainder Rn(x) in a Taylor series is the diﬀerence between the value of

the function and the sum of n + 1 terms of the series:

(14.1) Rn(x) = f (x) −

f (a) + (x − a)f (cid:3)(a) +

1
n!

34

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

Saying that the series converges to the function means that limn→∞ |Rn(x)| = 0.
There are many diﬀerent formulas for Rn(x) which are useful for special purposes;
you can ﬁnd these in calculus books. One such formula is

(14.2)

Rn(x) =

(x − a)n+1f (n+1)(c)
(n + 1)!

where c is some point between a and x. You can use this formula in some simple
cases to prove that the Taylor or Maclaurin series for a function does converge to
the function (Problems 11 to 13).

Error in Series Approximations Now suppose that we know in advance that
the power series of a function does converge to the function (within the interval
of convergence), and we want to use a series approximation for the function. We
would like to estimate the error caused by using only a few terms of the series.

There is an easy way to estimate this error when the series is alternating and
meets the alternating series test for convergence (Section 7). In this case the error
is (in absolute value) less than the absolute value of the ﬁrst neglected term (see
Problem 1).

If S =

∞(cid:8)

n=1

(14.3)

an is an alternating series with |an+1| < |an|,

and lim
n→∞

an = 0, then |S − (a1 + a2 + · · · + an)| ≤ |an+1|.

Example 1. Consider the series

+

The sum of this series [see (1.8), a = 1, r = − 1

than the next term = 1

64 = 0.015+.

Estimating the error by the ﬁrst neglected term may be quite misleading for

convergent series that are not alternating.

(cid:7)∞

Example 2. Suppose we approximate

n=1 1/n2 by the sum of the ﬁrst ﬁve terms; the
error is then about 0.18 [see problem 2(a)]. But the ﬁrst neglected term is 1/62 =
0.028 which is much less than the error. However, note that we are ﬁnding the sum
n=1 xn/n2 when x = 1, which is the largest x for which the
of the power series
series converges. If, instead, we ask for the sum of the series when x = 1/2, we ﬁnd
[see Problem 2(b)]:

The sum of the ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the series is 0.5815+, so the error is about 0.0007.
The next term is ( 1
6 )2/62 = 0.0004, which is less than the error but still of the

same order of magnitude. We can state the following theorem [Problem 2(c)] which
covers many practical problems.

If S =

That is, as in (14.3), the error may be estimated by the ﬁrst neglected term, but
here the error may be a few times as large as the ﬁrst neglected term instead of
xn/n2 with x = 1
smaller. In the example of
2 , so (14.4)
says that the error is less than two times the next term. We observe that the error
0.0007 is less than 2(0.0004) as (14.4) says.

2 , we have 1 − x = 1

(cid:7)

For values of |x| much less than 1, 1 − |x| is about 1, so the next term gives a
good error estimate in this case. If the interval of convergence is not |x| < 1, but,
for example, |x| < 2 as in

15. SOME USES OF SERIES

In this chapter we are going to consider a few rather straightforward uses of series.
In later chapters there will also be many other cases where we need them.

Numerical Computation With computers and calculators so available, you may
wonder why we would ever want to use series for numerical computation. Here is
an example to warn you of the pitfalls of blind computation.

Example 1. Evaluate f (x) = ln

(cid:21)

(1 + x)/(1 − x) − tan x at x = 0.0015.

Here are answers from several calculators and computers: −9 × 10−16, 3 ×
10−10, 6.06 × 10−16, 5.5 × 10−16. All of these are wrong! Let’s use series to see
what’s going on. By Section 13 methods we ﬁnd, for x = 0.0015:

(1 + x)/(1 − x) = x +

f (x) =

with an error of the order of x7 or 10−21. Now we see that the answer is the
diﬀerence of two numbers which are identical until the 16th decimal place, so any
computer carrying fewer digits will lose all accuracy in the subtraction. It may also
be necessary to tell your computer that the value of x is an exact number and not
a 4 decimal place approximation. The moral here is that a computer is a tool—a
very useful tool, yes—but you need to be constantly aware of whether an answer
is reasonable when you are doing problems either by hand or by computer. A ﬁnal
point is that in an applied problem you may want, not a numerical value, but a
simple approximation for a complicated function. Here we might approximate f (x)
by x5/15 for small x.

We can do this by computer, but it’s probably faster to use sin x2 = x2−(x2)3/3! · · · ,
and observe that when we divide this by x and take 5 derivatives, the x2 term is
gone. The second term divided by x is an x5 term and the ﬁfth derivative of x5 is
5!. Any further terms will have a power of x which is zero at x = 0. Thus we have

anxn, and we let x have a particular

value (within the interval of convergence), then we get a numerical series whose
sum is the value of the function for that x. For example, if we substitute x = 1 in

We can also ﬁnd sums of series from tables or computer, either the exact sum
if that is known, or a numerical approximation (see Problems 20 to 22, and also
Problems 14.2, 16.1, 16.30, and 16.31).

Integrals By Theorem 1 of Section 11, we may integrate a power series term
by term. Then we can ﬁnd an approximation for an integral when the indeﬁnite
integral cannot be found in terms of elementary functions. As an example, consider
the Fresnel integrals (integrals of sin x2 and cos x2) which occur in the problem of
Fresnel diﬀraction in optics. We ﬁnd

Inﬁnite Series, Power Series

Chapter 1

You may recall L’Hˆopital’s rule which says that

lim
x→a

f (x)
φ(x)

= lim
x→a

f (cid:3)(x)
φ(cid:3)(x)

when f (a) andφ (a) are bothzero, and f (cid:3)/φ(cid:3) approaches a limit or tends to inﬁnity
(that is, does not oscillate) as x → a. Let’s use power series to see why this is true.
We consider functions f (x) andφ (x) which are expandable in a Taylor series about
x = a, and assume that φ(cid:3)(a) (cid:4)= 0. Using (12.8), we have

lim
x→a

f (x)
φ(x)

= lim
x→a

f (a) + (x − a)f (cid:3)(a) + (x − a)2f (cid:3)(cid:3)(a)/2! + · · ·
φ(a) + (x − a)φ(cid:3)(a) + (x − a)2φ(cid:3)(cid:3)(a)/2! + · · ·

.

If f (a) = 0 and φ(a) = 0, and we cancel one (x − a) factor, this becomes

lim
x→a

f (cid:3)(a) + (x − a)f (cid:3)(cid:3)(a)/2! + · · ·
φ(cid:3)(a) + (x − a)φ(cid:3)(cid:3)(a)/2! + · · · =

f (cid:3)(a)
φ(cid:3)(a)

= lim
x→a

f (cid:3)(x)
φ(cid:3)(x)

as L’Hˆopital’s rule says. If f (cid:3)(a) = 0 and φ(cid:3)(a) = 0, and φ(cid:3)(cid:3)(a) (cid:4)= 0, then a repetition
of the rule gives the limit as f (cid:3)(cid:3)(a)/φ(cid:3)(cid:3)(a), and so on.

There are other indeterminate forms besides 0/0, for example, ∞/∞, 0 · ∞,
etc. L’Hˆopital’s rule holds for the ∞/∞ form as well as the 0/0 form. Series are
most useful for the 0/0 form or others which can easily be put into the 0/0 form.
For example, the limit limx→0(1/x) sin x is an ∞ · 0 form, but is easily written as
limx→0(sin x)/x which is a 0/0 form. Also note carefully: Series (of powers of x) are
useful mainly in ﬁnding limits as x → 0, because for x = 0 such a series collapses
to the constant term; for any other value of x we have an inﬁnite series whose sum
we probably do not know (see Problem 25, however).

Series Approximations When a problem in, say, diﬀerential equations or physics
is too diﬃcult in its exact form, we often can get an approximate answer by replac-
ing one or more of the functions in the problem by a few terms of its inﬁnite series.
We shall illustrate this idea by two examples.

Example 3.

In elementary physics we ﬁnd that the equation of motion of a simple pen-

dulum is (see Chapter 11, Section 8, or a physics textbook):

d2θ
dt2 = − g

l

sin θ.

This diﬀerential equation cannot be solved for θ in terms of elementary functions
(see Chapter 11, Section 8), and you may recall that what is usually done is to
approximate sin θ by θ. Recall the inﬁnite series (13.1) for sin θ; θ is simply the ﬁrst
term of the series for sin θ. (Remember that θ is in radians; see discussion in Chapter
2, end of Section 3.) For small values of θ (say θ < 1
2 radian or about 30◦), this
series converges rapidly, and using the ﬁrst term gives a good approximation (see
Problem 14.4). The solutions of the diﬀerential equation are then θ = A sin
g/l t
and θ = B cos
g/l t (A and B constants) as you can verify; we say that the
pendulum is executing simple harmonic motion (see Chapter 7, Section 2).

Some Uses of Series

Example 4. Let us consider a radioactive substance containing N0 atoms at t = 0. It is
known that the number of atoms remaining at a later time t is given by the formula
(see Chapter 8, Section 3):

(15.1)

N = N0e−λt

where λ is a constant which is characteristic of the radioactive substance. To ﬁnd λ
for a given substance, a physicist measures in the laboratory the number of decays
∆N during the time interval ∆t for a succession of ∆t intervals. It is customary
to plot each value of ∆N/∆t at the midpoint of the corresponding time interval
∆t. If λ ∆t is small, this graph is a good approximation to the exact dN/dt graph.
A better approximation can be obtained by plotting ∆N/∆t a little to the left of
the midpoint. Let us show that the midpoint does give a good approximation and
also ﬁnd the more accurate t value. (An approximate value of λ, good enough for
calculating the correction, is assumed known from a rough preliminary graph.)

What we should like to plot is the
graph of dN/dt, that is, the graph of the
slope of the curve in Figure 15.1. What
we measure is the value of ∆N/∆t for
each ∆t interval. Consider one such ∆t
interval in Figure 15.1, from t1 to t2.
To get an accurate graph we should plot
the measured value of the quotient
∆N/∆t at the point between t1 and t2
where ∆N/∆t = dN/dt. Let us write
this condition and ﬁnd the t which sat-
isﬁes it. The quantity ∆N is the change
in N , that is, N (t2) − N (t1); the value
of dN/dt we get from (15.1). Then
dN/dt = ∆N/∆t becomes

−λN0e−λt =

Multiplying this equation by (∆t/N0)eλ(t1+t2)/2, we get

(15.3)

−λ ∆t e−λ[t−(t1+t2)/2] = e−λ(t2−t1)/2 − eλ(t2−t1)/2 = e−λ ∆t/2 − eλ ∆t/2

since t2 − t1 = ∆t. Since we assumed λ ∆t to be small, we can expand the expo-
nentials on the right-hand side of (15.3) in power series; this gives

where m is the electron mass, and c is the speed of light. The factor mc2 is called
the rest mass energy (energy when v = 0). Find two terms of the series expansion
of (1 − v2/c2)−1/2, and multiply by mc2 to get the energy at speed v. What is the
second term in the energy series? (If v/c is very small, the rest of the series can be
neglected; this is true for everyday speeds.)

29. The ﬁgure shows a heavy weight suspended by a cable and pulled

large coins), one meter apart and of negligible thickness. The radius of the disk at
height n is 1/(n ln n) (n ≥ 2).

Assuming that the tower is of inﬁnite height:

(a) Will the total area of the disks be ﬁnite or not? Hint: Can you compare the

series with a simpler one?

(b)

If the disks are strengthened by wires going around their circumferences like
tires, will the total length of wire required be ﬁnite or not?

(c) Explain why there is not a contradiction between your answers in (a) and (b).
That is, how is it possible to start with a set of disks of ﬁnite area, remove a
little strip around the circumference of each, and get an inﬁnite total length
of these strips? Hint: Think about units—you can’t compare area and length.
Consider two cases: (1) Make the width of each strip equal to one percent of
the radius of the disk from which you cut it. Now the total length is inﬁnite
but what about the total area? (2) Try to make the strips all the same width;
what happens? Also see Chapter 5, Problem 3.31(b).

Show that the “doubling time” (time for your money to double) is n periods at

number of years; it can be the number of months with i = interest rate per month,
etc.) Hint: You want (1 + i/100)n = 2; take ln of both sides of this equation and
use equation (13.4). Also see theorem (14.3).

If you are at the top of a tower of height h above the surface

Show that it is possible to stack a pile of identical books so that the top book
is as far as you like to the right of the bottom book. Start at the top and
each time place the pile already completed on top of another book so that
the pile is just at the point of tipping. (In practice, of course, you can’t let
them overhang quite this much without having the stack topple. Try it with

a deck of cards.) Find the distance from the right-hand end of each book to
the right-hand end of the one beneath it. To ﬁnd a general formula for this
distance, consider the three forces acting on book n, and write the equation for
the torque about its right-hand end. Show that the sum of these setbacks is a
divergent series (proportional to the harmonic series). [See “Leaning Tower of
The Physical Reviews,” Am. J. Phys. 27, 121–122 (1959).]

top) the top book is completely to the right of the bottom book, that is, the
overhang is slightly over one book. Use your series in (a) to verify this. Then

Complex Numbers

1. INTRODUCTION

You will probably recall using imaginary and complex numbers in algebra. The
general solution of the quadratic equation

(1.1)

az2 + bz + c = 0

for the unknown z, is given by the quadratic formula

(1.2)

−b ±

z =

√

b2 − 4ac
2a

.

If the discriminant d = (b2 − 4ac) is negative, we must take the square root of
a negative number in order to ﬁnd z. Since only non-negative numbers have real
square roots, it is impossible to use (1.2) when d < 0 unless we introduce a new
kind of number, called an imaginary number. We use the symbol i =
−1 with the
understanding that i2 = −1. Then

We use the term complex number to mean any one of the whole set of numbers,

real, imaginary, or combinations of the two like 1 ± i. Thus, i + 5, 17i, 4, 3 + i
5
are all examples of complex numbers.

Section 3

The Complex Plane

47

Once the new kind of number is admitted into our number system, fascinating
possibilities open up. Can we attach any meaning to marks like sin i, eiπ, ln(1 + i)?
We’ll see later that we can and that, in fact, such expressions may turn up in
problems in physics, chemistry, and engineering, as well as mathematics.

When people ﬁrst considered taking square roots of negative numbers, they felt
very uneasy about the problem. They thought that such numbers could not have
any meaning or any connection with reality (hence the term “imaginary”). They
certainly would not have believed that the new numbers could be of any practical
use. Yet complex numbers are of great importance in a variety of applied ﬁelds; for
example, the electrical engineer would, to say the least, be severely handicapped
without them. The complex notation often simpliﬁes setting up and solving vibra-
tion problems in either dynamical or electrical systems, and is useful in solving many
diﬀerential equations which arise from problems in various branches of physics. (See
Chapters 7 and 8.) In addition, there is a highly developed ﬁeld of mathematics
dealing with functions of a complex variable (see Chapter 14) which yields many
useful methods for solving problems about ﬂuid ﬂow, elasticity, quantum mechanics,
and other applied problems. Almost every ﬁeld of either pure or applied mathe-
matics makes some use of complex numbers.

2. REAL AND IMAGINARY PARTS OF A COMPLEX NUMBER

A complex number such as 5 + 3i is the sum of two terms. The real term (not
containing i) is called the real part of the complex number. The coeﬃcient of i in
the other term is called the imaginary part of the complex number. In 5 + 3i, 5 is
the real part and 3 is the imaginary part. Notice carefully that the imaginary part
of a complex number is not imaginary!

Either the real part or the imaginary part of a complex number may be zero.
If the real part is zero, the complex number is called imaginary (or, for emphasis,
pure imaginary). The zero real part is usually omitted; thus 0 + 5i is written just
5i. If the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, the number is real. We
write 7 + 0i as just 7. Complex numbers then include both real numbers and pure
imaginary numbers as special cases.

In algebra a complex number is ordinarily written (as we have been doing) as a
sum like 5 + 3i. There is another very useful way of thinking of a complex number.
As we have said, every complex number has a real part and an imaginary part
(either of which may be zero). These are two real numbers, and we could, if we
liked, agree to write 5 + 3i as (5, 3). Any complex number could be written this way
as a pair of real numbers, the real part ﬁrst and then the imaginary part (which, you
must remember, is real). This would not be a very convenient form for computation,
but it suggests a very useful geometrical representation of a complex number which
we shall now consider.

3. THE COMPLEX PLANE

In analytic geometry we plot the point (5, 3) as shown in Figure 3.1. As we have
seen, the symbol (5, 3) could also mean the complex number 5 + 3i. The point (5, 3)
may then be labeled either (5, 3) or 5 + 3i. Similarly, any complex number x + iy (x
and y real) can be represented by a point (x, y) in the (x, y) plane. Also any point
(x, y) in the (x, y) plane can be labeled x + iy as well as (x, y). When the (x, y)

48

Complex Numbers

Chapter 2

plane is used in this way to plot complex numbers, it is called the complex plane. It
is also sometimes called an Argand diagram. The x axis is called the real axis, and
the y axis is called the imaginary axis (note, however, that you plot y and not iy).

Figure 3.1

When a complex number is written in the form x + iy, we say that it is in
rectangular form because x and y are the rectangular coordinates of the point
representing the number in the complex plane. In analytic geometry, we can locate
a point by giving its polar coordinates (r, θ) instead of its rectangular coordinates
(x, y). There is a corresponding way to write any complex number. In Figure 3.2,

x = r cos θ,
y = r sin θ.

(3.1)

Then we have

(3.2)

x + iy = r cos θ + ir sin θ
= r (cos θ + i sin θ).

Figure 3.2

This last expression is called the polar form of the complex number. As we shall
see (Sections 9 to 16), the expression (cos θ + i sin θ) can be written as eiθ, so a
convenient way to write the polar form of a complex number is

(3.3)

x + iy = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = reiθ.

The polar form reiθ of a complex number
is often simpler to use than the rectangu-
lar form.

Example.

√

√

In Figure 3.3 the point A could be
labeled as (1,
3) or as 1 + i

larly, using polar coordinates, the point
A could be labeled with its (r, θ) values
as (2, π/3). Notice that r is always taken
positive. Using (3.3) we have

Terminology and Notation

Radians and Degrees
In Figure 3.3, the angle π/3 is in radians. Ever since
you studied calculus, you have been expected to measure angles in radians and not
degrees. Do you know why? You have learned that (d/dx) sin x = cos x. This
formula is not correct—unless x is in radians. (Look up the derivation in your
calculus book!) Many of the formulas you now know and use are correct only if
you use radian measure; consequently that is what you are usually advised to do.
However, it is sometimes convenient to do computations with complex numbers
using degrees, so it is important to know when you can and when you cannot use
degrees. You can use degrees to measure an angle and to add and subtract angles
as long as the ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd the sine, cosine, or tangent of the resulting angle
(with your calculator in degree mode). For example, in Figure 3.3, we can, if we like,
say that θ = 60◦ instead of θ = π/3. If we want to ﬁnd sin(π/3−π/4) = sin(π/12) =
0.2588 (calculator in radian mode), we can instead ﬁnd sin(60◦ − 45◦) = sin 15◦ =
0.2588 (calculator in degree mode). Note carefully that an angle is in radians unless
the degree symbol is used; for example, in sin 2, the 2 is 2 radians or about 115◦.

In formulas, however, use radians. For example, in using inﬁnite series, we say
that sin θ ∼
= θ for very small θ. Try this on your calculator; you will ﬁnd that
it is true in radian mode but not in degree mode. As another example, consider
(cid:3) 1
0 dx/(1 + x2) = arc tan 1 = π/4 = 0.785. Here arc tan 1 is not an angle; it is the
numerical value of the integral, so the answer 45 (obtained from a calculator in
degree mode) is wrong! Do not use degree mode in reading an arc tan (or arc sin or
arc cos) unless you are ﬁnding an angle [for example, in Figure 3.2, θ = arc tan(y/x),
3 = π/3 or 60◦].
and in Figure 3.3, θ = arc tan

√

4. TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATION

√

Both i and j are used to represent
−1, j usually in any problem dealing with
electricity since i is needed there for current. A physicist should be able to work
with ease using either symbol. We shall for consistency use i throughout this book.
We often label a point with a single letter (for example, P in Figure 3.2 and A
in Figure 3.3) even though it requires two coordinates to locate the point. If you
have studied vectors, you will recall that a vector is represented by a single letter,
say v, although it has (in two dimensions) two components. It is customary to use
a single letter for a complex number even though we realize that it is actually a pair
of real numbers. Thus we write

(4.1)

z = x + iy = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = reiθ.

Here z is a complex number; x is the real part of the complex number z, and y is
the imaginary part of z. The quantity r is called the modulus or absolute value of
z, and θ is called the angle of z (or the phase, or the argument, or the amplitude of
z). In symbols:

(4.2)

Re z = x,
Im z = y (not iy),

|z| = mod z = r =
angle of z = θ.

(cid:4)

x2 + y2,

50

Complex Numbers

Chapter 2

The values of θ should be found from a diagram rather than a formula, although
we do sometimes write θ = arc tan(y/x). An example shows this clearly.

Example. Write z = −1 − i in polar form. Here we have x = −1, y = −1, r =

4.1). There are an inﬁnite number of values of θ,

√

2 (Figure

(4.3)

θ =

5π
4

+ 2nπ,

where n is any integer, positive or negative. The
value θ = 5π/4 is sometimes called the principal
angle of the complex number z = −1 − i. Notice
carefully, however, that this is not the same as
the principal value π/4 of arc tan 1 as deﬁned in
calculus. The angle of a complex number must be
in the same quadrant as the point representing the number. For our present work,
any one of the values in (4.3) will do; here we would probably use either 5π/4 or
−3π/4. Then we have in our example

[We could also write z =

2 (cos 225◦ + i sin 225◦).]

The complex number x − iy, obtained by changing the sign of i in z = x + iy,
is called the complex conjugate or simply the conjugate of z. We usually write the
conjugate of z = x + iy as ¯z = x − iy. Sometimes we use z∗ instead of ¯z (in ﬁelds
such as statistics or quantum mechanics where the bar may be used to mean an
average value). Notice carefully that the conjugate of 7i − 5 is −7i − 5; that is, it
is the i term whose sign is changed.

Complex numbers come in conjugate pairs; for
example, the conjugate of 2 + 3i is 2 − 3i and the
conjugate of 2−3i is 2+3i. Such a pair of points in
the complex plane are mirror images of each other
with the x axis as the mirror (Figure 4.2). Then
in polar form, z and ¯z have the same r value, but
their θ values are negatives of each other. If we
write z = r(cos θ + i sin θ), then

Figure 4.2

(4.4)

¯z = r[cos(−θ) + i sin(−θ)] = r(cos θ − i sin θ) = re−iθ.

5. COMPLEX ALGEBRA

A. Simplifying to x +iy form
Any complex number can be written in the rectangular form x + iy. To add,
subtract, and multiply complex numbers, remember that they follow the ordinary
rules of algebra and that i2 = −1.

Example 1.

(1 + i)2 = 1 + 2i + i2 = 1 + 2i − 1 = 2i
To divide one complex number by another, ﬁrst write the quotient as a fraction.
Then reduce the fraction to rectangular form by multiplying numerator and denom-
inator by the conjugate of the denominator; this makes the denominator real.

and using a calculator in degree mode: 0.5(cos 20◦ − i sin 20◦) = 0.47 − 0.17i.

B. Complex Conjugate of a Complex Expression

It is easy to see that the conjugate of the sum of two complex numbers is the sum
of the conjugates of the numbers. If

z1 = x1 + iy1

and

z2 = x2 + iy2,

then

¯z1 + ¯z2 = x1 − iy1 + x2 − iy2 = x1 + x2 − i(y1 + y2).

The conjugate of (z1 + z2) is

(x1 + x2) + i(y1 + y2) = (x1 + x2) − i(y1 + y2).

Section 5

Complex Algebra

53

Similarly, you can show that the conjugate of the diﬀerence (or product or quotient)
of two complex numbers is equal to the diﬀerence (or product or quotient) of the
conjugates of the numbers (Problem 25). In other words, you can get the conjugate
of an expression containing i’s by just changing the signs of all the i terms. We
must watch out for hidden i’s, however.

Example.

If

z =

2 − 3i
i + 4

,

then

¯z =

2 + 3i
−i + 4

.

But if z = f +ig, where f and g are themselves complex, then the complex conjugate
of z is ¯z = ¯f − i¯g (not f − ig).

PROBLEMS, SECTION 5

25. Prove that the conjugate of the quotient of two complex numbers is the quotient of
the conjugates. Also prove the corresponding statements for diﬀerence and product.
Hint:
It is easier to prove the statements about product and quotient using the
polar coordinate reiθ form; for the diﬀerence, it is easier to use the rectangular form
x + iy.

C. Finding the Absolute Value of z
(cid:4)

Recall that the deﬁnition of |z| is |z| = r =
(positive square root!).
Since z ¯z = (x + iy)(x − iy) = x2 + y2, or, in polar coordinates, z ¯z = (reiθ)(re−iθ) =
r2, we see that |z|2 = z ¯z, or |z| =
z ¯z. Note that z ¯z is always real and ≥ 0, since
x, y, and r are real. We have

x2 + y2

√

(5.1)

|z| = r =

(cid:4)

x2 + y2 =

√

z ¯z.

By Problem 25 and (5.1), the absolute value of a quotient of two complex numbers
is the quotient of the absolute values (and a similar statement for product).

Complex Numbers

Chapter 2

D. Complex Equations

In working with equations involving complex quantities, we must always remember
that a complex number is actually a pair of real numbers. Two complex numbers
are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.
For example, x + iy = 2 + 3i means x = 2 and y = 3. In other words, any equation
involving complex numbers is really two equations involving real numbers.

Example. Find x and y if

(5.2)

(x + iy)2 = 2i.
Since (x + iy)2 = x2 + 2ixy − y2, (5.2) is equivalent to the two real equations

x2 − y2 = 0,
2xy = 2.

From the ﬁrst equation y2 = x2, we ﬁnd y = x or y = −x. Substituting these into
the second equation gives

2x2 = 2

or

− 2x2 = 2.

Since x is real, x2 cannot be negative. Thus we ﬁnd only

x2 = 1

and

y = x,

that is,

x = y = 1

and

x = y = −1.

PROBLEMS, SECTION 5

E. Graphs

Using the graphical representation of the complex number z as the point (x, y) in
a plane, we can give geometrical meaning to equations and inequalities involving z.

Section 5

Complex Algebra

Example 1. What is the curve made up of the points in the (x, y) plane satisfying the

equation |z| = 3?

Since

the given equation is

(cid:4)

|z| =

x2 + y2,

(cid:4)

x2 + y2 = 3

or

x2 + y2 = 9.

Thus |z| = 3 is the equation of a circle of radius 3 with center at the origin. Such
an equation might describe, for example, the path of an electron or of a satellite.
(See Section F below.)

Example 2.

(a) |z − 1| = 2. This is the circle (x − 1)2 + y2 = 4.
(b) |z − 1| ≤ 2. This is the disk whose boundary is the circle in (a).

Note that we use “circle” to mean a curve and “disk” to mean an area. The interior
of the disk is given by |z − 1| < 2.

Example 3.

(Angle of z) = π/4. This is the half-line y = x with x > 0; this might be the

path of a light ray starting at the origin.

F. Physical Applications

Problems in physics as well as geometry may often be simpliﬁed by using one com-
plex equation instead of two real equations. See the following example and also
Section 16.

Chapter 2

Example. A particle moves in the (x, y) plane so that its position (x, y) as a function of

time t is given by

z = x + iy =

i + 2t
t − i

.

Find the magnitudes of its velocity and its acceleration as functions of t.

We could write z in x + iy form and so ﬁnd x and y as functions of t. It is
easier to do the problem as follows. We deﬁne the complex velocity and complex
acceleration by

dz
dt =
Then the magnitude v of the velocity is v =

6. COMPLEX INFINITE SERIES

In Chapter 1 we considered inﬁnite series whose terms were real. We shall be very
much interested in series with complex terms; let us reconsider our deﬁnitions and
theorems for this case. The partial sums of a series of complex numbers will be
complex numbers, say Sn = Xn + iYn, where Xn and Yn are real. Convergence is
deﬁned just as for real series: If Sn approaches a limit S = X + iY as n → ∞,
we call the series convergent and call S its sum. This means that Xn → X and
Yn → Y ; in other words, the real and the imaginary parts of the series are each
convergent series.

It is useful, just as for real series, to discuss absolute convergence ﬁrst. It can
be proved (Problem 1) that an absolutely convergent series converges. Absolute
convergence means here, just as for real series, that the series of absolute values of
the terms is a convergent series. Remember that |z| = r =
x2 + y2 is a positive
number. Thus any of the tests given in Chapter 1 for convergence of series of
positive terms may be used here to test a complex series for absolute convergence.

7. COMPLEX POWER SERIES; DISK OF CONVERGENCE

In Chapter 1 we considered series of powers of x,
in series of powers of z,

(7.1)

(cid:12)

anzn,

(cid:11)

anxn. We are now interested

where z = x + iy, and the an are complex numbers. [Notice that (7.1) includes real
series as a special case since z = x if y = 0.] Here are some examples.

Let us use the ratio test to ﬁnd for what z these series are absolutely convergent.

For (7.2a), we have

(cid:9)

(cid:9) = |z|.

(cid:4)

The series converges if ρ < 1, that is, if |z| < 1, or
x2 + y2 < 1. This is the interior of a disk of radius 1 with
center at the origin in the complex plane. This disk is called
the disk of convergence of the inﬁnite series and the radius of
the disk is called the radius of convergence. The disk of con-
vergence replaces the interval of convergence which we had
for real series. In fact (see Figure 7.1), the interval of con-
(−x)n/n is just the interval (−1, 1)
vergence for the series
on the x axis contained within the disk of convergence of
(cid:11)

(cid:11)

Figure 7.1

(−z)n/n, as it must be since x is the value of z when y = 0. For this reason we
sometimes speak of the radius of convergence of a power series even though we are
considering only real values of z. (Also see Chapter 14, Equations (2.5) and (2.6)
and Figure 2.4.)

Next consider series (7.2b); here we have

Thus, this series converges for

|z + 1− i| < 3, or |z − (−1 + i)| < 3.

This is the interior of a disk (Figure 7.2) of radius 3 and
center at z = −1 + i (see Problem 5.65).

Figure 7.2

Section 7

Complex Power Series; Disk of Convergence

59

Just as for real series, if ρ > 1, the series diverges (Problem 6.14). For ρ = 1
(that is, on the boundary of the disk of convergence) the series may either converge
or diverge. It may be diﬃcult to ﬁnd out which and we shall not in general need to
consider the question.

The four theorems about power series (Chapter 1, Section 11) are true also for
complex series (replace interval by disk of convergence). Also we can now state for
Theorem 2 what the disk of convergence is for the quotient of two series of powers
of z. Assume to start with that any common factor z has been cancelled. Let r1
and r2 be the radii of convergence of the numerator and denominator series. Find
the closest point to the origin in the complex plane where the denominator is zero;
call the distance from the origin to this point s. Then the quotient series converges
at least inside the smallest of the three disks of radii r1, r2, and s, with center at
the origin. (See Chapter 14, Section 2.)

Example. Find the disk of convergence of the Maclaurin series for (sin z)/[z(1 + z2)].

We shall soon see that the series for sin z has the same form as the real series

for sin x in Chapter 1. Using this fact we ﬁnd (Problem 17)

sin z
z(1 + z2)

= 1 − 7z2

47z4

− 5923z6

+ · · · .

From (7.3) we can’t ﬁnd the radius of convergence, but let’s use the theorem above.
Let the numerator series be (sin z)/z. By ratio test, the series for (sin z)/z converges
for all z (if you like, r1 = ∞). There is no r2 since the denominator is not an inﬁnite
series. The denominator 1 + z2 is zero when z = ±i, so s = 1. Then the series (7.3)
converges inside a disk of radius 1 with center at the origin.

8. ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX NUMBERS

The so-called elementary functions are powers and roots, trigonometric and inverse
trigonometric functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, and combinations
of these. All these you can compute or ﬁnd in tables, as long as you want them as
functions of real numbers. Now we want to ﬁnd things like ii, sin(1+i), or ln i. These
are not just curiosities for the amusement of the mathematically inclined, but may
turn up to be evaluated in applied problems. To be sure, the values of experimental
measurements are not imaginary. But the values of Re z, Im z, |z|, angle of z, are
real, and these are the quantities which have experimental meaning. Meanwhile,
mathematical solutions of problems may involve manipulations of complex numbers
before we arrive ﬁnally at a real answer to compare with experiment.

Polynomials and rational functions (quotients of polynomials) of z are easily

evaluated.

Example.

If f (z) = (z2 + 1)/(z − 3), we ﬁnd f (i − 2) by substituting z = i − 2 :

·

=

=

f (i − 2) =

−i − 5
−i − 5

(i − 2)2 + 1
i − 2 − 3

−4i + 4
i − 5
Next we want to investigate the possible meaning of other functions of complex
numbers. We should like to deﬁne expressions like ez or sin z so that they will
obey the familiar laws we know for the corresponding real expressions [for example,
sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x, or (d/dx)ex = ex]. We must, for consistency, deﬁne functions
of complex numbers so that any equations involving them reduce to correct real
equations when z = x + iy becomes z = x, that is, when y = 0. These requirements
will be met if we deﬁne ez by the power series

8i − 12
13

.

(8.1)

ez =

∞(cid:12)

0

zn
n!

= 1 + z +

z2

2!

+

z3

3!

+ · · · .

This series converges for all values of the complex number z (Problem 7.1) and
therefore gives us the value of ez for any z. If we put z = x (x real), we get the
familiar series for ex.

It is easy to show, by multiplying the series (Problem 1), that

(8.2)

ez1 · ez2 = ez1+z2 .

In Chapter 14 we shall consider in detail the meaning of derivatives with respect to
a complex z. However, it is worth while for you to know that (d/dz)zn = nzn−1,
and that, in fact, the other diﬀerentiation and integration formulas which you know

Section 9

Euler’s Formula

61

from elementary calculus hold also with x replaced by z. You can verify that
(d/dz)ez = ez when ez is deﬁned by (8.1) by diﬀerentiating (8.1) term by term
It can be shown that (8.1) is the only deﬁnition of ez which pre-
(Problem 2).
serves these familiar formulas. We now want to consider the consequences of this
deﬁnition.

(The rearrangement of terms is justiﬁed because the series is absolutely convergent.)
Now compare (9.1) and (9.2); the last line in (9.2) is just cos θ + i sin θ. We then
have the very useful result we introduced in Section 3, known as Euler’s formula:

(9.3)

eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.

Thus we have justiﬁed writing any complex number as we did in (4.1), namely

(9.4)

z = x + iy = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = reiθ.

Here are some examples of the use of (9.3) and (9.4). These problems can be done
very quickly graphically or just by picturing them in your mind.

Examples. Find the values of 2 eiπ/6, eiπ, 3 e−iπ/2, e2nπi.

2 eiπ/6 is reiθ with r = 2, θ = π/6. From Figure 9.1,
√

x =

eiπ is reiθ with r = 1, θ = π. From Figure 9.2, x = −1,
y = 0, x + iy = −1 + 0i, so eiπ = −1. Note that r = 1 and
θ = −π, ±3π, ±5π, · · · , give the same point, so e−iπ = −1,
e3πi = −1, and so on.

3e−iπ/2 is reiθ with r = 3, θ = −π/2. From Figure

9.3, x = 0, y = −3, so 3e−iπ/2 = x + iy = 0 − 3i = −3i.

e2nπi is reiθ with r = 1 and θ = 2nπ = n(2π); that is,
θ is an integral multiple of 2π. From Figure 9.4, x = 1,
y = 0, so e2nπi = 1 + 0i = 1.

It is often convenient to use Euler’s formula when we want to multiply or divide
complex numbers. From (8.2) we obtain two familiar looking laws of exponents
which are now valid for imaginary exponents:

(9.5)

eiθ1 · eiθ2 = ei(θ1+θ2),
eiθ1 ÷ eiθ2 = ei(θ1−θ2).

Remembering that any complex number can be written in the form reiθ by (9.4),
we get

Section 9

(9.6)

z1 · z2 = r1 eiθ1 · r2 eiθ2 = r1 r2 ei(θ1+θ2),
z1 ÷ z2 =

ei(θ1−θ2).

In words, to multiply two complex numbers, we multiply their absolute values
and add their angles. To divide two complex numbers, we divide the absolute
values and subtract the angles.

Example. Evaluate (1 + i)2/(1 − i). From Figure 5.1 we have
2 eiπ/4. We plot 1 − i in Figure 9.5 and ﬁnd
2 e−iπ/4. Then

From Figure 9.6, we ﬁnd x = −1, y = 1, so

1 − i = x + iy = −1 + i.
We could use degrees in this problem. By (9.6), we ﬁnd
that the angle of (1 + i)2/(1 − i) is 2(45◦) − (−45◦) = 135◦
as in Figure 9.6.

PROBLEMS, SECTION 9

Express the following complex numbers in the x + iy form. Try to visualize each complex
number, using sketches as in the examples if necessary. The ﬁrst twelve problems you
should be able to do in your head (and maybe some of the others—try it!) Doing a
problem quickly in your head saves time over using a computer. Remember that the point
in doing problems like this is to gain skill in manipulating complex expressions, so a good
study method is to do the problems by hand and use a computer to check your answers.

10. POWERS AND ROOTS OF COMPLEX NUMBERS

Using the rules (9.6) for multiplication and division of complex numbers, we have

(10.1)

zn = (reiθ)n = rneinθ

for any integral n. In words, to obtain the nth power of a complex number, we take
the nth power of the modulus and multiply the angle by n. The case r = 1 is of
particular interest. Then (10.1) becomes DeMoivre’s theorem:

(10.2)

(eiθ)n = (cos θ + i sin θ)n = cos nθ + i sin nθ.

You can use this equation to ﬁnd the formulas for sin 2θ, cos 2θ, sin 3θ, etc. (Prob-
lems 27 and 28).

The nth root of z, z1/n, means a complex number whose nth power is z. From

(10.1) you can see that this is

√
z1/n = (reiθ)1/n = r1/neiθ/n = n

This formula must be used with care (see Examples 2 to 4 below).

Some examples will show how useful these formulas are.

Example 1.

Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers

Example 2. Find the cube roots of 8. We know that 2 is a cube root of 8, but there are
also two complex cube roots of 8; let us see why. Plot the complex number 8 (that
is, x = 8, y = 0) in the complex plane; the polar coordinates of the point are r = 8,
and θ = 0, or 360◦, 720◦, 1080◦, etc. (We can use either degrees or radians here;
read the end of Section 3.) Now by equation (10.3), z1/3 = r1/3eiθ/3; that is, to
ﬁnd the polar coordinates of the cube root of a number reiθ, we ﬁnd the cube root
√
of r and divide the angle by 3. Then the polar coordinates of 3

8 are

(10.4)

r = 2,

θ = 0◦,
= 0◦,

360◦/3,
120◦,

720◦/3,

1080◦/3 · · ·

240◦,

360◦ · · · .

We plot these points in Figure 10.1. Observe that the point (2, 0◦) and the
point (2, 360◦) are the same. The points in (10.4) are all on a circle of radius 2
and are equally spaced 360◦/3 = 120◦ apart. Starting with θ = 0, if we add 120◦
repeatedly, we just repeat the three angles shown.
Thus, there are exactly three cube roots for any
(cid:4)
number z, always on a circle of radius 3
|z| and
spaced 120◦ apart.

√

Now to ﬁnd the values of

8 in rectangular
form, we can read them from Figure 10.1, or we
can calculate them from z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) with
r = 2 and θ = 0, 120◦ = 2π/3, 240◦ = 4π/3.
We can also use a computer to solve the equation
z3 = 8. By any of these methods we ﬁnd

8 = {2, −1 + i

the 6 equally spaced points 60◦ apart. To ﬁnd the
roots in rectangular coordinates, we need to ﬁnd all
the values of r(cos θ + i sin θ) with r and θ given by
(10.5). We can do this one root at a time or more
simply by using a computer to solve the equation
z6 = −8i. We ﬁnd (see Problem 33)

Summary In each of the preceding examples, our steps in ﬁnding n

reiθ were:

(a) Find the polar coordinates of the roots: Take the nth root of r and divide

θ + 2kπ by n.

√
(b) Make a sketch: Draw a circle of radius n

r, plot the root with angle θ/n, and
then plot the rest of the n roots around the circle equally spaced 2π/n apart.
Note that we have now essentially solved the problem. From the sketch you
can see the approximate rectangular coordinates of the roots and check your
answers in (c). Since this sketch is quick and easy to do, it is worthwhile even
if you use a computer to do part (c).

(c) Find the x + iy coordinates of the roots by one of the methods in the examples.
If you are using a computer, you may want to make a computer plot of the
roots which should be a perfected copy of your sketch in (b).

√

11. THE EXPONENTIAL AND TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

Although we have already deﬁned ez by a power series (8.1), it is worth while to
write it in another form. By (8.2) we can write

(11.1)

ez = ex+iy = exeiy = ex(cos y + i sin y).

This is more convenient to use than the inﬁnite series if we want values of ez for
given z. For example,

e2−iπ = e2e−iπ = e2 · (−1) = −e2

from Figure 9.2.

We have already seen that there is a close relationship [Euler’s formula (9.3)]
between complex exponentials and trigonometric functions of real angles.
It is
useful to write this relation in another form. We write Euler’s formula (9.3) as it

68

Complex Numbers

Chapter 2

is, and also write it with θ replaced by −θ. Remember that cos(−θ) = cos θ and
sin(−θ) = − sin θ. Then we have

(11.2)

eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ,
e−iθ = cos θ − i sin θ.

These two equations can be solved for sin θ and cos θ. We get (Problem 2)

(11.3)

sin θ =

cos θ =

eiθ − e−iθ
2i
eiθ + e−iθ
2

,

.

These formulas are useful in evaluating integrals since products of exponentials are
easier to integrate than products of sines and cosines. (See Problems 11 to 16, and
Chapter 7, Section 5.)

So far we have discussed only trigonometric functions of real angles. We could
deﬁne sin z and cos z for complex z by their power series as we did for ez. We could
then compare these series with the series for eiz and derive Euler’s formula and
(11.3) with θ replaced by z. However, it is simpler to use the complex equations
corresponding to (11.3) as our deﬁnitions for sin z and cos z. We deﬁne

(11.4)

sin z =

cos z =

eiz − e−iz
2i
eiz + e−iz
2

,

.

The rest of the trigonometric functions of z are deﬁned in the usual way in terms
of these; for example, tan z = sin z/ cos z.

Example 1.

cos i =

= 1.543 · · ·. (We will see in Section 15 that

ei·i + e−i·i

=

e−1 + e

this expression is called the hyperbolic cosine of 1.)

Notice from both these examples that sines and cosines of complex numbers may
be greater than 1. As we shall see (Section 15), although | sin x| ≤ 1 and | cos x| ≤ 1
for real x, when z is a complex number, sin z and cos z can have any value we like.
Using the deﬁnitions (11.4) of sin z and cos z, you can show that the familiar

trigonometric identities and calculus formulas hold when θ is replaced by z.

12. HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS

Let us look at sin z and cos z for pure imaginary z, that is, z = iy:

(12.1)

sin iy =

cos iy =

e−y − ey
2i
e−y + ey
2

= i

=

ey − e−y

,

2
ey + e−y
2

.

The real functions on the right have special names because these particular combi-
nations of exponentials arise frequently in problems. They are called the hyperbolic
sine (abbreviated sinh) and the hyperbolic cosine (abbreviated cosh). Their deﬁni-
tions for all z are

(12.2)

sinh z =

cosh z =

ez − e−z

2
ez + e−z
2

,

.

The other hyperbolic functions are named and deﬁned in a similar way to parallel
the trigonometric functions:

(12.3)

tanh z =

sech z =

sinh z
cosh z
1
cosh z

,

,

coth z =

csch z =

,

tanh z

.
sinh z

(See Problem 38 for the reason behind the term “hyperbolic” functions.)

We can write (12.1) as

(12.4)

sin iy = i sinh y,
cos iy = cosh y.

Then we see that the hyperbolic functions of y are (except for one i factor) the
trigonometric functions of iy. From (12.2) we can show that (12.4) holds with y
replaced by z. Because of this relation between hyperbolic and trigonometric func-
tions, the formulas for hyperbolic functions look very much like the corresponding
trigonometric identities and calculus formulas. They are not identical, however.

Example. You can prove the following formulas (see Problems 9, 10, 11 and 38).

13. LOGARITHMS

In elementary mathematics you learned to ﬁnd logarithms of positive numbers only;
in fact, you may have been told that there were no logarithms of negative numbers.
This is true if you use only real numbers, but it is not true when we allow complex
numbers as answers. We shall now see how to ﬁnd the logarithm of any complex
number z (cid:7)= 0 (including negative real numbers as a special case). If

(13.1)

then by deﬁnition

(13.2)

z = ew,

w = ln z.

(We use ln for natural logarithms to avoid the cumbersome loge and to avoid con-
fusion with logarithms to the base 10.)

We can write the law of exponents (8.2), using the letters of (13.1), as

(13.3)

z1z2 = ew1 · ew2 = ew1+w2.

Taking logarithms of this equation, that is, using (13.1) and (13.2), we get

(13.4)

ln z1z2 = w1 + w2 = ln z1 + ln z2.

This is the familiar law for the logarithm of a product, justiﬁed now for complex
numbers. We can then ﬁnd the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm of a
complex number from the equation

(13.5)

w = ln z = ln(reiθ) = Ln r + ln eiθ = Ln r + iθ,

where Ln r means the ordinary real logarithm to the base e of the real positive
number r.

Since θ has an inﬁnite number of values (all diﬀering by multiples of 2π), a complex
number has inﬁnitely many logarithms, diﬀering from each other by multiples of
2πi. The principal value of ln z (often written as Ln z) is the one using the principal
value of θ, that is 0 ≤ θ < 2π. (Some references use −π < θ ≤ π.)

Example 1. Find ln(−1). From Figure 9.2, we see that the polar coordinates of the point

z = −1 are r = 1 and θ = π, −π, 3π, · · · . Then,

ln(−1) = Ln(1) + i(π ± 2nπ) = iπ, −iπ, 3πi, · · · .

Example 2. Find ln(1 + i). From Figure 5.1, for z = 1 + i, we ﬁnd r =

π/4 ± 2nπ. Then

ln(1 + i) = Ln

Even a positive real number now has inﬁnitely many logarithms, since its angle
can be taken as 0, 2π, −2π, etc. Only one of these logarithms is real, namely the
principal value Ln r using the angle θ = 0.

Section 14

Complex Roots and Powers

14. COMPLEX ROOTS AND POWERS

For real positive numbers, the equation ln ab = b ln a is equivalent to ab = eb ln a. We
deﬁne complex powers by the same formula with complex a and b. By deﬁnition,
for complex a and b (a (cid:7)= e),

(14.1)

ab = eb ln a.

[The case a = e is excluded because we have already deﬁned powers of e by (8.1).]
Since ln a is multiple valued (because of the inﬁnite number of values of θ), powers
ab are usually multiple valued, and unless you want just the principal value of ln z
or of ab you must use all values of θ. In the following examples we ﬁnd all values of
each complex power and write the answers in the x + iy form.

Example 1. Find all values of i−2i. From Figure 5.2, and equation (13.5) we ﬁnd ln i =
Ln 1 + i(π/2 ± 2nπ) = i(π/2 ± 2nπ) since Ln 1 = 0. Then, by equation (14.1),

i−2i = e−2i ln i = e−2i·i(π/2±2nπ) = eπ±4nπ = eπ, e5π, e−3π, · · · ,

where eπ = 23.14 · · · . Note the inﬁnite set of values of i−2i, all real! Also read the
end of Section 3, and note that here the ﬁnal step is not to ﬁnd sine or cosine of
π ± 4nπ; thus, in ﬁnding ln i = iθ, we must not write θ in degrees.

Example 2. Find all values of i1/2. Using ln i from Example 1 we have i1/2 = e(1/2) ln i =
ei(π/4+nπ) = eiπ/4einπ. Now einπ = +1 when n is even (Fig. 9.4), and einπ = −1
when n is odd (Fig. 9.2). Thus,

i1/2 = ± eiπ/4 = ± 1 + i
√
2

using Figure 5.1. Notice that although ln i has an inﬁnite set of values, we ﬁnd just
two values for i1/2 as we should for a square root. (Compare the method of Section
10 which is easier for this problem.)

Example 3. Find all values of (1 + i)1−i. Using (14.1) and the value of ln(1 + i) from

Example 2, Section 13, we have

(1 + i)1−i = e(1−i) ln(1+i) = e(1−i)[Ln

Now you may be wondering why not just do these problems by computer. The
most important point is that it is useful for advanced work to have skill in manip-
ulating complex expressions. A second point is that there may be several forms for
an answer (see Section 15, Example 2) or there may be many answers (see examples

74

above), and your computer may not give you the one you want (see Problem 25).
So to obtain needed skills, a good study method is to do problems by hand and
compare with computer solutions.

15. INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS

We have already deﬁned the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions of a complex
number z. For example,

(15.1)

w = cos z =

eiz + e−iz
2

deﬁnes w = cos z; that is, for each complex number z, (15.1) gives us the complex
number w. We now deﬁne the inverse cosine or arc cos w by

(15.2)

z = arc cos w

if w = cos z.

The other inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are deﬁned similarly.

In dealing with real numbers, you know that sin x and cos x are never greater
than 1. This is no longer true for sin z and cos z with z complex. To illustrate the
method of ﬁnding inverse trigonometric (or inverse hyperbolic) functions, let’s ﬁnd
arc cos 2.

u + u−1

z = ln(x +

the constant ln a, which is a constant of integration.

16. SOME APPLICATIONS

Motion of a Particle We have already seen (end of Section 5) that the path
of a particle in the (x, y) plane is given by z = z(t). As another example of this,
suppose z = 1 + 3e2it. We see that

(16.1)

|z − 1| = |3 e2it| = 3.

Recall that |z − 1| is the distance between the points z and 1; (16.1) says that this
distance is 3. Thus the particle traverses a circle of radius 3, with center at (1, 0).
The magnitude of its velocity is |dz/dt| = |6i e2it| = 6, so it moves around the circle
at constant speed. (Also see Problem 2).

particle from the origin at time t. Show that the particle travels in a circle of radius
a at velocity v = aω and with acceleration of magnitude v2/a directed toward the

Electricity In the theory of electric circuits, it is shown that if VR is the voltage

part of I in (16.10), that is, by (16.5). Note, by comparing (16.5) and (16.10), that

a d-c circuit. The more complicated a-c circuit equations now take the same simple
form as the d-c equations except that all quantities are complex. For example, the
rules for combining resistances in series and in parallel hold for combining complex
impedances (see Problems below).

Optics
In optics we frequently need to combine a number of light waves (which
can be represented by sine functions). Often each wave is “out of phase” with the
preceding one by a ﬁxed amount; this means that the waves can be written as sin t,
sin(t + δ), sin(t + 2δ), and so on. Suppose we want to add all these sine functions
together. An easy way to do it is to see that each sine is the imaginary part of a
complex number, so what we want is the imaginary part of the series

(16.17)

eit + ei(t+δ) + ei(t+2δ) + · · · .

This is a geometric progression with ﬁrst term eit and ratio eiδ. If there are n waves
to be combined, we want the sum of n terms of this progression, which is

(16.18)

eit(1 − einδ)
1 − eiδ

.

We can simplify this expression by writing

(16.19)

1 − eiδ = eiδ/2(e−iδ/2 − eiδ/2) = −eiδ/2 · 2i sin

by (11.3). Substituting (16.19) and a similar formula for (1 − einδ) into (16.18), we

Simple Harmonic Motion It is very convenient to use
complex notation even for motion along a straight line.
Think of a mass m attached to a spring and oscillating
up and down (see Figure 16.3). Let y be the vertical dis-
placement of the mass from its equilibrium position (the
point at which it would hang at rest). Recall that the
force on m due to the stretched or compressed spring is
then −ky, where k is the spring constant, and the mi-
nus sign indicates that the force and displacement are in
opposite directions. Then Newton’s second law (force =
mass times acceleration) gives

Now we want a function y(t) with the property that diﬀerentiating it twice just
multiplies it by a constant. You can easily verify that this is true for exponentials,
sines, and cosines (see problem 13). Just as in discussing electric circuits (see
(16.10)), we may write a solution of (16.21) as

(16.22)

y = y0 eiωt

with the understanding that the actual physical displacement is either the real or the
imaginary part of (16.22). The constant ω =
k/m is called the angular frequency
(see Chapter 7, Section 2). We will use this notation in Chapter 3, Section 12.
