RPA Definitions 

› Attended RPA is defined as:

“Automation that interacts in real time with humans who initiate and control robot tasks, often 
embedding functions within apps., generally associated with front-office, agent-led activities.” 

› Unattended RPA is defined as:

“Automation that replaces a complete human function in a ‘lights-out’ “batch-oriented” 
manner, creating a virtual workforce, generally associated with back-office activities.”

› Hybrid RPA is defined as:

“Automation that combines attended and unattended  tasks that work together, generally 
associated with processes that span front and back-office activities.”

Investments are 
expected to improve 
customer self-
service (52%) and 
help employees 
serve customers 
better (48%) in order 
to get better 
answers quickly.

Q11. Where do you see the most ‘newer’ term investment? 

Chatbots directed at customer to
improve self-service

Chatbots directed at employees to
help them service / serve customers
better

48%

52%

Q12. [IF CHATBOTS DIRECTED AT EMPLOYEES] You said newer term investment of 
chatbots is directed at employees to better serve / service customers. Why is this?

It will enable employees to get better answer customer queries
quickly

Technology for understanding a conversation is still developing /
immature

Chatbots enable smarter, quicker decisions to better serve
customers in a personalized way

We have an immediate ROI due to internal help desk elimination
