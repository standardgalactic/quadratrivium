Summary: We study a nonequilibrium mean ﬁeld Ising model in the low temperature phase regime, where
metastable equilibrium states develop a cuspidal (spinodal) singularity. We focus on celebrated Glauber
dynamics, and design a contact Hamiltonian ﬂow which captures some of its rough features in this regime.
We prove, however, that there is an inevitable discrepancy between the scaling laws for the relaxation
time in the Glauber and the contact Hamiltonian dynamical systems.
