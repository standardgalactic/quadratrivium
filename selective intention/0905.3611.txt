You Could Simplify Calculus∗

Abstract

I explain a direct approach to diﬀerentiation and integration. Instead
of relying on the general notions of real numbers, limits and continuity,
we treat functions as the primary objects of our theory, and view diﬀer-
entiation as division of f (x) − f (a) by x − a in a certain class of functions.
When f is a polynomial, the division can be carried out explicitly. To see
why a polynomial with a positive derivative is increasing (the monotonic-
ity theorem), we use the estimate |f (x) − f (a) − f ′(a)(x − a)| 6 K(x − a)2.
By making it into a deﬁnition we arrive at the notion of uniform Lipschitz
diﬀerentiability (ULD), and see that the derivative of a ULD function is
Lipschitz. Taking diﬀerent moduli of continuity instead of the absolute
value, we get diﬀerent ﬂavors of calculus, each rather elementary, but
all together covering the total range of uniformly diﬀerentiable functions.
Using the class of functions continuous at a, we recapture the classical
notion of pointwise diﬀerentiability. It turns out that uniform Lipschitz
diﬀerentiability is equivalent to divisibility of f (x) − f (a) by x − a in the
class of Lipschitz functions of two variables, x and a. The same is true for
any subadditive modulus of continuity. In this bottom-up, computational,
one modulus of continuity at a time approach to calculus, the monotonic-
ity theorem takes the central stage and provides the aspects of the subject
that are important for practical applications. The weighty ontological is-
sues of compactness and completeness can be treated lightly or postponed,
since they are hardly used this streamlined approach that pretty much fol-
lows the Vladimir Arnold’s “principle of minimal generality, according to
which every idea should ﬁrst be understood in the simplest situation; only
then can the method developed be applied to more complicated cases.” I
discuss a generalization to many variables brieﬂy.

T: Your answer is correct, but why didn’t you use the deﬁnition of the

derivative as a limit? We are studying calculus here, you know.

S: Do I really need to use limits? It looks like a waste of time, I can just

simplify and plug in x = a instead, it looks like it works ﬁne.

T: But do you understand why it works?
S: Hmmm, let me see. I guess it works because the limit of (x + a)(x2 + a2)
a is 4a3, so, instead of calculating the limit we can just plug x = a into

as x
(x + a)(x2 + a2).

T: How do you call such a function, that you can just plug in x = a into it

instead of calculating the limit of this function at a?

S: Continuous at a? Yeah, I remember.
T: Right! You know, people diﬀerentiated polynomials, roots and trig func-
tions in the 17th century, long before they started thinking of such generalities
as continuity and limits in the 19th century. Why don’t you try to diﬀerentiate
your way some other simple algebraic expressions, such as 3√x or
S: O.K., I will, I think I understand it a little better now.

1.2 Diﬀerentiating √x without using limits

It happened in the fall of 1997, when I taught two calculus recitation sections at
Suﬀolk University. The purpose of these sections was to answer the questions
the students had about their homework and the subject in general. The text
was Anton’s Calculus, which I came to hate as the semester progressed.

It was one of the classes, and some students asked me to explain how to dif-
ferentiate √x. So I wrote down the diﬀerence quotient √x
√a
a on the chalkboard
−
x
−
and said that we had to calculate the limit of this expression as x approaches a.
As soon as I uttered the word “limit” I saw many students slump in their
seats, their eyes glazing over, and I had the sinking feeling that they were totally
lost. I had to do something fast to help them, to pull them out of their despair,
but what?

I said, look, you don’t really need limits to calculate this derivative, you
can do it algebraically. Let us rewrite this expression in such a way that it
would make sense for x = a. How can we do that? Let us rewrite the de-
√a2 and factor it as (√x
nominator as √x2
√a
a =
√x+√a that makes sense for x = a, giving us the answer

(√x)′ = 1/(2√x), that’s all there is to it.

I saw the students brightening up a little bit, when they realized that the
problem could be solved with the tools familiar to them. And that’s exactly
when it dawned on me that all calculus could be done like that, diﬀerentiation
being nothing but division in the class of continuous functions. It surely looked
like a promising idea.

Let us start with the simplest and most popular example, diﬀerentiating x2.
We form the diﬀerence quotient x

a and try to make sense of it for x = a.
x
The trouble is, of course, that when we just plug in x = a, we get 0/0, which is
undeﬁned, because 0c = 0 for any number c. But luckily, the numerator factors
as (x
a and rewrite our expression as x + a that
makes sense for x = a, giving us (x2)′ = 2x. To generalize to xn, we use the
1.

This trick will work for any polynomial p(x), because a is a root of the poly-
p(a) =
a, so we have p(x)
as q(x, a) which is a polynomial in

Of course we don’t have to divide polynomials every time we diﬀerentiate
them. The ﬁrst two diﬀerentiation rules tell us that (f +g)′ = f ′+g′ and (kf )′ =
kf ′ for any constant k, in other words, diﬀerentiation is a linear operation, and
therefore we can diﬀerentiate polynomials “term by term,” i.e.
(p0 + p1x + . . . + pnxn)′ = p1 + 2p2x + . . . + npnxn
−

1.

The other two rules of diﬀerentiation, the product (or Leibniz) rule, saying that
(f g)′ = f ′g + f g′ and the chain rule by Newton, (f (g(x)))′ = f ′(g(x))g′(x) are
a matter of algebra of polynomials.

The trick developed here can be used to diﬀerentiate all rational functions,
and even algebraic functions that are deﬁned implicitly by algebraic equations,
if we use implicit diﬀerentiation.

holds for any polynomial p, and explains why tangents clings the graphs. We
will use it in the next subsection to understand why a polynomial with a positive
derivative is increasing.

2.3 Monotonicity principle

The derivative is a mathematical metaphor for the instantaneous velocity, or
the instantaneous rate of change of a function relative to its argument. So
we would expect that a function with positive derivative would be increasing.
Let us see why it is true for polynomials. Assume that p′(x) > 0 for any x
such that A 6 x 6 B. We want to show that p(A) 6 p(B). We can deal
with a simpler case p′(x) > C > 0 ﬁrst. Our basic estimate (1) tells us that
a 6 C/K.
p(x)
Therefore, p(A) 6 p(B), since we can get from Ato B by steps shorter than
C/K. To get to the original assumption, we can consider q(x) = p(x) + Cx with
B), therefore p(A) 6 p(B) since
p(A) > C(A
C > 0 and conclude that p(B)
C is arbitrary.

see how monotonicity is related to positivity of the area.

2.4 Formal integration

It can be introduced before the basic estimate is treated and monotonicity the-
orem is demonstrated, and it is very easy for polynomials. Besides, it provides
a strong evidence for the Newton-Leibniz theorem. The simplest examples of
course are the constants and the linear functions. A bit more work is required
to calculate the areas under the other power curves, and may give the skep-
tics an opportunity to use such tools as algebra, the geometric series and even
combinatorics (to estimate the sum 1k + 2k + . . . + nk). Newton-Leibniz is very
intuitive and can be explained early on. The integration rules are just the rules
of diﬀerentiation, rewritten in terms of integrals. This formal theory can be
used right away to solve some interesting problems in geometry and physics.

3 Uniform Lipschitz Calculus

How can we extend our calculus to functions more general than polynomials?
As it often happens in mathematics, we just look at some useful property or a
formula and make it into a deﬁnition (think about the Pythagorean Theorem).

4

The useful property here will be the basic estimate (1) from section 2.2, so we
call a function f uniformly Lipschitz diﬀerentiable (ULD) if the estimate

tions.

3.1 The automatic Lipschitz estimate for the derivative

We know that the derivatives of polynomials are also polynomials. What would
be the analogous fact for ULD functions? It turns out that theis derivatives
are Lipschitz, i.e., they satisfy the estimate
with L
independent of x and a.

as diﬀerentiation of polynomials is related to their factoring.

fact that makes the non-standard approach to calculus simple. More generally,
many pointwise estimates on a hyperreal interval are in fact uniform. In uni-
form diﬀerentiation theory we work with uniform estimates directly and get the
results much cheaper, without any inﬁnitesimals that are not constructive. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal number where I wrote a section “An
intuitive approach to the ultrapower construction” and references there.

3.2

Integration, existence of a primitive and Newton-Leibniz

It is easy to integrate polynomials and rational functions since antiderivatives
can be written down explicitly in terms of the elementary functions, but this
situation is rather exceptional. Now, we know that the derivative of any ULD
function is Lipschiz, and we ask if an antiderivative exists for any Lipschitz func-
tion, in what sense it exists, and how it can be calculated. The idea is to deﬁne

5

6
the deﬁnite integral as the area under the graph and then to make sense out
of the notion of the area by constructing explicit approximations (pretty much
following the approach of the Greeks, later developed by Riemann, Darboux,
Jordan, and Lebesque), and then prove Newton-Leibniz. The case of Lipschitz,
and other uniformly continuous functions, is particularly simple, and requires
hardly any sophistication. A picture (that is worth a 1000 words) is available
on page 13 at http://www.mathfoolery.org/talk-2004.pdf and pages 43-44 at
http://www.mathfoolery.org/lathead.pdf with a proof of Newton-Leibniz.

4 Other Moduli of Continuity

Sometimes calculus based on Lipschitz estimates is too restrictive, for example,
the function x3/2 has √x for the derivative, which is not Lipschiz, since it grows
too fast near x = 0. To treat this function as diﬀerentiable, we can relax the
3/2.

m(0) = 0, and subadditive, i.e., m(x + y) 6 m(x) + m(y). All the Lipschitz

4.1 An estimate of the diﬀerence quotient

Let m be a subadditive modulus of continuity, in particular, m is increasing,
deﬁned for x > 0, and m(x)/x is decreasing for x > 0, and let f be a uniformly
m - diﬀerentiable function, i.e. there is a uniform in x and a estimate with some
constant K:

that means that the diﬀerence quotient is a uniformly m - continuous. That
will justify the idea that uniform diﬀerentiation is factoring in the class of m -
continuous functions of 2 variables.

Because only the increments of the independent variable and the correspond-
ing increments of the values of f are involved in the diﬀerence quotient, we can
assume a = 0 = f (0) and the inequality we want becomes

4.2 Epsilon-delta and moduli of continuity

We used diﬀerent moduli of continuity to describe uniform continuity and diﬀer-
entiability. The question is: “how much of the classical theory of continuous and
smooth functions do we miss, if any?” The answer to this question is “nothing.”
Let us consider uniform continuity, uniform diﬀerentiability is analogous.

The classical way to describe uniform continuity of a function f is to say

We want to show that there is a modulus of continuity m, such that the

inequality
) holds. Let us consider the following
|
|
function: g(h) = sup
f (x)
. We know that g will be
{|
|
positive, increasing, and g(h)
0, so g will become continuous at
of
0 if we put g(0) = 0. Now, on (h, y) plane consider the set
points under the graph of g. Take the convex hull of this set. The upper edge
of this convex hull will be the graph of a concave (and therefore subadditive)
modulus of continuity for f .

It is needless to say that in some questions (such as topological classiﬁcation

be a nuisance, and not fruitful. Then we can throw all the uniformly continuous
or uniformly diﬀerentiable functions into one big pile and enjoy the generality.

of the function f should be the same. Now consider the approximation of these

6.3 The equality of the mixed derivatives

Probably the simplest way to understand why fxy = fyx is to use the Green’s
formula. Here is how. Let us consider a rectangle ABCD on the (x, y)
plane
where f is deﬁned. A = (a, c), B = (b, c), C = (b, d) and D = (a, d). There are
two ways to get from A to C. We can go from A to B and then from B to C,
or we can go from A to D and then from D to C. The total change in f should
be the same for both ways. Let us write down this change in terms of the line
integrals of the partial derivatives.

f (C) = f (B)

f (A) + f (C)

f (B) =

and on the other hand,
