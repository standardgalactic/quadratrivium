THE GRONE-MERRIS CONJECTURE

HUA BAI

Abstract. In spectral graph theory, the Grone and Merris conjecture
asserts that the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of a ﬁnite graph is
majorized by the conjugate degree sequence of this graph. We give a
complete proof for this conjecture.

The Laplacian of a simple graph G with n vertices is a positive semi-
deﬁnite n × n matrix L(G) that mimics the geometric Laplacian of a Rie-
mannian manifold; see §1 for deﬁnitions, and [2, 14] for comprehensive bib-
liographies on the graph Laplacian. The spectrum sequence λ(G) of L(G)
can be listed in non-increasing order as

λ1(G) ≥ λ2(G) ≥ · · · ≥ λn−1(G) ≥ λn(G) = 0.

For two non-increasing real sequences x and y of length n, we say that x

is majorized by y (denoted x 4 y) if

k

xi ≤

This notion was introduced because of the following fundamental theorem.

Theorem 1 (Schur-Horn Dominance Theorem [18, 11]). There exists a
Hermitian matrix H with diagonal entry sequence x and spectrum sequence
(cid:3)
y if and only if x 4 y.

In particular, if d(G) = (d1, d2, . . . , dn)T is the non-increasing degree se-
quence of G, which coincides the diagonal entry sequence of the Laplacian
matrix L(G), the Schur-Horn Dominance Theorem implies that d(G) 4
λ(G). Grone [7] improves this majorization result:
if G has at least one
edge, then (d1 + 1, d2, . . . , dn−1, dn − 1)T 4 λ(G).

For a non-negative integral sequence d, we deﬁne its conjugate degree
2, . . . , d′

sequence as the sequence d′ = (d′

n)T where

1, d′

Another important majorization relation is the following.

Theorem 2 (Gale-Ryser [6, 17]). There exists a (0, 1)-matrix A with row
and column sum vectors r and c if and only if r 4 c′.
(cid:3)

Applying this to the adjacency matrix of G immediately gives that d(G) 4

d′(G).

In 1994, Grone and Merris [8, 9] raised the natural question whether
the Laplacian spectrum sequence and the conjugate degree sequence are
majorization comparable.

Grone-Merris Conjecture. For any graph G, the Laplacian spectrum is
majorized by the conjugate degree sequence

λ(G) 4 d′(G).

In this paper, we give a complete proof to the Grone-Merris Conjecture.
As a consequence, we have the double majorization d(G) 4 λ(G) 4 d′(G).

See [3] for a partial result in this direction, as well as [19, 12, 13, 1] for
proofs in the special cases. See also [3] for a generalization to simplicial
complexes, which is still open.

1. The Laplacian matrix and the majorization relation

Let G = (V, E) be a simple ﬁnite graph with n = |V | vertices. We write
i ∼ j when the i-th vertex is adjacent to the j-th vertex, and we let di
denote the degree of the i-th vertex.

The Laplacian matrix L(G) of the graph G is the n × n matrix deﬁned

by

L(G)ij =

if i = j;
di
−1 if i ∼ j;
0

otherwise.




We can also express the Laplacian as L(G) = D−A, where D is the diagonal
matrix deﬁned by the degree sequence, and A is the adjacency (0, 1)-matrix
of the graph.



It is well-known that L(G) is positive semi-deﬁnite, since it corresponds

to the quadratic form
xT L(G)x =

(xi − xj)2 for x = (x1, . . . , xn)T ∈ Rn.

i∼j
X

Let λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λn)T be the non-increasing spectrum sequence of the
Laplacian matrix L(G). The smallest eigenvalue is λn = 0, with eigenvector
1n = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T .

Given two vectors x = (x1, . . . , xn)T and y = (y1, . . . , yn)T in Rn, rear-

range their components in non-increasing order as

x[1] ≥ x[2] ≥ · · · ≥ x[n],

y[1] ≥ y[2] ≥ · · · ≥ y[n].

We will make use of the following majorization inequality.

λ(H1 + H2) 4 λ(H1) + λ(H1).

(cid:3)

2. Split graphs

A graph is split (also called semi-bipartite in [12]) if its vertices can be
partitioned into a clique V1 and a co-clique V2. This is equivalent to saying
that the subgraph induced by V1 is complete, and that the subgraph induced
by V2 is an independent set. See [5, 20, 15, 10] for many characterizations
and properties of split graphs.

Given a split graph G = (V, E), let N = |V1| be the size of the clique,
and M = |V2| be the size of the co-clique. Let δ(G) be the maximum degree
of vertices in V2. Clearly δ(G) ≤ N , and the Laplacian matrix of the split
graph G is of the form

L(G) =

(cid:18)

KN + D1 −A

−AT

,

D2 (cid:19)

where KN is the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph on N vertices,
where D1 and D2 are diagonal matrices with diagonal entries the vertex
degrees of V1, V2 respectively, and where A is the adjacency matrix for
edges between V1 and V2.

The Laplacian matrix is symmetric, and therefore Hermitian.

Theorem 4 (Courant-Fischer-Weyl [16]). Let the n × n matrix H be Her-
mitian, with eigenvalues λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn. Then

λk = max

dim(S)=k

,

where the max (resp. min) is taken over all k-dimensional (resp. (n−k +1)-
dimensional) subspaces of Rn.
(cid:3)

We ﬁrst investigate the Laplacian spectrum of a split graph.

Proposition 5. If G is a split graph of clique size N , then

λN −1(G) ≥ N ≥ δ(G) ≥ λN +1(G).

Proof. To prove the inequalities involving λN −1(G) and λN +1(G) by the
Courant-Fischer-Weyl Min-Max Principle, it suﬃces to ﬁnd an (N − 1)-
dimensional (resp. M -dimensional) subspace for which the action of L(G)
has a desirable lower (resp. upper) bound. There are natural candidates.

Let P ⊂ RM +N be the (N − 1)-dimensional subspace consisting of all
with u ∈ RN and u ⊥ 1N . Then for any unit

vectors of the form
vector u ∈ Rn,
u

= h(KN + D1)u, ui = N + hD1u, ui ≥ N.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:28)
Similarly, consider the M -dimensional subspace Q ⊂ RM +N consisting of
with u ∈ RM . Then for any unit vector u,

all vectors of the form

(cid:19)(cid:29)

(cid:18)

L(G)

= hD2u, ui ≤ δ(G).

(cid:28)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:29)

This proves our ﬁrst statement part that λN −1(G) ≥ N ≥ δ(G) ≥ λN +1(G).
When λN (G) ≥ N , we assert that the degree of any vertex in the clique
V1 is at least N . For this, suppose that our assertion is false, namely that
there exists a vertex v0 ∈ V1 with degree less than N . Then this vertex v0
is adjacent to none of the vertices of the co-clique V2. Consequently G can
be regarded as a split graph with new clique V1 \ {v0} and new co-clique
N = N − 1. Applying the ﬁrst part
V2 ∪ {v0}. The size of the new clique is
of the proposition, we obtain that

e
λN (G) = λ eN +1(G) ≤

N = N − 1,

which is a contradiction.

3. The homotopy method

This section is devoted to proving Lemma 6. We adopt a homotopy
method, following an idea of Katz [12] in his proof of the Grone-Merris
Conjecture for 1-regular semi-bipartite graph.

Let α ∈ [0, 1]. Deﬁne an (M + N ) × (M + N ) matrix Lα as
KN + M −JN ×M
−JM ×N

Lα = (1 − α)

−AT

+ α

KN + D1 −A

N

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

D2 (cid:19)

where JM ×N denotes the M × N matrix whose entries are all equal to 1.

Note that L1 = L(G) is the matrix we are interested in, and that L0 is the
Laplacian of a complete split graph. The spectrum of L0 is well-understood:

Lemma 7. The Laplacian spectrum of the complete split graph of clique size
N and co-clique size M is

{ (M + N )(N ), N (M −1), 0(1) },
where P (Q) denotes Q copies of the number P . The eigenspace corresponding

to the eigenvalue N consists of all vectors of the form

, where v is

M -dimensional and v ⊥ 1M ; the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue
(M + N ) is spanned by the orthogonal vectors
(0i−1, M + N − i, −1M +N −i)T ,

1 ≤ i ≤ N.

Lemma 8. If λN (G) > N or λN (G) = N > δ(G), then
N +1 ≤ N < λ(α)
λ(α)

N for all 0 ≤ α < 1.

Proof. We again make use of the Courant-Fischer-Weyl Min-Max Principle.
Recall that the M -dimensional subspace Q ⊂ RM +N consists of all vectors

of the form

(cid:18)

Lα

0N
u

(cid:19)
0N
u

(cid:28)

(cid:18)

with u ∈ RM . Then for any unit vector u,

0N
u

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:29)

= (1 − α)hN u, ui + αhD1(u), ui

≤ (1 − α)N + αδ(G) ≤ N.

Therefore, the (N + 1)-th largest eigenvalue λ(α)

N +1 is at most N .

For the eigenvalue λ(α)

N , let ˜P be the N -dimensional subspace which is
spanned by the eigenvectors of L1 corresponding to the N largest eigenval-
ues. Clearly ˜P ⊥ 1M +N . For any unit vector v ∈ ˜P , we know from Lemma

6

HUA BAI

7 that hL0(v), vi ≥ N . Moreover,

hLα(v), vi = αhL1(v), vi + (1 − α)hL0(v), vi

≥ α λN (G) + (1 − α)N ≥ N.

Therefore, the N -th largest eigenvalue λ(α)

N is at least N .
We next proceed to show that the inequality on λ(α)

α < 1. We already know that λ(0)
then the above arguments show that necessarily

N = M +N . If λ(α)

N is strict, when 0 ≤
N = N for some 0 < α < 1,

λN (G) = N,

hL1v, vi = N, and L0(v) = N v.

The ﬁrst condition λN (G) = N implies that δ(G) < N , from our assumption
on λN (G); the third condition L0(v) = N v implies that v is a unit vector in
Ker(L0 − N ), thus in turn a unit vector of Q. Then

which contradicts the second condition hL1v, vi = N .

(cid:3)

hL1v, vi ≤ δ(G) < N,

We now consider all possible N -dimensional subspaces

where V (α) is an M × N matrix. Here the notation of the subspace means

that the subspace is spanned by the column vectors of the matrix

IN
V (α)

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

Lemma 9. If the subspace

of Lα, then the matrix V (α) solves the quadratic matrix equation

⊆ (1M +N )⊥ is an invariant subspace

Proof. It is easy to see that the orthogonal complement in RM +N of the

V (α)

subspace

is the subspace

. If the subspace

(cid:18)

(cid:19)
is an invariant subspace of Lα, then so is its orthogonal complement, since
Lα is a symmetric matrix.

V (α)[(1 − α)M + α(N + D1)]
= − (1 − α)JM ×N − αAT + α

The quadratic matrix equation is complicated, and is almost impossible

to be solved explicitly. Fortunately, we do not have to do so.

Proof. Consider the subset

Γ = {α ∈ [0, 1) : V (α) ∈ Ω}

of the half-open half-closed interval [0, 1).

When α = 0, v(0)

ji ≡ − 1

M (see Lemma 7 or Equation (1) ). As a conse-

quence, V (0) ∈ Ω, so that 0 ∈ Γ and Γ is not empty.

Suppose there is a sequence of points αn ∈ Γ and limn→∞ αn = α with α
still in [0, 1). By Lemma 10, limn→∞ V (αn) = V (α). Because Ω is a compact
set, so V (α) ∈ Ω and α ∈ Γ. Therefore, Γ is a closed subset of [0, 1).

Suppose α ∈ Γ, namely V (α) ∈ Ω for some α ∈ [0, 1). Because the
in Equation (1) are all non-negative, we

Therefore V (α) is contained in the interior of Ω. Since V (α) depends contin-
uously on α, it follows that Γ is an open subset of [0, 1).

The interval [0, 1) is connected, and Γ is an open closed non-empty subset

of it, therefore Γ is equal to [0, 1).

By continuity at α = 1, V (1) is also in Ω. This proves that V (α) ∈ Ω for
(cid:3)

all α ∈ [0, 1].

4. Proof of Grone-Merris Conjecture

For consistence we restate the Grone-Merris Conjecture here.

Grone-Merris Conjecture. For any graph G, its Laplacian spectrum is
majorized by its conjugate degree sequence, namely λ(G) 4 d′(G).

The Grone-Merris Conjecture behaves nicely under complementation, in

the sense of the proposition below.

The complement graph of a graph G is a graph G on the same vertices
such that two vertices of G are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent
in G. The Laplacian matrices of the graph G and of its complementary
graph G are related by the property that

All these matrices commute with each other, so that

L(G) + L(G) + Jn = nIn.

λ(G) = (n − λn−1(G), . . . , n − λ1(G), 0);
d′(G) = (n − d′
1(G), 0).

n−1(G), . . . , n − d′

From these we see that

Proposition 12. For any 1 ≤ k < n, the k-th inequality holds for the graph
G if and only if the (n − k − 1)-th inequality holds for the complement graph
G.

We are now ready to prove the Grone-Merris Conjecture.
Assume that the Grone-Merris Conjecture is not true, and the graph
G = (V, E) is a counterexample. Namely, there exists an integer k with
1 < k < n = |V |, such that

Without loss of generality, we can assume that this integer k is minimum

over all counterexamples. Then we have

Moreover, we can further assume that the number |E| of edges is minimum
over all counterexamples with the same k. Under this assumption, we claim
that

Lemma 13. For any two vertices i, j in the graph G, if di ≤ k and dj ≤ k,
then they are not adjacent in G.

Proof. We will prove this by contradiction. Assuming that the lemma is
false, namely there exists a pair of vertices such that

di ≤ k,

dj ≤ k,

i ∼ j.

This contradicts our assumption that G was a counterexample, and there-

fore concludes the proof.

Next, we add new edges to G to get a new graph

G. Add to G a new

edge ij for any pair of vertices i, j in G such that

di ≥ k, dj ≥ k, and i ≁ j.

The new graph
The clique of

G consists of all vertices of G whose degree is at least k,

The co-clique consists of all vertices of G whose degree is less than k, so the
