Abstract. A given question can be defined in terms of the set of statements or assertions that
answer it.   Application of the logic of inference to this set of assertions allows one to derive the
logic  of  inquiry  among  questions.   There  are  interesting  symmetries  between  the  logics  of
inference  and  inquiry;  where  probability  describes  the  degree  to  which  a  premise  implies  an
assertion,  there  exists  an  analogous  quantity  that  describes  the  bearing  or  relevance  that  a
question  has  on  an  outstanding  issue.   These  have  been  extended  to  suggest  that  the  logic  of
inquiry results in functional relationships analogous to, although more general than, those found
in information theory.

Employing lattice theory, I examine in greater detail the structure of the space of assertions
and  questions  demonstrating  that  the  symmetries  between  the  logical  relations  in  each  of  the
spaces  derive  directly  from  the  lattice  structure.   Furthermore,  I  show  that  while  symmetries
between  the  spaces  exist,  the  two  lattices  are  not  isomorphic.   The  lattice  of  assertions  is
N2 ,  whereas  the  lattice  of  real  questions  is  shown  to  be  a

sublattice of the free distributive lattice 
.   Thus there does not exist a one-to-one
mapping of assertions to questions, there is no reflection symmetry between the two spaces, and
questions in general do not possess unique complements.   Last, with these lattice structures in
mind, I discuss the relationship between probability, relevance and entropy.

“Man has made some machines that can answer questions provided the facts
are profusely stored in them, but we will never be able to make a machine that
will ask questions. The ability to ask the right question is more than half the
battle of finding the answer.”

INTRODUCTION

It was demonstrated by Richard T. Cox (1946, 1961) that probability theory represents
a generalization of Boolean implication to a degree of implication represented by a
real number.  This insight has placed probability theory on solid ground as a calculus
for conducting inductive inference.   While at this stage this work is undoubtedly his
greatest  contribution,  his  ultimate  paper,  which  takes  steps  to  derive  the  logic  of
questions in terms of the set of assertions that answer them, may prove yet to be the
most revolutionary.   While much work has been done extending and applying Cox's
results (Fry 1995, 1998, 2000; Fry & Sova 1998; Bierbaum & Fry 2002; Knuth 2001,
2002), the structure of the space of questions remains poorly understood.  In this paper

I  employ  lattice  theory  to  describe  the  structure  of  the  space  of  assertions  and
demonstrate how logical implication on the Boolean lattice provides the framework on
which the calculus of inductive inference is constructed.  I then introduce questions by
following Cox (1979) and defining a question in terms of the set of assertions that can
answer  it.   The  lattice  structure  of  questions  is  then  explored  and  the  calculus  for
manipulating the relevance of a question to an unresolved issue is examined.
The first section is devoted to the formalism behind the concepts of partially ordered
sets and lattices.  The second section deals with the logic of assertions and introduces
Boolean  lattices.   In  the  third  section,  I  introduce  the  definition  of  a  question  and
introduce the concept of an ideal question.  From the set of ideal questions I construct
the entire question lattice identifying it as a free distributive lattice.   Assuredly real
questions are then shown to comprise a sublattice of the entire lattice of questions.  In
the last section I discuss the relationship between probability, relevance, and entropy
in the context of the lattice structure of these spaces.

FORMALISM

Partially Ordered Sets

In this section I begin with the concept of a partially ordered set, called a poset, which
a £ , which satisfies for
is defined as a set with a binary ordering relation denoted by 
all a, b, c (Birkhoff 1967):

Alternatively one can write 
a <  and read “a is less than b” or “a is properly

If 
a < , but 
b
 is not true for any x in the poset
contained in b”.  Furthermore, if 
a p .  In this case b can be considered an
P, then we say that “b covers a”, written 
immediate  superior  to  a in a hierarchy.   The set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
along with the binary relation “less than or equal to”  £  is an example of a poset.   In
2 < , but there is no number x in the

visualize the structure imposed on these sets by the binary relation.

Posets also possess a duality in the sense that the converse of any partial ordering
is itself a partial ordering (Birkhoff 1967).  This is known as the duality principle and
can  be  understood  by  changing  the  ordering  relation  “is  included  in”  to  “includes”
which equates graphically to flipping the poset diagram upside-down.

With  these  examples  of  posets  in  mind,  I  must  briefly  describe  a  few  more
Pa Œ
concepts.  If one considers a subset X of a poset P, we can talk about an element 
Xx Œ ; such an element is called an upper  bound of the
that contains every element 
subset X.  The least upper bound, or l.u.b., is an element in P, which is an upper bound
of X and is contained in every other upper bound of X.  Thus the l.u.b. can be thought
of as the immediate successor to the subset X as one moves up the hierarchy.  Dually
we can define the greatest lower bound, or g.l.b.  The least element of a subset X is an
Xx Œ .  The greatest element is defined dually.

FIGURE  1.  The poset 
 results in the
diagram  shown  here.   The  binary  relation  Õ   dictates  the  height  of  an  element  in  the  diagram.   The
concept  of  covering  allows  us  to  draw  lines  between  a  pair  of  elements  signifying  that  the  higher
element  in  the  pair  is  an  immediate  successor  in  the  hierarchy.   Note  that  {a}  is  covered  by  two

Lattices

The next important concept is the lattice.  A lattice is a poset P where every pair of
elements  x and y  has  a  least  upper  bound  called  the  join,  denoted  as 
x ⁄ ,  and  a
greatest lower bound called the meet, denoted by 
x Ÿ .  The meet and join obey the
following relations (Birkhoff 1967):

(y is the least upper bound of x and y).

The relations L1-4 above come in pairs related by the duality principle; as they hold
∂L ), which is obtained by reversing
equally for a lattice L and its dual lattice (denoted 
the  ordering  relation  thus  exchanging  upper  bounds  for  lower  bounds  and  hence
exchanging joins and meets.  Note that the meet and join are generally defined for all
lattices satisfying the definition of a lattice; even though the notation is the same they
should not be confused with the logical conjunction and disjunction, which refer to a
specific ordering relation.  I will get to how they are related and we will see that lattice
theory provides a general framework that clears up some mysteries surrounding the
space of assertions and the space of questions.

THE LOGIC OF ASSERTIONS

Boolean Lattices

I introduce the concept of a Boolean lattice, which possesses structure in addition to
L1-4.  A Boolean lattice is a distributive lattice satisfying the following identities for
all x, y, z:

B1.

x

(

⁄

)

(

x

⁄

y

)

Ÿ

(

x

⁄

z

)

(Distributive)

Again the two identities are related by the duality principle.  Last the Boolean lattice is
a complemented lattice, such that each element x has one and only one complement
x~  that satisfies (Birkhoff 1967):

where O and I are the least and greatest elements, respectively, of the lattice.  Thus a
Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice.

We now consider a specific application where the elements  a  and  b  are logical
y
assertions and the ordering relation is 
, read “x implies y”.  The logical
operations of conjunction and disjunction can be used to generate a set of four logical
statements, which with the binary relation “implies” forms a Boolean lattice displayed

the logical conjunction of a and b, and the join of a and b, written 
ba ⁄ , is identified
with the logical disjunction of a and b.  I will require that the lattice be complemented,
,  and  vice  versa.   If  we
which  means  that  the  complement  of  a must be b, 
require the assertions to be exhaustive, then either a or b are true, and their join, the
disjunction

and is thus I, which in logic is called the truism, as it is always true.   Similarly their

FIGURE 2.  The lattice diagram formed from two assertions  a  and  b .   In this diagram I chose to use
arrows to emphasize the direction of implication among the assertions in the lattice.

The symbol for the truism  I  mirrors the  I  used by Jaynes to symbolize “one’s
prior  information”  (Jaynes,  unpublished).   In  fact,  in  an  inference  problem,  if  one
believes that one of a set of assertions is true then one’s prior knowledge consists, in
part, of the fact that the disjunction of the entire set of assertions is true.   Thus the
notation of lattice theory agrees quite nicely with the notation used by Jaynes.

Deductive inference refers to the process where one knows that an assertion  a  is
true, and deduces that any assertion reached by a chain of arrows must also be true.  If
x £ , we say that
for two assertions x and y elements of a lattice L, x is included in y, 
x implies y, denoted 

y

These elements that cover  O  are called atoms  or  points.   As all other elements are
formed from joins of these atoms, they are called generators or generating elements

Inductive Inference guided by Lattices

Inductive inference derives from deductive inference as a generalization of Boolean
implication to a relative degree of implication.   In the lattice formalism that this is
equivalent to a generalization from inclusion as defined by the binary ordering relation
of  the  poset  to  a  relative  degree  of  inclusion.   The  degree  of  implication  can  be
represented as a real number denoted  (
)y
x Æ  defined within a closed interval (Cox
x £ ,  “x  is
y
1946,  1961).   Contrast  this  notation  with

measure  relating  arbitrary  pairs  of  assertions  in  the  lattice.   As  the  binary  ordering
relation  of  the  poset  is  all  that  is  needed  to  define  the  lattice,  there  does  not  exist
sufficient structure to define such a measure.   Thus we should expect some form of
indeterminacy that will require us to impose additional structure on the space.   This
manifests itself by the fact that the prior probabilities must be externally defined.

Cox derived relations that the relative degree of implication should follow in order
to  be  consistent  with  the  rules  of  Boolean  logic,  i.e.  the  structure  of  the  Boolean
lattice.   I will briefly mention the origin of these relations; the original work can be
found in (Cox 1946, 1961, 1979) with a slightly more detailed summary than the one
to follow by Knuth (2002).   From the associativity of the conjunction of assertions,

THE LOGIC OF QUESTIONS

“It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.”

-Eugene Ionesco (1912-1994)

“To be, or not to be: that is the question.”

-William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act 3 scene 1, (1579)

Defining a Question

Richard  Cox  (1979)  defines  a  system  of  assertions  as  a  set  of  assertions,  which
includes every assertion implying any assertion of the set.   The irreducible  set is a
subset of the system, which contains every assertion that implies no assertion other
than itself.  Finally, a defining set of a system is a subset of the system, which includes
32   in  Figure  3  right.   To
the  irreducible  set.   As  an  example,  consider  the  lattice 
generate a system of assertions, we will start with the simple set 
.   The system
must  also  contain  all  the  assertions  in  the  lattice  which  imply  both  assertion a  and
assertion  b.   These are all the assertions that can be reached by climbing down the
lattice from these two elements.   In this case, the lattice is rather small and the only
,{
assertion that implies the assertions in this set is O, the absurdity.  Thus 
 is a
system of assertions.  The irreducible set is simply the set 
.  Last, there are two
.  Note that in general there are many
defining sets for this system: 
defining  sets.   Given  a  defining  set,  one  can  reduce  it  to  the  irreducible  set  by
removing assertions that are implied by another assertion in the defining set, or expand
it by including implicants of assertions in the defining set, to the point of including the
entire system.

Cox defines a question as the system of assertions that answer that question.  Why
the  system  of  assertions?   The  reason  is  that  any  assertion  that  implies  another
assertion that answers a question is itself an answer to the same question.   Thus the
system  of  assertions  represents  an  exhaustive  set  of  possible  answers  to  a  given
question.  Two questions are then equivalent if they are answered by the same system
of assertions.  This can be easily demonstrated with the questions “Is it raining?” and
“Is it not raining?”  Both questions are answered by the statements “It is raining!” and
“It is not raining!”, and thus they are equivalent in the sense that they ask the same
thing.   Furthermore, one can now impose an ordering relation on questions, as some
questions  may  include  other  questions  in  the  sense  that  one  system  of  assertions
contains another system of assertions as a subset.

Consider the following question:   T = “Who stole the tarts made by the Queen of
Hearts all on a summer day?”   This question can be written as a set of all possible
statements that answer it.  Here I contrive a simple defining set for T, which I claim is
an exhaustive, irreducible set

}.

    
This is a fun example as it is not clear from the story1 that the tarts were even stolen.
In the event that no one stole the tarts, the question is answered by no true statement
and is called a vain question (Cox 1979).  If there exists a true statement that answers
the question, that question is called a real question.  For the sake of this example, we
assume that the question T is real, and consider an alternate question A = “Did or did
not Alice steal the tarts?”  A defining set for this question is

A  ≡  { 

a =

As  the  defining  set  of  T  is  exhaustive,  the  statement 
a~   above,  which  is  the
complement  of  a ,  is  equivalent  to  the  disjunction  of  all  the  statements  in  the
.   As  the  question  A is a
irreducible  set  of  T except for  a ,  that  is 
system of assertions, which includes all the assertions that imply any assertion in its
defining set, the system of assertions A must also contain k, m and w as each implies
a~ .  Thus system of assertions T is a subset of the system of assertions A, and so by
answering T, one will have answered A.  Of course, the converse is not generally true.
In the past has been said (Knuth 2001) that the question A includes the question T, but
it may be more obvious to see that the question T answers the question A.  As I will
demonstrate,  identifying  the  conjunction  of  questions  with  the  meet  and  the
disjunction  of  questions  with  the  join  is  consistent  with  the  ordering  relation  “is  a
subset of”.   This however is dual to the ordering relation intuitively adopted by Cox,
“includes  as  a  subset”,  which  alone  is  the  source  of  the  interchange  between
conjunction and disjunction in identifying relations among assertions with relations
among questions in Cox’s formalism.

With the ordering relation "is a subset of" the meet or conjunction of two questions,
called the joint question, can be shown to be the intersection of the sets of assertions
answering each question.

It should be noted that Cox’s treatment dealt with the case where there the system was
not built on an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive atomic assertions.  This leads to a
more  general  definition  of  the  joint  question  (Cox  1979),  which  reduces  to  set
intersection in the case of an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive atomic assertions.
Similarly,  the  join  or  disjunction  of  two  questions,  called  the  common  question, is
defined as the question that the two questions ask in common.  It can be shown to be
the union of the sets of assertions answering each question

In the case that the lattice A is a lattice of assertions, property I1 above is a necessary
and sufficient condition for the set J to be a system of assertions.  Thus each ideal of a
lattice  of  assertions  represents  a  unique  system  of  assertions,  or  equivalently  a
question.  For this reason, I call these systems of assertions which are also ideals, ideal
questions.

Furthermore, one can show (Birkhoff 1967, Theorem 3.3) that the set of all ideals of
any lattice L ordered by set inclusion forms a lattice Lˆ , and that for a finite lattice  Lˆ  is
isomorphic  to  L.   This  is  significant,  as  the  space  of  ideal  questions  possesses  a
structure isomorphic to the space of assertions (Figure 5).  An inverse mapping can be

At  this  point  the  space  of  assertions looks  isomorphic to  the  space  of  questions.
However,  recall  that  the  ideal  questions  satisfy  an  additional  property  I2,  which
requires  that  there  be  a  single  greatest  element  in  the  set.   This  is  not  a  property
required of questions in general by the definition put forward by Cox.  Thus there exist
additional questions not represented in the lattice  Qˆ .  One such question is

Real Questions

)

(NQ

Thus  far  in  these  examinations  one  important  point  has  been  neglected;  I  have  not
stipulated that the assertions defining a question be exhaustive.   That is, there is no
assurance that all of the questions in the lattice 
 are real questions answerable
by a true assertion.  As the atoms of the lattice of assertions  N2  are an exhaustive set,
then  only  questions  containing  the  set  of  atoms  as  a  subset  are  assured  to  be  real
questions.  There of course may be questions that do not contain this entire set, that for
a  given  situation  may  be  answerable  by  a  true  assertion,  but  this  in  general  is  not
guaranteed  a  priori.   The least element that contains the set of atoms as a subset is

Inductive Inquiry on Lattices

As briefly described earlier, the sum rule of probability (2) derives from the fact that
Boolean lattices are uniquely complemented.  In Cox's earlier work, he described how
there  could  be  no  complete  analog  in  the  algebra  of  systems  (questions)  to  the
complement  in  the  algebra  of  assertions  (Cox  1961,  pp.  52-3).   In  a  footnote  Cox
describes how Boole  (1854) applied  his algebra to  classes of objects in  addition  to
propositions (see Figure 1).  He notes that one might be inclined to think of a system
as a class as defined by Boole, however the set of assertions not included in a system,
while forming a class, do not itself form a system.   This implies that the algebra of
systems cannot possibly be Boolean.

In  Cox'  paper  on  inquiry  (1979)  he  defines  a  mutually  contradictory  pair  of
questions "as a pair whose conjunction is equal to the conjunction of all questions, and
whose  disjunction  is  equal  to  the  disjunction  of  all  questions."   This  definition  is
acceptable as long as one keeps in mind that he is working with the ordering relation
dual to convention.  However, he does not prove their existence.  While my discussion
on join-irreducible elements may be convincing to a mathematician familiar with the
theory, those less-familiar may require more tangible evidence.  Consider the question

Last, distributive lattices share the associative and commutative properties of the
Boolean lattice.  For this reason, one can fully expect that generalizations of the binary
ordering relation to measures of degree of inclusion will result in a calculus possessing
a product rule as well as a rule analogous to Bayes' Theorem.

J(A) and A is called the dual of O(Q), however this duality should not be confused
with the duality induced by the ordering relation discussed earlier.  Furthermore, it can
be shown that the join-irreducible map takes products of lattices to sums of lattices, so
that  one  can  think  of 
  as  being  the  logarithm  and
exponential  functions,  respectively,  for  lattices  (Davey  &  Priestley  2002).   This  is
quite  enticing  in  that  it  further  supports  our  expectations  that  the  relevance  of  a
question on an issue can be represented in terms of the logarithm of the probabilities
of  the  assertions  involved,  and  that  entropy  may  still  play  the  same  role  with
distributive lattices as probability does with Boolean lattices.

THE ROLE OF ORDER

The lattice structure of the space of assertions and the space of questions has provided
great  insights  into  their  structures,  symmetries,  and  relationships.   In  addition,  the
associative  and  commutative  properties  of  lattices  suggest  that  analogies  to  the
familiar product rule of probability and Bayes' Theorem may appear in the calculi of
other fields where ordering relations play an important role.   This in fact may have
already been recognized with the realization that the cross-ratio in projective geometry
has  the  same  form  as  the  odds  ratio  from  Bayes'  Theorem  (Rodríguez  1991).
Considering the findings in this paper, such a relationship may no longer be such a
mystery  as  the  notion  of  closeness  in  a  projective  space  provides  such  an  ordering
relation.  In fact, we might now not be surprised to see forms identical to probability
and perhaps entropy appearing in seemingly unrelated fields.   In such cases, it is not
geometry that underlies these theories - but order.

“The important thing is not to stop questioning.”

-Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
