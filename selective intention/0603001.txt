A holographic derivation of the entanglement entropy in quantum (conformal) ﬁeld theories is
proposed from AdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that the entanglement entropy in d + 1 dimen-
sional conformal ﬁeld theories can be obtained from the area of d dimensional minimal surfaces in
AdSd+2, analogous to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for black hole entropy. We show that our
proposal perfectly reproduces the correct entanglement entropy in 2D CFT when applied to AdS3.
We also compare the entropy computed in AdS5×S5 with that of the free N = 4 super Yang-Mills.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most remarkable successes in gravitational
aspects of string theory is the microscopic derivation of
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH

tool to investigate the nature of quantum criticality (refer
to [10] and references therein for example).

For one-dimensional (1D) quantum many-body sys-
tems at criticality (i.e. 2D CFT), it is known that the
entanglement entropy is given by [10, 11]

for BPS black holes [1]. This idea relates the gravi-
tational entropy with the degeneracy of quantum ﬁeld
theory as its microscopic description. Taking near hori-
zon limit, we can regard this as a special example of
AdS/CFT correspondence [2, 3, 4].
It claims that the
d + 1 dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories (CFTd+1) are
equivalent to the (super)gravity on d+2 dimensional anti-
deSitter space AdSd+2. We expect that each CFT is sit-
ting at the boundary of AdS space.

On the other hand, there is a diﬀerent kind of entropy
called entanglement entropy (von-Neumann entropy) in
quantum mechanical systems. The entanglement entropy

provides us with a convenient way to measure how closely

is. Here, the total system is divided into two subsystems
A and B and ρA is the reduced density matrix for the

tuitively, we can think SA as the entropy for an observer
who is only accessible to the subsystem A and cannot
receive any signals from B. In this sense, the subsystem
B is analogous to the inside of a black hole horizon for an
observer sitting in A, i.e., outside of the horizon. Indeed,
an original motivation of the entanglement entropy was
its similarity to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [5, 6].

The entanglement entropy is of growing importance
in many ﬁelds of physics in our exploration for better
understanding of quantum systems. For example, in a
modern trend of condensed matter physics it has been
becoming clear that quantum phases of matter need to be
characterized by their pattern of entanglement encoded
in many-body wave functions of ground states, rather
than conventional order parameters [7, 8, 9]. Recently,
the entanglement entropy has been extensively studied in
low-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a new

In spite of these recent developments, and its simi-
larity to the black hole entropy, a comprehensive gravi-
tational interpretation of the entanglement entropy has
been lacking so far. Here, we present a simple proposal
on this issue in the light of AdS/CFT duality. Earlier
discussions from diﬀerent viewpoints can be found in e.g.
papers [12, 13]. Deﬁne the entanglement entropy SA in

where γA is the d dimensional static minimal surface in
AdSd+2 whose boundary is given by ∂A, and G(d+2)
is
the d + 2 dimensional Newton constant. Intuitively, this
suggests that the minimal surface γA plays the role of a
holographic screen for an observer who is only accessible
to the subsystem A. We show explicitly the relation (1.5)
in the lowest dimensional case d = 1, where γA is given
by a geodesic line in AdS3. We also compute SA from the
gravity side for general d and compare it with ﬁeld theory
results, which is successful at least qualitatively. From
(1.5), it is readily seen that the basic properties of the
entanglement entropy (i) SA = SB (B is the complement

We can also deﬁne the entanglement entropy at ﬁnite
temperature T = β−1. E.g. in a 2D CFT on a inﬁnitely
long line, it is given by replacing L in Eq. (1.3) with iβ
[10]. We argue that Eq. (1.5) still holds in T > 0 cases.
Note that SA = SB is no longer true if T > 0 since ρ
is in a mixed state generically. At high temperature, we
will see that this occurs due to the presence of black hole
horizon in the dual gravity description.

II. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY IN AdS3/CFT2

Let us start with the entanglement entropy in 2D
CFTs. According to AdS/CFT correspondence, gravi-
tational theories on AdS3 space of radius R are dual to
(1+1)D CFTs with the central charge [14]

c =

(2.1)

The metric of AdS3 in the global coordinate (t, ρ, θ) is

ds2 = R2

cosh ρ2dt2 + dρ2 + sinh ρ2dθ2

.

(2.2)

∞

At the boundary ρ =
of AdS3 the metric is divergent.
To regulate physical quantities we put a cutoﬀ ρ0 and
restrict the space to the bounded region ρ
ρ0. This
procedure corresponds to the UV cutoﬀ in the dual CFTs
[15]. If L is the total length of the system with both ends
identiﬁed, and a is the lattice spacing (or UV cutoﬀ) in
the CFTs, we have the relation (up to a numerical factor)

The (1+1)D spacetime for the CFT2 is identiﬁed with
the cylinder (t, θ) at the boundary ρ = ρ0. The subsys-
tem A is the region 0
2πl/L. Then γA in Eq. (1.5)
is identiﬁed with the static geodesic that connects the
boundary points θ = 0 and 2πl/L with t ﬁxed, traveling
inside AdS3 (Fig. 1 (a)). With the cutoﬀ ρ0 introduced
above, the geodesic distance LγA is given by

This entropy precisely coincides with the known CFT
result (1.3) after we remember the relation Eq. (2.3).

This proposed relation (1.5) suggests that the geodesic
(or minimal surface in the higher dimensional case) γA is
analogous to an event horizon as if B were a black hole,
In
though the division into A and B is just artiﬁcial.
other words, the observer, who is not accessible to B, will
probe γA as a holographic screen [16], instead of B itself
(Fig. 1 (b)). The minimal surface provides the severest
entropy bound when we ﬁx its boundary condition. In
our case it saturates the bound.

More generally, we can consider a subsystem A which

consists of multiple disjoint intervals as follows

the dual AdS3 description, the region (2.6) corresponds
to θ

is not straightforward to determine minimal (geodesic)
lines responsible for the entropy. However, we can ﬁnd
the answer from the entanglement entropy computed in
the CFT side. The general prescription of calculating the
entropy for such systems is given in [10] using conformal
mapping. For our system (2.6), we ﬁnd, when rewritten
in the AdS3 language, the following expression of SA

where La,b is the geodesic distance between two boundary
points a and b. We can think that the correct deﬁnition
of minimal surface is given by the numerator in Eq. (2.7).
Next we turn to the entanglement entropy at ﬁnite
temperature. We assume the spacial length of the total
system L is inﬁnitely long s.t. β/L

perature, the gravity dual of the CFT is the Euclidean

line, it is useful to remember the familiar fact that the
Euclidean BTZ black hole at temperature TBT Z is equiv-
alent to the thermal AdS3 at temperature 1/TBT Z. This

equivalence can be interpreted as a modular transfor-
mation in the CFT side [18]. If we deﬁne the new co-
ordinates r = r+ cosh ρ, r+τ = Rθ, r+ϕ = Rt, then
the metric (2.8) indeed becomes the Euclidean version of
AdS3 metric (2.2). Thus the geodesic distance can be
found in the same way as in Eq. (2.4) : cosh(LγA/R) =
1 + 2 cosh2 ρ0 sinh2
, where the UV cutoﬀ is inter-
preted as eρ0

the RG ﬂow generically drives the theory to a trivial IR

corresponds to capping oﬀ the IR region, restricting the

III. HIGHER DIMENSIONAL CASES

Motivated by the success in our gravitational deriva-
tion of the entanglement entropy for d = 1, it is inter-
esting to extend the idea to higher dimensional cases
(d
2). A natural thing to do is to replace geodesic
lines with minimal surfaces. The computations are anal-
ogous to the evaluation of Wilson loops [19], though the
dimension of relevant minimal surfaces is diﬀerent.

From these results, the entanglement entropy can be
calculated by Eq. (1.5). Each of (3.2) and (3.3) has a
a−d+1 that is proportional to the
UV divergent term
area of the boundary ∂A. This agrees with the known
‘area law’ of the entanglement entropy in quantum ﬁeld
theories [5, 6]. Note that this ‘area law’ is related to ours
Eq. (1.5) via the basic property of holography.

∼

We may prefer a physical quantity that is independent
of the cutoﬀ (i.e. universal). The second term in Eq. (3.2)
has this property. In general, when A is a ﬁnite size, there
is a universal and conformal invariant constant contribu-
tion to SA if d is even (see [20] for properties of minimal
surfaces in AdS). In (2+1)D topological ﬁeld theories the
constant contribution to SA encodes the quantum dimen-
sion and is called the topological entanglement entropy
[8, 9]. If d is odd, the coeﬃcient of the logarithmic term

log(l/a) is universal as in Eq. (1.3).

IV. YANG-MILLS AT FINITE TEMPERATURE

As the ﬁnal example, we discuss the

= 4 super Yang-
Mills theory on R3 at a ﬁnite temperature T , which is
dual to the AdS black hole deﬁned by the metric [24]

(4.3)
We can regard this entropy as a part of the Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy of black 5-branes [23], which is propor-
tional to the area of horizon situated at u = u0. Thus we
can interpret the part (4.3) as a thermal entropy contri-
bution to the total entanglement entropy at ﬁnite tem-
perature. In our gravitational description, this part arises
because the minimal surface wraps a part of the black
hole horizon (Fig. 3 (a)). If we expand the size of A until
it coincides with the total system (in the global coordi-
nate), γA wraps the horizon completely and SA becomes
equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as expected.
In a sense, the overall normalization in Eq. (1.5) is ﬁxed
from Eq. (1.1) once we consider the entanglement entropy
at ﬁnite temperature. Note that at ﬁnite temperature,
SA = SB does not hold generically. In the present situ-
ation, this occurs because the surfaces γA and γB wrap
two diﬀerent parts of the horizon (Fig. 3 (b)).

As argued in [13, 26], the AdS black hole can be dual to
an entanglement of two diﬀerent CFTs at the two bound-
aries. It is interesting to look at the minimal surfaces that
connect them. As a speciﬁc limit, we may think the black
hole entropy is the same as the entanglement entropy of
the CFTs as the minimal surface wrap the horizon.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we proposed a holographic description of
the entanglement entropy in quantum (conformal) ﬁeld
theories via AdSd+2/CFTd+1 correspondence. This is
summarized as the area law relation (1.5). Based on
our proposal we computed the entanglement entropy for
=
various systems, e.g. 2D CFTs and the 4D large-N
4 super Yang-Mills theory. We checked that in the lowest
dimensional case (d = 1), our formula exactly coincides
with the entropy computed directly from CFT.

In higher dimensions (d

ison is not easy because the gravity description corre-
sponds to the strongly coupled gauge theory whose entan-
glement entropy is not known at present. Nevertheless,

to the well-known result of the thermal entropy [23].

Finally we computed the entanglement entropy at ﬁ-
nite temperature employing AdS black hole geometry. In
this case the minimal surface wraps a fraction of the black
hole horizon and this part is responsible for the thermal
contribution.
