A culture based upon the printed book, which has prevailed from the Renaissance
until lately, has bequeathed to us — along with its immeasurable riches –
snobberies which ought to be cast aside. We ought to take a fresh look at tradition,
considered not as the inert acceptance of a fossilized corpus of themes and
conventions, but as an organic habit of re-creating what has been received and is
handed on.

Acknowledgments

This book and the data described in it are the result of a number of years of re-
search activities, seminars, workshops, courses and summer schools, where I had
the privilege to meet many colleagues and students: I express my warmest thanks
to all of them for fruitful exchanges, discussions, and help.

My first acknowledgment goes to Gregory Crane, who has supported and
encouraged my research with his endless energy both at Tufts University and
at the University of Leipzig. Lisa Cerrato and Alison Babeu have contributed
to my work with many conversations in meetings and workshops at the Perseus
Project. Bridget Almas helped me experiment with annotating textual fragments
in Perseids at a time when web-based annotation tools for historical documents
were still missing.

My research is deeply inspired by Neel Smith and Christopher Blackwell,
with whom I have spent many hours to discuss the complexities of philological
citations. Their students at the College of the Holy Cross and at Furman Uni-
versity have helped me with creative questions, suggestions, and concrete data
production.

A variety of topics of this book has been also discussed with Gabriel Bo-
dard, Charlotte Roueché, and Simona Stoyanova, who have helped me expand
the EpiDoc Guidelines for representing historical fragmentary texts.

Gregory Nagy, Lenny Muellener, and Kenny Morrell at the Harvard’s Cen-
ter for Hellenic Studies helped me develop the international program Sunoikisis
Digital Classics, thanks to which I can offer online courses in Digital Classics that
are of great inspiration for my work.

I’m very grateful to Charlotte Schubert for our discussions on Digital Clas-

sics and for her precious help in finalizing and publishing this monograph.

I also thank Stefan Schorn and Ernest Suyver for our fruitful conversations
on the complexities of representing historical fragmentary texts in the digital age.
Finally, my deep acknowledgment is to my husband Gianluca, who has been
teaching me how to program in order to study Classical sources and who has been
helping me create the projects described in this volume.

Introduction

This book is the publication of the Habilitation monograph that I wrote to describe
the results of new experimental research in Digital Classics carried out at the
University of Leipzig as part of the Open Philology project of the Alexander von
Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities.

The aim of this monograph is to present a new model for producing digi-
tal editions of historical fragmentary texts, by which I mean texts that are now
lost in their original form and transmitted only through quotations and reuses
in later works. Being a Classicist, in this research I analyze ancient Greek and
Latin sources with a main focus on historiography. The choice of this topic is due
to three main circumstances: 1) an interest in Greek fragmentary historiography
that led me to explore this genre and publish papers and critical editions of frag-
mentary authors,1 2) a related interest in the transmission of Classical texts and
in the philological contribution of the Alexandrian Library,2 and 3) the impact
of the digital revolution on Greek and Latin that brought me to work with the
Perseus Project at Tufts University and with the Open Greek and Latin initiative at
the University of Leipzig.3

The meaning of the term edition in the title of this book has to be explained,
given that this word is the focus of many scholarly debates in recent publications
concerning the Digital Humanities.4 In my work, the expression digital edition
refers not to the publication of a new reconstructed text of Greek historical frag-
ments that is the result of autopsies and new readings of manuscripts and other
historical media, but to the critical selection, production, analysis, interpretation
and annotation of digital data about fragmentary authors and works. Scholars

Introduction

with enough experience in digital data know that the computational environ-
ment is bringing new questions and solutions to the treatment and preservation
of historical texts. Centuries of philological practice have been contributing in an
impressive manner to the advancement of our knowledge of the Greco-Roman
world thanks to the technology of the printed book. If the goal of the digital turn
is to preserve these results and continue these exegetical efforts, it is indisputable
that the digital medium is very different from the printed medium and that it
requires a different approach.

This monograph describes practical and concrete problems that scholars
have to deal with when trying to digitally represent and analyze textual frag-
ments of lost authors and works. Publishing printed historical fragments is a
very difficult and complex task. Publishing digital historical fragments is an even
more difficult and complex task, because, if we always need to answer critical
research questions, we also have to navigate in a new dimension where we can’t
rely on the work of our predecessors and we can’t make use of conventions and
standards established by philology in the printed age.

This is the reason why results described in this book are experimental and
address new issues that still have to be properly discussed and solved if we want
to take full advantage of digital technologies and fulfill our responsibility to pre-
serve the Greek and Latin textual heritage. When I started my work on this topic,
the technology was different and many digital resources for analyzing Greek and
Latin were missing. A lot of time was spent on producing data and rethinking
our approach to historical sources.5 My future work and the work of future gen-
erations will certainly help go beyond naiveties and mistakes of this first phase
of research in Digital Classics.

Experiments and results of my research are also profoundly influenced by
and indebted to very different scholary environments I have been working for.
My Italian academic background taught me the principles of historiographical re-
search. My activities at the Perseus Project represented a fundamental moment to
move from analog to digital philology and concretely experiment with the pro-
duction of digital textual fragments. My research and teaching duties in the In-
stitute of Computer Science at the University of Leipzig have given me the pos-
sibility to deepen the computational aspect and produce new resources.

The outcome is a very interdisciplinary product that also reflects what is
happening not only in Classics, but also in Computational Linguistics and Digital
Humanities, where we can see the birth and growth of many projects that apply
new technologies to the study of historical languages and of the ancient world.6

This monograph is structured in five chapters that introduce the new domain
of digital fragmentary literature and describe two related projects that I have been
working on in the last five years: the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
and the Digital Athenaeus.

Chapter 1 (Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture) explains the meaning of the
word fragment in Classical studies and individuates the most important scholarly
phases that have been producing modern collections of fragmentary texts. Statis-
tics are offered to quantify the amount of fragmentary authors and works on the
basis of available digital data, and a description of the characteristics of printed
editions of historical fragmentary texts is provided to show the role of the tech-
nology of the printed book in shaping the field of fragmentary historiography in
the last two centuries.

Chapter 2 (Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution) describes the first
generation of digital libraries where fragmentary texts are collected and pub-
lished in a way that still depends on the printed editorial practice. The chapter
analyzes how hypertextual theories are important for a new model of fragmen-
tary texts in a digital environment and describes the concept of cover-text, that
helps philologists move the attention from the isolated fragment to its context of
transmission. The chapter describes also experimental implementations of com-
putational techniques that in the future will be hopefully applied to the domain
of fragmentary literature, such as text reuse detection, intertextual analysis, and
translation alignment.

Chapter 3 (Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary Texts) explains the new
idea of conceiving fragmentary texts as annotations of textual elements about
lost authors and works. It also describes two resources for producing canonical
citations and annotations of historical fragments: the CITE Architecture and the
Perseids Fragmentary Texts Editor.

Chapter 4 (Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum) is the description of
the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG), which is the dynamic and
expanded version of the printed edition of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
(FHG) edited by Karl Müller.

Chapter 5 (Digital Athenaeus) is the description of the Digital Athenaeus,
which is a project that provides an inventory of authors and works cited in the
Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis and implements a data model for iden-
tifying, analyzing, and citing uniquely instances of text reuse, in order to produce
a text-based and annotated catalog of Greek fragmentary authors and works.

The Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum is not the mere digitization
of a printed collection, but the extraction, expansion, and deep analysis of its data
to produce further resources for the study of Greek fragmentary historians and
their works. The reasons for choosing this collection are fully explained in the

4

Introduction

following pages. Nevertheless and given the topic of this monograph, a reader
could ask why I didn’t produce a new born-digital edition of Greek fragmentary
historians. I have two main answers to this question.

The first answer is that many extant sources that preserve Greek historical
fragments are still missing in an open and digital format. A comparison with
the first volume of the indices of Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker by
Pierre Bonnechère shows how many sources of fragments and editions are not
yet digitized.7 This situation will be certainly overcome in the next decades, but
today is a significant limit considering that a complete collection of source texts
preserving testimonies and fragments is the preliminary condition to produce an
edition of a fragmentary author.

The second answer is that the time at my disposal for this project would have
allowed me to work only on one fragmentary author or on a small group of au-
thors with a limited number of fragments. The adverb only in this sentence may
seem provocative, because the study of a single fragmentary author can be ex-
tremely difficult and time consuming, as I know by experience. But, if we change
our perspective from a traditional philological point of view to a computational
point of view, this adverb makes better sense. Focusing on one author or on a
small group of authors would have resulted in a work very similar to what I edited
in a printed format, without a proper exploration of new computational possibil-
ities. The goal of this research was not to replicate what we can still achieve with
the technology of the printed book, but to experiment with new forms of analysis
in a digital environment, where a single fragmentary author or a few hundreds
fragments are not enough as an object of study.8

This book shows that digital libraries are transforming the concept of tex-
tual fragments. If in printed books textual fragments are chunks of texts extracted
from their original context, in digital editions they are annotations of textual el-
ements pertaining to lost authors and works. The Digital Athenaeus project was
born from the need to produce this model and move from the perspective of the
quoted author to that of the quoting author, which will be the prevailing per-
spective in the future development of digital fragmentary literature. The choice
of the Deipnosophists is not only due to historical and philological reasons that
are extensively described in the following pages, but also to the fact that its main
editions are openly available in a digital format and that data can be extracted
and structured from them in a sustainable way.

This monograph is written in English for two main reasons. The first rea-
son is that English is not only the language of the Digital Humanities, but also

the natural language that in the last decades has produced models and program-
ming languages to analyze textual data. If our responsibility as humanists and
philologists is to translate and express these models into other languages, we
can’t renounce to describe the results of our research in English, given that this
language permeates methods and standards of Digital Philology.

The second reason is that I was employed as an Academic Assistant of the
Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig
to develop an English program for teaching and research. I achieved this task by
contributing to the creation of a new Bachelor of Science and a new Master of
Science in Digital Humanities, where I currently teach courses in Digital Philol-
ogy and Digital Classics.9 I also fulfilled this task by promoting research projects,
conferences, and publications that include data described in this book.10

Part of this task was also the creation of Sunoikisis Digital Classics, which is an interna-
tional consortium of Digital Classics programs developed in collaboration with the Har-
vard’s Center for Hellenic Studies and the Institute of Classical Studies at the University
of London: Berti/Crane et al. (2015); Berti (2016b); Berti (2017c); Berti (2017b).

10 Bibliographic resources are collected in the Bibliography at the end of the volume with
DOIs and dates of access. The volume cites many links that are not provided with stable
identifiers, but are important to show the current state of research. The last access to these
links was on July 23, 2021. The Index at the end of the volume lists Digital Humanities and
Digital Classics projects not explicitly mentioned in chapter and section titles.

1 Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture

This chapter explains the meaning and the development of the word frag-
ment when referred to the domain of literary texts and print culture. The
first section (1.1) distinguishes between material fragments of ancient ev-
idence and textual fragments represented by quotations and text reuses.
The second section (1.2) traces the relationship between Classical schol-
arship and textual fragments by individuating the most important phases
that have been producing modern collections of fragmentary authors and
works. The third section (1.3) offers statistics for quantifying the amount
of fragmentary authors and works based on data available in contemporary
digital libraries. The fourth section (1.4) analyzes characteristics of printed
editions of historical fragmentary texts in order to understand the role of
the technology of printed books in determining the birth and the growth of
fragmentary historiography in the last two centuries.

1.1 Fragments and Fragmentary Texts

The English term fragment comes from the Latin word fragmentum and from
the verb frangere, which means to break. The Oxford English Dictionary defines
fragment (s.v.) as “a part broken off or otherwise detached from a whole; a broken
piece; a (comparatively) small detached portion of anything.” The word can also
be used figuratively as “a detached, isolated, or incomplete part; a (comparatively)
small portion of anything; a part remaining or still preserved when the whole is
lost or destroyed.” As far as artistic or literary works are concerned, the word
refers to “an extant portion of a writing or composition which as a whole is lost;
also, a portion of a work left uncompleted by its author; hence, a part of any
unfinished whole or uncompleted design.”

These definitions show that the inner characteristic of a fragment is its being
the surviving piece of something irremediably lost or never finished. In this sense
the word is applied to a great variety of physical remains of ancient evidence, such
as monumental ruins, potsherds, scraps of papyri and broken inscriptions. The
boundaries of these fragments are marked by margins, whose materiality draws
our attention to the exteriority of the evidence, influencing our reconstruction of

7

8

1 Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture

the wholeness to which the fragment belonged and our perception of the reasons
of its fragmentation, usually due to an external violent event like destruction or
consumption.1

Most of what we still have from the ancient world has been preserved in a
fragmented form and physical fragments include many typologies ranging from
big architectural elements to small sherds. When physical fragments bear textual
evidence the materiality of the fragment extends also to the text, which becomes
the surviving broken off piece of an ancient writing. Epigraphy and papyrology
are the disciplines devoted to collecting, restoring, studying and integrating texts
that have been engraved, painted, or written on any materials surviving from the
past. Fragmentary texts of this kind include many different types of documents
that pertain to public, private, documentary and literary spheres. Examples are
fragments of decrees, laws, ostraka, gravestones, inscribed vases, brick stamps,
loom weights, letters, private contracts, legal documents, accounts and literary
texts.2 An interesting group of this evidence is constituted by literary works
preserved only on physical fragments. Given that this book is mainly focused
on Greek historical and historiographical texts, two significant examples are the
Hellenica Oxyrhynchia and the Marmor Parium.

The Hellenica Oxyrhynchia is a 4th century BC work of history transmitted
on papyrus fragments of the 1st and 2nd century CE stored in different collec-
tions in Egypt, Great Britain, Italy and the United States of America.3 In this case
we have a fragmentary work in the literal sense of the word, because the historio-
graphical research of the author of the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia — whose identity is
still questioned — has been preserved only thanks to these fragments of papyrus.
The Marmor Parium is a Hellenistic chronicle on a marble slab coming from
the Greek island of Paros. The document contains a Greek chronology (1581/80–
299/98 BC) with a list of kings and archons accompanied by short references to
historical events mainly based on the Athenian history. The text is dated to the
3rd century BC and part of it survives in two fragments (A and B) preserved in
the Ashmolean Museum of the University of Oxford and in the Archaeological

Museum of Paros.4 As for the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, also the Marmor Parium
is a fragmentary work produced by an unknown author whose historiographical
text is still extant only through these fragments of marble. Another example is a
group of texts that the online Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) labels as Anonymi
Historici (tlg1139). This collection includes forty historical fragmentary texts pre-
served on inscriptions, papyri, manuscripts and quotations in later texts.5

Even if technically it is not a fragmentary text, I can also mention the Consti-
tution of the Athenians attributed to Aristotle. The Aristotelian work was known
only thanks to quotations and text reuses until the discovery in Egypt in the 19th
century of papyri bearing the text, which are now preserved in the Staatliche
Museen zu Berlin and in the British Library in London.6 The text is for the most
part complete and is a very important example of a literary work transmitted only
on papyrus and not through manuscript tradition in the Middle Ages.7

Scholarship employs the expressions fragment and fragmentary text to refer
also to another kind of evidence, which is constituted by incomplete textual quo-
tations and reuses. This category includes many different examples that range
from verbatim quotations to paraphrases and allusions.8 Fragmentary texts of
this type can be divided into two main groups:

1. Fragmentary texts of still extant works. This form of reuse is attested when
an ancient author quotes, paraphrases, or alludes to another author whose text
has been preserved by the tradition. In this case the reuse can be compared with
the original text in order to check the reliability of the quotation.

of the stone with Latin translation, chronological table, and commentary was published
by Karl Müller in FHG I, whose digital version is now available as part of the Digital Frag-
menta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) project, which is also producing an experimental
digital edition of the Marmor Parium: see section 4.5. For a recent study of the literary and

1 Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture

Examples are citations of Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides or Xenophon in the

Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis.9 Here is an example for Herodotus:
Deipn. 12.58 = 541bc: περὶ δὲ Σμινδυρίδου τοῦ Συβαρίτου καὶ τῆς
τούτου τρυφῆς ἱστόρησεν Ἡρόδοτος ἐν τῇ ἕκτῃ, ὡς ἀποπλέων ἐπὶ
τὴν μνηστείαν τῆς Κλεισθένους τοῦ Σικυωνίων τυράννου θυγατρὸς
Ἀγαρίστης, φησίν, ἀπὸ μὲν Ἰταλίης Σμινδυρίδης ὁ Ἱπποκράτεος
Συβαρίτης, ὃς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον δὴ χλιδῆς εἷς ἀνὴρ ἀφίκετο. εἵποντο
γοῦν αὐτῷ χίλιοι μάγειροι καὶ ὀρνιθευταί. ἱστορεῖ περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ
Τίμαιος ἐν τῇ ἑβδόμῃ.10

Hdt. 6.127.1: ἀπὸ μὲν δὴ Ἰταλίης ἦλθε Σμινδυρίδης ὁ Ἱπποκράτεος
Συβαρίτης, ὃς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον δὴ χλιδῆς εἷς ἀνὴρ ἀπίκετο (ἡ δὲ Σύβαρις
ἤκμαζε τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον μάλιστα), καὶ Σιρίτης Δάμασος Ἀμύριος
τοῦ σοφοῦ λεγομένου παῖς.11

Athenaeus quotes almost verbatim the words of Herodotus, but the context is
different because he is talking about people who are famous for their love for
luxury (τρυφή), while the Halicarnassensis is mentioning Smindyrides in a pas-
sage concerning the family of the Alcmeonidae and he uses only the term χλιδή
(extravagance), which is different from τρυφή (luxury). If the work of Herodotus
was lost, we could read his words through Athenaeus, but we would attribute to
him also the information about the number of cooks and fowlers accompaning
the Sybarite, which doesn’t appear in his text and probably comes from the lost
historian Timaeus who is cited at the end of the passage.12

Another example is a reference to the History of the Peloponnesian War of

Thucydides in the text of the Deipnosophists:

Ambaglio (1990); Bouvier (2007); Bréchet (2007); Lenfant (2007c); Maisonneuve (2007); Ol-
son (2018). On quotations of Homer in the text of the Deipnosophists and how to represent
them in a digital environment, see Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016).
“Herodotus in Book VI told the story of Smindyrides of Sybaris and his addiction to luxury,
describing how he sailed off to court Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes, the tyrant of
Sicyon: From Italy, he says, came Smindyrides the son of Hippocrates of Sybaris, who was
more devoted to luxury than any of the others. He was accompanied, for example, by 1000
cooks and fowlers. Timaeus also discusses him in Book VII.” Trans. by Olson (2006–2012).
The same story is also narrated in Athen., Deipn. 6.105 (= 273bc).
“From Italy came Smindyrides of Sybaris, son of Hippocrates, the most luxurious liver of
his day (and Sybaris was then at the height of its prosperity), and Damasus of Siris, son of
that Amyris who was called The Wise.” Trans. by Godley (1920–1925).

11

Deipn. 5.15 = 189c: λέγονται δὲ Ἀθήνησι καὶ ἱεροί τινες αὐλῶνες, ὧν
μέμνηται Φιλόχορος ἐν τῇ ἐνάτῃ. καλοῦσι δ᾽ ἀρσενικῶς τοὺς αὐλῶ-
νας, ὥσπερ Θουκυδίδης ἐν τῇ δʹ καὶ πάντες οἱ καταλογάδην συγ-
γραφεῖς, οἱ δὲ ποιηταὶ θηλυκῶς.13

Thuc. 4.103.1: ἐπὶ ταύτην οὖν ὁ Βρασίδας ἄρας ἐξ Ἀρνῶν τῆς Χαλ-
κιδικῆς ἐπορεύετο τῷ στρατῷ. καὶ ἀφικόμενος περὶ δείλην ἐπὶ τὸν
Αὐλῶνα καὶ Βορμίσκον, ᾗ ἡ Βόλβη λίμνη ἐξίησιν ἐς θάλασσαν, καὶ
δειπνοποιησάμενος ἐχώρει τὴν νύκτα.14

The two contexts are completely different because Athenaeus is discussing the
meaning of the words αὐλή (court), αὐλός (pipe), αὐλῶπις (helmet with a tube-
like opening) and αὐλών (hollow), while Thucydides is talking about the march of
the Spartan general Brasidas against Amphipolis and he mentions the toponym
Aulon (Αὐλών) in Chalcidice. If we didn’t have the text of Thucydides, it would be
impossible to infer the context of his passage, as for the lost text of Philochorus
who is mentioned in the same context.15 Moreover, Athenaeus is not precise
because Thucydides doesn’t refer to the noun but to the geographical place, and
the Naucratites was probably getting the citation of the passage of the historian
from an intermediate source.16

2. Fragmentary texts of lost works. This kind of reuse, which is the most
interesting and challenging one, is represented by authors who quote, cite, or
paraphrase other authors whose texts are currently lost. In this case the reuse
can’t be compared with the original text and its interpretation depends on many
factors. An example is a passage of the Lexicon of the Ten Orators of Harpocration
concerning the Athenian festival of the Panathenaea:17

Lex., s.v. Παναθήναια: Δημοσθένης Φιλιππικοῖς. διττὰ Παναθήναια
ἤγετο Ἀθήνησι, τὰ μὲν καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ἐνιαυτόν, τὰ δὲ διὰ πενταε-

“Certain sacred aulones (hollows) in Athens are referred to; Philochorus mentions them in
Book IX. Some authorities have the word in the masculine, as for example Thucydides in
Book IV and all prose-authors, whereas the poets have it in the feminine.” Trans. by Olson
(2006–2012).
“Against this place Brasidas marched with his army, setting out from Arnae in Chalcidice.
Arriving about dusk at Aulon and Bormiscus, where the lake Bolbe has its outlet into the
sea, he took supper and then proceeded by night.” Trans. by Smith (1928–1935).

“Demosthenes (uses the word) in Philippics. Two (festivals called) Panathenaia were cel-
ebrated at Athens, the one yearly, the other every fifth year (i.e. four years apart). And
this was called the Great (Megala). Isokrates in the Panathenaikos uses the expression ‘a
little before the Great Panathenaia.’ The festival was first celebrated by Erikhthonios, son
of Hephaistos, as both Hellanikos and Androtion record, each one in the first (book) of
Atthis. Before this (the festival) was called Athenaia, as is made clear by Istros in the third
(book) of his Attika.” Trans. by Harding (2008) 39.

In this entry Harpocration cites five authors, of whom two are still extant (De-
mosthenes and Isocrates) and three are lost (Hellanicus, Androtion, and Istros).
Demosthenes and Isocrates are cited as examples of the use of the expressions
Παναθήναια (Panathenaea) and μεγάλα Παναθήναια (great Panathenaea), but
their contexts don’t contain a description of the two festivals.18 As far as the
three Atthidographers are concerned and except for the few references of Har-
pocration, it is not possible to reconstruct the context of their texts and in fact
their contribution to the history of the festival of the Panathenaea is discussed by
scholars.19

All these examples show that the term fragment can be quite misleading
when referred to a reused text. In most cases a fragment is not the broken off
piece of a lost original text, but the result of the philological and historiographical
interpretation of the scholar who has to dig into the context in order to measure
the distance between the lost text and its reuse.20 This is one of the reasons why
in recent scholarship the focus has moved from the fragment to the preserving
context, and in the digital environment the expression text reuse is preferred to
fragmentary text.21

Classical scholarship makes also use of other terms to refer to other texts
transmitted in the form of quotations and reuses, such as, for example, epitoma,
excerptum, frustulum and reliquia.22 As far as epitomes are concerned, there are
many different examples among which I can remember the abridged versions
of the works of Livy (including the Periochae), the epitome of the Aristotelian
Politeiai by Heraclides Lembus, Iustinus’ epitome of Pompeius Trogus’ Historiae

physical objects, never to portions of discourse […] This metaphor seems not to have been
invented until relatively modern times […] small parts of a larger text are not fragments
but just quotations or excerpts.”
See section 2.3.
It is not always possible to distinguish between fragmenta and these forms of text reuses,
because many times there is an inevitable overlapping, but in any case this terminology
gives a sense of the vast variety of reuses of texts of Classical works: see Most (1997).

epitomes of the Aegyptiaca by Manetho.23 An important example of excerpts is
represented by the Excerpta Constantiniana that was produced in Constantinople
in the 10th century under the supervision of the emperor Constantinus Porphy-
rogenitus, who gathered a group of excerptores to extract and combine excerpts
about 53 topics from Classical and Byzantine historiographical works.24 Another
example is represented by the excerpts of ancient Greek geographers collected by
Karl Müller in the 19th century.25 The terms frustula and reliquiae are used, for
example, to refer to groups of anonymous poetic fragments and in the collection
of the fragments of the Roman historians by Hermann Peter.26

1.2 Classical Scholarship and Textual Fragments

Collecting fragments is not a recent activity, but dates back to ancient times when
authors excerpted passages of texts in order to assemble and transmit them for
many different purposes. Philologists, grammarians, and lexicographers pro-
duced collections of notes, extracts, quotations and references to other texts in
order to create bibliographies and research tools about a wide range of topics.
Alexandrian scholarship has a crucial role in this long and complex process that
has indirectly transmitted Classical works, and the tradition also preserves traces
of the methods used by authors like Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Aulus Gellius and
Athenaeus in their intellectual activities.27

Given that for a long period of time in antiquity texts were for the most part
still availabe, in this case collecting fragments didn’t originate from the need of
looking for lost works, but from the necessity of producing reference tools that
could facilitate information management and accessibility.28 From the Renais-
sance onwards, when humanists realized that recently discovered manuscripts
didn’t preserve the entirety of Classical textuality, collecting fragments became

a way for publishing the most celebrated authors and, after that, for gathering
traces of an irremediably lost past.29

Glenn Most individuates two phases in the history of postclassical scholar-
ship on collecting fragments. The first is the “humanist and early modern” phase
that began in the second half of the 16th century and was “largely aesthetic in
orientation,” because the interest was more in publishing the very best fragments
of the most important authors than in producing complete, critical, and exhaus-
tive collections.30 The second is the “romantic and contemporary” phase that
began in the second half of the 18th century and was characterised by a “refor-
mulated scholarship,” which brought a new attempt to understand the totality
of the past beyond the few surviving canonical works and “a new dignity to the
fragment.” These elements were fundamental for developing a new scholarship
on ancient literary fragments that took off in the middle and the second half of
the 19th century, when “systematic coherence and philological rigor” produced
big collections of fragmentary texts belonging to many different genres, as for
example epic poetry, comedy, tragedy, philosophy and historiography.31 This
second phase lies at the bottom of contemporary scholarship on fragmentary au-
thors, which still relies on four “basic methodological pillars”: 1) the efforts of
identifying and attributing (a) single lost works to individual authors, (b) single
fragments to individual authors and works, and (c) single fragments to literary
genres but not to a particular author or work; 2) the complete and exhaustive ex-
amination of all the sources that make possible the identification of fragments; 3)
the distinction between the original words of a lost text and the context in which
the reference to them is preserved; 4) a systematic source criticism in order to in-
vestigate and understand, as far as possible, the relationship among the sources
of fragments.32

A complete and detailed list of collections of fragmentary authors and works
produced between the 19th and the 21st century is beyond the scope of this book,
but I can cite the most important editions:

works remains widely if unobtrusively operative,” see Dionisotti (1997) 8, who explores
many different forms of fragmenta in Classical scholarship.

ing on commenting in details single authors. Examples are the series I Frammenti

ing authors originally published in the FGrHist of Felix Jacoby, and the project

New technologies applied to philology are posing new questions and chal-
lenges about representing fragmentary texts in a digital environment. The goal
of this book is to discuss these questions and offer solutions by describing the
impact of the digital revolution on literary sources and by presenting the Digital
Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) and the Digital Athenaeus projects
(see chapters 2–5). I begin by showing preliminary statistics of the amount of
fragmentary authors and works at our disposal and by examining characteristics
of printed editions of fragmentary texts.

1.3 How Many Fragmentary Texts?

In an important paper significantly entitled Umblick im Trümmerfeld der griechis-
chen Geschichtsschreibung, Hermann Strasburger tried to quantify the “land of
ruins” of ancient Greek historiograhy and came to the conclusion that the tradi-
tion has preserved only about 2.5% of what was originally written, with a ratio of
1 to 40 between what is still extant and what is lost.41

Given the fragmentary state of ancient evidence and its complexity, count-
ing the amount of textual fragments and calculate its proportion in relation to
what has survived from the past are a difficult task that can’t produce complete
and definitive results, first of all because it’s not possible to establish with preci-
sion what is a fragmentary text.42 Nevertheless, undertaking this task is impor-
tant from a methodological and a numerical point of view: From a methodolog-
ical point of view, because a survey of fragmentary texts helps scholars identify
and overview different kinds of textual fragments and their characteristics across
the centuries and in different literary cultures; from a numerical point of view,
because this effort gives the opportunity to quantify — at least partially and in
a relative way — the amount of evidence that we have at our disposal and the
kind of work necessary to produce new editions of fragmentary authors and new
collections of fragmentary works.

In a digital environment this kind of task is even more relevant because it
allows research investigators to calculate the amount of data to be digitized, pro-
cessed, produced, critically edited and stored. These statistics become important
in order to plan digital projects that involve a certain number of people with dif-
ferent expertise, that might require a long period of time to be accomplished, and
that consequently request an estimate of project costs.

Hermann Strasburger based his statistics on the number of pages of the edi-
tiones minores of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana and on the number of books of frag-
mentary works and of pages of modern collections of fragmentary historians.43
The interest in counting books and the extent of library collections is evidenced
since ancient times. Callimachus of Cyrene in his Tables (Pinakes) of ancient lit-
erature classified authors by genre and, as far as we know, probably included also
information about the number of books and lines of every work.44 Ancient au-
thors tried also to quantify the amount of texts stored in the Library of Alexandria
and modern scholars have made an effort to check the reliability of these numbers
and produce new figures.45 All these methods depend on the kind of medium by
which works are transmitted, like papyri, manuscripts, printed books, and now
digital data.46 Moreover, we also have to take into account the nature and ar-
rangement of libraries and catalogs.

Digital technologies and the World Wide Web have been creating many dif-
ferent resources that range from huge collections (like Internet Archive, Google
Books, and HathiTrust) to digital library catalogs and repositories belonging to
specific domains of Classical literature. Most of these projects are collecting data
created for printed publications and are generating other data that is the result
of a digitization workflow of printed editions. In order to quantify what is now
available and what has to be done in the next decades, we can explore these dig-
ital collections to see how they reflect the “land of ruins” described by Hermann
Strasburger in his paper.

As far as ancient Greek fragmentary historians and works are concerned, I
provide here a first set of data and statistics drawn from different digital projects
pertaining to ancient Greek literature: the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG), the
Perseus Catalog, the Open Greek and Latin (OGL), the First One-Thousand Years of
Greek (First1KGreek), the Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ), and the Digital Fragmenta His-

fragments of it has been preserved. For the nature of this collection see, among many
others, Parsons (1952) 204–218, Witty (1958), and Blum (1991). Traces of ancient criteria
for calculating the extent of works can be also found in later authors as Athenaeus of
Naucratis and in encyclopedic works like the Suda: see, for example, Jacob (2001) lxiv ff.,
Jacob (2004), and Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016) 123.

toricorum Graecorum (DFHG). These resources are ongoing projects and therefore
I can only offer provisional statistics, which are in any case important to under-
stand the state of the art at the beginning of the 21st century, not only in terms
of numbers but also in terms of characteristics, limits, and omissions of these
collections.47

Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG). The TLG (subscription required) is the old-
est and biggest digital library of ancient Greek texts.48 The project started in 1972
at the University of California, Irvine, with the goal of creating a digital library of
Greek literaty texts from Homer (8th century BC) to 600 CE.49 The collection was
later expanded to include Byzantine works until 1453 CE and a large number of
texts up to the 20th century.50 Today the online version contains more than 110
million words from over 10,000 works associated with 4,000 authors. The TLG
Statistics page (subscription required) shows that the TLG collects 3,293 authors
for the period of time between the 8th century BC and the 20th century CE, in-
cluding authors dated as varia and incerta. Limiting the selection to the centuries
8th BC through 6th CE, the TLG has 2,120 authors + 99 varia and 90 incerta for a
total of 2,309 authors (fig. 1.1).

http://www.dfhg-project.org/Fragmentary-Texts.

48 As of 2021, the individual one year online TLG subscription costs $140. Costs of the insti-
tutional subscription depends on the size of the institution (total number of FTEs) and the
number of anticipated users.

Since the beginning, the TLG has addressed the problem of including lost
authors. According to the Canon, the TLG lists authors “represented by some
form of text that owes its provenance to codices, papyri, inscriptions, or quota-
tions by later authors. There are, however, some authors who are lost except for
the testimonia provided by later authors. […] Some of these lost writers have,
in fact, been assigned a place in the Canon, although there has not been a con-
sistent effort to include every lost author mentioned in the surviving testimonia.
[…] Entirely omitted from the Canon, however, are authors who are known to us
only by way of anecdote or through recollected or (ostensibly) reported conver-
sation. Such authors remain lost, and it is the anecdotist whose text resides in the
data bank.”51 Luci Berkowitz and Karl Squitier clarify that the criterion for includ-
ing lost authors in the TLG Canon depends on printed collections of fragments,
where fragmentary authors may be represented by quotations (fragmenta), by ref-
erences to their literary production and activity (testimonia), or only by titles.52 In
the CD-ROMs of the TLG, work titles were accompanied by codes identifying the
means of transmission of texts, and the codes Q and NQ were used for quotation and
no quotation: They stood for direct and indirect quotations, and for testimonia
and titles.53 This criterion is still reflected in the online version of the TLG, where
there are no more codes for indicating the means of transmission of texts, but the
field Work Title includes the forms fragmentum, testimonium, and titulus.54 Ex-
amples are the Fragmenta of the comic author Aristophanes (tlg0019.012–018),
the Testimonia of the historian Acusilaus (tlg0392.001 and 003), and the Tituli of
the comic author Alexis (tlg0402.004).55

Considering this arrangement of texts and editions, it is possible to search
the online version of the TLG with the string fragm* in the TLG field All Fields
(which includes Author, Editor, Work Title, Publ. Title, Series and Publ. Year).

tween fragmenta and testimonia, see section 1.4.

54 On the TLG work title Fragmentum or Fragmenta, see Berkowitz/Squitier (1990) xxiii.
The online version of the TLG has work classification tags, which include also the forms
fragm. and test. As for now, fragm. is used only for the fragments of Joannes Doceianus
(tlg3288.006), while test. is used for the Testimonia published in 147 editions of different
authors. On work classification tags and on the label Test. in the TLG Canon, see Berkow-
itz/Squitier (1990) xxviii and xlviii.

55 TLG authors have four-digit numbers, while TLG works have three-digit numbers. In the
examples mentioned in the text, multiple works correspond to multiple editions. Frag-
menta of Aristophanes are from seven editions and the Testimonia of Acusilaus from two
editions. In the past, TLG fragmentary works (i.e., works not to be found in an indepen-
dent text edition) had numbers with an x replacing the first of the three digits in the work
number (e.g., the fragments of Erasistratus quoted by Galen: tlg0690.x01): see Berkowitz/
Squitier (1990) xxii.

The search is not limited to the fields Author and Work Title because there are
TLG fragmentary works without a fragmentary specification (e.g., the work title
Κωμῳδούμενοι of a fragmentary comedy of the Comica Adespota: tlg0662.008).
On the other hand, it is also necessary to eliminate works that are included in the
results because the corresponding Publ. title has a form of the word fragmentum
(e.g., Lysias’ extant orations that are part of Christopher Carey’s edition entitled
Lysiae orationes cum fragmentis). For the period between the 8th century BC and
the 6th century CE, the TLG counts 1,131 fragmentary authors + 29 varia and
50 incerta, for a total of 1,210 fragmentary authors (fig. 1.2). Within this group,
there are 215 authors with both extant and fragmentary works, and 995 authors
with only fragmentary works (fig. 1.3). Examples are authors like Sophocles, for
whom we have both extant tragedies and fragmentary ones, and Hellanicus, who
is known only through references and quotations in later texts.56

Table 1.1 shows that for the period between the 8th century BC and the 6th cen-
tury CE (including varia and incerta) the TLG collects 1,210 fragmentary authors
and 2,314 fragmentary work titles whose texts have been digitized from 489 edi-
tions. The TLG field Series includes only the entry Poetarum Graecorum Frag-
menta. A deeper analysis reveals that there are other terms in the TLG field Work
Title used for fragmentary works: fragmentum, frustulum, epitome, excerptum,
testimonium and titulus with inflected forms. Table 1.2 shows the number of oc-
currences of these terms based on data filtered with the string fragm* in the TLG

century CE (including varia and incerta).

For the same period of time, TLG fragmentary authors are classified accord-

ing to 69 epithets grouped in 117 combinations:57
Alchemista, Alexandrinus, Apamensis, Apocrypha, Apologeta, Astrologus, Astronomus, Atticista,

TLG fragmentary works are classified according to 69 work classifications grouped
in 236 combinations:59

Given that the TLG is an ongoing project and new authors, works, and editions
are periodically added, this data is partly provisional, even if it mostly covers the
current state of textual transmission. Moreover, literary and geographical clas-
sifications of authors and works are always problematic. Nevertheless, the goal
of these statistics and numbers is to collect a first set of information concerning
what is available online in a digital format and the kind of challenges and issues
we have to deal with for new textual entries.

If we focus on historical fragmentary texts, which are the research question
of this book, the TLG includes 273 fragmentary historians (based on the TLG
author epithet Hist.) for the centuries 8 BC through 6 CE including varia and
incerta. Moreover, if we take into account the TLG combination of the epithet
Hist. with other epithets, there are 297 fragmentary historians (fig. 1.4):60

Perseus Catalog. The Perseus Digital Library and the Scaife Viewer (open access)
have no texts of fragmentary authors, but the Perseus Catalog collects informa-
tion about editions of fragmentary authors and works. The Perseus Catalog was
conceived in 2005 with the goal of collecting open bibliographic data and meta-
data about authors, works, and editions of Greek and Latin literature. Inspired by
the FRBR model (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records), the Perseus
Catalog aims at offering a complete view of the editorial and textual tradition of
every work of Classical literature producing linked data and using standards for
connecting its resources to bigger library systems and international data banks,
as for example WorldCat and the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF).61 The
Perseus Catalog includes not only ancient Greek and Latin works, but also Arabic
works, and it is browsable by Author, Work Title, Work Original Language, Edition
or Translation Year Published, Edition or Translation Language, Series and Subjects.
The catalog counts 2,072 authors and 4,584 work titles (table 1.3). The catalog
offers also numbers for works in the original language, series, and subjects (table
1.4).

Within the collection of the Perseus Catalog, there are 891 fragmentary authors,

tary works, and 141 subjects pertaining to fragmentary works (table 1.5, figures

Testimonium

As far as identifiers of Greek authors and works are concerned, the Perseus Cat-
alog has been making use of the codes of the last printed edition of the TLG
Canon by Berkowitz/Squitier (1990). Perseus Catalog entries have a main CITE
URN identifier for authors and TLG identifiers for authors and works that are
also part of Perseus CTS URNs for identifying works and editions.63 As for frag-
mentary authors, an example is Hellanicus of Lesbos, who is identified with
urn:cite:perseus:author.701 and with tlg0539. Hellanicus’ Fragmenta are cata-
loged with urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0539.tlg001.64

Given that both the online TLG and the Perseus Catalog are ongoing projects,
there are cases where authors are not any more in the online TLG (but were

62 Different figures of works and work titles depend on Perseus Catalog MODS records that
include both uniform official work titles and a list of alternative titles or translated titles
found within a record. An example is represented by the fragments of Istros the Calli-
machean (urn:cite:perseus:author.776), where the table of contents of the MODS file
includes the titles Atthis, Fragmenta incertae sedis, Apollinis apparitiones, Ptolemais, Ae-
gyptiorum coloniae, Argolica, Eliaca, Collectio sacrificorum creticorum, De proprietate cer-
taminum, Melopoei, Commentarii, Dictiones atticae and Incertorum operum fragmenta from
the section of the author’s fragments in the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG):

See http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cite:perseus:author.701 and http://catalog.
perseus.org/catalog/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0539.tlg001. The further specification opp–grc1
in the Perseus Catalog identifies the fragments of Hellanicus in the edition of the FHG. In
the TLG Canon, the codes 001, 002, and 003 identify the testimonia and the fragmenta of
Hellanicus in the FGrHist and in Mette (1978) 11–12.

present in the printed edition of the Canon and therefore are still in the Perseus
Catalog) and other cases where authors collected in the Perseus Catalog are not
existing in the online TLG.

An example of the first case is Amphion of Thespiae, who is a Greek frag-
mentary historian published in the FHG (IV 301) and in the FGrHist (387 = BNJ
387). This author was originally available in the printed edition of the TLG Canon
with the number tlg2271 and the letter Q as a mean of transmission, but is not
present in the online TLG.65 The Perseus Catalog preserves his TLG record.66

As far as the second case is concerned, an example is Nicander of Alexandria,
who was published in the FHG (IV 462) and in the FGrHist (1112). The author
has been never published in the TLG and is therefore included as fhg0480 in the
Perseus Catalog.67

Another interesting example is represented by the historian Acestodorus
of Megalopolis, who was originally inserted in the printed edition of the TLG
Canon as tlg1818. The author is mentioned in a scholion to Sophocles’ Oedi-
pus Coloneus that preserves also two fragments of Istros the Callimachean and
Andron of Halicarnassus.68 The printed edition of the TLG Canon gives this in-
formation and in fact identifies Acestodorus’ fragment as tlg1818.x01 adding a

Open Greek and Latin (OGL). The Open Greek and Latin (OGL) (open access) is a
project developed at the University of Leipzig for digitizing editions of Greek and
Latin sources produced in antiquity through the 6th century CE. The goal is to
generate OCR outputs that are encoded according to the TEI XML Guidelines and
are freely downloadable and reusable. OGL has been digitizing also fragmentary
authors and is making available a first limited set of editions of fragmentary works
through a GitHub repository (fragm–dev): https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLat

Jacoby Online. Jacoby Online (JO) (subscription required) is a project devel-
oped by Brill publishers to produce a digital version of Die Fragmente der griechis-
chen Historiker (FGrHist) and its continuatio, and to publish a new edition of the
FGrHist through the Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ).72

Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG). The DFHG (open ac-
cess) provides the digital edition of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG)
by Karl Müller (see chapter 4). It collects 636 Greek fragmentary historians, who
are searchable through the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog (see section 4.4.1).
The FHG doesn’t provide dates for each author, but arranges the content in 15 sec-
tions within 5 volumes according to general chronological classifications (figg. 1.8
and 1.9).

strategies for publishing printed critical editions of Greek and Latin sources. A
walk through the shelfs of a specialized library and an online search in Google
Books show how many different examples of printed editions of primary sources
of Classical antiquity have been produced in the last five centuries. Since the
experiments of Aldus Manutius in Venice up to very recent products of publishing
companies, the technology of the printed book has played a fundamental role in
producing and shaping forms of critical collections, arrangements, and editions
of information and knowledge about historical texts.73

The digital revolution has been affecting textuality in a dramatic way and
also Classical philologists are now faced with new questions about representing
their data in a digital environment.74 In this regard digital philology has two main
goals: 1) preserve the editorial heritage of the past by digitizing printed editions
and generating machine readable and structured outputs, and 2) produce a new
digital scholarly model for editing primary sources and publishing new born-
digital editions.
In this scenario, digital philologists have the responsibility of
preserving the understanding of traditional print conventions and criteria in or-
der to transfer this editorial heritage to a computational format.75 At the sime
time and while never abandoning the rigor of well established methods, the re-
sponsibility of digital philologists is to become independent of the print model in
order to create a new digital scholarly environment and avoid the risk of produc-
ing digital replica of printed editions.

This is also valid for editions of fragmentary authors and works, and this
is the aim of the two projects that will be described in chapters 4 and 5. In the
following pages I present an overview of printed editions of ancient Greek frag-
mentary historians, focusing on the two big collections edited by Karl Müller and
Felix Jacoby (including its continuatio) and on the volumes of the Italian series I
Frammenti degli Storici Greci.76

The five volumes of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) were
edited by Karl Müller with the help of Theodor Müller and Victor Langlois, and
printed in Paris between 1841 and 1873 by the publisher Ambroise Firmin-Didot.77
The FHG is a collection of excerpts from many different sources preserving infor-
mation and text reuses about 636 ancient Greek fragmentary historians. Exclud-
ing the first volume, authors are chronologically distributed and cover a period

of time from the 6th century BC through the 7th century CE.78 In FHG I, critical
commentaries about the life and the intellectual activity of authors (testimonia)
are published at the beginning of the volume in a section entitled De vita et scrip-
tis auctorum. From FHG II onwards, introductory commentaries are printed at
the beginning of the section of each author or group of authors.79 There are also
authors without an introduction but only with a collection of fragmenta, and au-
thors who have only an introduction discussing testimonia about them and not a
collection of fragmenta.80

Müller doesn’t provide a formal distinction between testimonia and frag-
menta like Jacoby in the FGrHist — where the letters T and F clearly separate
the two kinds of sources — but inserts testimonia into the introductions to au-
thors, and only the fragmenta represent a seperate section with a numerical ar-
rangement.81 There are also cases where Müller summarizes the content of the
fragments in a section called Argumentum.82 Under each FHG author section,
fragments are arranged by fragmentary works and in a sequence that depends on
historiographical and philological decisions of the editor.83 Figure 1.10 shows the
first page of the section about Hecataeus of Miletus with numbered fragments.84
After the Greek title of a fragmentary work (e.g., Περίοδος γῆς) and a possible
work section (e.g., Α. Εὐρώπη), there is the number of the fragment (e.g., 1), a
reference to the witness of the fragment (e.g., Herodot. IV, 36), the text of the
fragment itself extracted from the source text of the witness, and sometimes also

For a detailed description of the content of this edition, see section 4.1.

78
79 Examples of groups of authors are Dionysodorus Boeotus and Anaxis Boeotus (FHG II 84),
who have only testimonia and not fragmenta, and the Andrones (FHG II 346–352: Andron
Ephesius, Andron Tejus, Andron Halicarnassensis, and Andron Alexandrinus).

80 An example of an author without an introduction is Ptolemaeus Euergetes II (FHG III 186–
189). Examples of authors without fragments are Cadmus Milesius (FHG II 2–4) and Psaon
Plataeensis (FHG III 198).

81 Exceptions are Strabo Amasensis (FHG III 490–491), Dexippus Atheniensis (FHG III 667),
Eunapius Sardianus (FHG IV 9–10), Priscus Panites (FHG IV 70), Malchus Philadelphensis
(FHG IV 111–112), Petrus Patricius (FHG IV 183–184), and Bardesane (FHG V 61–62), who
have separate sections entitled Testimonia. On different types of testimonia about authors
and works, and on the problem of distinguishing between testimonia and fragmenta, see
Laks (1997), part. 237: “La couple fragment/témoignage fait partie de l’appareil critique
primaire de tous les historiens de l’Antiquité, quel que soit le domaine considéré.” A fur-
ther example is the collection of the fragments of the Presocratic philosophers edited by
Diels/Kranz (1959–1960), who separate not only testimonia (A: Leben und Schriften) and
fragmenta (B: Fragmente), but also passages of texts influenced by fragmentary philoso-
phers (C: Imitationen).
See Pherecydes (FHG I 70), Eunapius Sardianus (FHG IV 10–11), Priscus Panites (FHG IV
70–71), Malchus Philadelphensis (FHG IV 112), Petrus Patricius (FHG IV 184), and Menan-
der Protector (FHG IV 200–201).

82

83 When fragments can’t be attributed to a fragmentary work, they are collected in sections
entitled fragmenta incerta, fragmenta incertae sedis, fragmenta incertorum operum, etc.

a short Latin commentary.85 Latin translations of work titles and fragments are
printed in the lower part of the page. FHG fragments may include more than
one witness under the same number, while in other cases related witnesses are
separated with different letters attached to the same fragment number.86 Frag-
ment numbers can be also accompanied by other characters like parentheses,
square brackets, and question marks which mean that Müller contests, suggests,
or doubts the attribution of a fragment to a certain author.87

Figure 1.10. Hecataeus of Miletus, FHG I 1

Given that the FHG includes a wide range of authors and works, there are parts
of the collection with different layouts. For example, in FHG I the chapters of
the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus are printed in two columns with the Greek text on
the left and the Latin translation on the right.88 Müller doesn’t produce a crit-

85

In many other cases works are divided into books with headings like liber primus, liber
secundus, etc. See, for example, the books of the Atthis of Philochorus: FHG I 384–410.
86 An example of the first case is fr. 161 of Ephorus (FHG I 276), which includes source
texts from both the Suda and Harpocration. An example of the second case is fr. 221 of
Theopompus (FHG I 315), which has two different witnesses numbered as fr. 221a and fr.
221b. On problems concerning the treatment of this kind of fragments in the DFHG, see p.
151 n. 51.
See, for example, FHG I 1, frr. 5 (?) and 7 (?); 56, fr. (83); II 14, fr. (5); 29, fr. [2]; 34, fr. [22];
361, frr. (4) and (5). On the representation of these characters, see p. 151 n. 52.

ical apparatus for the text of the fragmenta, excluding those fragments that are
excerpta from manuscripts. Examples are Diodorus Siculus, Polybius, and Diony-
sus of Halicarnassus at the beginning of FHG II, Nicolaus of Damascus in FHG
III, and John of Antioch in the appendix of FHG IV and in FHG V.89 FHG I in-
cludes also the text of the Marmor Parium (with Latin translation, chronological
table, and commentary) and the Greek text of the Marmor Rosettanum (with a
French literal translation as well as a critical, historical, and archaeological com-
mentary).90 FHG V has a different structure because it is divided into two parts.
The first part has fragments of Aristodemus, Eusebius, Priscus, John of Antioch,
John Malalas, Critobulus, Photius, the author of the Periplus of the Euxine Sea,
and Dionysius of Byzantium, while the second part has only the French transla-
tion of eleven authors with Greek and Syrian historical fragments preserved in
Armenian sources.91 Each volume of FHG I–IV has a praefatio (except for vol. III),
an index nominum et rerum, an index auctorum, an index titulorum, and addenda
et corrigenda. The two parts of FHG V have two distinct prefaces and final indices
of names.92

The fifteen volumes of the first three parts of Die Fragmente der griechischen
Historiker (FGrHist) were edited by Felix Jacoby and printed by the publisher
Brill between 1923 and 1958: Part I. Genealogie und Mythographie, Part II. Zeit-
geschichte, Part III. Geschichte von Städten und Völkern (Horographie und Ethno-
graphie).93 Authors are numbered sequentially within groups arranged by liter-
ary genres, and the organization of the collection is much more complex than
the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG).94 The FGrHist has a formal dis-
tinction between testimonia (T) and fragmenta (F), and the text of fragments is
provided with a critical apparatus, but not with a translation into a modern lan-
guage. Introductions to authors and commentaries to fragments are printed in
separate volumes.95 Jacoby groups fragments under work titles and book num-
bers, when this kind of information is available in the source texts, otherwise he

classifies them as of uncertain location. He also prints with spaced-out letters
those parts of the fragments that seem to be direct quotations.96 Volumes are ac-
companied by introductions, tables of contents, addenda, delenda and corrigenda,
cross-references, concordances with the FHG, and indices auctorum.97 Commen-
taries of the collection are in German, except for the supplement of volume B of
Part III which is in English (A Commentary on the Ancient Historians of Athens).98

Figure 1.11. Hellanicus, FGrHist 323a 40–41

Figure 1.11 shows the first page of Hellanicus at the beginning of the section of
the fragmentary local historians of Athens (FGrHist III B). In this part of the col-
lection Hellanicus has the number 323a with 8 testimonia and 29 fragmenta. Testi-
monies and fragments of Hellanicus are also printed in other parts of the FGrHist
because the author is classified according to different literary genres: nr. 4 (30
testimonia and 202 fragmenta) in FGrHist I (genealogy and mythography); nrr.
601a (2 fragmenta), 608a (7 fragmenta), 645a (1 fragmentum), and 687a (3 testimo-
nia and 11 fragmenta) in FGrHist III (under local histories of Thessaly, Egypt, and
Persia). In these different sections, the same source texts that preserve testimo-

texts of FGrHist fragments have been published by Bonnechère (1999) with description
and review by Marincola (2000).

nia and fragmenta of Hellanicus are frequently printed more than once because
their evidence covers different categories devised by Jacoby for classifying an-
cient Greek fragmentary historians.99 This situation is reflected in the Thesaurus
Linguae Graecae (TLG) online, which follows the printed edition of the FGrHist
and therefore reprints the same source texts when repeated by Jacoby in differ-
ent parts of his collection.100 Going back to figure 1.11, information in round
brackets after the number of testimonia and fragmenta includes cross-references
to other fragments in the FGrHist and correspondences with fragment numbers
of the FHG. Lines of the texts of fragments are numbered and referenced to in
the critical apparatus at the bottom of the page. Further elements in the page
may include fragmentary work titles and book numbers (in ancient Greek), and
chronological data.

Given that Felix Jacoby didn’t finish his monumental work, this task has been in-
herited by other scholars. Charles Fornara published the first fascicle of the com-
mentary to FGrHist III C,101 Pierre Bonnechère compiled the indices to FGrHist
I–III,102 while an international team has been working on publishing two other

Perikles)who had seen him, in his book entitled On Themistokles, Thukydides and Perikles.3 In my opinion I am the best speaker of all men on Homer, and neitherMetrodoros of Lampsakos, nor Stesimbrotos of Thasos nor Glaukon oranybody else, who has ever lived, could express so many and such beautifulthoughts on Homer as I can.4 Do you know a more foolish kind of people than the reciters of epicpoems? ... But you (sc. Nikeratos) gave Stesimbrotos and Anaximandros andmany others much money with the intention, that nothing of great valueshould escape your notice.5 Antimachos: A man from Kolophon ... some authors—completely mis-taken in their opinion—wrote that he was a servant of Panyasis the poet; forhe was his and Stesimbrotos’ disciple.F1. ON THEMISTOKLES, THUKYDIDES AND PERIKLES1 In spite of this Stesimbrotos asserts that Themistokles was a pupil ofAnaxagoras and attended the lectures of Melissos the physicist.But here heis obviously mistaken in his dates, for when Perikles, who was much younger thanThemistokles, was besieging Samos, Melissos was the general who opposed him, whileAnaxagoras was one of Perikles’ intimate friends. For this reason it is easier to believethose writers who say that Themistokles was an admirer of Mnesiphilos, a member ofthe same deme of Phrearrus.   -;  38

(FGrHist Continued): Part IV on Biography and Antiquarian Literature edited by
Guido Schepens and Stefan Schorn, and Part V on Die Geographen edited by Hans-
Joachim Gehrke and Felix Maier. A few fascicles of Part IV have been already pub-
lished as printed volumes, while the rest is currently being made available online
before the final printed publication.103 The online publication is part of the Jacoby
Online project that includes also the Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ) edited by Ian Wor-
thington, which is a “fully-revised and enlarged edition” of the FGrHist.104 One
of the aims of the continuation of Jacoby’s FGrHist is to make more accessible
the philological and historiographical complexity of textual remains of fragmen-
tary authors. This is one of the reasons why fascicles of Part IV have an English
translation of each fragment, and commentaries and notes are printed together
with testimonia and fragmenta and not in separate volumes (fig. 1.12).105 To dis-
tinguish the FGrHist Continued from the work of Jacoby, numbering of authors
of FGrHist Part IV starts from 1000 and numbers of authors of FGrHist Part V
starts from 2000.106

39

The Italian series I Frammenti degli Storici Greci directed by Eugenio Lanzil-
lotta is publishing monographs on single authors and sections originally collected
by Felix Jacoby in the FGrHist.107 The books of the series follow the traditional
way of publishing fragmentary texts in printed editions. They include a distinc-
tion between testimonia and fragmenta, which are accompanied by loci paralleli,
a critical apparatus, a translation into Italian, and a historical commentary. The
ancient text of testimonies and fragments is provided with an extensive context,
in order to help readers understand the reasons of the textual reuse.108 Com-
mentaries have footnotes and volumes include also bibliographies, concordances,
and indices of names and sources.109 In general, testimonia and fragmenta follow
the sequence of the FGrHist, but the goal of the series is to supplement and ex-
tend whenever possible the work of Jacoby by reviewing his work and adding
new fragments discovered after his publication.110 Figure 1.13 shows an example
of one of the fragments of Istros the Callimachean.111 The number of the frag-
ment is always accompanied, when available, by a reference to the corresponding
number of the FGrHist and of the FHG. Given the amount of witnesses for each
fragmentary author and given that the scope of the series is to provide histor-
ical commentaries, the critical apparatus is not based on new examinations of
manuscripts, papyri, and other primary surces, but on a selection of the most
important readings published in other editions.112 The goal of the historical com-
mentary is to focus on the context of the fragment and on the roles of the quoting
author who has preserved it.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital

Revolution

This chapter describes how fragmentary authors and works are represented
in the first generation of digital libraries. It also analyzes how hypertextual
models have been developing a new dimension, where textual fragments
are envisioned as text reuses preserved in contexts that cover and therefore
hide their original form. The first section (2.1) presents the relationship
between digital scholarship and textual fragments by describing how frag-
mentary texts are currently collected and published in digital libraries that
still depend on the printed editorial practice. The section introduces digital
projects that include Greek and Latin fragmentary texts, devotes specific
attention to the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (2.1.1) and to the Jacoby Online
(2.1.2) with the example of the edition of the fragments of Istros the Calli-
machean (2.1.3), and presents digital collections of physical fragments such
as inscriptions, papyri, and manuscripts that bear textual evidence (2.1.4).
The second section (2.2) describes how editions of fragmentary authors and
works are representations of hypertexts and how hypertextual theories in
literature and digital media are important for a new publishing model of
fragmentary texts in a digital environment. The last section (2.3) presents
the concept of cover-text that has led philologists to move the attention from
decontextualized fragments to the role of the context that preserves quota-
tions and reuses of lost texts. Parallel to this is the implementation of com-
putational techniques for text reuse detection that are now also applied to
historical data (2.3.1). Given that they are strictly connected to text reuse,
the two last sections focus the attention on intertextual analysis (2.3.2) and
translation alignment (2.3.3), whose methods are beginning to be experi-
mented with literary texts and historical documents.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution

2.1 Digital Scholarship and Textual Fragments

The digital revolution has been affecting primary and secondary textual sources
of Greek and Latin works.1 The first generation of digital libraries has converted
into a machine readable format the reconstructed text of single editions of Clas-
sical works. The goal of the second generation of digital libraries is to publish
multiple editions of the same work, reproduce the critical apparatus and all other
paratextual elements (prefaces, introductions, indices, bibliographies, notes, etc.),
and generate collaborative environments for new born-digital critical editions of
Greek and Latin sources.2 Fragmentary authors and works are directly involved
in this process because they consist of quotations and text reuses preserved by still
surviving sources. The problem is that the model according to which fragmentary
texts are currently represented in digital libraries is not satisfactory, because it
strongly depends on printed editorial practices. In the following pages, I describe
varieties of this model according to the most important collections of Greek and
Latin sources.

As far as ancient Greek sources are concerned, the Thesaurus Linguae Grae-
cae (TLG) is the most extended digital library that also includes many editions of
fragmentary authors and works. Given the huge amount of TLG texts and the im-
portance of the TLG Canon, I refer to section 2.1.1 for a more specific and detailed
analysis of the TLG treatment of fragmentary texts in its databank. The Perseus
Digital Library and the new Scaife Viewer don’t contain editions of fragmentary
authors and works, but the Open Greek and Latin (OGL) project has been offer-
ing a first set of digitized versions of printed editions of fragmentary authors and
works. In this case, the goal is to generate OCR outputs with a basic TEI XML
encoding of printed editions in order to produce machine readable files that allow
scholars to create digital versions of printed books and extract data for many dif-
ferent purposes. An example is constituted by the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum (DFHG) that will be described in chapter 4. A project specifically fo-
cused on producing digital editions of Greek fragmentary authors is Brill’s Jacoby
Online, which is continuing in a digital format the work started by Felix Jacoby
one century ago for collecting evidence of lost Greek historians. Considering its

specificity, the project will be discussed in section 2.1.2.3 As for Latin literature,
PHI Latin Texts is one of the electronic databases of Greek and Latin sources pro-
duced by the Packard Humanities Institute.4 PHI Latin Texts is a digital archive of
836 Latin works from 362 authors up to 200 CE with a selection of sources from
later antiquity. The Canon of the PHI Latin Texts offers an overview of authors
and works that are part of the collection with references to the printed editions
on which digital texts are based: http://latin.packhum.org/canon. Authors and
works are identified with numbers and abbreviations. For example, Marcus Tul-
lius Cicero is [0474 Cic] and Cicero’s In Catilinam (ed. A.C. Clark 1905) is [0474
013 Cic].5

PHI Latin Texts includes collections of fragmentary authors, such as the His-
toricorum Romanorum Reliquiae (HRR) by Hermann Peter.6 An example are the
fragments of the Latin Annales of Fabius Pictor [0061 001 hist].7 In this case,
PHI reproduces the text of only three of the six Latin fragments of Fabius Pictor
originally edited by Peter under the section Fabii Pictoris Latini Annales (3, 4, and

3

On these projects see also section 1.3. There are other still in progress plans for producing
digital editions of single Greek fragmentary authors or groups of authors belonging to
specific genres, as for example the fragments of Protagoras of Abdera by Tazuko van Berkel
at Leiden University, the fragments of Demetrius of Scepsis by Alexandra Trachsel at the
University of Hamburg, the fragments of Sceptic philosophers by Stéphane Marchand at
the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and the fragments of ancient Greek rhetoric and
oratory by Jan Heßler at the University of Würzburg. Another project is the collection and
edition of fragments and testimonies of historians from late antiquity at the University of
Düsseldorf, where they are producing printed editions with an online version. The project
is still in beta version and has been conceived as a traditional printed critical edition with
a parallel online presence: see Fischer (2017) 267–268.

4 These databases were originally published as CD-ROMs. PHI 5.3 was a collection of Latin
texts now freely accessible at http://latin.packhum.org: see Kozák (2018). PHI 7 was a
database of Greek inscriptions and documentary papyri. Greek inscriptions are online at
https://inscriptions.packhum.org, while documentary papyri are part of Papyri.info. On
PHI Greek Inscriptions, see p. 69.

5 The Canon of the PHI is now ingested in a new project for publishing and curating critical
editions of Latin texts, which is under development as the Digital Latin Library (DLL) and
which is also going to include fragmentary authors and works: https://digitallatin.org. The
HTML code of the PHI Canon embeds tags and attributes that can be used for extracting
data and reusing it for other purposes. The DLL has extracted this data and integrated
it in its catalog, which is a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource built according to the best
practices of library information science: https://catalog.digitallatin.org. For example,
Marcus Tullius Cicero is cataloged as DLL #A5129 and its entry is available at https://cata
log.digitallatin.org/dll-author/a5129. For a presentation of the DLL project, see Huskey
(2019) and Digital Latin Library Project (2021).
Peter (1870–1914).
See https://latin.packhum.org/author/61. This data is ingested in the DLL Catalog with a
DLL identifier (DLL #W2649): https://catalog.digitallatin.org/dll-work/w2649. Fragments
of Fabius Pictor have been encoded in TEI XML as part of the Digital Fabius Pictor project
developed at the University of Leipzig as a result of a collaboration between the Institute
of Computer Science and the Historical Seminar: see Straßburger (2018).

6).8 Moreover, PHI doesn’t publish the critical apparatus, the commentary, and
the context of the witnesses as Peter does, but reproduces only the words that
can be attributed to the original lost texts of Fabius Pictor (fig. 2.1).

An identical treatment of the Latin fragments of the Annales of Fabius Pictor
is available in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina (BTL) and in the Library of Latin
Texts Series A (LLT–A). The BTL online provides electronic access to all printed
editions of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina with a database that includes about
13 million word forms.9 The BTL publishes the same portions of fragments 3, 4,
and 6 as in PHI Latin Texts (fig. 2.2).
It allows to export a PDF file with the
text of the fragments and also different citation formats with a permanent URL.10
The Library of Latin Texts Series A (LLT–A) is part of a cluster of full-text Latin
databases and dictionaries which contains over 78 million Latin words from more
than 3,800 works attributed to ca. 1,200 authors.11 LLT–A provides the same por-
tions of fragments 3, 4, and 6 of Fabius Pictor as in PHI Latin Texts and in the
BTL, and allows users to export a PDF file with information about the author,
the texts, and the reference edition (figg. 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5).12 PHI Latin Texts
includes under the name of Fabius Pictor also the fragments of the Iuris Pontifi-
cis Libri ([0061 002 iur]) according to the edition Iurisprudentiae Anteiustinianae
Reliquiae by P.E. Huschke, E. Seckel, and B. Kübler (vol. I, 1908). LLT–A collects

8

Peter (1870–1914) I 112–113 (Greek fragments are at 5–39). PHI seems to publish only the
fragments that Peter attributed to Quintus Fabius Pictor and not those that he questioned
as being of Numerius Fabius Pictor. On these problems of attribution, see also FHG III
80–93, FGrHist (BNJ) 809, Cornell (2013) I 163–166, and Woodman (2015) 4–22.

As far as Latin fragments are concerned, I also point to Grammatici disiecti:
sources fragmentaires pour l’histoire de la grammaire latine (https://gradis.hyp
otheses.org/). The project is directed by Alessandro Garcea and is “a research
blog dedicated to gathering, for the first time, all Latin grammatical texts which
are preserved exclusively in fragmentary form.” The “primary purpose is to pub-
lish bio-bibliographical sketches of the authors of such texts, be they grammari-
ans, teachers, erudite writers or any other author who may have written works
on grammar, regardless of their position in society or their linguistic activity.”14
According to the description, Grammatici disiecti provides through a WordPress
website a list of Latin fragmentary grammarians dated between the 3rd century
BC and the 4th century CE. As soon as they are ready, the project publishes sep-
arate pages with complete bio-bibliographical presentations of the authors of the
collection.

Beyond the projects mentioned in these pages, there are also other resources
for accessing in many different ways digital versions of printed editions of frag-
mentary authors and works. For example, publishing companies have been of-
fering this kind of service through online subscriptions for individual and insti-
tutional customers. The Digital Loeb Classical Library offers “an interconnected,
fully searchable, perpetually growing, virtual library of all that is important in
Greek and Latin literature.”15 The online collection counts more than 520 vol-

15

14 A new edition of the corpus is in preparation for Les Belles Lettres editions (Collection des
Universités de France). As part of an interest in Latin grammarians, the project is connected
to the Corpus Grammaticorum Latinorum (CGL): see Garcea/Cinato et al. (2010).
See https://www.loebclassics.com. As of 2021, the annual subscription for individual
users is priced at $170 for the first year and $70 for subsequent consecutive years. Prices
for academic and public libraries depend on the size of the institutions interested in the
subscription.

umes of Latin, Greek, and English texts, which are available in an interface that
allows readers to browse, search, bookmark, annotate, and share content. The
Loeb online has also editions of fragmentary works, as for example the Greek
epic fragments published by Martin West in 2003 (fig. 2.7).16 Other examples
that are accessible with a subscription or direct payment are the Oxford Scholarly
Editions Online (OSEO), that enables readers to search across the texts, navigate
through reference forms and look up words in the Oxford Latin Dictionary (fig.
2.8),17 or the online Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana
that has put online PDF files of its editions including fragmentary authors and
works.18

Figure 2.7. Digital Loeb Classical Library: M.L. West, Greek Epic Fragments

A different kind of service is offered by mass digitization projects like Google
Books, Internet Archive, and HathiTrust, which have been giving free access to
millions of scanned copies of books that are in the public domain. These col-
lections contain also many volumes about Classical sources, allowing scholars
to rediscover past editions of ancient authors that comprise fragmentary ones.19

Needless to say that this is the first step toward an extraordinary contribution to
the preservation of an inestimable patrimony of past scholarship, which is often
neglected, not only because it is considered old and out-of-date, but also because
in many cases it is difficult to locate and consult in traditional libraries. An ex-
ample, among many others, is represented by the five volumes of the Fragmenta
Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) that will be described in chapter 4. These projects
offer not only the possibility to consult and read scholarly printed editions, but
also to get source files for experimenting with Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) techniques. As for ancient Greek sources, this kind of experimentation
is being performed by the Open Greek and Latin (OGL) project and by Lace: Greek
OCR, which is directed by Bruce Robertson at Mount Allison University.20 The
project has an online catalog with an updated list of OCRed texts including edi-
tions of fragmentary authors and works. Through the list, it is possible to access
single books, visualize the alignment of the image of each page with its OCR
stages, download the relevant files, and also contribute with manual OCR post-
correction.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution

2.1.1 Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG)

As I mentioned in chapter 1, since the beginning the TLG has addressed the prob-
lem of dealing with lost authors in the Canon and in the online collection. As far
as the catalog and the publication of textual fragments are concerned, the TLG fol-
lows standards and conventions of printed editions of fragmentary authors and
works.21 An example is the fragmentary historian Hecataeus of Miletus, who
corresponds to tlg0538. In the TLG Hecataeus is classified as historicus, is dated
between the 6th and the 5th century BC (6–5 B.C.), and has the geographical
epithet Milesius. In this case, the reference edition is FGrHist 1 and the TLG fol-
lows the arrangement of Felix Jacoby with his distinction between 25 testimonia
(tlg0538.001) and 373 fragmenta (tlg0538.002).22

Figure 2.9. TLG: Hecataeus Milesius (tlg0538)

The TLG adds two other witnesses to Jacoby’s fragment 145 that were published
by Hans Joachim Mette as 145bis (a and b) (tlg0538.003).23 Figure 2.9 shows the
pop-up window of Hecataeus with bibliographic references and the word count
of the texts of testimonies and fragments, excluding the apparatus criticus and
the commentary that are not reproduced in the TLG. Figures 2.10 and 2.11 show
how Hecataeus’ fragment 145bis was originally published by Mette and how is
replicated in the online TLG, which closely reproduces the layout of the printed
page and adds symbols to mark lines in its files: l1 marks the line with the ref-
erence to the witness until the colon, 1 marks the line with the Greek text of the

For a list of epithets and work classifications that identify fragmentary authors and works
belonging to different literary genres in the TLG, see pp. 21 and 23.
For the fragmenta of Hecataeus, the TLG provides further classifications (Historica,
Mythographa, and Periegesis).

fragment, and @1 stands for page end.24 The TLG provides a link to cite the page
with the edition of Mette, which incorporates author and work numbers (0538
and 003): http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/Iris/Cite?0538:003:0 (fig. 2.12).25 As part
of the online TLG services, it is also possible to perform morphological analyses
and obtain statistics about the words of the texts of the fragments (see below).

Figure 2.10. Mette (1978) 6 = Hecataeus, FGrHist 1 F 145bis

Figure 2.11. TLG: Hecataeus, FGrHist 1 F 145bis = Mette (1978) 6

Figure 2.12. TLG: link to cite Hecataeus, FGrHist 1 F 145bis = Mette (1978) 6

Another example is Hellanicus of Lesbos, who is represented in a similar way
in the TLG with a reproduction of the testimonia and the fragmenta from the
FGrHist and Mette (1978). In this case, the TLG allows users to select fragments
from the different FGrHist sections of Hellanicus arranged by Felix Jacoby, and

24

@1: “marks end of page in source text regardless of whether page is part of the citation
system. All files end in @1”. This method seems to be not consistent in the TLG corpus.
Cf. the example of Hellanicus below.

25 On TLG author and work numbers, see p. 19 n. 55. The TLG doesn’t provide identifiers
for single fragments: in this case, 003 refers to the edition of Mette and not specifically to
fragment 145bis with its two witnesses.

52

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution

there is also a specific reference to fragments on papyrus (figg. 2.13 and 2.14).26
As far as the layout of the FGrHist page is concerned, the TLG tries to replicate
it. Figures 2.15 and 2.16 show how Hellanicus’ fragments 2–5 (FGrHist 323a) are
represented in the printed edition of Jacoby’s FGrHist and in the online TLG. The
TLG reproduces the text of the fragments including references to other source
texts and follows the FGrHist in printing with spaced-out letters those parts of
the fragments that seem to be direct quotations (cf. p. 36). Missing elements are
the critical apparatus and therefore line numbers for the text of the fragments,
references in round brackets to the corresponding numbers of the fragments in
other parts of the FGrHist and in the FHG, references in angle brackets to other
fragments of the same FGrHist section, chronological data in the margin of the
page, and references to fragmentary work titles (in this case Ἀτθίς) and to book
numbers (in this case Β) according to which fragments are arranged in the col-
lection.

Figure 2.13. TLG: Hellanicus (tlg0539)

Considering that the TLG is not only a digital collection of texts but also a cata-
log of ancient Greek works based on printed editions, it would have been better
to include at least the reference to fragmentary work titles and book numbers
provided by Felix Jacoby, because they are a fundamental element to understand

26 PSI X 1173; P.Oxy. X 1241; P.Giss. 307v; fr. 133bis (= P.Oxy. XXVI 2442). It is not clear the
criterion used by the TLG for selecting these papyri, because there are other fragments of
Hellanicus preserved on papyrus but not mentioned in the breakdown: FGrHist 4 F 19b
(P.Oxy. VIII 1084), F 68 (P.Oxy. XIII 611), and F 197bis (= PSI XIV 1390). There is also an
inscription among the testimonia: FGrHist 4 T 30 (IG II/III2 2363). On the evidence of these
physical fragments, see section 2.1.4.

the content of the fragments and the editorial structure of the FGrHist.27 Never-
theless, the online TLG provides a very powerful search engine and useful tools
for performing morphological analyses and getting statistics and n-grams, which
represent an invaluable addition to printed editions of ancient source texs. For
example, by selecting the word Ἀτθίδος in F 2 of Hellanicus (FGrHist 323a), it is
possible to get not only the morphological analysis of the word with links to the
entry in different lexica (LSJ, MiddleLS, and DGE), but also statistics about the use
and the distribution of the word in the TLG corpus: A summary of the use of the
lemma (fig. 2.17), its distribution by century, its relative distribution by century
(fig. 2.18), its highest use by author, and its relative distribution by author. The
TLG provides also work statistics and in this case, for example, it is possible to
visualize results for the FGrHist fragments of Hellanicus reproduced in the TLG
(tlg0539.002) (fig. 2.19).28

Figure 2.17. TLG: statistics for the lemma Ἀτθίς, -ίδος, ἡ (summary)

These examples, even if limited to historians, show how fragmentary authors and
works are accessible through the TLG. The same dependency on the printed ed-
itorial practice is evident if we examine fragmentary authors belonging to other
literary genres in the TLG. Moreover, one of the downsides of this structure of
the TLG is the fact that the corpus has duplicates of texts. This phenomenon is
intrinsic to scholarship of fragmentary literature, because “a collection of frag-

27 To our knowledge, titles (tituli) of fragmentary works are present in the TLG if they are
the unique evidence of a fragmentary work: cf. p. 19. As for fragmentary historians, an
example is the TLG author Promathidas (tlg2300) with one titulus (Ἡμίαμβοι: tlg2300.003)
from Lloyd-Jones/Parsons (1983) 345.
It is also possible to get statistics for the entire corpus of Hellanicus or only for the FGrHist
testimonia (tlg0539.001) and for the fragmentum published by Mette (1978) (tlg0539.003).

ments simply duplicates the information contained in other books in a good li-
brary. All the texts it brings are usually available elsewhere.” In a philological
world dominated by printed books, this condition is inevitable in order to collect
knowledge and “concentrate information otherwise widely disseminated.”29 In a
digital world, where resources are more easily accessible and linkable, the inher-
itance of printed editorial methods by digital libraries is problematic, because the
digital duplication of texts generates distorted results.30

Figure 2.20. TLG: N-grams for Ἀττικῶν, δεδήλωκεν, and Ἴστρος

Going back to the examples mentioned above, if we take into consideration F 2 of
Hellanicus (FGrHist 323a), we can see how the context of the fragment is repeated
several times in the TLG (fig. 2.20). If we activate the TLG n-gram functionality
for the string δεδήλωκεν Ἴστρος ἐν γʹ τῶν Ἀττικῶν, we can see that the text is
repeated four times in the TLG: as Hellanicus FGrHist 4 F 39 (tlg0539.002) and
323a F 2 (tlg0539.002), as Ister FHG I fr. 7 (tlg1450.004), and as Harpocr. Lex. s.v.
Παναθήναια (tlg1389.002). The text is also repeated under Androtion FHG I fr.

1 (tlg1125.003), but ends before the quoted string.31 In all these cases, the only
citable evidence is the text of the Lexicon of Harpocration, which is the surviving
text that reuses the lost passages of Hellanicus, Ister, and Androtion and which
is therefore repeated multiple times in the editions of these fragmentary authors.
If this situation has the advantage of allowing users to visualize the same text in
different editions, the problem is that from a computational point of view these
repetitions generate wrong results when querying the TLG corpus. They also
produce the wrong impression of the existence of fragmentary texts that, as a
matter of fact, don’t exist any more but are only preserved through quotations
and reuses in other texts.

Fragmentary texts come not only from quotations and text reuses, but also
from material fragments like papyri, inscriptions, and excerpts in manuscripts.
In the example of Hellanicus mentioned above, there are six fragments preserved
on papyrus and one testimony from an inscription (fig. 2.13).32 In this case the
texts of the fragments are reproduced following the content and the layout of
the FGrHist and of Mette (1978), but there are no links to external resources.33
Another example is the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, which is a historiographical work
preserved only on physical fragments. Also in this case the text is reproduced in
the TLG following its reference printed editions (tlg0558).34

2.1.2 Jacoby Online (JO)

Jacoby Online (JO) is a project specifically aimed at ancient Greek fragmentary
historians.35
It is maintained by the Dutch publisher Brill and is part of a big
scholarly enterprise whose goal is to continue and update the editorial work of
Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (FGrHist) began by Felix Jacoby in the
Twenties of last century (cf. pp. 35 ff.). The project is also the result of an ongo-
ing effort to make more user-friendly and accessible the volumes of the FGrHist,

31 The complete text of the lexical entry is published only under the Lexicon of Harpocration,
while in the other cases the text is partially cut in the same way as it is published in the
FHG and in the FGrHist.
FGrHist 4 T 30, FF 19b, 68, 124b, 133bis, 189, and 201bis.

33 The text of some of these papyri is available through Trismegistos and other digital re-
sources: P.Oxy. VIII 1084 (http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/sx61dp87h); P.Oxy. X 1241
(www.trismegistos.org/text/63428); P.Oxy. XXVI 2442 (www.trismegistos.org/text/62564);
PSI X 1173 (www.trismegistos.org/text/61611). The texts of IG II/III2 2363 is available
through PHI Greek Inscriptions (https://inscriptions.packhum.org/text/4599). On these and
other digital resources for material fragmentary texts, see section 2.1.4.

which is a notoriously difficult tool to consult, especially for students of Classics.
The first steps of this effort were the publication of complete indices to FGrHist I–
III by Pierre Bonnechère and the production of a Windows compatible CD-ROM
version of the fifteen volumes of Jacoby’s FGrHist I–III and of Bonnechère’s in-
dices.36 The CD-ROM was welcomed as an “excellent tool” and as “a miracle of
20th-century scholarship with a miracle of 21st-century technology.”37 For the
first time, users had the possibility to search numerical and alphabetical lists of
the 856 FGrHist authors and to be immediately brought with one click to the rela-
vant part of the collection concerning the requested historian.38 Those who have
spent many hours in the library to consult the printed version of the FGrHist
— looking for information about authors scattered in the fifteen volumes of the
collection — greately enjoyed the advantages of a single CD-ROM with search
and hypertextual functionalities, and the possibility to visualize notes of the crit-
ical apparatus in dialogue babbles appearing on lines with textual problems and
variants.39 The CD-ROM version was based on the layout of the printed edition
(“page-based”) and the aim was to produce, as far as possible, an exact represen-
tation of the printed volumes.40

The CD-ROM version of the FGrHist is now superseded by the online edition
which is part of the Jacoby Online project. The current online version is under
revision and a new interface is going to be launched as part of a collaboration with
the company Eldarion, that has also developed the Scaife Viewer for the Perseus
Digital Library: https://scaife.perseus.org. An overview of the new version of the
Jacoby Online will be described in this section after a description of the current
version, which has been used by many scholars in the last ten years.41

36 Bonnechère (1999) and Jacoby (2005). For reviews of the CD-ROM, see Marincola (2005),

Worthington (2005), Walter (2005), and Cornell (2006).

37 Marincola (2005) and Cornell (2006) 186.
38 The home page and the booklet accompanying the CD-ROM contained a detailed history
of Jacoby and his work written by Mortimer Chambers, which is now available as part of
the online version of the Jacoby Online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_boj_abiogra
fie_jacoby.

For a detailed description of the CD-ROM, see Marincola (2005), who also points at its
limits, such as the price (€ 1,500) and the fact that pieces of information on the margins of
the FGrHist pages were not interactive and that the addenda and corrigenda sections had
to be manually searched.
I’m very grateful to Ernest Suyver and Mirjam Elbers for giving me access to the demo
version of the new Jacoby Online and in general for the opportunity to work with them
as a contributor and copy editor of the Jacoby Online project: see section 2.1.3. This col-
laboration now also includes the connection between the Jacoby Online and the Digital
Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) project, that I have been implementing and
that is described in chapter 4.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution

In order to be accessed and consulted, the Jacoby Online project requires a

subscription and includes five sections:42

1. Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker Part I–III. This is the online ver-
sion of the first three parts of the FGrHist originally published by Felix Jacoby.
It gives access to alphabetical and numerical lists of fragmentary authors, to the
“commentary on cities and peoples,” and to the addenda. In the “Prelims,” it is pos-
sible to consult an introduction to the life and the work of Felix Jacoby, notes for
readers (abbreviations, corrigenda, and indexes), and prefaces. Texts of fragments
are reproduced as they appear in the FGrHist, together with commentaries and
notes. Introductions, testimonia, fragmenta, commentaries, notes, and selected
addenda to every author are published together in the same web page. A menu
on the upper right part of the page contains links to each testimony and frag-
ment. Introductions to authors contain also note numbers, but without links to
the actual notes that seem not to have been included in the online collection. Fig-
ure 2.21 shows the example of FGrHist 323a F 2 in the Jacoby Online that can be
compared with the printed page at figure 2.15. References to corresponding FHG
and FGrHist fragments have been removed, as well as the notes on the margins of
the printed pages. Another difference with the printed edition is the addition of
links to the corresponding BNJ fragments (see below). Critical notes to the text
of the fragments are reproduced in footnotes at the bottom of the web page and
have numbers following the numerical sequence of the notes to the commentary.
Those parts of the fragments that Jacoby considered to be direct quotations are
reproduced with orange coloured letters and not with spaced-out letters as in the
FGrHist. Search and index functions are shared with other parts of the Jacoby
Online.43

2. Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker Part IV. This is the online ver-
sion of the FGrHist Continued on ancient Greek biography and antiquarian lit-
erature that Felix Jacoby was never able to publish. According to the plan, this
section will consist of 27 book volumes, some of which have been already pub-
lished in a printed format.44 Before the final printed publication, fragmentary au-
thors are progressively published online following the editorial guidelines of the
Jacoby Online project. This means that, after each introduction to authors with
interactive footnotes, there is a “brief encyclopaedia-style entry” with chrono-
logical, literary, and geographical metadata. A similar entry is at the beginning
of each testimony and each fragment with information on the witnesses, their

42 As of 2021, the “online subscription price” is € 1,1761 with an “annual update fee” of € 1,285.

The “institutional outright purchase price” is € 20,332.

chronology, language, and literary genre. Every testimony and fragment is ac-
companied by an English translation and a full commentary (see figure 2.22 to be
compared with the printed page at figure 1.12).45 Critical notes are expressed in
footnotes and there are interactive links to fragments of other parts of the FGrHist
and the BNJ. Each author section has a bibliography at the end of the web page.
Unlike the FGrHist, which was the work of one scholar, FGrHist IV is the result of
a team of researchers working on different authors under the direction of Stefan
Schorn and an editorial board. Search and index functions are shared with other
sections of the Jacoby Online.

3. Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker Part V. This is the part of the
FGrHist Continued that concerns geography. The plan is to publish testimonies
and fragments of 96 Greek historians with the collaboration of a team of scholars
under the direction of Hans-Joachim Gehrke and Felix Maier.46 The online edito-
rial layout is the same of FGrHist IV and search and index functions are shared
with other sections of the Jacoby Online.

4. Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ). The BNJ is described by its editor-in-chief Ian
Worthington in the home page of the project: “Brill’s New Jacoby is a fully-revised
and enlarged edition of Jacoby’s Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker I–III,
providing new texts of the ancient historians in many instances as well as several
new historians and many new fragments of existing historians that were either
unknown to Jacoby or excluded by him. Especially important is that for the first
time ever commentaries are provided on the final 248 historians in FGrHist I–

45 Given that this is an ongoing project, it is possible to see variants and changes in the

editorial treatment of authors and fragments.

III, which Jacoby was unable to prepare before his death. In addition, and also
for the first time, Brill’s New Jacoby presents facing English translations of all
the testimonia and fragments, new, critical commentaries on all the testimony
and fragments, and a brief encyclopedia-style entry about each historian’s life
and works, with a select bibliography.”47 Figure 2.23 shows the example of Istros
the Callimachean (BNJ 334 T 1). Editors of the BNJ are provided with guidelines
and a template to be filled in with metadata and data about fragmentary authors
and their works.
In order to be consistent, the project offers also lists of sub-
jects for authors, testimonies, and fragments, and special tags are used by copy
editors for hyperlinks and anchors of named entities, bibliographic elements, tes-
timonies’ and fragments’ numbers.48 Each entry has a final Biographical essay
on the fragmentary author and a bibliography.49 The BNJ keeps the numbering
system of Jacoby and new authors are inserted in the appropriate section with
the same number as the preceding author followed by A or B in order to distin-
guish them.50 Following the principle of offering a more user-friendly version of
the FGrHist, the BNJ provides not only new commentaries and English transla-
tions, but also expanded references to source texts and to bibliographic entries,
chronological and literary information, and links and metadata to help readers
contextualize fragments and witnesses. Search and index functions are shared
with other sections of the Jacoby Online.

5. Brill’s New Jacoby, Second Edition (BNJ2). This part is a “revised and en-
larged edition of Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ). New additions include an apparatus
criticus and a discussion of the provenance of each fragment where relevant, as
well as revised commentaries on the ancient historians in BNJ and updated bib-
liographies, all of which set BNJ2 significantly apart from the previous edition.”
The online editorial layout is the same of BNJ and search and index functions are
shared with other sections of the Jacoby Online.

As mentioned before, the current version of the Jacoby Online is going to be
substitued by a new version in the near future. This new version is presented in a
webpage entitled Documentation for Jacoby Online, which is maintained by Brill
Scholary Editions and published with GitBook.51 Given that this documentation
is public, my aim is not to repeat it here, but to summarize two main character-
istics of the new Jacoby Online there were also discussed as part of a seminar

2.1 Digital Scholarship and Textual Fragments

Figure 2.24. New Jacoby Online demo (early 2020)

organized at Brill in Leiden on January 22, 2020 with the participation of Stefan
Schorn, James Tauber, Ian Worthington, Cecily Robinson, Mirjam Elbers, Ernest
Suyver and myself. The first important characteristic in order to combine the
needs of the contributors and the needs of the Jacoby Online is the substitution
of Brill XML files, that were used in the past, with BPT files as a basic format to
produce TEI XML files for the publication on Brill Scholarly Editions (fig. 2.24).52
New extended Guidelines for authors have been written about entry structure,
publication statement, the historian, testimonia, fragments, biographical essay
and bibliography.

The second important aspect of the new Jacoby Online is the adoption of
the CITE Architecture to produce uniform and stable identifiers of the following
seven JO objects:53 1) textgroup: a group of fragments, united by origin, theme,
and/or (most common) authorship; 2) fragment: a textual remnant of an other-
wise lost work (“Fragment is a child of textgroup. We could have a collection level
= fgrh”); 3) historian: author of an (in the case of JO) lost historiographical work
(“Historian is metadata about (a version of) a textgroup”); 4) work: (in the case
of JO) lost historiographical work (“Work is metadata about (a version of) a frag-
ment”); 5) source: text (itself a work) containing a citation of or reference to a lost
work or its author; 6) entry: a textgroup as analyzed by modern scholars (“Entry
is metadata about (a version of) a textgroup”); 7) edition: edition of the source

both CITE and CTS URNs to cite texts, papyri, inscriptions and fragments. The

specific extensions. BPT supports the inclusion of additional mark-up, such as Leiden+

references, and HTML. Figure 2.24 shows an example of the demo of the new Jacoby Online

2.1.3 Printed and Digital Fragments: Istros the Callimachean

The edition of the fragments of Istros the Callimachean is an example of a work
shifting from printed to digital characteristics. I originally conceived this work
in the form of a printed book as part of the Italian series I Frammenti degli Storici
Greci. The first volume containing the fragments on Athens and Attica was pub-
lished in 2009 and its characteristics have been described in section 1.4.54 I pub-
lished a second edition with the testimonia and all the seventy-seven fragments of
Istros the Callimachean in 2015 for the Brill’s New Jacoby, as the result of an invi-
tation by Ian Worthington to complete the work originally begun by the late Steve
Jackson (fig. 2.25).55 This edition presents fragments according to the traditional
model of printed editions, but with the addition of metadata and hyperlinks that
will be further expanded in the revision of the fragments for the second edition
of BNJ and as part of the new version of the Jacoby Online.

Figure 2.26. DFHG: Ister (concordance of editions)

As it will be extensively described in chapters 4 and 5, one of the goals of new
born-digital editions of fragmentary texts is to expand and connect resources. As
far as Istros is concerned, the first step was accomplished by producing the digital
version of its fragments published by Karl Müller in the Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum, which is fundamental to understand the edition of Felix Jacoby in
Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker. Figure 2.26 shows the concordance
among the entries of Istros in different resources as part of the Müller-Jacoby
Table of Concordance of the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum project
(see section 4.4.3). Future work will conceive the edition of the fragments of Istros
the Callimachean not as the extraction of chunks of text (fragmenta), but as the
annotation of pieces of information concerning him and his works in the context
of surviving sources.56 The lack of digital versions of all the sources that preserve
testimonies and text reuses of Istros is still a limit for the accomplishment of
this task, but preliminary results are now available through the Digital Athenaeus
project (see chapter 5).

Figure 2.27 shows the lemma Ἴστρος and its inflected forms in the Named
Entities Concordance of the Deipnosophists.57 The concordance highlights the
name of Istros (red) (and the homonymous river) and other named entities (blue-
green) pertaining to him, such as other authors, ethnica, and work titles that are
cited in the immediate context. The extraction and annotation of Named Entities
pertaining to text reuses of lost authors is the beginning of a new philological
practice that will enable scholars to produce new digital and dynamic editions of
fragmentary authors and works within their context of transmission.

2.1.4 Digital Collections of Physical Fragmentary Texts

The expression fragmentary texts refers not only to quotations and text reuses,
but also to physical fragments that bear textual evidence, which includes many
examples of literary texts. As we have seen before, the TLG and the Jacoby On-
line collect also texts of ancient Greek authors preserved on material fragments.
Scholars interested in getting more information about this type of sources have
now at their disposal many digital projects and resources devoted to collecting
data about physical fragments (inscriptions, papyri, manuscripts, etc.). A com-
plete description of these resources is beyond the scope of this volume, but, in
order to be up to date with them, I refer to the Digital Classicist Wiki, which is
a hub for collecting guidelines, suggestions, and catalogs of digital projects con-
cerning the Graeco-Roman world.58 In this section, I limit my presentation to the
most important digital reference tools that can be used in a scholarly work about
ancient Greek fragmentary authors and works.

The PHI Greek Inscriptions is an electronic database produced by the Packard
Humanities Institute.59 It offers a comprehensive collection of searchable Greek
inscriptions arranged by ancient regions and modern scholarly collections. The
reconstructed text of the inscriptions is reproduced according to the main corpora
and reference printed editions, but without the critical apparatus and the com-
mentaries. This resource allows users to find the text of inscriptions that have
been classified also as testimonia or fragmenta of fragmentary authors. Examples
are IG II/III2 2363, IG XII 5, 444, and IG XIV 1293. IG II/III2 2363 is a 2nd-1st cen-
tury BC inscription from Piraeus with a catalog of mostly Attic writers including
Hellanicus (col. 2, 4 = FGrHist (BNJ) 4 T 30).60 IG XII 5, 444 is a 3rd century BC
inscription with the text of the Marmor Parium, which is a historiographical frag-
mentary work attested only on stone (= Jacoby (1904) and FGrHist (BNJ) 239).61
IG XIV 1293 is a marble plaque (Tabula Albana) with inscriptions of uncertain
provenance and date that preserve an anonymous history of Heracles (FGrHist
(BNJ) 40 F 1).62 The complete texts of these inscriptions are available through
the PHI Greek Inscriptions website (fig. 2.28).63 The resource provides links to
other publications within the PHI database, but not to external resources. Each
inscription has a unique reference number, which is also embedded in a stable
URL.

and now expanding to the Ancient World in general.64 Trismegistos offers many
resources and gives the possibility to obtain metadata concerning also physical
fragments that have been attributed to fragmentary authors and works. An in-
teresting service is the Authors database for searching ancient author names and
work titles. The aim of the resource is to collect information about all authors who
wrote between 800 BC and 800 CE including also “authors attested only as frag-
ments in other works.” As for now, the resource is based on the Leuven Database
of Ancient Books (LDAB) and Trismegistos editors warn users about limits, errors,
and possible lack of data.

Going back to the examples mentioned in the previous pages, Trismegistos
has an entry about Hellanicus of Lesbos with a stable URI: https://www.trisme
gistos.org/author/358. The resource provides metadata (chronology, onomastics,
ethnic, genre, language and bibliography) and links to different types of external
resources such as Wikipedia, the manuscript collection of Pinakes, the Perseus Cat-
alog, the TLG Canon, and Jacoby Online (fig. 2.29). As far as Hellanicus’ works are
concerned, Trismegistos collects three papyri differentiating them between direct
attestations and quotations (fig. 2.30): P.Oxy. VIII 1084 (Atlantis), P.Oxy. XXVI

64

For a detailed history and description of the project, see Reggiani (2017) 56–73, and Depauw
(2018). Trismegistos was an open resource that, starting from January 1, 2020, requires a
subscription to access all search interfaces and visualisations due to shortcuts in funding:
1) unlimited access through a subscribed institution (€ 990,91 excl. VAT per year), 2) insti-
tutional access for one concurrent user through a login (€ 299 per year excl. VAT), and 3)
personal single user access through a login (€ 199 per year incl. VAT).

2442 + P.Oxy. LXXV 5039 (opus incertum), and PSI XIV 1390 (opus incertum).65
P.Oxy. VIII 1084 is a papyrus dated between the 1st and the 2nd century CE,
whose text has been attributed to the Atlantis of Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGrHist
(BNJ) 4 F 19b). Trismegistos offers a detailed description of the papyrus including
the attribution to Hellanicus (direct attestation), a reference to the FGrHist, and a
link to Papyri.info for other metadata and pictures (fig. 2.31).66 P.Oxy. XXVI 2442
is constituted by several fragments of papyrus dated to the 2nd and 3rd centuries
CE with fragments and scholia to Pindar that mention the name of Hellanicus
(fr. 29, 1–8 = Mette (1978) 7, fr. 133bis = BNJ 4 F 101a). P.Oxy. LXXV 5039 is
associated to the previous papyrus because it belongs to the same set of rolls, but
doesn’t contain the name of Hellanicus. Trismegistos has a page with metadata
about both papyri and includes the reference to Hellanicus specifying that this is
a reference to his name (quoted) and not one of his fragments (direct attestation),
but in the bibliography doesn’t refer to the BNJ.67 PSI XIV 1390 is constituted by
three fragments dated to the 2nd century CE and contains a scholion to Euphorion
that mentions the name of Hellanicus (FGrHist 4 F 197bis = BNJ 4 F 197a). Tris-
megistos has a page on the papyrus with metadata, a reference to the fact that
Hellanicus is quoted in the text but this is not one of his direct attestations, and
a link to the database of the Papiri della Società Italiana with further information
and pictures.68

The TM Authors database allows also to search work titles. An example

It is not clear why PSI XIV 1390 is repeated twice, but Trismegistos editors warn about
possible duplicates still present in the database. Trismegistos text types are related to the
Leuven Database of Ancient Books (LDAB) metadata. As of now, there are four text types
in Trismegistos: 1) Direct attestation (13,445 of the 15,101 attestations of authors in texts):
this means that the text preserves the work of author X; 2) Quoted (882 attestations): this
means that in the text a work of author X is quoted or referred to; 4) Commented upon
(352 attestations): this means that a work of author X is the subject of a commentary;
5) Epitomised (422 attestations): this means that a work of author X is summarised.
In
the past there was also 3) Translated, but now there is a separate entry in works for each
translation. I’m very grateful to Mark Depauw for this information about the current state
of text types in Trismegistos.

Cairo.69 Given that Trismegistos collects data from other resources and the Au-
thors database is a work in progress, there are papyri associated with the name
of Hellanicus that are still missing or that are not yet imported in the author sec-
tion, and data from Jacoby Online seems not to have been completely ingested.70
In spite of that, Trismegistos is producing a fundamental resource for connecting
and aggregating databases and metadata about the ancient world through stable
identifiers and following recommendations and best practices of the Linked Open
Data (LOD) initiative.71 Considering the huge amount of data to be collected and
inserted into a complex database structure, the project is a model for establishing
a collaborative environment and an integrated network of scholars on the ancient
world.72 As far as fragmentary texts are concerned, this resource is very promis-
ing not only for publishing comprehensive digital data about physical fragments
of literary texts, but also for aggregating catalog data about fragmentary authors
and works (cf. sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2).

I.Sicily (Inscriptiones Siciliae) is a project directed by Jonathan Prag at the
University of Oxford for making freely available online the complete corpus of
inscriptions from ancient Sicily in all languages from the 7th century BC through
late antiquity.73
Inscriptions are encoded in XML according to the TEI Epi-
Doc schema and are stored in a database that can be filtered and searched in
many different ways.74 Each document has a unique identifier, as for example
ISic000298.75
Identifiers are cross-referenced with other collections like Tris-
megistos (TM), PHI Greek Inscriptions, and the Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR).
The goal of the project is to provide a new edition of every inscription with
images, a commentary, and an up to date bibliography maintained in a separate
public Zotero group library: https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445. An exam-
ple for our interests in ancient Greek fragmentary historiography is represented

https://www.trismegistos.org/authorwork/2177

70 An example is P.Oxy. X 1241 that is part of Trismegistos and bibliographical metadata
includes a reference to FGrHist 4 F 189, but the papyrus is not yet part of the Authors
database: https://www.trismegistos.org/text/63428. Another resource connected to
Trismegistos is the Digital Corpus of Literary Papyri (DCLP), which is building on tools and
data of the Integrating Digital Papyrology project and Papyri.info to establish a database of
literary papyri: http://www.litpap.info. Trismegistos numbers allow to obtain information
concerning literary papyrological resources about fragmentary historians. For example,
through TM 59974, it is possible to browse the DCLP and visualize the page on P.Oxy. VIII
1084, which is the papyrus with a fragment of the Atlantis of Hellanicus (see above in the
text): http://litpap.info/dclp/59974.

by five painted fragments dated between the 3rd and the 2nd century BC from
Tauromenium, which preserve traces of entries possibly belonging to a library
catalogue. The text contains bio-bibliographic information about ancient authors
who wrote in Greek: the fragmentary historians Callisthenes of Olynthus (BNJ
124), Philistos of Syracuse (BNJ 556), and Quintus Fabius Pictor (BNJ 809), an au-
thor from Elea whose name is lost and the fragmentary philosopher Anaximan-
der.76 The edition of the fragments in I.Sicily is still incomplete without images, a
physical and epigraphic description, a critical apparatus and a commentary, but
already includes bibliographic records, the current geo-location, and the date of
the autopsy of the document.77 The Greek text is based on the edition provided
by PHI and is published in three versions: interpreted, diplomatic, and download-
able TEI EpiDoc XML. The text has a corresponding identifier in Trismegistos (TM
494031), whose entry includes bibliographic records but still misses further meta-
data about the fragments and their linguistic content.78
