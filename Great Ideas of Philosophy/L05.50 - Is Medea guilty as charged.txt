Lecture 5 is Medea Guilty as Charged, the Greek Tragedians on Man's Fate.
In a previous lecture, I noted that when Theseus finally found his way back out of the labyrinth,
he set sail and, after abandoning good Ariadne on the island of Noxus, that being the subject
of opera, legend and song, he returned to the mainland and he recovered, he decoded
the labyrinthine maze through the cranes dance. He undertook the dance of the cranes
and in those dance steps, he repeated just what one would have to do to get back out
of the labyrinth and I suggested a certain parallel between Theseus' dance of the cranes
and the dance of the bees that locates the flowers with the greatest amount of nectar.
What's this dancing all about in primitive societies or what we call primitive societies?
What's this dancing all about in Homer and the Ovid and other classical literature?
Well, it has been argued by more than one cultural scholar. Eric Havlock is the one
who comes to mind in this connection. It has been observed by more than one scholar that
pre-literate societies, societies without a written and recordable language, have rather
limited resources with which to set down, as it were, what is worth knowing by those
coming along, by children who have to learn the lessons of the tribe or the community
and that one surefire way of recording what is of great value is through the art of the
dance itself, that is, through certain dance steps which can be rehearsed and repeated and
learned by others. One can symbolize events of great, great moment, not only symbolize
them but lay them out in a very definite and choreographed order. So to some extent, the
earliest cultural memories of a community are recorded, coded as it were, choreographically.
Now one can add to this, one can give great vividness and vitality to the dance steps by
having the dance accompanied by a chorus, by lyrics of a certain kind, by song. This
isn't going to be the developed grand opera of Puccini but it's certainly going to be
something that has a musical and metrical character to it and where the lyric involved
is a lyric of heroism, pathos, tragedy and the like. So now in the pre-literate world
we have a chorus and a dance and events of consequence are being played out, are being
depicted, are being performed before the community to teach and to remind and to allow those
witnessing the event to go home at the end of all this and recognize what kind of people
they are and what they stand for and what their obligations are. Now out of this background
something quite precious develops and that is where the chorus breaks up as it were and
there are actual participants whose activities now are commented on by or otherwise illuminated
by a group doing a gloss on this activity. The chorus is doing the gloss but the participants
themselves are engaged in one or another colloquy, engaged in some kind of drama, momentous drama
that is designed to teach a lesson or announce possibilities otherwise unforeseen or remind
people of events that must always be kept in mind if the polis is to be preserved, if
the tribe is to be kept intact and what we have of course is the foundation of drama
itself. The dramatic event now which is a characteristic also of pre-literate societies
there are dramatic productions that never get written down in a language but of course
in the classical world the dramas are going to be the most famous dramas are going to
be put together not only in a society that is literate but a society that has an exquisitely
precise and colorful and meaningful language to rely on. Out of the drama comes the dialogue
do you see that is out of it we now can find a much smaller ensemble of participants who
address frontally questions that the drama is otherwise about but that the drama itself
cannot resolve the drama presents possibilities and it's in a later development it's in a
later kind of philosophical or intellectual development that out of the possibilities
of the dramatic is carved a dialogue for the purpose of dispute and analysis and evaluation.
Well it might be said then that philosophy is the outcome of processes that begin in
a pre-literate world possessed of choreography and painting and certain natural movements
and natural language by way of which one can communicate feelings and the like that out
of this world of the dance and the painting this world of murals and body postures and signs
and symbols is added a chorus a lyric a story to be told an epic poem the benefit of minstrels
singing away memorably with tunes that you can remember all the way back to your tent
that out of this through the imagination the fertile genius of the literary mind whole
stories can be told in rich dramatic form that out of the possibilities of the drama comes the
rather different possibilities of a philosophical disquisition presented in the form of a dialogue
and so if I can go back to that metaphor of thesis that long golden cord which is at once
court of history is also a court of certain modes of recording where one has been and what all this
means and it is cord that I would say in Athens does culminate or at least reaches a first great
great plateau in the works of Plato in the dialogues of Plato but in the lecture today I want to
dilate on the dramatic form first because the dramatists not only predate socratic philosophy
predated just just a little bit and of course much of the dramatic riches of the period is
contemporary with the with the Socrates but because in the drama possibilities are considered
ideas are advanced in a in a vivid form I say things are not resolved quite the way they are
going to be in philosophy but a kind of philosophical challenges set forward in virtue of how the
lives are being lived within the drama and how these dramatic events are to be interpreted what
they mean what it is the dramatist is trying to convey the great great psychologists I mean we all
have good reason to read Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung and the like but I I think those who
have immersed themselves in in the classical drama and particularly Euripides and and Sophocles
will see a depth of psychological understanding that is unmatched certainly in the history of
in the modern history of psychiatry and medical psychology and the like so a few words then on
on how the human condition was understood by the dramatists and we can begin with the question
is is Medea a murderist is she a murderous now here's a figure the Medea is performed regularly
enough in the West End and on Broadway and in all many languages well of course she kills her sons
she's she's forlorn she's on a rage she's been abandoned by Jason Jason to improve his own situation
in the world has taken up with another woman he's taken up with the daughter of Crayon we're going
to meet Crayon again not not too long from now in today's lecture Crayon as he admonishes a very
different sort of woman Antigone but here's Medea who who has been the victim of an act of treason
against her own love she seeks a form of revenge proportioned to the offense
a form of revenge proportioned to the offense a punishment that will fit the crime even in this
rage even in what might be regarded as a kind of madness we see an attempt to find a proportionality
to find something fitting and meet even in the act in the act of what we would take to be a violent
and unequal in our natural crime there's going to be something that tries to match up with the depth
of feeling the depth of resentment that is experienced by this jilted jilted lover
now when Euripides gives us Medea and Jason he he already is casting himself as controversy
because he's not presenting heroic figures he's presenting figures that are all too human
figures that have very few by way of what we might call heroically redeeming qualities
oh yes Jason and the Argonauts are often doing all sorts of engage in all sorts of daunting tasks
to get the golden fleece and the like but you get the very definite sense that that search itself is
prompted by what might be called loath to use the term but what might be called middle class
values i mean they're off to you know to get the golden fleece this this isn't quite what the trojan
war is all about it's not quite what encounters with Apollo might might be about they're off to get
the golden fleece back he comes this is an opportunistic fellow he's moved around by his own passions
rather too easily and too readily he finds somebody less fetching than influential he takes up with
that person and meanwhile we have medea and what we know about medea is that is that her service
to jason was in the form of of sorcery she she's practiced the the the arts of magic and the like
there's something mysterious about her there's something at a kind of subterranean level she's
redolent she's redolent of a religion in the greek world that predates olympianism she's redolent of
the conic birth religions the religions grounded in in birth and renewal and agriculture and crops
and fertility the olympians replace the conic gods do you see in the conic religion conus is the earth
do you see in the in the conic religions pride of place goes to women because of their procreative
power their life-giving power life is identified centrally with woman and woman kind and there's
an interesting point in in greek literary and legendary history in which or estes after avenging
the murder of his father after after clitamnestra has killed agamemnon or estes kills his mother
and there's going to be a trial now and the jury is hung do you see the jury is hung they can't quite
choose between the crime of or estes killing his mother and the crime of clitamnestra in killing
agamemnon and the deciding vote is to be cast by whom well the deciding vote is going to be cast by
a woman and not just anyone the deciding vote is cast by athena and athena casts a vote in favor
of or estes because the crime of killing the man ranks higher in in negativity do you see than the
crime of killing the woman you begin to see the patriarchal perspective replacing that older
chthonic sort of matriarchal outlook i say medea is is redolent of of of a chthonic perspective
there's this element of the unknowable in her something is seaving when in within her when
medea is played right she is less aware of precisely what she's doing than actresses are
inclined to make her she should be more driven than driving there should be something of the earth
that impels her movements that will have her sacrifice her offspring to return them to the
earth so that this can be started all over again and worked out in a better way next time around
do you see uh she's not quite as chirpy i suspect in the ancient productions of medea as she turns
out to be in contemporary ones now your liberties tells us that this is how she is to be understood
i did scratch out just a couple of of lines uh where she where she is explaining herself as
she kisses the children she's about to kill it's it is one of the poignant moments in the history
of theater go she says leave me she wants them to disappear back into the fundament of things
do you see leave me i cannot bear to see you any longer that is your presence in my senses
are defiling but not because of anything you've done it's because of something i've done
i gave birth to you as a result of love for a traitor overcome by grief now i understand what
i am about to do she says passion that cause of our most dire woes has vanquished my rational power
played oh my just as well have been sitting in the audience taking notes do you see here we go again
passion does it all the movements are to be understood in that chronic sense of something
driving us we know not what we call it passion but what she's about to do has almost the character
of the involuntary the acusios in the ancient is she a murderous or are these motives irresistible
is she simply overcome by by grief as she says she has to put these children out of sight
so uripedes is giving us a character now more accessible than the olympian characters
he's giving us the the the jilted woman he's giving us the opportunistic and and aggressive
husband he's giving us the husband who is so concerned with his own profession too much time
at the office and so forth he this is a rather modern this is a rather modern saga so to speak
and many of his contemporary critics thought that for that very reason it was uninstructive
it wasn't doing what theater is supposed to do theater isn't supposed to depict the sorts of
entities we are it's to show us how our characters perhaps to the extent that they approximate
what is worthy lead to good ends whereas defective characters inevitably end up
end up on the short end of the stick but surely you don't want to do this through the types of
medea some weird sorcerers and jason who's floating around with the other organ arts in
search of something but uripedes knew what he was doing and uripedes knew in his day that this
tension now was a real one this tension between the ectonic and the olympian this tension between
the earthy requirements of life as it is actually lived and this sort of ideal perfected domain
that no longer really is a realistic a realistic possibility what we do find in uripedes and
we find in all of the greek dramatists is this notion this this belief i would call it a central
canon but at the end of the day character is everything its destiny that and this you get as
early as horror of course that that once you can peg the type of character smith or jones is
things really do fall into place no one is surprised when finally agamemnon gets up during that
brief period of raprochement with achilles and says oh look you know that day i didn't do it the
urenes take over you and the god there's something so true to character and agamemnon taking
that particular way out there's something so characteristic of helen and helen's character
you know helen helen of troi in iliad and odyssey on the few occasions when when we meet her never
utters a sentence in which she does not refer to herself every time she speaks there's a reference
to her this this subtle presentation of a character driven by vanity driven by a kind of
self-absorption is is something that homer would teach all of the greek dramatists to follow
now what else the dramatists are attempting to work out is this subtle balancing act
between the ageless customary practices of the greek speaking people
and what increasingly philosophical thought is producing as the laws of physics the laws of
science not not the way newtons going to do it but there's an ever greater awareness and an ever
more detailed knowledge of what might be called the efficient causal relationships in the natural
world so this relationship between custom and what is natural do our customs recover what is
really natural to us and then and then namos now namos not as the customary practices of the age
but as genuinely binding legal precepts namos as law how are we to understand the law is the law
something naturally right is it something imposed is it does it arise from our nature is it countered
to our nature and the dramatists play this out at the level of fiction but fiction that is often
more real than than reality itself now what we find in medea is someone behaving unnaturally
mothers do not kill their sons even when they are married to faithless husbands she's doing the most
unnatural of things a mother killing her own offspring nonetheless she's doing something
that is intelligible because she's driven by passion well if you are driven by passion
then is what you are doing the natural sort of thing to do when you are passionate when she says
herself that the direst consequences ensue when reason is trumped by passion is this a rational
reflection on her part isn't that precisely the point where she could stop herself no precisely
not to be driven by passion is to have passion rule reason even if as a kind of parallel development
you know sort of of you recognize that what you are doing is beyond reason nonetheless you are
beyond reason and and no private narrative to that effect stops the consequential action from
taking place so here we find in medea one of the famous women of the ancient greek world
and note how many of the central figures in the ancient greek world are women aphrodite and
athena and medea and antigony and the women of thieves the theban women it's very similar to what
we will find in shakespeare later on it's very difficult to find a bona fide hero in shakespeare
certainly anyone any hero of homeric proportions the heroic figures tend to be women in in in
shakespeare but the self-sacrificing committed stolid focused beings not with hamletian uh
whether to do it or not to do it a certain resolve even when that resolve leads to horrific
consequences there is at least a commitment to a plan of action that is then executed there's a
kind of decisiveness in shakespearian women and there is a kind of decisiveness in homeric women
and there's also a greatness in homeric women and a greatness in the women of the ancient greek
dramatists it's worth noting this because of the the position women actually occupied in the ancient
world and particularly the ancient athena world which is uh as a position of subservience and
reclusiveness and the like but uh this i think should be understood more in cultural terms than
in what might be called psychological terms it it it it it is more a recognition of the power of
eros the ancient understanding that that what it is that brings men and women together is not just
a creative force it's not just something that brings life about and renews life and repopulates
the world it is a power powerfully destructive force because what we will do in the name of eros
what we will do at the bidding of eros is what medea does we do that too do you see and i think
this recognition of the power of eros has more to do with the relative standing the actual
relative standing of women in the ancient greek world than some theory like Aristotle's according
to which women are sort of incomplete man kind of defective man not quite completely developed
closer to children than to adulthood that that that's sort of philosophers talk but i don't think
in that talk Aristotle is recovering the thought of his age and he's certainly not recovering the
thought of Sophocles and and euripides and and asculus well there's another woman uh that uh
warrants discussion and that woman is antigone as presented to us by Sophocles antigone finds
that her brother Polyneses has been killed his body is left out in the open for the dogs and
wolves to devour and the king king creon of Corinth has ordered that no one shall touch this body
let alone bury it creon you know the chap whose daughter jason takes up with keep that in mind
what do you say so there's creon don't touch the body antigone sits with her sister and says hey
we've got to do something about this that's polyneses out there he must be given a proper burial
sister says oh forget about it bad news from start to finish don't do it antigone says in
so many words not if the space program to pay i shall bury our brother and she does
and of course she is brought before the king and creon's questions they're taunting questions there's
a kind of peremptory insolence about them he says you know sort of um don't don't you know who i am
that kind of question do you know who i am see did did you not hear the order did didn't you get it
right you you know what's going did you not know what would happen to you if you did this
and the point he wants to make is that the will of the prince is the law of the land this is what
he's getting at he's getting at that old medieval chestnut the will of the prince is the law of the
land to say and we get this reflection by by antigone on on on the law on namos how this is to be
understood what she finds herself telling this king is that a sister that a sister shall bury the
body of her dead brother is written in a law more it's a universal precept it's it's not just
customary sometimes antigone's defenses in terms of antigone saying well we've always done it this
way no that's not what the greek says what the greek says is that what she is doing is universal
that she is impelled by something universal antigone is serving up by way of suffocles play
a version of what today might be called natural law theory that is that there is something in us
something at an intuitive but at reachable level that tells us the course of action that's right
for beings like ourselves when thomas equinus centuries later will say if our nature were different
our duties would be different he's recording the same insight that we find in in suffocles
antigone it is in my very nature do you see that i must do this she might just as well have said
to him and every ancient greek watching this play knows this is what she's saying she might just as
well have said to him if there would be kings we must have the capacity for the kind of allegiance
that i am now showing to my dead brother that is what impels me to do in his behalf what i'm doing
is exactly what you would have to rely on for there to be kings at all what she's doing is grounded
in a law older than kings now i find the the contrast or the comparison between medea and
antigone quite interesting antigone is of course a woman of passion there's no question about it
she loves deeply and reverentially she's a woman of fear she doesn't want to be locked up behind
stone by this by this malignant king in the eleventh hour however what she responds to
is the summons of her nature just as medea in the most forlorn of terms is lamenting the fact
that passion prevents her from matching up with the summons of her nature in the one case we have
euripides giving us a form of madness which is the madness that overtakes us when we surrender
reason to passion and in antigone suffocles is giving us a woman who recognizes who she is she
has answered the the she has answered the the command know thyself and she understands herself
to be constituted in such a way that what she does must be done it must be done whatever kings might
say ideally kings encourage us to do and command us to do what the best of our natures would have
us do in any case but when they don't trumping power is held by the light of conscience and not
by the holder of the scepter this is an extremely interesting comparison in in in figures who who
were readily accessible to to ancient um ancient audiences now in these plays what we find is the
part played by lusty ambition by greed and avarice by passion and envy murderous tendencies
jilted lovers aspirants to thrones and all that what is it that comes out of this well when when
Aristotle will get around to defining tragedy he will say that tragedy is when bad things happen
to good people Aristotle in that quintessentially aristotelian way rejecting the the proposition
that it's tragic when something bad happens to bad people it's it's entirely just when bad things
happen to bad people but there's something awful about bad things happening to good people and
of course the question that has to arise in in the ancient mind as it arises in the contemporary
mind is if there is a providential and all-seeing god who loves us how do we count account for the
presence of evil in the world why do infants die of brain cancer etc etc the ancient greek
dramatists are wrestling with just this question you can honor the gods you can perform the sacrifices
you can be reverential in your behavior you can shun hubris you can do everything right in every way
and if you do that and you do it all the time dreadful things may happen to you
and how are we to understand this well the philosophers will have to pick up the baton
and say all right these dramatically presented questions require very deep thought and a persistent
and disciplined mode of inquiry beyond the grasp of drama itself thank you
