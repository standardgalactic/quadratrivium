In this lecture, I plan to deal with three important developments during the period from
about 400 to 600 A.D. and this is often known as the period of the age of migrations.
And it refers to the fact that many dramatic tribes from Scandinavia and what is now West
Germany migrated into the former Roman Empire.
These would be notably Franks in what the Romans called Gaul and is destined to become
France, various people who move into the low countries, notably the Frisians, dramatic
tribes that come from Denmark and Northwest Germany that move into Britain and turn Britain
into England.
And that repeal of the Northwestern provinces of the Roman Empire had important demographic
changes in Scandinavia as well.
So this period is really in reference to a group of folk or ethnic migrations that essentially
spreads dramatic civilization deep into the former Roman Empire and has major consequences
for the Scandinavian heartland, those core areas where dramatic civilization had emerged.
So those migrations form the first part of this particular lecture.
Then what I would like to look at is the bonds that linked the Scandinavian homeland with
those dramatic societies now transplanted to the Roman world.
And those ties were very important because it not only formed part of a general dramatic
culture or coigne, if you want to use the Greek term, a common culture, but it also led
to the transmission of very important legendary material from the dramatic kinsmen of the Scandinavians
to Scandinavia.
These include the heroes of the Valsong saga, which is one way of documenting this contact.
And that led to the development of importance, dramatic poetry, epic poetry, and a whole
martial ethos, a set of common values that were shared by all the dramatic peoples and
became quintessentially Scandinavian in the Viking Age.
And then the third part of this lecture, I want to talk about how that common dramatic
culture that existed, say, around 600, 625 AD, began to part in different directions.
That is, the dramatic peoples of what are Gaul and Britain, the former Roman provinces,
evolve into English and Franks, the people in the Low Countries, predominantly the Frisians
and Holland, likewise evolve into a separate distinct dramatic people and how changes in
Scandinavia will remove the Scandinavians from those German kinsmen so that by 790 or
800 at the opening of the Viking Age, those dramatic peoples of Western Europe have evolved
into Christian Europeans, whereas the Scandinavians have evolved into a very distinct dramatic
pagan culture, and it explains a great deal of the animosity and differences between these
two groups at the opening of the Viking Age.
The Scandinavians came to regard these people as potential foes, victims for their raids.
There were no longer those close ties that you had seen, say, back in the 5th or 6th
century AD.
So there's three major issues, three very important issues, and it also opens up a discussion
of epic poetry and pagan beliefs and the heroic ethos, which is so important to the Scandinavian
people in the Viking Age because it's being clearly, if not necessarily foreign, but certainly
defined and shaped by the legends that emerged at this particular time.
Well, let's look first at some of the important ethnic changes in the political and linguistic
landscape of Northwestern Europe.
The Age of Migrations led to three major groups that removed themselves from that dramatic
heartland into the former Roman world.
The most important group that Americans wouldn't be familiar with are the Anglo-Saxons, which
is really a term that no one ever used in the Middle Ages.
The English themselves called themselves the English, or they might call themselves Saxons
if they came from Wessex, that is, they are related to the people of Northwestern Germany.
There were also people known as Utes, but the dramatic migrations between approximately
450 and maybe about 650 AD or 600 AD came from various parts of Scandinavia.
We know the southwestern areas of Norway.
There were people who migrated from the famous fjords of Rogaland and Hordaland.
These were later dens of Vikings.
They settled in Northern England, particularly in the region known as Bernicea, which is the
northern half of the later Kingdom of Northumbria.
Numerous tribes moved out of Jutland.
There is archaeological evidence to document that there was a significant drop of population
in Denmark.
Majormatic peoples removed themselves to England.
These include Engels, Utes, but other lesser tribes whose names are unknown to us.
So that Scandinavia had a constant outpouring of people from Jutland, southwestern Norway,
into England, but also along the northern shores of France, Gaul, the future areas of
say Normandy, where large numbers of Saxons settled and classical authors, notably Procopius,
who wrote the rather strange history of the Emperor Justinian, a classic history of writing
about great achievements and not crediting the man who performed them, talks of these
migrations.
He's very, very familiar with Northern Europe and the relationships among these dramatic
peoples.
That led to the creation of a dramatic speaking civilization in England, the various Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms.
In this period of the age of migration, those people were very conscious of their Scandinavian
origins.
Foremost, expressed in the epic of Beowulf, well known to students of English literature,
this epic is composed somewhere between maybe 675 and 700 AD, perhaps in the Midlands of
England, Mercia, the central kingdom, or perhaps in Northumbria, by a cleric, a man of noble
class, in Anglo-Saxon, that is dramatic, a literative verse, and yet this epic talks
not about English heroes, but about Beowulf, who is a Giet, Gietas is the plural, or Gotor,
or Gautar, that is Goths of southern Scandinavia, probably dwelling along the western shores
of Sweden today, pretty close to Lake's Vatern and Vanar, that is there in the southwest
of Sweden, and areas that were actually historically linked to Norway in the Viking Age.
That epic was brought by English settlers from Scandinavia who remembered these figures
and give us a great deal of detail about rulers of largely the 6th century AD and what became
parts of Norway and the Danish kingdom.
There are also references to the kings of Sweden at Uppsala, and these connections
were also borne out by archaeology, particularly the so-called Suttonhu treasure, that is the
objects found in the great ship burial, dated about 625 AD, it's an empty tomb, it's thought
to be a tomb of a king of East Anglia, which is Suffolk and Norfolk of southeastern England,
and it's a pagan burial tradition to a king who may have been nominally Christian, so
it's technically a cenotaph, and the helmet that comes out there of the excavation, there's
marvelous objects from all over the Mediterranean world, including some coins from Merovingian
Gaul, objects from the Byzantine world, but other objects show very, very close connections
to contemporary burials in Sweden, particularly burials at Vendel, where similar types of
helmets, particularly figures sporting boar helmets, the boar was the sacred animal of
the Vanar, that is the brother, sister Freya and Freya, who were important divinities in
the dramatic tradition.
So the ties are very close between these English people and the Scandinavians, likewise the
ties are very close to those dramatic peoples who moved into Gaul, primarily the Franks,
and the Frankish kings under Clovis, who converted to Christianity sometime around 490 AD, and
his conversion is very indicative of conversions of many dramatic peoples, and we'll re-encounter
this with the Scandinavian kings, essentially he prayed to the Christian god who gave him
victory in battle, he remembered that one of his wives was Christian and he tried Christ
and it worked, and Christ as the lord of hosts was understandable, Clovis immediately became
baptized, now that didn't mean conversion led to a Christian life, the Frankish kings
were very, very similar in their habits to their contemporaries in Scandinavia, and one
could read the pages of Gregory of Tours, who's a Christian author, who's of Gaela
Roman descent, and he writes in Latin about these Frankish kings, and if you read the
lives of these Frankish kings, the lurid politics, the murders, the assassinations, they sound
remarkably similar to what's going on in the great Scandinavian halls, as described in
Beowulf or the Valsong saga, which is the saga that talks about the early great heroes,
or the saga of Rolf Krocke, so that the great halls of the Frankish kings in Gaul were not
too different from the great halls in Denmark and in Sweden, described by the legends written
down in Iceland centuries later. Furthermore, the Franks were the most successful people
in western Europe, the Frankish kings went on to forge a very, very effective kingdom,
and gave some kind of political unity to the form in western empire, and whatever the trade
connections had been between Scandinavia and Rome, they had been disrupted in the fifth
century, and economic conditions had changed with this large migration of people out of
the Scandinavian area, but certainly by 500 AD trade connections renewed, and in many ways
the Danes particularly were Frankish wannabes, and most Danish monarchs from what we can tell
from the burial goods, or Swedish monarchs, especially from Vendel, would very much have
liked to have had the material culture of their Frankish contemporaries, and there's a lot of
archaeological evidence that suggests that swords were imported from the Frankish world,
they had the best manufacture in the Rhineland, this goes on through the Viking age, many of the
jewelry objects are similar, which you would find in a Frankish burial is also common in Scandinavian
burials, so that the ties between the Franks and the Scandinavian world were very close, and Frankish
kings, while they were nominally Christian, were not very good Christians, Frankish kings
kept multiple wives, the Christian authors usually called them concubines, but they were just
multiple wives as most dramatic kings married a number of wives for political purposes, and it
wasn't really until after about 625, when the Frankish kings began to become really Christian
kings, and that was owed to the fact that Irish monks showed up and started to explain to them
what their Christianity meant. The third important people who moved into western Europe and are
extremely important throughout this period of the age of migrations in the early Viking age are
the Frisians, the Frisians spoke a dramatic language which to this day is the closest related
language to English, they had dwelled along the islands on the shores of Holland and Germany,
they moved into sections of the low country, they dwelled along among the rivers of the lower Rhine,
and they were the people who developed the trade networks between western Europe and Scandinavia,
they are the premier merchants, usually operating under the protection of the Frankish kings,
they remain pagan for a very long time, they are not really converted until the 7th and 8th
centuries, their primary market town will be Duristad, which emerges around 675, and that
will be the nexus of the trade routes going into Jutland, into southern Sweden, and those trade
routes are actually the routes that the Vikings followed in reverse, and there is a reference
in Beowulf to the Gotar or the Gautar, that is the Gothic king, the Gyatos in Beowulf, a Heijlich of,
as raiding Frisia, Holland, about 523 AD, it's a reference in the poem which is also picked up
in the Chronicles, and he's killed in a Viking style raid, it almost looks like a preview of the
Viking Age, so those three groups are all important in establishing new kingdoms and eventually new
societies in western Europe, there were also distant relatives of the Scandinavians, well
geographically distant but linguistically very close, Goths, people who had migrated from Sweden,
I mentioned last time, and they ended up in the Mediterranean world in Spain and Italy,
and up until that departure into the Mediterranean world in the 5th century,
most of eastern Europe was under some sort of nominal Gothic control or later under the kings
of the Huns, particularly Attila of the Hun, and the Huns very much depended on their Gothic
subjects, and so Scandinavia was tied to eastern Europe through various trade routes, across the
great rivers of central and eastern Europe, the old amber trade routes, and the Gothic language
is very very close to the Scandinavian languages in some ways, and at the same time there's contacts
in terms of common jewelry and memories, the Goths remembered they had come from Sweden,
again our classical sources tell us that, well some moved into the Mediterranean world, some of
those Goths went back to the Scandinavian homeland, and that's borne out again by the archaeology
where large numbers of Roman gold coins of the, largely of the 5th century, some from the early
6th century show up in Sweden, particularly at Gotland, and in the areas around Stockholm today,
that is the Lake Malloran area, and the best guess is they're being carried back to the old Gothic
homeland by those Goths who remember those origins and trek back to Scandinavia some 200 years after
their ancestors had departed, and so you could see that Scandinavia was really part of a very very
wide dramatic world where these migrations had led to the settling of dramatic peoples across
large portions of the Roman world. Well, that is most dramatically documented in the literary
traditions, and these literary traditions, traditions to which I will return, survive in
Scandinavia largely from manuscripts composed in Iceland, these are prose sagas which are based
on earlier poetry, and the poetry is a German alliterative verse, a type of verse in which
the crucial elements in each line of poetry were the stressed syllables, and dramatic poetry is
based on what is known as a qualitative rather than a quantitative verse form. A classical
verse which goes back to Greek models is essentially a mathematical equation, so many longs and so
many shorts have to equal out, whereas in dramatic verse which is close to the cadence of the spoken
language, the key is not so much the number of syllables in a verse, but the number of stressed
syllables, and particularly those syllables that are stressed, should alliterate so that you combine
these two half lines and different patterns by the alliteration on the crucial words, and that's
the type of verse that's used in the Epic of Beowulf, and the type of verse that is innovated
in the Viking Age in Norse and is represented on the Icelandic manuscripts. This type of composition
is for oral recitation, that is poets did not use writing, the runic inscriptions which we'll
talk about in an upcoming lecture, were really used for communication with the gods, not for
composing poetry, so it's recitation of the great heroes and the gods that counted not composing
literary epics that people actually read, and that is very very indicative of that common
dramatic heroic culture that existed in all these areas, and that is the rulers maintained great
halls which also functioned in some ways as the ceremonial and religious centers of the community,
and you can imagine you spend a great deal of time indoors anyway during the winter, so the halls
of a great prince would obviously be the center of social activities, and this is captured in the
poems and in Beowulf as well, and the poets would recite stories for entertainment, and most of
these poems probably ran somewhere between the order of say 300 and 500 lines of verse, and they
were based on traditional heroes who are well known to the audience, and the poet really did exploit
anticipation over surprise as a dramatic technique. Well what's really significant in this period
of migrations is that the Scandinavians being part of this wider dramatic culture shared in the
same oral poetry, and what is a remarkable point about a heroic poetry in Scandinavia is the first
heroes who are based on historical figures celebrated by Scandinavians were not Scandinavians,
rather they were dramatic heroes of those various peoples to whom they were related who had moved
into the Roman world. These included heroes from a Gothic tradition from the early fourth century,
it also included Franks and Burgundians that is people who removed themselves to Gaul, and above
all it included Attila the Hun known as Attli in Norse, who was regarded as just well another
dramatic ruler. They really didn't make much of a distinction between the Huns and the Germans,
he was just a great figure. The legends know nothing of the Roman world, they don't tell us
anything about the economic and social breakup of the Roman Empire, rather they focused on great
deeds and figures and heroes who got linked to the ancient gods, legendary and mythological
traditions, and so what developed was a cycle of three poems, they're not really a single poem,
but they're a cycle of episodes and tales in which any poet could recite episodes in a particular
hall in a particular night, and the whole story was pretty much well known by the audience.
The most famous, the central story, concerned these Burgundian heroes particularly the king Gunnar
and his half-brother Hogni and their sister Gudrum, they were historical figures of the
Burgundian kingdom who were destroyed by the Huns in 437 AD, a Hun army showed up and wiped them
out on Roman orders. In Norse and dramatic legend these people lived on as a heroic group of kings
on the Rhineland, they became associated with the treasure of the Nifflungs or the Nibelungs in
the German tradition, this cursed treasure and they were lured to the great hall of Attila the Hun,
Atle, in the Norse tradition, where they were killed in a great heroic battle at the hall
and avenged by their sister Gudrum, who had reluctantly been married off to Atle,
she kills Atle, burns the hall down in retribution for the death of her brothers.
Well that cycle, which was an independent cycle, was also linked to another cycle of
Frankish heroes, these included the famous Brinehilde or Brunhilde, she's known in the
Wagnerian opera and Sigurd or Sigfried as he's known in Wagner as well, that's the
West dramatic version and these, this pair were apparently a group of Frankish rulers from the
late 6th, early 7th century with some really wild and woolly stories told about them in Gregory of
Tours and they captured the imagination because of all their deeds and misdeeds and in the
Norse tradition, Sigurd won Brunhilde after he had slain the dragon Fafner and this is depicted
on a famous runestone in Sweden, he was one of the favorite of Odin, the war god, he slew the
dragon by artifice, seized the golden horde, the dragon had brooded over, this was a horde that
had been cursed because of Loki who had killed the brother of the dragon known as Otto and Otter
and then Sigurd took the horde, got a famous horse grom and a sword from Odin, rode off,
won Brinehilde as his bride, she was a valkyrie who was asleep because she had offended Odin,
she awakens, teaches Sigurd all the secrets of the runes and then in the original tradition
they got married and lived as berserker and valkyrie as heroes of Odin, the Scandinavians took
those two traditions apparently and put them together and in the Scandinavian tradition
what happened is Sigurd doesn't marry Brinehilde but goes off and ends up marrying Gudrum,
the sister of Gunnar in the Burgundian tradition and that changes the entire action of the story
and it's very very Norse because the primary figures become the two queens, Brinehilde had been
promised to Sigurd but she ends up marrying the brother-in-law the lesser Gunnar and this results
in a tension between the two queens and Brinehilde eventually arranges for the death of Sigurd
claiming I will not suffer two men in one hall, she had been first taken by Sigurd who then went off
and was magically induced to marry Gudrum and when Brinehilde understands that she had married a
lesser man that she eggs on her relatives that is the younger son of a brother of Gunnar to
slay Sigurd treacherously and then the whole story ends up with the destruction at the hall of
Atlee, Brinehilde dies she joins Sigurd on his funeral pyre and in death they're united in the
way they were not in life and they then go off to Valhalla, Gudrum ends up avenging her brothers
at the hall of Atlee but that's a whole story that has to be reworked she has a you know a spell
is cast over and she forgets the fact that her husband had been done in by her brothers
that tradition which becomes the basis of the Valsong cycle is transmitted from the
West Germanic peoples to the Scandinavians and the Scandinavians take these here is particularly
Sigurd who slew the dragon who won the famous valkyrie and was done in by treachery because
he married the wrong woman the powerful Brinehilde who's a valkyrie of Odin Gunnar who while he
treacherously slays has his brother-in-law Sigurd slain dies heroically fighting against Atlee
is thrown into a snake pit where he he he plucks the strings with his toes until he gets all the
snakes asleep but one of them comes and gets him but he dies heroically all of this material
becomes the grist for the mill of turning out new legends about Scandinavian heroes
in the generations later in the sixth and seventh century and these West Germanic heroes become
quite essentially Scandinavian heroes the name Sigurd Gudrum Gunnar keep reappearing in the
Scandinavian nomenclature they embrace these West Germanic heroes as their own however by 625
their kinsmen the people who gave rise to these legends are forgetting these heroes they have
converted to Christianity they're coming under the influence of the Latin literary culture
and between 650 and 700 AD new Christian cultures emerge in England in the Frankish world and
eventually in Frisia and that leads to a parting of the ways between the Scandinavian heartland of
dramatic civilization and these new states that have emerged on the form in Roman Empire
and you can trace the fact that starting around 625 650 AD there aren't any more heroes coming out
of the West Germanic peoples the heroes being celebrated are now Scandinavian heroes based
on the figures of the Volsung saga there's also another important linguistic change that occurs
at the same time and that is starting around 700 or a little earlier the Scandinavian language
goes through a major morphological change and you have to keep in mind that these are not written
languages in a modern sense that is there's not a standard literary form these are various dialects
of Norse various dialects of English Frankish Frisian now the West Germanic peoples are beginning
to write their languages down in literary form Beowulf for instance is the first major literary
monument we have in English and it leads to a development of a literary language in English
the Scandinavians on the other hand because of the use of language you speak it it changes
it gets mutilated in common speech we are all familiar with the spoken vernacular as opposed
to the written well that gives rise to a series of changes in which the Scandinavian languages
are transformed into quite a different set of dialects so that they're mutually unintelligible
to the West Germanic peoples by say 800 AD that is in 450 AD someone from Denmark could probably
talk to someone in England by 800 AD that's no longer possible there's several fancy linguistic
reasons for it the general term is known as syncope there's a general shortening of words in
Scandinavian you can find this very easily illustrated when you look at the names of heroes
in Beowulf and you look at their Scandinavian equivalents very often the Scandinavian name is
two or three syllables the old English name is three or four syllables Rothagar the host of
Beowulf becomes a ra ra just two syllables in old Norse and there are also changes in verb forms
the dropping of certain continental forms the result is the languages really go into very
different directions and they're at the point where you could recognize that Norse is related to
English or Frisian or Germanic Frankish but understanding a complicated sentence is very
difficult when you're dealing with any kind of sophisticated ideas it can be illustrated by two
very short examples one is a runic inscription one of the rare ones we have from this period dating
around 400 AD on one of the great horns from Gellhus in Denmark these gold horns actually only known
through reproductions they were destroyed in 1802 there's a very early runic inscription
which is in a west dramatic dialect probably close to English which when translated reads
I Helvester of Holt made this horn it runs 13 syllables rendered in Norse of about 800 AD and
later it's a less there are hilton horn tatha it's reduced to eight this can also see be seen in
the way the languages diverge the Scandinavian languages drop final consonants so the German
word farrin to carry or bear uh becomes simply farra many words in Norse and in vowels which makes
the language ideally suited for poetry the shortening of many of the Norse words also make
the Norse language very well suited for poetry there are enormous changes in vowel sounds especially
when you take the basic root word and you in effect turn it into what are known as the oblique
cases that is you turn it into an accusative a genitive or a possessive those familiar with
latin know that what you're in effect doing are conjugating nouns the way when would conjugate
verbs and again a very simple illustration will show the difference uh skeoldar is shield in old
Norse shield is shield in English old English pretty close you can recognize them skeoldar
shield but when you start putting it in the oblique cases when you want to use it as a
as a object or as a possessive you see that the English stays pretty much the same shield shield
shieldus of a shield shielda shieldas plural shieldas as an objective plural shielda as a
genitive plural shieldum for uh you use with prepositions but in Norse there's all sorts of
internal vowel changes that occur in that basic conjugation so it goes skeold skeold
uh skeldar skeldir skeldir skeldu skeldar skeldum that is there's so many vowel changes that if
you encounter that basic root word in a sentence you're not going to know what it is so in a
complicated sentence a Norse and and English they might recognize the basic word but any
kind of sophisticated communication is not possible and that change in the Norse language
is indicative of a whole bunch of other cultural changes that is redefining the language in a
along new ways and is one of the best baselines we have for the emergence of a Scandinavian
identity by 800 AD and that is the Scandinavian identity of the Viking Age
