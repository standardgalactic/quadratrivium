In this lecture, I plan to look at the developments in Scandinavian shipbuilding from really prehistoric
times up through the end of the Viking Age. This is really a central lecture in understanding
the Viking Age because without certain breakthroughs in shipbuilding that were achieved at the
very end of the 8th century AD and then innovations that occurred in the 10th century, really
the Viking Age would be impossible. I've alluded to the fact that for all of the cultural
continuity between the age of migrations and the Viking Age, the real difference was
the fact that the kings and yarls, that would be nobles or earls in English, gained ships
that gave them a military advantage for over 300 years. And between about 790 and 1100,
the Scandinavians will dominate the northern waters of Europe, and that not only includes
the seas and oceans, the Atlantic Ocean, but also the river systems of western Europe and
of Russia, because they constructed really spectacular ships, warships popularly known
as the longship, although many scholars would reserve the term longship for warships later
in the Viking Age from the late 10th century, and also cargo vessels, the canard, these
are ocean-going cargo vessels that could carry settlers to Iceland or the British Isles,
and then a whole variety of other ships that we have, including ferries, coastal vessels,
fishing ships and the like. So the development in Scandinavian shipbuilding
is all important, and I like to look at essentially three issues in this lecture. The first is
going to be the evolution of shipbuilding, why the Scandinavians achieved these breakthroughs,
and once again we'll see that there are influences from other shipbuilding traditions, notably
the Celts of western Europe as well as the Romans, but again the Scandinavians applied
their own genius to create ships that no one else would have built. I'd then like to go
into a bit about the actual construction of ships in the Viking Age, and there are significant
points about that because it had major economic and social consequences for Scandinavian communities,
and I should stress that the act of building ships, which was an important capital investment
in any Norse community, and the sailing of these ships was a common experience as important
as the ancient traumatic gods they worship, the common Norse language, the poetry, the
legends, the culture of the sea and of going out and either raiding or trading by sea was
one of the quintessential elements of Scandinavian civilization.
And finally, I'd like to close with a brief example of what this meant in terms of military
advantages, and we'll use an example coming from the early Viking Age, one of the great
raids on France as an example of the performance of these Viking warships. So with that in
mind, let's take a look at the evolution. The Viking Age ships, the long ships, warships
and cargo ships represent a climax to a very long evolution in shipbuilding. This certainly
goes back to the prehistoric age, there are a number of remarkable rock carvings, essentially
carvings or painted carvings, sometimes they're just painted, sometimes they're carved with
painted highlights. Going back to the prehistoric age, the Neolithic age, between 4000 and 2300
BC and then there's others coming from the Bronze Age, they show that the Scandinavians,
the ancestors of the Scandinavians, the first people in that area were familiar with constructing
ships. These are extremely schematic and it's difficult to know the precise construction
without an archaeological find. Nonetheless, they're familiar with building ships that
could at least negotiate the coasts. They seem to have been propelled by paddles rather
than by actual oars, there are no sails, but from the very start, the only way people
in goods could have been moved around the core areas of Scandinavia was some type of
vessel that could negotiate. The rather treacherous seas, such as the Sund, that is the narrow
strait of water that separates Zeeland or Zeeland from southern Sweden, you have to
have a fairly sophisticated ship in order to do that. Now, the first major ship that
we know of comes from about 300 to 200 BC and as becomes evident in this lecture, most of
our information is based on ships that we've recovered in archaeological excavation. These
are usually burials, that is ships that have been put in the ground as a funerary monument.
It's often been modified in order to carry out the burial, often sails have been removed,
large numbers of goods are in there. They are either to honor the dead or they might
be a votive gift, they might have been given to the gods in recognition for some favor,
but nonetheless, these are not working vessels necessarily. They are ships that have been,
in some cases, constructed specifically either for funeral purposes or have been modified
for that. The great exception is the wonderful find of ships made which were sunk in the
channel of the Roskilde fjord probably in the early 11th century and there we actually
have working Viking ships, which we'll get to in this lecture.
In any case, our earliest one is a ship known as the Hjortsprings ship that comes from Aals,
an island of Denmark and it's been uncovered in excavation and it shows some very important
features already. As I mentioned, it's propelled by paddles, it certainly confirms what we
suspected from the rock carvings. It's a fairly lengthy vessel, it's about 40 feet
in length, would have had 20 men on the side propelling it and there are some important
provisions on it. One is there's no evidence there was a sail and it's doubtful it ever
had a sail. It seems to be largely a vessel for moving people along coastal waters into
the estuaries of rivers. It's not quite like a flat boat or ferry but it's something more
or less in that class. It's certainly not a ship that could go out and handle the North
Sea and certainly not the Atlantic. It does not have a keel but it does show certain
important innovations and part of that is the adaptation of Celtic building styles of
ships that we know from Roman descriptions, primarily Julius Caesar, as well as the long
Celtic tradition of building skin boats that is essentially putting down a skeleton construction
of ribs and then covering it with skins and caulking the skins. These are known as curogs,
they're used in the British Isles particularly but also on the shores of Northern France
and those skin boats are really quite impressive. Some of them can retain sizes as much as 40
or 50 feet. They are without keels and riding those things is like bouncing around on the
waters but nonetheless they're really quite durable for doing shipping in rather quiet
enclosed waters such as say the Baltic Sea or in the case of the British Isles the Irish
Sea. This undecked early ship of about 40 to 50 feet in length was also tied together
with planks and so it shows a mixture of building styles. Part of it is the so-called overlapping
clinker or skeleton style and that is a method that's pioneered Northern Europe. The other
method of ship building is often called shell construction and that is building your ship
so that the wood fits together airtight and it's essentially the equivalent of building
a fine piece of furniture and Viking vessels actually show a combination of these building
techniques. The shell construction is usually associated with the Mediterranean, the skeleton
construction with the Celtic Northwest. Both of these constructions will be represented
in Viking ships and are indicative of the type of influences getting up to Scandinavia.
Remarkably the Scandinavians start building their first successful warships and cargo
ships probably due to the influence of Roman ship designs and again it's often thought
in the popular imagination what do the Romans know about ships. The Roman attitude to the
Mediterranean world was to conquer it over land, corner it and call it RC but the Romans
in the high empire in a sense inherited this whole Celtic ship building tradition and the
Romans had real reason to tap into the trade routes into Northern Europe and so in the
first, second, third century AD large numbers of commercial vessels arrived from the Roman
world sailed by largely provincials who were mostly Celtic origins, some of Germanic origin
and so the Scandinavians had a chance to see these ships. One of the most important innovations
was a sail and it is still a highly debatable point among scholars when did sails get put
on Scandinavian ships. Some regard the addition of the sail as extremely late just on the
eve of the Viking age somewhere between maybe 750 and 790 at most a generation before the
first race. Others would argue that the sail is already being used in the third and fourth
century based on comments by Roman authors and also based on the two primary ships we
have that we can examine which are clearly the ancestors of Viking ships. One of those
I referred to earlier and that is the Nidem ship again a burial ship coming from Denmark
tentatively dated to around 350 or 400 AD. It's quite a large vessel, it's almost 80
feet in length and it again is debated whether there was a sail in it, it was a burial ship
and therefore if it did have a sail, a mast and something to hold it in place it may have
been removed because the grave goods are found in the middle of the ship. The Nidem ship shows
a combination of building styles, it shows very much the clinker style of construction,
the Scandinavians have now perfected building larger warships, it's still debated whether
it was decked or not but it is propelled by oars not by paddles and based on several reconstructions
this ship certainly could negotiate coastal waters of the North Sea very easily and could
move a lot of people and goods around. The Sutton Ho ship to which I referred that ship
in Anglo-Saxon England about 625 AD is not so useful and the ship itself doesn't survive,
that's really an impression in the clay and we have a couple of similar such burials from
Norway, one is the Klavsund ship which is about 700 and again it's also difficult to
make sense out of it because we really don't have that much of the timbered construction.
But all three of these vessels starting with the Nidem ship and ending with this Norwegian
ship about 700 show improved construction of the vessels especially the side streaks
which are the levels of planking that one constructs and by the time of 700 somewhere
in the early 8th century the Scandinavians figure out how to put down a keel and somewhere
in the 8th century keels that is a backbone to a ship becomes a major feature in Scandinavian
ship construction and that is the first important breakthrough putting in a keel. That keel allows
the Scandinavians to begin to construct ships that could really negotiate the sea and the
open waters and once you have a keel you can set in a foundation on that keel, a keelsund
as is often called this huge base where you can attach a large mast which will give you
an enormous area for sale and that will give you a propulsion especially out at sea that
previous vessels could not have and these breakthroughs are made sometime in the 8th
century sometime between 700 and 800 and allow the Scandinavians to build the classic long
ships and cargo vessels of the Viking age. Again much of this information about these
vessels comes from archaeological excavation and there are several excavations that are
absolutely important in telling us how these ships were constructed. Two of them are Norwegian
burials to which I've referred earlier. One is the Osberg ship. That burial is dated to
about 834 based on dendrochronology. The vessel itself is probably the equivalent of a royal
yacht rather than an actual working warship and it shows all of the classic features of a Viking
age ship. It has a keel, it has a sail set back about a third back from the bow of the ship. It
also shows a very very sophisticated construction in which you're building up by levels of streaks
on that keel which is the backbone and then you put in the ribbing afterwards. The other
important vessel is the Goxtod ship which is dated to about 900. It's again a burial ship.
It's very closely found in the same area of Vestfold. That is a warship and is probably
pretty close to the class of warships used in the 9th and 10th century on the 1st raids.
The Goxtod ship for the longest time and this was a ship that was excavated nearly at the
end of the 19th century was one of our major sources of information and the ship itself is
something like 75 feet long and certainly had a keel and keelsome capable of carrying a huge
mass close to 45 feet in height and there's various reconstructions of the sail and depending on
you know how much height you suspect the ship carried it could be anywhere from 750 to 825
square feet of sail that would give you an enormous amount of propulsion. It is absolutely a
brilliant piece of work in combining strength and flexibility because in all of these Viking
Age ships they are built to essentially ride the waters rather than to fight the waves. If they
tried to build ships that were more in the Mediterranean or Roman tradition those ships
probably would have just broken up in the water. They would have been too brittle but Viking Age
ships essentially are able to ride the waves. There's also a third set of ships that we've
excavated and this was state-of-the-art excavation starting in 1962 and are now on display in the
Roskilde ship museum and those were really six vessels there's really essentially five they
brought up two of them were warships that they're making a composite out of but these were ships
that were sunk probably to block the bay may have been done in the 11th century by Sven Estresen
it's anyone's guess to block the bay so warships couldn't come in and attack the Danish capital
of Roskilde and they think it's perhaps directed against someone like Harald Hoddery or or Magnus
the king of Norway who were talking attacking Denmark at this point so these were working vessels
that were sunk to block up a channel they were able to pump the water out state-of-the-art
archaeology and anyone in Denmark must make a pilgrimage to that ship museum and see it in any
event the ships that have been recovered there are usually known as the Skaldelev ships Skaldelev is
the little town near where the ships were found and they include two important warships which are
clearly long ships in the classic sense perhaps built somewhere between 975 and 1000 an important
vessel a canar our first really good ocean-going vessel the type of vessel used to settle Iceland
and then there are some smaller vessels including a coastal vessel a ship that might have been a
fishing ship all of these ships together show us the essentially the culmination of Scandinavian
shipbuilding the warship is about 92 feet in length a breath of a 14 to 15 feet it is the type
of ship that would have been used by King Canute's armies to invade England there's a somewhat
smaller warship that is a class just below it but quite impressive as well the canar is a ship
that could carry somewhere between 30 and 40 tons worth of cargo and it also confirms what we're
told in the Icelandic sagas of the type of cargo ships that were regularly used in trade between
Norway and Iceland and it's very very reassuring to have an actual such vessel in the archaeological
record all of the ships were clearly working ships that can be demonstrated in part by the fact
that they were repaired particularly on the bottoms quite frequently because Viking ships were
beached so by 790 the Scandinavians have created a remarkable set of war and cargo vessels that
no one else has and these ships could be constructed rather readily from the materials at
hand and did not require the same kind of specialized labor and facilities as say
Mediterranean shipbuilding and this is an extremely important point to stress we can easily follow
in the archaeological record the increasing experimentation and sophistication and one
shudders to think how some of these were actually discovered you wonder how maybe a Norwegian
town launched a vessel with one you know one type of early keel and they never came back and then
they eventually concluded well that didn't work and then let's try something else this is all done
by trial and error there are no written manuals and the shipwrights who constructed these vessels
worked largely from memory and experience and would adjust and modify based on the building
materials they had at the time and so there are undoubtedly variations in in say caulking
material the distance the proportion of length to breath of a ship all of that could be handled
based on the wood on the materials you had whether you had a long ship or can are these
things could be built very very quickly and easily in a Norse community you can build them
close to the shore most of them were probably constructed underneath very simple temporary
structures to protect them since Viking ships rode so low in the water there is very very low
draft to them they could be beached anywhere and that's one of the great tactical advantages
both for Viking cargo vessels and warships you don't need deep water ports these Viking ships
can go up rivers very very far they are very easy to pick up from rivers and carry from river to
river that is to make a portage to go from one river system to another you see this frequently
done in France it's done in England and particularly in Russia where in effect you can move from
one river system to another overland rather easily and then go in a totally different direction
that's actually how the Vikings end up on the Volga and then the Caspian Sea the other important
feature about these ships is that they were built from the existing hardwoods in Scandinavia
particularly oak that's one reason why Denmark was so important in the Viking age Denmark had some
of the prime oak forests and and the oak was ideal for mast keels ribs and planks in order to
construct the ship though what the Norse had learned to do as a result of trial and error going
back into that early you know all the way back certainly to that Nidom ship once you had a keel
as the basis of your ship to give it the strength to handle ocean conditions it also was the basis
of constructing the first thing you laid down was a keel you found an ideal oak tree of the right
length could be 90 feet 60 feet whatever and you cut that tree down and that basic trunk became
your keel and then the large branches were often used as the ribs and the cross sections and very
often the lumber they they used the grain and the natural curvature of the lond lumber to
build various sections of the ship they were very very cleverly adapting the materials to the
construction of the ship they also built these ships from rather green and unseasoned timber and
that was again to retain the flexibility so that Viking vessels almost bent with the waves and
there's reports of this by several reconstructions that have been done the earliest and most famous is
the one done by the Norwegians in 1893 where a replica of the Goxtod ship was constructed and
sailed from Bergen to Newfoundland I think it was about 28 days to do it and the reports very
much were the ship you know rode the waves and there there was a certain amount of bending of the
ship with the waves are very very flexible so the oak your first thing you do is you put down your
keel and then you start building up your strikes that is your levels of planking and once you get
those attached to your keel you put in the various ribbing and cross beams to reinforce it and this
is a very very clever there's a combination of both shell and clinker construction to build this
ship you caulk it as you go along the way the boards are nailed into place and with washers you
know iron nails and then you bend them over with a washer there is a minimum amount of metal used
in this construction and furthermore the ships are remarkably thin in their construction that these
are not as heavy and ponderous as you think for instance the the bottom planking of a Viking
vessel is essentially one inch thick you start with a three inch oak board and then you plane it
down to essentially one inch that's that's just one inch separating you from the Atlantic ocean
is rather terrifying thought and they're they're fitted into place we believe that the decks were
always movable because there's always a danger of water seeping in and you have to bail and so once
you've got your strikes built up you then put in your keel some that is this this construction to
hold the mast and the mast comes in and the mast would be another oak tree of appropriate length
which has been chopped down and put in place you can use a birch and pine for a lot of the lesser
construction and finally you cut these slots for the oars you put in the oars the oars should be
prime oak if you can get it and presto you've got a Viking ship now the amount of technical skill is
extremely high that is these shipwrights directing it really have to understand proportions which
they've all learned through experimentation but a lot of the work can be done very very quickly by
people who are skilled in wood building that is planing the boards following the grain of the
wood and adapting the material that you need the result is a ship of remarkable flexibility and
speed whether it be a cargo or a warship and it is a considerable amount of effort to build one
of these ships to put together a vessel of the gox dodd class which was you know a Viking say
warship about 75 to 80 feet in length you need a oak tree just to do the keel and then you need
another oak tree for the mass and you need somewhere between 12 and 13 fully fledged oak trees just
get your basic wood so the construction of these ships involved a great deal of labor and cutting
down and preparing the wood but again you're dealing with the population that is skilled in
woodwork that is the main construction they do and most Scandinavian communities can do this they
also have now the superior iron tools and nails and clamps necessary to do the construction so you
had to have a lot of developments before you got one of these Scandinavian ships now these vessels
are built for speed and efficiency of moving people in goods they are definitely not built for
comfort and sailing one of these vessels across the North Atlantic is a daunting task in and of
itself you essentially lived on a salted and boiled foods you drank a horrible curled milk or or to
pass the time away a low low grade need or beer probably the past the time you didn't build fires
you were open to the elements you could build a temporary structure perhaps that there's references
to that in Icelandic cargo vessels but you may show to bring a lot of skins and woolen's along with
you because you essentially slept on the deck and the conditions were harsh and you have to be fit
in order to handle ship like this and that is one reason why the Vikings are such excellent
warriors they are constantly involved in building ships and enduring the conditions necessary to
sail these vessels the performance of these ships can be deduced by building reconstructions and
again there's a certain amount of debate of how many men would be to an ore we know how many
ores might be in a vessel most of these vessels probably could put two or three men to an ore
which would mean a standard longship of the ninth century carried a crew of at least 50 when you
get into the late 10th and 11th century crews of a hundred or even 200 in the great dragon ships is
not unusual so you have a lot of muscle power to move those vessels and but in any event based on
these these reconstructions a Viking vessel of the Goxtod ship a warship sailing in eight hour
day could easily average between three and four knots and if it's running with the wind and it's
got its sail up there's arguments that it could make it and make anywhere from eight to twelve
knots now what does this mean in practical application when you can you know average sailing day is
40 to 65 nautical miles statute miles about 85 percent of a nautical mile well that means that
these vessels gave the Vikings a remarkably remarkable tactical advantage and I want to close
with the third part of this lecture with just a some indication of what this meant and it should
explain a great deal of part three the success of the Viking raids in Western Europe and across
Russia I take as an example a documented case that we know quite well on March 28th Easter Sunday a
large Danish army occupied the city of Paris in 845 the fleet is reputedly 120 vessels according to
some of the accounts most of these vessels are apparently arriving from Denmark and Southwestern
Norway and they are according to some sources commanded by the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok
now if you work out the times and distances and when they would have set sail which would have been
maybe at the earliest March 1st and you take the sailing distances that are deduced from these
replica ships that is easily three to four knots especially if you have the currents going with
you along the North ship sea they could cover somewhere on the order about 900 statute miles
from Scandinavia to the mouth of the same within about three weeks they would then sail up the
same which is about 150 miles from Paris and if they were rowing in shifts and even though they
were going against the current and dealing with the curves of the river they could probably reach
Paris certainly within a week certainly within three to four days in the process of going to
Paris they ran into two Frankish armies commanded by Charles the ball they defeated the smaller
one on one side of the same that's where they they hang the 111 prisoners which panic the other
army which fled and that's how they occupied Paris without resistance and so based on what we
know of our sailing distances and based on what we know of this particular campaign they're quite
consistent that a Viking fleet of this size could raid out of Scandinavia hit a city like Paris
within a month and then get out very quickly in comparison to the speed of these ships which
could cover easily going up river you know they're selling up a river 115 miles there they could do
it in four or five days most medieval armies by land assuming they had anything resembling a
Roman road could on average only make 12 or 15 miles a day cavalry forces pushing those horses
really hard an elite force might make 20 miles that is Viking fleets which could negotiate along
any coast of Europe and could go extremely deep up river systems could move three four five times
faster than any opponent on land and given the fact that the Scandinavians come to have a monopoly
of sea power it is no surprise that the Vikings can raid and attack at will before most of their
opponents can even get their forces in the field and this strategic advantage is held by the Vikings
for the next 300 years no one will attempt to contest Scandinavian sea power northern Europe
and the only major naval battles fought in the Viking age is Vikings fighting Vikings and that is
one of the most important points that comes out of this lecture is that by 790 these Scandinavians
propelled with that martial ethos and propelled with that culture to the war gods now have ships
that can get them to go anywhere in Western Europe
