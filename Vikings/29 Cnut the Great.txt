In this lecture, I plan to look at the career and the impact of the Danish king Knut the
King of Norway and exercised a hegemony over Sweden. Knut, sometimes known as Knut the old in the
Norse tradition, is a king of European importance and in some ways he marks a new point in the Viking
Age. He forges essentially the territorial kingdom of Denmark at least in its institutions and in part he's able to do this
because he was also king of England. He could draw upon the resources that is financial as well as the personnel, the talent to create a
kingdom of Denmark. He was less successful in Norway and actually his policies in Norway in many ways contributed to the demise of his
kingdom. So by the time of his death in 1035 Knut ruled a North Sea empire that included England, Norway, Denmark and a hegemony or some kind of
personal domination over the kings of Sweden. It was an impressive looking state in some ways it looked like the realization of political
developments since the 10th century that is the Scandinavian homeland coming together in a Christian kingdom under a great European
style king, a king who in many ways saw himself as the heir of Charlemagne or the Charlemagne of the North and yet shortly after his death the kingdom
was already falling apart. In the case of Norway Knut lost control over Norway in the very final months of his life.
Well the career of King Knut excites a lot of imagination, a lot of study. Much of it is concentrated on his career in England and what I plan to do in this
lecture is to first look at Knut's early career, his conquest of England. He accompanied his father Sven Forkbeard in the effort to take over England and that was the
conquest initiated back in 1002 when King Ethelred II of England had carried out this massacre of Danes who were in England and that prompted Sven Forkbeard to declare war on the
English king. Then I want to examine Knut and his career as a king not just of England as very often he's treated but as a king of this sort of North Sea empire.
And the argument that we're going to make in this lecture that for all of the importance of the English kingdom in this North Sea empire or North Sea super kingdom if you will Knut was very traditional and very
very Scandinavian in his approach to government and in many ways he drew upon the policies of his dad that is Sven Forkbeard as well as Harold Bluetooth his grandfather and his great-grandfather
Gorm the old and so Knut is better understood as a Scandinavian king ruling this wide flung empire who had aspirations to become a European style figure like Charlemagne rather than looking at him as an English king
whereas many a textbook might state at least in England that Knut was born a Viking sea king and died in English monarch and there's a reason to test this theory this image that is very often used to understand him.
And finally I want to conclude this lecture with some thoughts about why this empire didn't stay together. It is easy to dismiss it as an ambitious state that really had no foundations other than the charismatic king Knut and his veteran warriors in
and furthermore that the arrangements for the succession were really flawed as I noted in the case of Norway Knut had lost control of Norway in the final months of his year his of his life that is in the year 1035
Nonetheless for contemporaries people living in the first half of the 11th century there was some reason to believe that this unification of Scandinavia with England had a certain amount of logic to it that there were some institutional bases for this as well as trade connections and
and an economic ties that there's no reason to simply assume that this kingdom was doomed from its start and as we shall see in the upcoming lecture the sequel to this lecture there was a very long war of succession over who should have the right to rule this kingdom this empire of Knut
and that is not decided until the battles of 1066 when it's clear that partition is going to be the result not a unitary state or some sort of related set of kingdoms ruled by a single family that is it's a dynastic union of England and the Scandinavian kingdoms
so it was by no means foreordained that Knut's empire was going to break up
Well let's look at the first part of this lecture and that is the career of King Knut and who this remarkable ruler was
Knut in some ways can simply be seen as the most successful sea kings that we've ever seen in the Viking Age
a man who ended up ruling three kingdoms and in many ways being treated as a great Christian monarch who twice visited Rome
who was accepted as the equal of the Holy Roman Emperor that is the emperor ruling in Germany who also had the crown of Holy Roman Emperor going back to Charlemagne
who as a European wide figure really cast in the shadow many of his contemporaries
yet it has to be kept in mind that he remained first and foremost the Scandinavian speaker of the Danish tongue
and above all he gained a great deal from his father Sten Forkbeard
and it's important to stress that in contrast to Sven's relationship to his father Harold Bluetooth
Sten Forkbeard never had a doubt that Knut was going to be his heir
Knut was the son of a dynastic marriage with Polish princess and it was part of a long term Danish policy to secure alliances with the Slavic peoples
the Wends, the people dwelling on the southern shore of the Baltic
that would today be the shores of Germany and Poland at the mouth of the Oder River
also with the princes of Poland because the Slavic rulers were often seen as potential allies against the common enemy the German king the Holy Roman Emperor
in addition Knut was taken on campaign and fought in England with his father
and there was no doubt when his father suddenly died early in 1014 and Knut was actually in Scandinavia raising fresh forces
the Danish army immediately acclaimed Knut king
there was no doubt that he was the next in line
and so from the start Knut probably from the age of 15 on
and we're not quite sure when he was born sometime in the mid to late 990s
was reared as the royal successor to his father
now Sven in 1003 embarked with a great fleet to begin the conquest of England
and that expedition is still debated whether Sven intended to simply exact vengeance for the massacre on St. Bryce's day
or he had in the back of his mind a real conquest
at the very least in my opinion Sven saw the campaigns in England as a way to gain revenues and booty
to support the types of royal fleets and warriors necessary to assert his authority in Scandinavia
and as I mentioned from the beginning of his reign with that defeat
that early naval defeat at JÃ¶rungavag back around 987-988
Sven had been behind the political eight ball
he sent his great yarls to command the armies in later expeditions
these were earls in the English tradition
they included a man named Torre or Tostig as he was called in old English
and above all Thorkel the Tall who was a famous commander associated with the Jones Vikings
the Jones Vikings that professional company living at the mouth of the odor in their fortified camp and celebrated in Saga
and they made a fair amount of headway in England exacting great payments of Dengald
and winning over the former Dan Law areas particularly the regions around York and the five boroughs
and so by 1013 when Canute followed his father Sven on the final campaign to England
there had already been made considerable progress in the conquest of England
most of the former Dan Law areas had gone over to the Danes were cooperating
and there were already signs that great English earls that is regional figures appointed by the West Kings
the West Saxon Kings were beginning to open negotiations with the potential Danish conqueror
in 1013 Sven's army immediately scored some important successes
but as I noted early in the year he died suddenly in the next year in 1014
in February 1014 Sven dies
Canute at that point had gone back to Scandinavia he was raising forces
he's acclaimed king he makes an arrangement with his younger half brother Harold
who rules in Denmark while Canute goes back to take charge of the army
when Canute arrives in England he finds a changed situation
the very feckless king Ethelred the Unreddy the Unreddy as he's often called
which means he couldn't hold his council Ethelred II had come to the throne back in 978
had been guided by ministers through much of his early reign
and really asserted himself in 1002 by ordering the massacre
his name Ethelred or Ethelred in Anglo-Saxon means noble council, noble advice
and Unredd meaning no council was a title given to him which was mocking his vacillating nature
that is noble council of no council king is what we have
and he was unpopular for a number of reasons
he was associated with the murder that was ordered on his predecessor
his half brother Edward the martyr he was unpopular in certain church circles
and as I noted in an earlier lecture Ethelred lost the cooperation of the landed classes
in northern England the Anglo-Danish norming classes who went over to spend
and then went over to Canute and he turns out to be perhaps the most unsuccessful descendant
of the house of Alfred the Great and he had taken refuge in Normandy
with his brother-in-law Duke Richard II
Ethelred was married to Emma the sister of Duke Richard II
and the Norman court at Rouen became the court where all the English exiles
and political outlets trekked as Fen and Canute swept England
well when Canute came back from Denmark to take charge of his army after the death of his father
he found that the oldest son of Ethelred
his name is Edmund Ironside had returned from Normandy with forces
and had rallied the English
now most of these English who rallied to Edmund Ironside were in the old kingdom of Wessex
and the city of London which had prospered under the West Saxon kings
whereas elsewhere in the country his support was pretty weak
there's a war of maneuver and finally in 1016 Canute and Edmund come to an agreement
and they essentially agreed to partition the kingdom of England more or less along the lines
that Alfred had petitioned the kingdom with that old great Danish army in the 9th century
and England in effect would have been ruled as a divided state
with Canute ruling in the Danish the Dan law areas
when in November 1016 suddenly this energetic Anglo-Saxon prince died
Ethelred II is in exile back in Normandy
and finally the English nobility think it's just not worth bringing back Ethelred
in his discredited court and they go over to Canute
and Canute is received as king of all England
well that turn of events was the unexpected triumph for the Danes
who had been attacking England since the end of the 8th century
since the 790s
this was a complete conquest of the kingdom
and furthermore Canute took over an extremely well run state
of the state that had been forged by Alfred and his son and grandson
in response to the Danish raids
and this gets us to the usual image of Canute
is that once Canute became king of England
of all England in 1016 not just the Dan law regions
he essentially settled into a position and ruled as an English king
well there's a certain amount of truth to that
for one Canute spent a great deal of his reign in England
and he didn't visit Scandinavia that frequently
in fact Scandinavia was ruled through deputies
his half brother ruled as king of Denmark until late in 1018 when he died
and then Canute went back to Denmark
and was immediately voted king of the Danes at the thing of Vborg in 1019
and so henceforth he's king, uncontested king of both England and Denmark
he used Yarls, great earls to run Denmark
the first of them was a man named Ulf who was married to Canute's half sister
her name is Estrith or Astrid as we'd say in English
their son Ulf and Estrith's son would be Estrithsen
the nephew of Canute who would eventually end up being in many ways the successor
to Canute in Denmark later on
Ulf actually ran afoul of his brother-in-law and was deprived of power
and in the later years Thorkle the Tall ruled in Denmark as Yarl
why Canute stayed in England and then in his final years
one of Canute's sons was designated to run Denmark while Canute was in England
so throughout Canute's reign there's this notion that
well Scandinavia was run by proxies it couldn't have been that important
it also was nice for the English to assuage their sense of national image
to claim that well Canute may have been a Danish king
but he ended up dying as really an English monarch
because it's a little embarrassing for the English to admit
that a half Danish half Polish king with a fleet came and conquered England
there are a number of problems for the English in recognizing this
Canute however could really far more be looked at as a Scandinavian conqueror
who stayed in England because he had to
and to put it rather bluntly
to run Denmark and eventually Norway and essentially Sweden indirectly
because he had the revenues in England to hire that professional Viking fleet
that royal fleet and the warriors to maintain control
Canute demobilized part of his forces in 1016 after the conquest of England
he couldn't keep all of his men on retainer
no one has that kind of resources
and there's vast payments and discharges of Scandinavians
we have memorial runestones in Sweden
a testing of the fact that they had been paid off by Canute
and went back to their homeland somewhere around Uppsalao like Malloran
nonetheless he retained a royal army of 2,000 well-trained warriors
House Carl's as they're often called in the English tradition
who continued under the later English king Edward the Confessor as the royal army
a large fleet was maintained
part of it was raised by what is known as the Ledic
ledig the Ledic in Danish which is the ship levy
that is all able-bodied men in Denmark
it was later extended to Norway as well
had to provide so many ships on royal call
there was also some sort of arrangement in England
associated with the Ferd that is the national service
in which ships could be called up from the coastal counties or shires
but there was a royal fleet of dragon ships and long ships on immediate call
plus very good information on when those ship levees could be summoned
Canute had naval power
and he never forgot the importance of naval power in running this far-flung empire
and that meant he had to collect money to maintain it
and so he ruled England with a hard hand
there are several features of his reign in England
that indicate that you're dealing with the conqueror
ruling over a very well-run medieval state
especially by the standards of this time in the Middle Ages
for one, he patronized the English church
he endowed a number of monasteries
he's remembered as a friend of the English church
but that never inspired a royal biographer
that is a churchman to write anything like Azir's biography of Alfred
and it never really inspired much interest in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
these are the chronicles written about the achievements of the kings of England
and Canute's reign is remarkably
these chronicles are remarkably silent about the king's achievements
instead they concentrate on the great English figures
particularly a fellow named Earl Godwin
who had five sons, one of them the future King Harold II
which was an English family that early on came over to the Danish side
and played ball with Canute and Sven Forkbeard
and was rewarded with very, very important lands
and became the leading political family in England
in fact, Godwin and his family were essentially the national political elite
upon whom Danish rule rested in England
they were so important
and that alone is an indication that there is a lack of interest in the accounts
that Canute as much as he tried to rule as a Christian monarch
and looked like the new Charlemagne
never really got particularly good PR in the English tradition
in fact today if one questions anyone in Great Britain
about what do you know of King Canute
it's not that he ruled this great North Sea Empire
but a story that becomes common in the 12th century
that story actually emphasizes the foolishness and arrogance of the king
it starts with, I believe Henry of Huntington is the first one to report it
that King Canute was convinced by his advisors
that because he had such a great naval empire
he could command the waves to haul
and so he goes down to the beaches and he's seated there
the waves are coming in at high tide
and he's yelling to them in Danish and Old English and Latin
whatever language is, stop, stop
and the waves keep coming and of course you know
several ministers lose their heads in their lands
and the king is very angry
and what the story underscores is that
Canute is not like King Alfred
I mean think about it
you just can't envision Canute
taking a dressing down from some peasant lady
that he had fallen asleep and the cake said burn
Canute would just wouldn't do that
that peasant lady would be paying the dangal
in order to maintain the warriors
so Canute never gained any kind of major reputation
in the English tradition
really a little difficult to deal with
in the national history of England
another important point about Canute
and why in many ways he was a Scandinavian conqueror
while he used those local institutions in England
that were evolved by Alfred's successors
and also created what I like to call
a Charmed Club of Yarls
the English word is Earl
which were very very powerful regional men
these were men endowed with large areas such as
Mercia and Northumbria
in some ways their powers approximated
the regional kings and Anglo-Saxon England
before Alfred the Great
and this is a common arrangement
this is an arrangement we'd seen earlier
especially with his father and his grandfather
most of Norway was ruled for a long time by Yarl Hacken
that's how Canute ruled much of Norway
up until 1015 when St. Olaf showed up
he used loyal Yarls who ruled Trondelog
the whole northern section
so he depended on running Denmark through a great Yarl
and so the notion of an English Earl
who is a very very high member of the aristocracy
in the peerage today in England
that position of the Earl was essentially created by Canute
because before that
Earl's or to be more accurate
Earl's old men, older men
were much more minor officials
subject to the will of the king
Canute could only rule England
by bringing in very very loyal Danish families
or Norwegian families
who were given these large districts
or co-opting a family such as Godwin
a family of Godwin
who married a Danish lady
he actually married the sister of Ulf
the brother-in-law of Canute
so that that was really an English Danish family
Harold II
the last Anglo-Saxon king of England
was actually half Danish
and the first cousin of Sven Estresen
the king of Denmark
finally you can also see
in the succession arrangements in England
and Canute's dynastic plans
that he was again very much a Scandinavian king
he had two wives
and the sources are a bit confused about this
because the first wife is usually treated as a mistress
in the modern scholarship
but the medieval sources had no problem
in seeing Canute having two wives
the first one was an English lady
by the name of Alf Javu
Alf Javu of Northampton
who was the daughter of a leading magnate
in Mercia in the Midlands
and that marriage had occurred very early
in the conquest to win over important support
and by her he had his two oldest sons
the eldest of them was Sven
named after the father
and the other one was Harold
named after the grandfather
very often known as Harold Harefoot
that means he was really a fast runner
he was fast as a hare
and they were the sons by this first marriage
who's often called a concubine or mistress
which is inaccurate
and then Canute came upon the brilliant idea
of marrying the widow of his rival
Ethelrid II
who had just died in Normandy in exile
and that was Queen Emma
Emma was the sister of Richard II of Normandy
as I mentioned Richard Court
was where all the English exiles
had gone in order to mount
an offensive against the Danes who were in England
and by marrying Emma
Canute secured an understanding
with his new brother-in-law
Norman Duke would not support English rebels and dissidents
in Normandy particularly Emma's son
Canute's now stepson
of the future king of England Edward the Confessor
who was kept conveniently in Normandy
and raised as virtually a Norman prince
who probably would have been happier in a monastery
than running England
that political marriage with Emma was extremely important
there was a third son in the marriage
he was given the name Hartha Canute or Canute
he was known in the sources as Canute the Third
and just to clarify a potential confusion
King Canute, Canute the Great, Canute the Old
is usually designated Canute the Second
because his great-great-grandfather
that is the father of Gorm the Old
was also Canute and he's designated Canute number one
even though he was never really a king of Denmark
he was just a sea king
in any case with three sons, two queens
Canute faced the usual problem that any dramatic ruler faced
including Charlemagne and particularly Louis the Pious
and that is providing realms for each of his sons
and this was just expected in the dramatic tradition
there was not the sense that there was a crown
or a single monarchy
and so one of the ways of running this far-flung empire
was to create a set of associated kingdoms
ruled by the sons of Canute
who would then acknowledge one of their number as the overall
chairman of the board as you will of this royal consortium
and in this regard Canute really blundered very badly
he handed over Norway
in 1030 to his
oldest son, Sven, who was probably
considered the head of this family that was to
rule in Scandinavia and England
and Sven came to Norway with his mother, his very very English mother
Elf Jaivu and they blew it
in 1028 Canute had successfully
been elected king of Norway
by the thing in Trondlog
that his long-term rival Olaf the Stout, the king of
Norway who had been ruling in Norway since 1015
had been run out and within 18 months
of securing the throne for himself
Canute handed it over to his oldest son
and Sven and his mom did just about everything to offend
the Yarls and the Lendermen, the leading property men in Norway
and by early 1035
the Norwegians had kicked Sven out of Norway
and invited the son of St. Olaf
Magnus the Good, coming up in a future lecture
to come back and rule over them and so the
position in Norway essentially collapsed
Sven died at the court of his brother in Denmark
that would have been Arthur Canute
and Elf Jaivu was actually in Denmark when Canute died
Harald Harefoot was in England
and the other half brother Canute was in
Denmark when Canute died
late in 1035
and there would immediately be a succession problem
there would be essentially a civil war between the two half brothers
who should rule Denmark and England together
and then whoever took the prize would then have
the right to take out Magnus and bring Norway back under control
and so in his arrangements, his dynastic arrangements
Canute was very much the dramatic ruler
and he followed the principle of providing separate
realms for each of his sons which is very very different
from the principle that evolved in England with Alfred the Great
that is there was a royal family
and brothers might succeed brother but there was only one king
and there was only one realm and the monarchy was not to be divided
and in that sense Canute really is quite different
from an English king
I also mentioned that he had European wide pretensions
and this is an important point to stress
and also accounts a bit for the memory of Canute
in the later historical tradition not only in England
but also in Scandinavia for as we shall see
not only did Canute not get a great reputation in England
he really wasn't remembered that fondly in Scandinavia either
part of the problem is the best Icelandic poets
were hired by his rival Olaf the Stout
the future St. Olaf and as I mentioned
in an earlier lecture not only is it important to have
the best veteran warriors and fleets on hand
it's also to have the best poets because in Scandinavian society
he who has the most Icelandic poets wins
in the PR world and St. Olaf
was accompanied by some of the greatest poets of Iceland
who sang his praises and Canute did not have them
and in part Canute was striving in my opinion
to act somewhat like the Charlemagne of the north
that is he was not associated necessarily with the Scandinavian kingdoms
or with England he saw himself
as a figure on par with Charlemagne
and this is indicated by some of his diplomatic arrangements
two important papal visits
including one where he attended the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor
perhaps the most important diplomatic event
that occurs in western Europe at this time
that is who is going to be crowned by the Pope Holy Roman Emperor
furthermore he arranged a marriage
of one of his daughters to the future Holy Roman Emperor
and that marked Denmark
as a kingdom that had come of age
here is a case where the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire
the future Empress
her name is Gunhild
the great Christian imperial state
when just two generations ago Denmark was subject to attack
by the Holy Roman Emperors who were coming in and forcing these Danish kings
to be baptized look like Denmark would fall under control
and here Canute is able to act as an equal
with the greatest monarch in the Christian world
and that image of Canute
that diplomatic effort by Canute to act as that great Christian king
is one of the reasons why Canute
is not remembered in the same way as St. Olaf
and later Scandinavian kings are
and he comes across as a rather distant figure
in the literature
even so politically and in his lifetime
he was immensely successful
he had harnessed the energies of the Viking Age
to carry out the conquest of England
he had built an empire embracing the three most important kingdoms
in the North Sea
he also exercised an authority over Sweden
any professional warrior in the North lands
was in his employ or potential employ
he took the church institutions
the royal fiscal institutions of England applied them to Denmark
and turned Denmark into a well run efficient Christian kingdom
by his death which his sons and eventually his nephew
were able to turn into a territorial kingdom
and finally in many ways he provoked
the emergence of a new Norwegian family
that is the family of St. Olaf
which would come to unify Norway and turn Norway
into one of the most successful Christian kingdoms of the 13th century
and so in terms of his political legacy
the kings who followed Canute even though his empire was partitioned
all owe their careers and their institutions
to this man and yet strangely
he is not well known in not only the historical tradition
but also in the great poetic and saga traditions
and foremost he handed to his successors
a very very difficult political legacy
of holding this empire together
and we shall see why they failed to do so
