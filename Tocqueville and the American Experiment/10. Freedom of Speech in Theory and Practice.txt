Lecture 10 Freedom of Speech in Theory and Practice
Talk.
In some real way, that's what democracy is about.
In a vibrant, functioning, just, democratic society, people have to talk, they have to
be free to talk, and they have to talk a lot.
Now this is not exactly an insight of Alexis de Tocqueville.
One can go back and read, for example, the funeral oration of Pericles, given in Athens
in the year 430 BC, and he will emphasize the need of citizens to talk.
To talk formally, to be sure, in public debate, but just to talk about stuff that human beings
in a democracy have to communicate, have to communicate openly, have to communicate often.
And Tocqueville saw, we still see today in America, that in a vibrant democracy, people
talk.
Let me give you an illustration.
We have in upstate New York, a place called Genesee Country Village, it's one of those
reassembled villages of old buildings that have been put back together, so that together
they sort of make up an old 19th century town of about the era of Tocqueville.
And one of the things you discover when you walk around this village is that things were
set up so people could talk.
There's a town square and in closed space with stores and churches all around, a natural
gathering place, a natural place to focus, whether it's for a concert or a speech or
just people talking in the park in the town square.
If you walk into the inn that is there, you discover that there were not private dining
tables at the time Tocqueville no doubt stayed and ate in many ins, but rather there were
big communal tables and you sat down and presumably you chatted with the people who were at the
table who were in many cases obviously, especially all for Tocqueville, perfect strangers.
You go into a substantial house and what's that big room in the front?
It's the parlor that is to say the place for talking, a sort of formal space set aside
for conversation.
You go into the village hall, the government building and there's a big place for people
to assemble so that they can get together and they can speak and they can address their
fellow citizens.
Talk is central to democracy and therefore freedom of speech is essential to democracy.
People not only have to talk, they have to be free to say what's on their mind and Tocqueville
knows this and Tocqueville has read the constitution and he has read the first amendment and yet
he says even with all that there are limits on speech in America, not placed there by
the government but placed there in a sense by the culture and by the traditions and Tocqueville
is very concerned with this.
He's concerned about the fact that in theory and in law there is virtually absolute freedom
of speech and in practice it's not quite the same.
And so what I want to focus on for the rest of this lecture is looking at Tocqueville's
critique of speech in America, seeing where and how it is curtailed, what some of the
dangers of that are and what some of the consequences ultimately could be in the long run.
First of all he says if you are part of the majority and by majority here he doesn't mean
a political party or a particular organization but sort of if you are in the mainstream of
thought about American life and institutions, that's what he really means by the majority
here, if you're part of the majority you're fine.
If you believe what most people believe you are fine.
If you are close to what most people believe you will be able to speak out he says and
you will set out to try to win the majority over because the majority is in a sense easily
winnable. You say guys you know the majority most people don't quite get it but they sort
of almost get it. I'll sort of move them to my direction a little bit.
All of that's fine. Tocqueville says however that those whose ideas are far from the majority
can accomplish nothing.
And then he says you know I'm bothered about this because when I first arrived in America
in New York in particular I went to all kinds of meetings and I was really impressed by
the breadth and the passion and the amount of free speech that I heard and at first
I just sort of said this is great.
He listened to discussions about building a church.
He listened to meetings of various political groups talking about the upcoming elections.
He noted that there were always discussions both informal and formal about making improvements
making the streets better or whatever it might be.
He said it was hard to believe how many discussions there were about schools what kinds of schools
what should be taught and so forth and in fact he made one very interesting observation.
He said even women attended these discussions even though of course they didn't vote but
more than that it doesn't stop there.
That would just be an interesting observation.
He says that what women do in America is even though again they don't vote or whatever
they form clubs he says rather than engage in theater going.
Obviously a comment comparing American women to French women as he observed them back home
that women not only attend these meetings they're caught up in this too but women actually
then form clubs and they become part of the democratic process albeit indirectly since
they don't have the franchise and don't run for public office.
It's a very interesting observation because again where I come from near Rochester New
York Rochester is a home of Susan B. Anthony.
She was a teacher but what did she do?
She used to go to temperance rallies.
She went to temperance rallies with dad and whatever and she became very active in the
temperance movement and then she began to go to abolition meetings and became active
in the abolitionist movement.
She was very important part of both of those movements before she became the great women's
rights advocate that we know her for being and it's really interesting to look at her
as a kind of illustration of what Tocqueville says women form clubs to talk about the same
kinds of things that men talk about better schools better roads public improvements
and so on.
Anyway I want to get back now to the main theme despite all the speech that he heard
in New York and other places Tocqueville said this is a very spooky thought in some
ways.
He says that he found less independence of mind and genuine freedom of discussion in
America than any place he had been okay less freedom of mind and freedom of discussion
despite all this talk he heard and he spends a good deal of time explaining what he means
by this first of all he says the majority and again we don't mean a political party
or a faction in a formal sense going to talk about that a little bit later on in another
lecture the majority has drawn a circle around thought a very broad circle he says not a
narrow circle there are a lot of things if you will that Americans are free to talk about
and free to say I don't just mean free legally because that's not what he's talking about
he's not talking about laws he's talking about practice he's talking about custom talking
about the way people respond to other people the circle of discussion in America is wide
it is broad inside this circle there is complete freedom of discussion and thought if you want
to put that in modern terms today you can be a liberal or a conservative you can be
a Republican or a Democrat you can be a conservative Republican or a liberal Democrat and you're
within that circle and there's freedom of speech and freedom of discussion but Tocqueville
says those whose ideas are outside that circle are the butt of jokes and the object of persecution
very big circle bigger than most places presumably but outside that circle if you're if that's
where you are in terms of your views then essentially there is he says persecution you are the butt
of jokes now this persecution is not physical you don't get thrown in jail you aren't arrested
for spouting we might say today sort of radical very very unconventional political ideas you
aren't arrested in the United States today for example if you are an avowed Marxist so
we're not talking about the government intervening here we're not talking about people thrown
in jail as he said it's not about anybody suffering through an auto daff√© referring
to some of the activities of the Inquisition of the 16th century but those who are outside
the circle he says are cut off from power political careers are closed to those outside
the circle very interesting let me throw out one illustration today that might help us
to get what to what I think Tocqueville is talking about there is on my campus a group
called Democratic Socialists of America by the way as far as I can tell despite the name
probably a fairly moderate liberal group but leaving aside what its positions are called
the Democratic Socialists of America I've had students say to me you know I like the
positions that that organization on campus takes I'd like to be bound up with that I'd
like to join but I don't dare because someday I might want to run for public office and
you know somebody's going to put the socialist label on me and be able to prove that I was
once a socialist and that's going to be a very big hole I might not be able to dig
myself out of I think that's the sort of thing Tocqueville has in mind again he is not
talking about legal violations of people's First Amendment rights it's very important
to know that we're making a careful distinction here what happens is in the realm of public
opinion the majority says this is the ballpark we'll play in you can play in this ballpark
anywhere in this ballpark it's okay we'll go back and forth within this ballpark and
you are penalized for wherever you are inside this ballpark but get outside the ballpark
and probably you have no influence on the society anymore you to some extent lose your
voice and you probably lose any realistic opportunity to obtain political power okay
the majority he says does intellectual violence to those outside the circle of thought that
they have established people are free from physical violence but they are treated as
strangers people outside the circle he says keep their privileges we might say keep their
rights but those privileges won't be of any use to them because they will in a sense be
written off as coops or cranks or whatever it might be I think one way to consider this
is to take a look at a lot of cable news cable political discussions I've read several
commentaries about this that makes sense to me having read reread read reread recently
obviously this piece of Tocqueville think about the the the kinds of TV shows we have
somebody on the left and somebody on the right and they sort of argue with each other even
yell at each other think about where they are on the left and the right when's the last
time the one on the left for example was really a socialist or a Marxist when's the
last time the one on the right was really you know a libertarian when's the last time
you saw an anarchist having one of those points of view in one of those TV shows where the
opposite sides argue with one another again I think this is a good illustration not in
law but in practice of what Tocqueville is talking about the circle is very broad you
get people who on TV who disagree fairly fundamentally with one another on what government should
do on what the role of government is on specific policies but there is a circle and you don't
hear the voices beyond the edges of that circle however big that circle is and I think there
are those who would argue the circle is getting bigger today there are those who argue the
circle is getting smaller today but I think that we need to take this point of Tocqueville
very very seriously you know it's interesting because in some nations in Europe for example
if a political party let's say gets 5% of the vote it gets representation in its parliament
or its national assembly or whatever they might call it and so a party might get 6%
of the vote but they will have a seat or two at the table they will be in the legislature
of course we have a two party system where you really don't have that situation that
you may get a party that could get consistently 15% of the vote that would never elect anybody
to a state legislature let's say and so forth so that those people never get to participate
in the government now again the two party system is formed by tradition not formed by our constitution
or by law but nevertheless I think Tocqueville is concerned that there are other societies
that allow a wider range of voices and take a wider range of voices seriously even though
in America in theory and in law there is virtually absolute freedom of speech there is a difference
between theory and practice on in the theory side Europe would look much more constricted
in its speech that America does but in practice Tocqueville is not so sure he worries about
that and I think it is something for us to think about and to be concerned with he says
those who disagree from you know disagree significantly from the majority find themselves
in isolation and despair it's difficult he says to believe what the majority respects
that the majority and we'll talk about the idea of the tyranny the majority in a future
lecture but the majority in a sense sets the agenda and the majority sort of sets what's
tolerable again they draw the lines of that circle and if you're outside that circle it
is a very difficult job what he calls being the butt of jokes of being ridiculed for being
outside that circle it's a very interesting position he takes and he says the majority
doesn't need to constrain others because it persuades them I put the word persuade in
quotation marks in a real sense in other words the majority doesn't say you have to believe
what we believe or you're going to jail it's if you will move into at least that circle
then you can talk then you can be listened to then somebody will read your editorial
newspaper I was reading some papers recently by my students about Tocqueville in fact and
they had to write letters to the editor about some topics that they could choose and it's
interesting because a couple of them at the end instead of go along making an interesting
argument and then at the end one of them wrote for example and America has become a fascist
state and I sat down with a student and I said you know first of all I want you to make
sure you're using language carefully you mean what you say but secondly I said let me just
talk about this to you tactically if you are writing a real letter to the editor and you
want to persuade a group of people to listen to your point of view and to follow your advice
that's what letter to the editors do and you put that as your punchline you're going to
lose almost all the people you might have persuaded up to that time because you've removed
yourself to a place outside the circle if you want to do that if that's what you want
to do fine but be aware that that's what you're doing is the point I made to this student
you're free to say that in my paper and in a letter to the editor but probably a the
letter to the editor is less likely to get published but be more importantly it seemed
to me is very very few people are going to say boy there was a there was a cogent analysis
I got to think about that they're going to say ah some wacko wrote this letter and so
I think that that we want to take seriously this concern the Tocqueville has now another
point he makes with regard to freedom of speech isn't interesting when he says you know Americans
are the American majority is sort of humorless they don't like to be made fun of it's in a
sense hard to satirize majority opinion it's hard to satirize the positions that are inside
that circle and he gives a very interesting illustration rooted in his own French citizenship
he says even at the court of Louis 14th it the sun king of the builder of the palace
of Versailles said even there you can't think of a more absolutist monarchy anywhere than
the monarchy of Louis the 14th he said even at the court of Louis the 14th there were
plays put on at Versailles written by people such as Moli√®re whom he names in the book
there were plays that just mocked and made fun of the very people who were there watching
the play and the very people who had commissioned Moli√®re to write the play that he said even
in this absolutist society people who were running the show at Versailles could laugh
at themselves they could accept mockery of who they are and how they acted Tocqueville
says boy you don't find that in America that the majority is rather humorless and not particularly
tolerant of that kind of humor I think we can all think of examples where political
officials or candidates have really gotten angry not at false accusations but at certain
kinds of satire at a skit or a play that was put on for example that really made fun of
them and Tocqueville sees Americans as needing to sort of chill out a little bit we might
say to have a little bit more of a sense of humor be a little bit more laid back not be
so tightly wound when it came to free speech again not in theory you don't arrest people
for writing this stuff it's a practice that I think Tocqueville worries about he says
that the majority only will listen to two things one it will listen to experience that
is to say you know if the majority says gee if we do this that will happen and you do
this and that doesn't happen majority will notice that and therefore the majority may
shift its opinion about how you do certain things okay the other teacher he says it's
foreigners he said somehow or other they will listen to foreigners say things about America
and of course Tocqueville is a foreigner they will listen to foreigners say things about
America that Americans really can't say about themselves one wonders about some of these
interesting conversations that Tocqueville had with various people where you know Tocqueville
must have said occasionally I just don't get this at all this doesn't make any sense to
me at all and apparently if it had been an American that's had said that to another group
of Americans they might have said what's the matter with you on patriotic guy but the Tocqueville
they might have said huh that's interesting or at least we'll think about that or gee
we never heard that perspective before and certainly America has a tradition not just
of Tocqueville but of other foreigners who have come to America and written about America
and the sense showed us things and said things to us that Americans themselves either don't
say to one another or won't take seriously if another American says it I recently read
a book written by an Italian journalist who spent a year in Washington DC it's called
Chow America and it's sort of a description of America in his one year that he lived in
Washington it's everything from going to a great big hardware store you know the size
of a football field to just day to day living and it is hilarious and insightful and I'm
probably laughing at things he says and therefore sort of storing them away where if another
American might have said them I could have been insulted by him how dare he say that
about us but somehow or other this journalist from Milan can get by with telling us some
things about ourselves that we don't want to hear from one another I really do think
that's still a part of the American tradition we need to listen to foreigners because probably
we don't so often listen to to all the voices that might be more critical or challenging
to our paradigms than we would like it's a very interesting point. Tocqueville says
to now draw a distinction in what he has said I've drawn a distinction between law and practice
let me draw another distinction that Tocqueville draws now he says in America there's freedom
of speech but not freedom of mind and here's some of the things he says there are no great
writers in America he says because they lack freedom of mind it's interesting that this
seems to be something Tocqueville missed because this is the very time we're beginning to get
a wonderful and distinguished body of American literature out of a group from New England
the most democratic place right called the transcendentalist he says there are unbelievers
of the American way in America but they have no organ they have no way of communicating
with one another effectively. Now today one of the questions we're always asking not just
on this issue but on so many issues is well is the internet going to change things we
asked that 30 years ago 40 years ago is television going to change things we now ask is the internet
going to change things anybody essentially for a few bucks after all can post a website
so are we finding now that people who are in fact unbelievers of the American way now do have
organs and is that a good thing or a bad thing I think Tocqueville would see it as a good thing
he was worried it didn't exist in America in 1831 maybe like the comment on producing great
American writers Tocqueville was wrong or at least he's been outdated on this issue but it's
worth thinking about he says to some extent one must renounce the rights of citizenship to
deviate from the beliefs of the majority again not thrown in jail but if you deviate too far
from the majority essentially you have cut off your ability not to speak out but to be listened
to not to have an opinion but to put that opinion reasonably before the electorate and say vote for
me I want to hold this office and he says because of the power that the majority has
over mind therefore he says only a few who seek power in America have what Tocqueville
calls an old-fashioned language virile candor or manly independence we tend to get he says
in America a lot of fairly bland people running for office people who say conventional things
who pass on conventional wisdom because to be unconventional or to be too unconventional
is to essentially ban yourself from reasonably being able to run for office and win or even
to have a voice that people will listen to I mean every town every village I suppose has
a couple people that are just sort of always complaining always protesting things they
may serve a very valuable function but I know I've been to town meetings where that particular
person in our town stands up and everybody and they moan and they grown and they look
each other and they whisper and three go to the bathroom and that's sort of what Tocqueville
is worried about that those folks who are regarded as the cranks the ones who object
to everything really might have something to say but have been marginalized because their
views fall outside the circle that the majority has drawn I want to read you one passage to
come back to something I mentioned a minute ago about Tocqueville's concern that foreigners
have this role to play in a nation like America the foreigner it is true sometimes encounters
Americans who deviate from the rigor of formulas they come to deplore the viciousness of the
laws the volatility of democracy and its lack of enlightenment they often go so far as to
note the fault the faults that alter the national character and they point out the means that
could be taken to correct them but no one except you the foreigner listens to them and
you to whom they confide their secret thoughts you are only a foreigner and you pass on they
will willingly deliver to you truths that are useless to you and when they descend to
the public square they hold to another language okay some become cranks some just shut up but
they'll talk to a foreigner they'll say come here come here let me tell you what I really
think and they will lay it out now think about how that works because some of those ideas
that people won't express to their fellow Americans they expressed to Tocqueville and
then some of those show up in democracy of America in America because he says people
will tell me things they won't tell their fellow Americans this emphasizes again why
do we need to listen to foreigners because foreigners have listened to a part of ourselves
that we either don't hear can't hear or pay too little attention to Tocqueville says I'm
worried that freedom of speech could be lost in America freedom of speech now not just
freedom of mind freedom of speech even though we have that in America he said it's not
necessarily there forever it needs vigilance the omnipotence of the majority will talk
about that particular theme or the tyranny of the majority he sometimes says could lead
to loss of freedom he also says centralized administration a thing we've talked about
several times before making government work from the top administer all the details that
will take away that vigorous local discussion and ultimately freedom of speech could be
lost we need to appreciate the fact that in America freedom of speech is a reality freedom
of mind is not always a reality we can say whatever we want without fear of being arrested
but if we say certain things we essentially remove ourselves from serious discussion I
think these are issues that a very sensitive thoughtful Alexis took to Tocqueville has
pondered a great deal and it's worth it even in a nation that's so wedded to the first
amendment to consider these thoughts and to realize that vigilance must always be there
to protect free speech.
