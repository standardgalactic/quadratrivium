Lecture 46.
Genetic Psychology and the Bell Curve
In Plato's Republic, a question arises as to where the polis will get the guardians,
where the guardians of the state are to be found, because the guardians of the state,
as their title suggests, are the last great hope for the preservation of the state and
for its achieving those ends for which the polis is created.
So Socrates is asked, where are we going to get the guardians?
These are people now who aren't going to have any privately held property, their children
will be part of a community, they're going to have to be absolutely stolid, you've got
to be able to count on them under all circumstances, they're going to be like the U.S. Marine Corps
at its best, where are we going to get such people?
Well Socrates answers the question, as very often he does, by asking a question.
He's being regaled in all this by Glaucon and Thrasymachus and Nadia Montes and the other
young eager beavers who are constantly peppering them with questions.
And he says, he says, you have hunting dogs, don't you?
And they must have been a pause, you know, Plato constructs these dialogues like theater
pieces.
So, so if these were actually staged dialogues, there'd be that kind of numbing silence for
a moment.
And then, and then the, the, the priest says, you don't mean, you don't mean we're going
to breed them, do you see?
But as you have hunting dogs means, look, your dogs hunt, not because you've taught
them how to hunt, your dogs naturally hunt, that's what a hunting dog is.
And the way you get a very, very good hunting dog is by breeding for just those traits on
which the successful hunt depends.
Now as eyebrows go up and skepticism mounts, Socrates has to make even clearer how this
is all going to come about.
He says, well, you know, the way you do this sort of thing is you, you, you stage a sort
of ball or party of some kind, a, a, a fet of some kind and, and late at night when people
are a bit in their cups and so forth and their defenses are down, well, you report the results
of the marriage lottery, you know, you presented as if it were just a kind of game of chance
that has this jack matched up with that chill.
But of course in the background and in the back room, the smoke filled room sort of thing,
you've made sure that the right pairings are the ones that are going to take place so that
the particular chap is chosen for the particular woman with a particular heritable outcome
in mind.
That's how you're going to do it.
And then in response to the question, in case you think that Socrates is inevitably just
that cheerful gadfly who bounds around and is nothing but a ball of humor, when the question
then arises, well, look, these pairings don't always work.
We certainly know very, very intelligent people who have doltish children, etc.
What do you do with the outcomes that don't match up with your expectations?
Socrates' answer is, well, these are exposed then.
And by exposed, he means exposed to the environment.
These are just infants left to die.
The practice here was not uncommon in the world of Sparta and do remember that the dialogues
are based on events that occurred after Athens had lost to Sparta.
You should read Plato's dialogues as discussions taking place among the losing side in a long
drawn out, devastating war.
And so you do have people regrouping to find out where did we go wrong, what might we have
done, what were our failures, this kind of moral criticism that very often attaches to
defeat in war.
And many of the recommendations made in the dialogues have to do with practices that were
long customary in the victorious Spartan world.
Well, that's the subject of another occasion.
But what is illustrated here, going back to Socrates, and it goes back long before Socrates,
it goes back to the very birth of animal husbandry, is the recognition or the claim that certain
characteristics can be bred for, that you actually can avail yourself long before anyone
knew anything about genes.
You can avail yourself of whatever it is in the germ plasm that results in new births.
Some of this is fairly rich, good, pure stuff.
Some of it isn't.
And when you work the combinations out right, you get the types that you're eager to get.
Going back for a moment to Plato's Republic, Socrates says that the people should be made
aware of the, he calls it a convenient fiction.
He's referring to an older myth, a myth that surfaces in the works of Hesiod, of men of
gold, men of silver, men of brass, and men of iron.
And the point that Socrates wants to make is that you will not get men of gold by mating
people at the level of iron and so forth.
Men of gold are what they are because there's something pure and right within them.
Obviously the environment and education will count for much as the tree, as the twig is
bent, so grows the tree.
Nonetheless, it's not in bending a twig that you'll make a spruce into an oak.
You've got to have the right ingredients to begin with because for the environment to
work, it must work on something.
And the something that it works on is, in a manner of speaking, genetically determined.
Now that's an ancient view.
It is at the bottom of all psychologies that in an earlier lecture I identified as nativistic
psychologies.
A nativistic psychology, a nativistic theory in psychology, is one that takes genetics,
or heredity, as having such powerful, predisposing influences, that although the environment always
figures importantly, the environments effects take place within a range and that that range
is set by the genetic realities of the situation.
Well, it goes without saying that this is a view that not only raises any number of theoretical
and indeed empirical problems, problems of a scientific, experimental measurement nature,
but of course it raises any number of grave and grim social questions and moral questions.
It's a view that has been clouded in controversy from its earliest expression and it is a view
that surfaces with some reliability in our own culture time and time again.
It generally is part of the discussion on race and racial differences, gender and gender
differences, why is it that males routinely score higher on mathematics and science aptitude
tests and female score higher on verbal aptitude tests, aha, that's because men and women
are different, well of course men and women are different or you wouldn't even have the
denomination man and woman, but the question is whether that range of differences not merely
predicts something like scores on a math and science aptitude test, but more or less determines
scores on a math and aptitude test, is there a gene for mathematics and science, is there
a gene for verbal fluency? We know that brains are in a manner of speaking gendered, that
indeed you can, if you enter early enough in ingestation, if you enter early enough even
in the neonatal life of non-human organisms, you can increase the testosterone or estrogen
titer in the cerebral circulation and you can have male adult animals behaving in female
patterns of sexuality and the contrary and the like and thus it has been argued by more
than one scientist, more than one psychologist, that the sexual orientation of an organism
is determined by brain mechanisms which early on are flexible enough to be gendered differently
so that the sexual behavior of the animal does not match up with the secondary sex characteristics
of the animal. So I say this is a literature that gets thicker as we sit here and the question
at the end of the day is whether or not it's a literature that is thick but somehow thin
or whether it's a literature that is thick in the sense of being informing, portentous,
suggestive, worthy of our abiding attention. Now I say the issue very often surfaces in
connection with racial comparisons and no one speaking at the close of the 20th century
can treat this as a merely academic subject. Indeed in the American experience it's a subject
that has a fairly tawdry history to it, a fairly tawdry social history to it and I should
say a few things in that connection. When I discussed intelligence tests I noted that
at least in the United States experience the leading proponents of intelligence testing
very often were drawn from that part of the intellectual community that already had reached
a settled position on racial differences and it was a position that told for the Caucasian
race and against the Negro race and so when challenges to the testing movement are mounted
today when racial comparisons in IQ show significantly greater performance by Caucasian
than by Negroid populations it is customary for people in the psychological community
to make clear that these tests have a racist history behind them that the very construction
and validation of these tests already has been in behalf of a very well known prejudiced
view etc etc and defenders of the test who are quite prepared to accept that pedigree
or genealogy that history to the testing movement say yes yes yes but whatever the original
impulses were here are the tests now they have been validated by correlating the results
of these tests with school performance and for goodness sake if some people aren't doing
well on them doing well let's not go back to what the attitudes were of the people who
framed the first test let's find out why they're not doing well on them and I say this debate
goes back and forth now when I refer to a history that's somewhat tawdry I don't mean
simply that there might have been and were racist impulses in some of the early early
figures in the mental testing movement but rather our own political history availed itself
both of these attitudes and of the tests to to put in place a restrict restrictive immigration
policies there there was proposed legislation that would keep out of America for example
on Mediterranean types the people standing on the floor of Congress saying we've got
to do something about the influx of these Mediterranean types which Mediterranean types
and of course as the dialogue goes further and further we discovered that well you know
it's particularly the southern Mediterranean type you know those Sicilians and this is
all being advanced with a straight face now on what grounds do we want to restrict immigration
to the United States by Sicilians oh well because of their well-known mental defectiveness
do you see so you so you've got an IQ defense for what turns out to be a strong cultural
bias without going into the details let me say pick your group what whatever ethnic group
you most closely identify with whether it's Oriental black Mediterranean Jewish Central
European Hispanic every group has had its day so to speak in that every group at one
time or another it was a target of discriminatory practices based on the proposition that that
group was intellectually inferior to the reference group the reference group I guess
being the group that came over on the Mayflower or not not long after and this goes on to
this day what we have at work here for those who recall earlier lectures we do have the
fundamental attribution error we have the ultimate attribution error we we we are inclined
as a people to make judgments about persons based upon characteristics that they have
in common with some larger reference group this is another one of those shortcuts where
we don't have to take on the very very heavy labor of behaving justly toward the individual
and finding out the merits or demerits of that person rather I say we we've got the
nice convenient shortcut of treating that person as if he were just an instance of a
type well is there nothing to this do we want to stand behind that sort of liberal social
perspective according to which all this hereditarian talk is just a kind of social Darwinism it's
a convenient excuse for historic exploitational practices and the like well for goodness sake
animal husbandry plant agronomy the plant sciences make quite clear that certain phenotypes
certain characteristics of organisms plant and animal organisms are so easily refined
so easily specified by selective breeding practices that anyone wanting to argue that
these characteristics are not strongly causally indebted to underlying genetic mechanisms
would simply be climbing a rope of sand there isn't any question at all but that the the
the genetic composition of an organism is a powerfully predisposing condition which
is going to function or not function in a given environment in such a way as to realize
certain characteristics or fail to realize them or realize them in varying degrees it
seems to me I think it would seem to to anyone examining the record that that record is so
unequivocal and enduring over the course of eons that to argue against it would be to
argue against it on the grounds of nothing less than superstition or bias so the question
is not a question of does heredity have something to do with the characteristics of organisms
obviously heredity has something to do with characteristics of organisms the question
rather is the extent to which a developed psychology a developed psychology of the person a developed
psychology of personality intellect moral standing social life social interaction into
personal influence into personal relations political life whether whether a psychology
capable of reaching these significant aspects of the human condition is particularly informed
by an hereditarian perspective whether social policies should be dictated to by a literature
on the heritability of intelligence personality and the like that's a rather different question
are genes important the answer to the question are genes important is yes the answer to the
question is the environment important is yes the answer to the question which is more important
is that's the wrong question and I shall make clear why that is the wrong question wrong
now we have a specialty within psychology but is referred to as behavior genetic analysis and
behavior genetic analysis has to do with studies of the relationship between highly
inbred strains of animals and their performance their behavioral performances in a variety of
settings it's of some interest to note for example that you can breed which is to say
selectively breed or inbreed quote maze bright close quote and quote maze dull close quote
strains of mice or rats that is if you expose a sample of rats to a maze and then you pick off
the best scoring males and females and make them that is those who solve the maze in the
fewest trials and make them and you keep this going for a number of generations you can actually
generate overlapping but quite disparate distribution of maze performances by genotype you can
actually come up with strains whose members are much more successful in solving mazes quickly
and in the fewest trials and other members that and another sample whose members have a hellish
time doing it in fact some of whose members can't do it at all now there's a temptation when one
sees findings like this of stepping back and saying there you know that that settles it well of
course that doesn't settle at least are important questions and I think I mentioned earlier in
an earlier lecture the important questions are those that should be answered with sentences
that end in a semicolon rather than an exclamation point there's there's always more to stories of
this kind have you genetically inbred certain heightened sensitivities a greater olfactory
sensibility have you in fact just to produce different strains with respect to levels of
arousal levels of activity have you produced strains that more desperately feel the pangs of
hunger and therefore work much harder to reach again so this this this can go on till planet
earth suffers the heat death the simple claim on the basis of these findings that what you've
bred for is intelligence is something that intelligent people probably would would be quite
skeptical on hearing now what about the most controversial findings in this field and these
are findings on the pertaining to the heritability of IQ and indeed the heritability of personality
are Paul meal a past president of the American Psychological Association in a famous address
of his said if you could know one thing about a person that would allow you to predict schizophrenia
with greater than chance accuracy what's the one thing you'd want to know are find a person who
has a schizophrenic identical twin and the point is what that that Paul meal wants to make is is
that schizophrenia displays high heritability we're going to have to get back to this notion of
heritability very soon but it has been known for a very long time that that as you diminish the
degree of genetic difference between samples as you as you reduce the overall degree of genetic
variability you tend to reduce the variance that a particular characteristic will display so for
example the heritability the heritability of height is calculated to be in excess of 0.95
actually what heritability is a is a statistical value that can range from 0 to 1.0 and when
you do heritability studies what you discover what you discover is this if a characteristic has
very high heritability then no matter what you do to the environment no matter how you manipulate
the environment the variance that that characteristic displays in a population remains relatively
constant note what I'm referring to as the variance if you imagine the distribution of scores to be
shaped like a bell the famous bell curve then the total area under that curve is the sumbed variance
of all of all the scores there their departures from the average value they fill out that space under
the bell curve and what you know is this if a characteristic has very high if it if these
measured heritability is very high then manipulating the environment doesn't significantly change the
shape of that curve but note this also although a high heritability means that an environmental
manipulation will not do much to change the variance of the bell curve it tells you nothing
about how an environmental manipulation might change the average value of that distribution
district now it's very very important to get clear the distinction between the average of a
distribution let's say that the average height of American males over 20 years old is five feet
nine let's say that all right I don't know what it is it's probably somewhere between five eight
and five five eleven something like that now that's its average now if you measured the height of all
American males over 20 and you plotted on the ordinate on the vertical line the percent of
height and on the horizontal line heights of a different range two feet three feet four feet five
feet six feet in the light the resulting distribution would be a bell curve it would be very much
like the theoretical normal distribution the average height would be five feet nine now if the
heritability of height is very high then the shape of that curve the spread of scores will not
change even if you change diet exercise patterns duty rest cycles high protein growth hormones and
all that the distribution will remain the same but of course you can shift the average value all
over the place in fact it's been calculated that the average height of Japanese males has increased
significantly since the second world war though height is highly heritable what hasn't changed
among Japanese males since the end of the second world war the variance of the height distribution
the average has been increased but the overall variance has remained the same now heritability
I don't want this to be overly technical heritability to a first approximation this might
be something you want to write down and listen to more than once you might want to write it down
and study it but if you were expressing heritability calculations as an equation heritability is
generally represented by the symbol lowercase h squared h squared equals and then the denominator
here is the total variance displayed by a distribution of scores you can symbolize that as
capital V sub t and the numerator in that equation would be capital V sub g where this is where this
represents the the variability of the genes in the breeding pool or in the pool being examined so
the question you want to answer then is this what heritability tells you is the fraction of the total
variance that's attributable to genetic variation in the sample being measured or to what more
technically is referred to as additive genetic factors this on the view that any given characteristic
is the result of some number of discrete Mendelian genes that contribute to the overall effect
additively so h square equals V sub g over V sub t and that that's a rather crude estimation of it
now now that that that measure of heritability is something that you take on an actual population
you can ask what the heritability is of yielding a lot of wool in a sample of sheep growing up on
various portions of of a thousand acre sheep farm you can ask about the heritability of redness
in tomatoes you can you can measure the you can measure the heritability of any measurable
characteristic you can determine the heritability of amount of money in savings accounts what you're
looking for is this as the genetic variation in the in the people you're actually studying as the
genetic variability diminishes what happens to the variance of a sample of savings account
amounts are in the population you might you might discover i think you probably would discover that
wealth has a way of staying in families and so wealth might display quite high heritability
shoe size might display quite high heritability the tendency to buy blue cars rather than green
cars you you can do these calculations for any measurable characteristic and therefore you
can do this for a characteristic like iq and the heritability of iq has been estimated to range
from depends on the study remember the heritability is something calculated from actual scores that
you have it's not some theoretical entity you you compute the heritability once you know the degree
of genetic relatedness and the range of scores or measures displayed by the sample of interest
now how do you know the degree of genetic relatedness in a human population well this is a bit of a
trick of course well you can take a look at pairs of identical twins because you know the
identical twins are genetically identical and you can compare that with fraternal twins who have 50
percent of their genes in common as siblings do you can compare offspring with parents and with
grandparents and with uncles and aunts if you get a large enough sample you can at least get a crude
estimate of the fraction of the total genes held in common by different pairings different combinations
within that sample and it has been shown in very very large sample studies that as the degree
of genetic similarity increases the degree of similarity in iq scores increases so there does
seem to be a basis it's not an unarguable basis and in other contexts i've made quite
strong arguments against it but there's some basis upon which to suggest that it does make
sense to compute the heritability of iq studies that do this i say get values ranging from 0.5
or 6 up to 0.9 and and higher studies also show that the average black iq is lower than the average
white iq and of course you've got to put black and white in quotes you're not dealing with the
pea plants and genetically pure strains and the like you know of course that during three four
hundred years of slavery in the united states all of the black women slaves routinely assaulted
their white masters and i guess that's the story according to some do you see and so there's been
a fair amount of genetic mixing here which is to say that the sexual exploitation of the female
population more or less guarantees that within the american experience the idea that you can
compute heritability for something called a black race is at once laughable and deplorable
what are we to say about the average differences between the races on iq scores coupled with
the high heritability displayed by iq the answer to that question is probably nothing
and for this reason as the average of a phenotype is not predicted by heritability that is if you
knew that the heritability of iq were 1.0 and the question is how might a program of environmental
enrichment alter the average iq your answer would have to be i don't know what you would know is
this an environmental manipulation would not significantly affect the variance of that distribution
all bets are off as to what it might do to the average the heritability of iq in trisaphala in
the fruit fly is for all practical purposes 1.0 the average iq achieved by a sample of trisaphala
is a function of the altitude at which they are reared two eyes is a common feature of almost
all forms of fish there are species of fish that develop as cyclopses if they're if they're reared
in a permanganate solution the heritability of binocular vision for all practical purposes is 1.0
but whether you get it depends what the average effect will be depends on the environmental
medium in which these genetic predispositions operate so again and again and again to know the
heritability of a characteristic is to know nothing about how an environmental manipulation
might affect its average value now the only way that blacks and whites differ and and other groups
of Asian groups and the like they differ in in in average iq's and so the question then
could this be changed through the right kind of environmental manipulation is not to be answered
no because it's highly heritable from the fact that it's highly heritable nothing follows as to
whether or not the average value can be changed a very controversial article appeared in 1969 70
how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement by Arthur Jensen on which the
hernstein murray book depends considerably and the answer jensen served up was projects like
head start are doomed to fail because iq is highly heritable black average iq's are lower than
white average iq's you don't change a genotype by throwing money at it and in this there was of
course just a profound mistake from the high heritability of iq nothing follows as to whether
or not a program like head start will improve the average iq or the average academic performance of
those participating not to mention the fact that our school should be made as good as we can because
we oblige our children to attend them they're not there so that their sat scores will go up
they're there to become citizens in a world ready to receive them and what their iq is probably
turns out to be much less consequential than their sense of civic duty
