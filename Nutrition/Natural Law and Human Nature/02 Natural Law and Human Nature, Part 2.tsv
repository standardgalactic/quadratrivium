0	20000	Lecture 15 Natural Law and the Founding Fathers
20000	27000	So far we have been pursuing the theory of natural law as it has been evident on the continent of Europe.
27000	44000	But in this lecture I'd like to turn here to America, for the theory of natural law has played a very interesting role in the thought of our founding fathers as they created this very interesting experiment in representative democracy upon these shores.
44000	58000	Our founding fathers knew of the theory of natural law, and not only from John Locke whom we were discussing in the last lecture, but also from the use of natural law in the long tradition of English jurisprudence.
59000	68000	Our Declaration of Independence, for instance, cites at one point nature and nature's God, and then proceeds to an enumeration of various natural rights.
68000	83000	Likewise, the U.S. Constitution bears some of the signature marks of natural law theory, as well as its own Bill of Rights where there are a specific enumeration of the rights that John Locke himself would have talked about in his theory of natural law.
83000	103000	In addition, one finds natural law theory evident in the Constitution and in its subsequent history, where we have given to the Constitution such a supreme role in the notion of law as it's understood here, not just because it has been something that gained the consent of the people in the states,
103000	114000	but I think out of that natural law recognition that this Constitution in certain important ways embodies the eternal and immutable principles of natural justice.
114000	123000	What I'd like to do in this lecture then is to focus for a few minutes on some of the direct sources of natural law theory as our founding fathers knew them,
123000	135000	and then, secondly, turn briefly to the Declaration of Independence and then for a slightly longer period to consider our Constitution and a bit of the development of constitutional ideas in this country.
135000	156000	First, the Declaration of Independence and its sources. It was written by Thomas Jefferson and then adopted by the Second Continental Congress, and that Declaration of Independence relies very much on one specific version of natural law, namely the theory of natural law as articulated by John Locke.
156000	170000	Not only because of the way in which the natural rights claims are enumerated in our Constitution, but also because of a very specific natural right which John Locke had talked about and which we were discussing at the end of the last lecture,
170000	179000	namely the natural right of a people to rebel when there is no other way to redress violations of that people's other natural rights.
180000	190000	I point out, though, that in commenting and saying that John Locke's theory is so influential for the Declaration and for the Constitution, that this is one version of natural law.
190000	204000	And as we have seen earlier on in this course, there have been some other very strong versions, in particular the one championed by the Stoics at the end of antiquity, and then the one developed by Thomas Aquinas at the height of the Middle Ages.
205000	217000	When I try to think about natural law and its history and try to locate the American founding fathers within that tradition, I think it's helpful to think about this as being yet one more species in a much larger genus.
217000	231000	It's clearly recognizably the same sort of animal, but there's also something particular and distinctive about it, and what I think is so particular and distinctive about the American version and puts it squarely in the camp of John Locke
231000	243000	is its emphasis upon natural rights, and when you see that tradition, you can, I think, be fairly secure in saying that this is one species, but a different species of the larger theory of natural law.
243000	247000	Now, what were the sources of our founding fathers?
247000	259000	Besides Locke, whom they had read in his second treatise on government, there are also a number of British jurists who are extremely important to understanding the American use of natural law theory.
259000	276000	In particular, the British jurists, Edward Cook and William Blackstone, they discuss at some length in their various commentaries on British common law the possibility of having the judiciary enforce certain natural law limits on legislation.
277000	294000	That is, they don't have anywhere nearly the activist jurisprudence that later emerged at points in our constitutional history, but they certainly raise the prospect and the possibility of having the jurists have having jurisprudential limits on legislation.
294000	304000	In doing so, what we find in the course of their writings are particular claims about natural law, which our American founding fathers knew.
304000	317000	Always, I think we should balance these British jurists with the theory of John Locke, and from John Locke, we see in the Declaration of Independence and in other writings, references to a set of inalienable natural rights.
317000	331000	As our constitution has it, a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and we hear there, I think, the echoes of John Locke who spoke of the natural rights of life, liberty, and property.
331000	341000	Now, it's interesting when we hear that language from Locke and echoed in these other writers of British jurisprudence, it's interesting to think about that term inalienable for a minute.
341000	355000	Inalienable is one way in which to talk about these rights as natural, that is, they come to us not by virtue of a gift of the community, they come to us not by virtue of law or legislation itself,
355000	365000	they come to us not because of power, they come to us not because of a claim we're making. The claim of an inalienable right, it is that it is inalienable.
365000	375000	That is, it is something that cannot be taken away from us by force of power or by legislation, nor is it something that we can voluntarily surrender.
376000	385000	And when one thinks through that claim of these rights of being inalienable, one will see how deeply steeped we are in the tradition of nature.
385000	397000	What are we to make of that difference between the Locke and formulation, life, liberty, and property, as opposed to Jefferson's formulation, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?
397000	410000	It may be that the difference is simply rhetorical, that Jefferson thought that he could gain a greater sway and find a formulation that would be more easily acceptable to those who were property owners and to those who were not.
410000	416000	On the other hand, it could also be that Jefferson is making some particular significant statement in the matter.
417000	428000	And so we look elsewhere in the writings of Jefferson and look in terms of who he's quoting to see what he may have meant by choosing happiness rather than property.
429000	438000	One finds, for instance, that before the Continental Congress had convened, and when Jefferson was still thinking about the language he was intending to propose,
438000	447000	that he didn't discuss that these rights in terms of inalienability, rather he spoke of them as being sacred and inviolable,
447000	460000	and then later turned to the notion of an alienable as well as chose the language of happiness, perhaps echoing even the Aristotelian tradition and its strong sense of happiness as a natural end of human species.
460000	470000	And when one looks at those jurists, for instance, Sir Edward Cook, one is going further back in history and seeing some of the sources that were well known to these American jurists.
470000	475000	Edward Cook's book is called The Institutes and then later The Reports.
475000	482000	It's a very standard work on British law and was very prominent until the publication of Blackstone's own commentaries.
482000	490000	In particular, two cases come up again and again when American founding fathers are reading their Cook.
490000	494000	One is called Calvin's case that comes from the year 1608.
494000	498000	And just to read an important line from that tradition, it says,
498000	505000	The law of nature cannot be changed or taken away and, quote, should direct this case.
505000	513000	Another case that he cites and which our American founding fathers read up and talk about in their own literature is Bonham's case from 1609.
513000	524000	This is a very interesting case about the practice of law within the city limits of London and whether the equivalent of the British Medical Association at that period had to license a doctor
524000	528000	and whether there could be a law against practicing medicine without a license.
528000	539000	And in deciding in favor of the doctor and against the claim that there could be a law preventing the practice of medicine without a license, the case was decided on this principle.
539000	546000	The common law will control the acts of parliament and sometimes a judge them to be utterly void.
546000	552000	Now this is important because it's a sense that there is a higher law than statute law.
552000	560000	A sense of natural right and natural wrong, something that is recognized by the common law and is in fact the basis of the common law.
560000	569000	And for a person like Edward Cook to cite it and then American jurist to cite him is a recognition that they're thinking in terms of this higher law tradition.
569000	575000	A little later on Sir William Blackstone wrote a book called Commentaries on the Laws of England.
575000	587000	It's published in 1765 and when one thinks of the dates, this is a new hot ticket, a best seller in legal circles in the time just before our American Revolution.
587000	596000	And one finds in Blackstone both an advertence to natural law as well as a sense of the utter and absolute supremacy of parliament.
596000	611000	Now those are irreconcilable positions and sometimes in I think in lawyers' minds, it's okay that you have irreconcilable traditions and that the jurist will assent to one or the other of these traditions as they need in the pragmatic order.
611000	627000	One finds in Blackstone both traditions. For example, at one point he says, this law of nature, being co-evil with mankind and dictated by God himself, is superior in obligation to all others.
627000	632000	No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this.
632000	648000	Now again, that's a very strong natural law assertion and Blackstone is citing it and our American founding fathers at the time of the Revolution like to cite this precisely because it was a sense that the British laws which they thought were unfair and further complication,
648000	666000	the lack of any representation that they had before the British parliament now gave them under Lockean rules a set of a right to revolution precisely because the higher law was not being observed and in fact the laws made by parliament were directly against their own natural rights.
666000	694000	On the other hand, one also finds in Blackstone a strong sense that the law of parliament is absolute and that it may make laws on any subject whatsoever. Here I think one hears in Blackstone and in this tradition of British jurisprudence, one hears the echo of the enormous importance which British law has always accorded to the Magna Carta and to the restraint of the powers of the king by increasing the powers of the legislature.
694000	711000	And hence since they don't ever want to go back to a power of the king which surpassed the legislature, they end up asserting the absolute supremacy of the legislature, hoping I think with good British optimism that the legislature will behave itself and will observe the natural law and hence that there will be no conflict.
711000	721000	But in fact, there is no intrinsic resolution to this conflict within their system and you simply have principles which are at the furthest extreme incompatible.
721000	737000	What might Blackstone have meant when he's thinking about this natural law or higher law tradition? This is hard to say because Blackstone is enough of a philosopher to be quoting Stoic authors at various points and quoting Aristotle.
737000	763000	And yet to be given this tradition of the happiness which Jefferson eventually includes replacing the language of law, namely the natural rights of life, liberty and property, replacing that with terminology about the natural rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, one finds in Blackstone the frequent use and reference to happiness as being a natural end of humankind.
763000	782000	On the other hand, when he does so, and one reads a relatively, I don't have a quotation, but the relatively voluminous part of his works on that, one finds that he has emptied happiness out of any particular Aristotelian context where there is a natural end for humankind and he's emptied it of any theological sense.
782000	795000	It's not that there's a happiness in the next world for which this life is a preparation. There is rather a much stronger sense in Blackstone that this is personal happiness. It's the happiness that comes from doing as we will, from doing as one likes.
795000	803000	Hence, there's just a bit of a range of possibilities there in Blackstone that one can interpret these passages in either way.
803000	814000	Jefferson does pick up on the language and takes a very high moral note when he sounds the theme of an inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
814000	830000	Interestingly, Blackstone does envision some strong limits on the rights of property. When one thinks, for instance, of property rights in this country, one of the places where property rights come to be curtailed is in the practice of eminent domain,
830000	838000	when a government may take land, for instance, for a highway or for some other government institution where they need a given person's land.
838000	855000	And Blackstone is one who justifies the practice of eminent domain so long as proper compensation is paid, and he does so on an interesting natural law line of reasoning, namely that the consent of the property holder has been given to the government if the government is legitimate.
855000	870000	Even if the consent has only been given by one's representative to the legislature. So Blackstone is trying again to balance these things and I think comes up ultimately with a natural law kind of reasoning to justify a limit on property.
870000	875000	And I think this was probably fairly influential for Mr. Jefferson.
875000	887000	Now, when we turn to the text of the declaration itself, one finds their natural law language, especially in the opening phrases with the reference to nature and nature's God.
887000	902000	And one of the great questions, of course, that has come to scholars about our American Declaration of Independence concerns whether this is, for instance, the God of Christianity, or is this perhaps just a very vague deist vision of God.
902000	914000	I won't try to settle that question here since our project is largely to consider natural law, and hence I find it simply interesting that we have a reference to nature first and then to the God of nature.
914000	919000	This allows the notion of a creator, but it doesn't particularly specify which theory.
919000	932000	My own view on the matter is that Jefferson recognized that America, the American colonies at this time, were a relatively religious set of communities, but that there was a variety in American religion.
932000	942000	That it ranged across quite a considerable range of Christianity, and I think that what he was doing was looking simply for the most acceptable possible language.
942000	951000	What would draw in as many of the colonists to the revolution which was now being declared, and so we have a relatively generic approach.
951000	963000	And interestingly, natural law allows that common basis, and this has always been one of natural law strengths, namely that it doesn't claim particularly to have any one ecclesial backing,
963000	976000	but rather is something that is accessible to any person who have open mind and reasonable inclination to see that there is a God who ought to be worshiped and to see that there is a nature within us,
976000	984000	which is the source of various moral obligations, including obligations of a political nature as well as rights of a political nature.
985000	993000	On this subject, I'd like in particular to recommend a very, very wonderful volume by Edward Corwin, written earlier in this century.
993000	1010000	Corwin's volume is entitled the Higher Law Background of American Constitutional Law, and he gives a wonderful account of the Declaration as well as of the U.S. Constitution in terms of some of the natural law concepts that are found in the Declaration of Independence.
1010000	1026000	What one sees in that Declaration is a tremendous assertion of natural rights, rights which the American colonists thought to have been historically theirs on their basis of being Englishmen, as well as on their basis of simply being human.
1026000	1041000	That is that they balance the notion of the common law of England and the natural law precisely in order to stress the legitimacy of their claim and the illegitimacy of legislative control, of legislative activity without the consent of the governed,
1041000	1045000	and that is the situation in which they find themselves.
1046000	1066000	One interesting question, though, that comes out is how about slavery? On natural law grounds, as we saw a lecture or two ago, there was, at least in Baroque scholasticism, among some of those Dominican and Jesuit authors of the 16th and 17th centuries, a readiness to condemn slavery as against the natural law.
1066000	1085000	Jefferson's first draft of the Declaration actually does condemn slavery, and this is very interesting given that Jefferson himself was a slave holder. Perhaps it was a recognition in his own part, on his own mind, that slavery was a violation of the natural right to freedom and liberty.
1085000	1105000	But the passage got removed by the Second Continental Congress, presumably out of a desire not to weaken the cause of independence by alienating slave owners. In a way, this shows the problem with legislation by committee and a strong sense of the difficulties that come when one is forced to compromise on moral principle.
1106000	1121000	When one makes a compromise, especially of this magnitude, one may be simply building in conflict later, as we saw in the history of our republic, with the war that was eventually fought on that subject, among other reasons for the Civil War.
1121000	1136000	Jefferson may well have had a stronger sense of this, but was unable to maintain his position in the Congress, and at one point, in the course of his letters, he tells us that the fact of slavery in his country haunted him, quote, like a fire bell in the night.
1136000	1149000	Indeed, he says, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and that his justice will not rest forever. A strong sense, I think, in Jefferson of his trouble over that particular issue.
1149000	1172000	Let me turn now to the Constitution of the U.S., for it, too, reflects a number of important natural law concepts. But in addition to the fact that there is explicit reference to some of these concepts in our Constitution, I'd also like to keep our minds focused on the fact that the Constitution enjoys such a tremendous supremacy, such a tremendous high regard,
1172000	1192000	and ask the question about whether this is out of simply a social contract devotion to a document that we've agreed on, or, as I would rather suggest, not only that, but also that this supremacy rests on the fact that the Constitution embodies principles of natural justice.
1192000	1207000	And I would want to contend that that is actually the more important and significant factor. When one is looking at any country's basic law, whether it be in the form of a written Constitution such as ours is, or an unwritten Constitution such as England has,
1207000	1227000	whether one is looking at a code, for instance, as was long the case in France, or is still the case in Louisiana, one finds a basic, a fundamental nature to this law. But one can always ask about that country's history and to see, does that basic law have a really high regard?
1227000	1246000	Is it something that is venerated? And in our country, I think the answer to that is yes, it clearly does. As one reads the history of jurisprudence over our 220-some years, especially in the first 80 years, it had a regard that was tantamount to being sacred.
1246000	1261000	I think that after that first period of 80-some years, I think you see the language of jurists being tempered much more, and especially as you see activist courts emerge, then there's a much stronger sense that we need to adapt to this document to new conditions.
1261000	1268000	Now, whether that's a good idea or a bad idea, it's a change in any case in the original understanding of it.
1268000	1281000	Let's consider for a moment the opening lines of the Constitution, and near the beginning, one finds the language that this Constitution has been ordained by the people of the United States.
1281000	1294000	Now, that can be read in an entirely voluntary sense. And as we were stressing a couple of lectures ago, in the history of the tradition of law and thinking about law, there are intellectual strands and voluntary strands.
1294000	1303000	That is, law might be right because it embodies what reason directs us for the common good, the reason of God, the reason of the human legislator.
1303000	1313000	Or it can be voluntarist. Law can be law because chosen by God, or chosen by the people, or chosen by the legislatures as an act of strength and will.
1313000	1332000	This language, near the beginning of our Constitution, ordained by the people of the United States, can of course be read in an entirely voluntarist sense, as if the law were simply an expression of the commands of the human lawgiver and an expression of the will of the people,
1332000	1335000	the highest possible source for legitimacy and autonomy.
1336000	1350000	Especially in the tradition of law and of Montesquieu, I think you have a sense that the voluntarist tradition is strong here, namely that societies are organized by a social contract when people in a state of nature come together.
1350000	1365000	In the other and older traditions of natural law that we were considering, even states and governments and societies have a nature, the form of it may be devised by human institution, but it's an entity with a nature in its own right.
1365000	1375000	So one way of reading this is to say that this is a commitment to the voluntarist sense of the legitimacy and authority of our government and of our Constitution.
1375000	1388000	But I would submit to you that the claim that the real supremacy and legitimacy of the U.S. Constitution as coming solely from its rootedness and popular will is a theory of more recent origin.
1388000	1404000	It's a theory, I think, that is subsequent to the American Civil War and much more prominent in our recent jurisprudence, and I think it's forgetful of the higher law background from Cook and Blackstone and the tradition that is antecedent to John Locke.
1404000	1410000	Because I think that higher law background was operative for the founders of the American Republic.
1410000	1424000	For our American founders, the supremacy of a Constitution, and I think the reason why they wrote a Constitution rather than simply rest upon an unwritten Constitution such as England had,
1424000	1429000	the supremacy of a Constitution comes precisely from its content.
1429000	1443000	That is, from the way in which a given Constitution, and they had many from which they could have chosen, the way in which a given Constitution embodies in so many words the essential and unchanging demands of justice.
1443000	1453000	And then what the people do when they choose the Constitution is give witness to how good a job that Constitution does in embodying the principles of justice.
1453000	1468000	And so I would maintain that that phrase from the opening of the Constitution, ordained by the people of the United States, is not so much direct social contract language as fundamental affirmation that we believe that the Constitution, which was written,
1468000	1481000	does embody these principles of natural justice and the longstanding and older tradition of the natural law, and especially when one reads the Federalist papers, one sees them making these philosophical arguments all the time.
1481000	1497000	Among the natural law concepts that are most prominent in the Constitution and in subsequent constitutional history are the following four, namely, the superiority of the rule of law to rule by power, secondly, the practice of judicial review,
1497000	1506000	thirdly, the separation of powers, and fourth, the assertion of fundamental human equality. Let me discuss each of those in turn.
1506000	1525000	The rule of law, in contrast to any volunteerist assumptions about government and society, assumptions which inevitably lead to rule by power and by the strongest power, the American Constitution outlines a program for rule by law.
1525000	1543000	And it's a program for rule by law, where law is always superior to political party or political power. It's a program that depends upon an intellectual appreciation of the greater likelihood of natural justice and objective fairness when all parties
1543000	1558000	know in advance how the law is going to treat them. That is, it's a sense that there's going to be a tremendous fair play here precisely because we will respect rule of law at all costs and not be changing the rules of the game when another party enters into power.
1558000	1574000	And insofar as one thinks that the founders of our country in establishing this system of government envisioned plural parties which could operate even when power shifts occurred by fundamental rules of law rather than by a fundamental rule by power,
1574000	1592000	this is a sense that intellectual appreciation of the demands of justice is what is envisioned by those founding fathers. And I think that it's very, very strong for how we conduct all the public business as well as the public restrictions and public regulation of private enterprises.
1592000	1611000	Secondly, the notion of judicial review. I've called attention to this a number of times in our lectures. This is the power of some branch of government, the judiciary, to supervise legislation, to supervise another branch of government, and then to nullify anything that is inconsistent with the Constitution.
1612000	1630000	Now, some people would say that that power of judicial review simply rests upon the assertion of various justices in our history. In fact, the matter is, it is nowhere explicitly stated in the Constitution, nor did any court in England explicitly have the power.
1630000	1642000	We saw in the quotations I read earlier in this lecture that Blackstone and Cook had envisioned such a role, but no one court in England had the role which the U.S. Supreme Court eventually took to itself.
1642000	1655000	Rather, the practice of judicial review was inaugurated by Chief Justice John Marshall, and the case that is rightly associated with the beginning of that practice is the 1803 decision in Marbury versus Madison.
1655000	1669000	Even though the power of judicial review is not explicitly bestowed by the founders, nonetheless, I think you can make the argument that the power of judicial review flows from the nature of the judicial office.
1669000	1683000	In England, I think that it was too often blurred with the notion of judicial legislation. But here, when they had separated the powers of government more strictly, this power has to belong to somebody if there's going to be an appropriate check and balance.
1683000	1695000	And the alternative would be to say that only the executive checks the legislature by choosing what to enforce and checks the judiciary by appointing the powers of the judiciary itself.
1695000	1701000	This is an assertion by John Marshall, which I suspect flows simply from the nature of the judiciary.
1701000	1709000	Now, in the course of our history, there have been various interpretations of how strong the power of judicial review should be.
1709000	1721000	Many of the justices over the course of history have restricted themselves for testing whether statutory and administrative law, strictly speaking, conforms to the Constitution.
1721000	1730000	So it's a purely formal test, and they don't employ any natural law standard over and above the formal test of does this conform to the U.S. Constitution.
1730000	1743000	It's on that basis, I suspect, that something like Red Scott was decided, where they refused to invoke a natural law standard and simply asked, does this law or does this law not conform to the U.S. Constitution?
1743000	1758000	As such, this is in accord with the spirit of Blackstone, who I think was very much anxious that the courts would simply find a law which was in discrepancy with the Constitution and then take it back to the legislatures to correct it.
1758000	1768000	And so a much weaker sense of judicial review simply has the court in the role of identifying what is, in some way, inconsistent, but leaving the legislature to be the legislature.
1768000	1783000	In other periods, jurists have assumed a much closer relation between the Constitution and natural law and have been much more willing to be activists in uprooting legislation that they thought in some way violated the law.
1783000	1787000	The civil rights legislation of this century isn't a great example of that.
1787000	1795000	The third and fourth matters where our Constitution reflects natural law. Third is the separation of powers into the distinct branches of government.
1795000	1802000	This is indeed a new political idea. It's not something I think that any government had ever managed before our experiment.
1802000	1817000	And yet the justification for so separating those powers comes with a sense that justice requires it and that this particular device will give us a better chance at keeping justice and avoiding rule by power.
1817000	1834000	So the natural law sense of this is simply because natural law demands that there be justice, we need to devise some appropriate remedy so as more likely to ensure the actual conduct of the various powers of government because power does tend to increase.
1834000	1842000	Finally, there's the sense of inalienable rights and we'll have occasion to discuss those as we turn to some other moral problems in the later part of these lectures.
1842000	1861000	Here I simply noticed that even the Bill of Rights beyond stipulating a number of personal and state rights also in the Ninth Amendment goes on to say the enumeration of certain rights in this Constitution shall not prejudice other rights so enumerated and a strong sense that there's a vigorous natural rights tradition here.
1861000	1865000	We'll turn to further moral subjects in following lectures.
1873000	1887000	Lecture 16, Descartes, Rousseau and Kant
1887000	1915000	In the last lecture we were considering the fortunes of natural law theory here upon American shores. In this 16th lecture I'd like to return to Europe and return to somewhat more technical philosophy precisely in order to investigate for just a bit the fortunes of natural law within the tradition of philosophy more formally speaking
1915000	1935000	because there is much in the history of modern European philosophy that cast doubt upon the entire project of natural law in any of its forms, whether in the form of the Stoics or the form of Thomas Aquinas or the form of Locke that found establishment and institutionalization here in the American Republic.
1935000	1948000	In the European philosophy of the early modern period there are various trends which are antithetical to the whole project of natural law, in particular the mechanization of the world picture.
1948000	1971000	We saw earlier on in our study of natural law that one of the most important concepts was the notion of teleology or end directedness, an inbuilt end within our nature, something that we didn't decide upon but that was already there and there was the pattern for our development and was a natural goal for the individual and the family and whole culture.
1971000	1996000	But the mechanization of the world picture that is that tendency in modern science and modern technology to reduce all kinds of causes to efficient causality to the way in which human agency is able to structure and restructure things drives out the notion of final causality or end directedness and that is antithetical to any form of natural law.
1996000	2006000	I'd like to discuss in the course of this lecture some of the philosophers who are very prominent in that tradition of mechanization and then the ethical implications of it.
2006000	2024000	I'll begin with a short discussion about Descartes and the change that happens in modern philosophy and then for a greater length of time I'd like to focus on Rousseau and on Emmanuel Kant who were extremely influential for thinking about ethics and about human freedom and about political organization
2024000	2036000	and who do so in ways that change natural law certainly perhaps make it impossible or if they make it possible at all make it possible only under a very, very different rubric.
2036000	2038000	Let's begin however with Descartes.
2038000	2051000	As we were saying, the notion that was typical of causality in say Aristotelian philosophy or in much of the realist philosophy of the Middle Ages was a notion of causality that was differentiated.
2051000	2059000	There are the internal causes of matter and form that is the structure and the stuff that makes up anything whatsoever in the universe.
2059000	2064000	Anything has a certain basic matter and it has a certain form that that matter has.
2064000	2069000	These aren't two things but rather they're co-principals, structure and stuff.
2069000	2079000	In addition causality refers to the agent, the efficient cause, the person or the object which is imposing a new structure on stuff.
2079000	2086000	And finally and most importantly for natural law theory there's the notion of final causality, the sense of a goal or a purpose.
2086000	2094000	It's something that's so obvious within say human artistry and human invention when we have our purposes, we have our goals.
2094000	2105000	The claim of Aristotelian philosophy is that in addition to our imposed goals or our imposed purposes there are also natural goals or natural purposes.
2105000	2112000	The things that one can see when for instance acorns only grow up into oak trees and never into dandelions or pear trees.
2112000	2118000	Or the fact that tadpoles always grow up into frogs and never into any other kind of creature.
2118000	2131000	So too it was argued the human being from the time of conception through the time of natural growth has as at least one natural goal developing into the complete adult mature human.
2131000	2136000	Things can go wrong, diseases can interfere, there can be actions by other human beings.
2136000	2145000	But that these effects upon our natural programming are extraneous and that there is at least a natural end that should be provided.
2145000	2152000	Some figures would be quite willing to say that there's an end that transcends our life in this world, a supernatural happiness.
2152000	2159000	But that even if one is confined to this world there's a sort of a natural happiness for which we are well designed.
2159000	2167000	In the course of modern European philosophy one finds all of this brought into doubt by the mechanization of the world picture.
2167000	2173000	Mechanics and the mechanization of science means the elimination of final causality.
2173000	2185000	A sense that what we'd explain when we explain something in natural science is explaining its mechanics, its matter, form and efficient cause and that we rid ourselves of the notion of final causality.
2185000	2193000	The philosopher who I think is best representative of that tradition is Rene Descartes, in many ways the founder of modern philosophy.
2193000	2214000	And one finds that very quickly in Descartes all of the Baroque scholasticism that we were discussing with those especially the Dominican thinkers who had opposed slavery of the Indians on the basis of natural law that all of this Baroque scholasticism is gone precisely because he so compartmentalizes the theoretical sphere
2214000	2228000	and the practical sphere. The theoretical sphere now has to be handled in these instrumental and mechanical terms. The practical sphere will be what we decide upon, not what we in any way find as rooted in nature.
2228000	2243000	In the course of doing so there's a great division between all of ethics and all the rest of philosophy and if you divide ethics from the rest of philosophy you can no longer use nature which is a category of metaphysics in your ethics.
2243000	2261000	So what for Descartes and the rest of the tradition of modern philosophy, this strong separation is invoked and it will mean that if we're going to have any objectivity, any universality, any intelligibility, those three strong characteristics of any ethical theory,
2261000	2270000	if we're going to have intelligibility, universality and objectivity we're going to have to get them from a different source other than nature.
2270000	2283000	One of the thinkers who I think follows up the ideas of Descartes and wants to find a new way to establish objectivity and universality is the figure Jean-Jacques Rousseau, figure of the 18th century.
2283000	2303000	He is very strongly opposed to natural law in any form of a deductive system. He wants no part of the notion of deducing natural law obligations or for that matter natural rights either from the historical state of how things have come to be or from some primeval state of nature.
2303000	2316000	Rather, he is very, very strongly interested in the course of his works on talking about human autonomy and human freedom. So he will still use the categories of human nature, but it can't be used to found a system on any natural law.
2316000	2332000	Jean-Jacques Rousseau is a very difficult figure I think to understand, primarily because so many of his works involve constantly a retelling of his biography, except that every time he retells the biography one finds it's a slightly different biography and we practically got a new individual.
2332000	2353000	But in his most prominent political work where one sees some elements of that biography combined with a lot of interesting philosophizing, in his book The Social Contract he deliberately and thematically attacks the notion that it is possible by reason, the thing that was so useful for all of the natural law thinking we've been considering,
2353000	2374000	it was impossible for reason to learn the principles of natural law by reflecting on the state of nature or by reflecting on the law of nations, what is common to the law of so many different cultures or what is found in a given constitution trying to analyze human nature and what anthropology requires.
2374000	2393000	In fact there's even a strong suspicion against civilization as corruptive and corrosive. He attacks all the intellectual traditions that are in natural law, he attacks Roman theorists as well as some modern figures whom he considered to be unfairly and inappropriately
2393000	2408000	representing those Roman theories. By name he attacks Grosius and Hobbes whom we considered about three lectures ago and in particular what he's suspicious about in them is their justifications of slavery.
2408000	2424000	He finds himself torn agreeing with Rousseau because slavery is so inimical to what human nature demands and yet also finding him attacking the claim that by an intellectual pattern, that by an intellectual process one can reason to this conclusion.
2424000	2439000	Well you say, if he doesn't think that reason can get us to natural law, how does he think we should get there? One finds in a book like Emil from 1762 that Rousseau argues that the real way to get to it is by our feelings.
2439000	2457000	He suggests in Emil that the vicar of Savoy is a good standard for this and at one point he has the vicar of Savoy praising, quote, the inner light of conscience whose judgments are not judgments, excuse me, whose commands are not judgments but feelings.
2457000	2468000	Likewise in Rousseau's book The Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, that complaint about civil society and civilization as he knew it, it's a 1754 volume.
2468000	2483000	Rousseau very openly defends an emotive view of morality, that it requires that we stress human feeling, sometimes human sympathy with other humans, or at least our sense of feeling, of what we feel is right about a situation, what we feel is wrong.
2484000	2500000	Technically speaking in philosophy this is an intuitionist approach. It's a sense we may not be able to provide the reasons which will convince anybody else, but for ourselves the ultimate basis for our assertions, the basis for our confidence is our intuition about a situation.
2500000	2507000	Hence it's emotivist because it's dependent upon feeling and the justification is intuitionist, either you see it or you don't.
2508000	2525000	Now Rousseau does treat human nature and so he's still the philosopher, you can take I suppose the philosopher out of philosophy but you can't take philosophy out of him, and he does treat human nature considering topics like true feelings of the heart, pity and altruism,
2525000	2537000	and he urges that these true feelings, these reliable feelings, can be a useful guide for learning the fundamental principles of morality and the fundamental principles of politics.
2538000	2556000	He doesn't think that reason can do this and he again stresses his opposition to an intellectual theory of natural law, but he strongly advocates that our better and nobler feelings, feelings such as the primitive might have, the noble savage, the true innocent who has yet been uncorrupted by civilization,
2556000	2570000	that these true primitive, original, noble, savage like feelings can help us discover our true nature as free individuals living according to laws that we impose upon ourselves.
2570000	2589000	So there you see I think the real clarion call of Enlightenment thinking, a sense that what are we primarily, we are primarily free individuals who have to trust something in ourselves, that which is deepest in us, our feelings, and that when we create something in a social contract,
2589000	2599000	when we create a set of laws, we had better do it in ways that are somehow fundamentally conforming with these deepest and truest and noblest part of ourselves.
2599000	2616000	Hence his theory will be something we'll try to cultivate freedom as much as possible and yet acknowledge the fact that sometimes we must make these social contracts corrosive as they can tend to be if they can provide us some of the benefits and some of the advantages that we so desire.
2616000	2634000	Curiously in Rousseau's writings, especially in his book Social Contract, but also in that discourse on the origin of inequality, he uses some of the very same language that John Locke and Samuel Pufendorf had employed, the state of nature for instance, or the very term social contract.
2635000	2651000	But he uses those terms for vastly different purpose. The chief emotions of someone in the state of nature for Rousseau are pity and self-love, and these he thinks flow from a spontaneous natural goodness.
2651000	2661000	One sees this coming up frequently enough in our own contemporary discourse from some ethical quarters who want to suggest the things that are most basic to us ethically are our feelings.
2661000	2671000	One sees I think in Rousseau a fundamental root of this notion that there's a spontaneous natural goodness. If only we would let it emerge and trust that that will occur.
2672000	2686000	One sees of course how very vastly different this is from that long Christian tradition that we had been examining a few lectures ago, a sense of original sin, a sense of the defects of our natures, a sense of the way in which there's still a basic goodness, yes,
2686000	2697000	but that too much of our problem is precisely that our loves get badly ordered, and hence this is the thing which is not in principle recoverable except with the aid of grace.
2697000	2703000	Rousseau would insist this is the very thing that needs to be recovered and the one thing that is trustworthy.
2703000	2714000	Virtually all of Rousseau's writings are about education in one way or another, programs of education, and in this way I think he resembles Plato than almost all the other modern philosophers.
2714000	2732000	But in the course of writing about education, what it is that I think that he emphasizes is that we need education in social relationships in such a way that these spontaneous natural goodness can emerge, that we need habituations of spontaneity.
2732000	2739000	It's a curious paradox, but we need to find ways in which people can be themselves, then it will all work out.
2739000	2761000	Civilizations, however, are something to be feared. They can corrupt individuals as much as they can improve them, and so much of Rousseau's literary energies go into proposing specific ways that we can try to retain all the advantages that government and culture bring us while rooting out some of those evils that have come in in the course of history,
2761000	2779000	inequality, self-deception, and exploitation. In short, I think Rousseau is trying to cultivate the sort of life that is possible in society and at the same time maximize the original freedom of the state of nature prior to society and prior to the introduction of government.
2779000	2787000	It's a desire to have the advantages without the cost. One can see why he wants to do this, and I can't complain about that.
2787000	2804000	But the preferred way for doing this, the preferred way for reducing the tensions between all of those constraints which live life in civil society require of us and the natural freedom that was ours in the state of nature and that he would like to recover,
2804000	2817000	For him, the way to do this is the social contract. Again, I point out the way in which this is now changing for very deliberate purpose. This is changing the understanding of a society or of a government.
2817000	2829000	It's a way in which I think many modern people understand the matter, as Rousseau does, that society and government come about and have a legitimacy only because of human convention and human invention.
2829000	2838000	Whereas an older theory, and the natural law theory that we have been studying most of this course, viewed even government and society as having a nature.
2838000	2848000	And they could say that admitting that the particular forms that government or society take will be matters in which human creativity and human intelligence have intervened.
2848000	2858000	And yet they intervene to produce some forms of government and some forms of society which will be more helpful in administering natural justice and natural need.
2858000	2866000	For Rousseau, I think there is a sense that social contract is precisely that. It is a contract and as such a human invention.
2866000	2883000	Rousseau envisions the social contract as the surrender that everyone makes to the general will, quote unquote, by which impartial laws for the common good will be made by the participation in everyone in a directly democratic process.
2883000	2891000	That is, I think he's suspicious of representatives and representative government. And he hopes that this will somehow freely apply to everyone.
2891000	2898000	Of course, doing such on a grand scale, anything beyond a small city quickly proves to be impossible.
2898000	2913000	There is, however, one point of connection here in this part of Rousseau's theory with traditional natural law theory, namely the conviction that Rousseau clearly has that individuals who will the general good unselfishly,
2913000	2920000	that is, as somehow part of the general will looking for the common good, will produce a natural harmony.
2920000	2930000	And in that respect, I think he's calling upon the Stoic tradition, who had always insisted that there are things one must do if one expects there to be a harmony of the whole of society.
2930000	2943000	As such, I think Rousseau can call upon that Stoic tradition that just as in the order of the universe that the Stoics had championed, so too for Rousseau, submission to the general will can bring about a natural harmony.
2943000	2953000	What he most hopes, however, to come from this situation is natural freedom, as much as possible the restoration of the kind of freedom that we had in the state of nature.
2953000	2958000	And for Rousseau, in all of his books, this is at the very center of his ethics.
2958000	2972000	For him, both moral and legal obligation can only be understood if an individual gives free and uncoerced assent to the principles which are going to apply to everyone as matters of law.
2972000	2981000	Hence, it's a strong emphasis upon the consent of the governed as the main condition for the legitimacy of a government.
2981000	2987000	Now, when one turns and asks, well, what effect did all this have? Who bought Rousseau's ideas?
2987000	2997000	And I think the person who is most indebted to them in the history of philosophy and whom we need to consider now for the last portion of this lecture is the great figure of Immanuel Kant.
2997000	3007000	There in Kant we see someone who accepts Rousseau's commitment to freedom and autonomy as the purpose of ethics.
3007000	3020000	There is someone who accepted Descartes' separation between nature and practice, a sense that what we can perhaps understand in the realm of natural science and philosophy will always be of the phenomenal order.
3020000	3032000	It's something which comes about through space and time and can be processed through the various filtering systems that our own bodies and the forms of our sense organs and then the very categories of our mind make possible.
3032000	3043000	But all of the things which can be known to science and to philosophy will be things of the phenomenal order, whereas things like God or freedom are never phenomenal.
3043000	3053000	That is, they are never things which are in space and time. They are rather things which transcend space and time and hence are, if not supernatural at least, trans-phenomenal.
3053000	3062000	As such, the realm of the practical order, the realm of ethics, the realm of politics cannot have a basis in nature. It will have to have a basis in reason.
3062000	3072000	Now, as we step back and before we look at the details of Kant, that is to accept natural law tradition in a way and to reject natural law tradition in a way.
3072000	3081000	What I have been trying to emphasize about the non-negotiable core of natural law ethics is that it's a matter of reason reflecting on nature.
3081000	3095000	But notice there are two parts. There's a nature to be reflected upon, but it's also a reason doing the reflecting and trying to discover the natural order, the natural end-directedness, and what it is that will most accommodate the accomplishment of that end.
3095000	3099000	Both of them are non-negotiable reason and nature.
3099000	3115000	What we find in Kant as the heir of Descartes and especially as the heir of Rousseau and his cultivation of freedom as the very central value, what we find in Kant is a strong sense of the commitment of ethics, the dependence of ethics upon reason.
3115000	3126000	Reason has to establish principles. He's distrustful, I think, of Rousseau's natural spontaneous human goodness, but he wants the value that Rousseau most emphasized, natural freedom,
3126000	3131000	and he thinks that the way to get it is by the cultivation of pure reason.
3131000	3138000	The central concept that Kant will use in his ethics is the concept of the categorical imperative.
3138000	3153000	This is an effort to try to find a way to state ethics in terms of law or command or imperative, and yet to do so by stressing the rational source of this categorical imperative.
3153000	3165000	As such, we will see the tremendous difference between Kantian and the ancient and classical and medieval views of philosophy in which nature and ethics were not so separated.
3165000	3182000	What does Kant propose? Well, in particular, he proposes that moral theory cannot be rooted in a special notion of human nature as theoretically known, but rather must be rooted on reason reflecting upon our pattern of choices.
3182000	3200000	That we have to avoid considering merely the ends of our choices, that would be utilitarianism to which Kant was strongly opposed, and instead focus on that which is most basic about our reason, namely our ability to understand the implications of the choices that we make,
3200000	3209000	especially as pertaining to the maximizing or the minimizing of the freedom that is so essential to practical reasoning.
3209000	3228000	Rather than link the goal of ethics, the goal of human life, to any specific end, which is external to us, rather one wants to link the goal of human life to the cultivation of our freedom, to maximizing our choice and doing it in a way that will always seem to be reasonable.
3228000	3248000	In the course of doing so, Kant proposes this interesting theory of the categorical imperative, and it's an imperative, it's a notion of a command or a directive, it's a source of obligation, and yet he thinks that the categorical imperative will be the precise way of grounding our ethics in a way that does maximize our freedom.
3248000	3265000	It operates basically in this way, namely that whatever one feels that one wants to do, one should make a general rule out of it and say, here's something I would like to do, if I'm going to have permission to do this, I must give permission to everybody to do this.
3265000	3275000	If on the other hand, what I'm considering is something I wouldn't like done to me, I've got to make a general rule that forbids it and include myself within the scope of that general rule.
3275000	3292000	Now as such, we have an advertence here to a notion I think that is familiar to us from biblical morality. One remembers it in the form of the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, or perhaps in the silver rule, don't do unto others as you'd rather not have them do unto you.
3292000	3297000	Notice how different this is from the Wall Street version, do unto others before they do unto you.
3298000	3323000	This is an idea that is attempting to focus our ethics on a precisely and purely formal aspect. There's no content in that, so that if one conceivably were interested in doing something that somebody else considered nefarious, as long as you're willing to suffer the same thing that you're giving, there's no reason why you should not make it a general rule of conduct.
3323000	3334000	It's an effort to trust reason to say that nobody in their right mind will do such a thing that is heinous. Nobody in their right mind will do such a thing that will be so offensive.
3334000	3349000	And so it's trusting that human reason will itself rule out things which are in fact injurious, things that make social living impossible, things that frustrate our nature, but it doesn't in any way force us back onto an analysis of nature.
3349000	3361000	It doesn't require any anthropology. It's an effort to say there's a way to be reasonable and a way in fact to accomplish our human purposes that doesn't require an analysis of our human nature.
3361000	3371000	Any analysis of our human nature would be presenting a rule which were somehow goal-based and hence subject to the utilitarian calculation of values.
3371000	3382000	Instead, this is an effort to say reason can ground ethics purely on its own terms. In the shortest possible compass, I may never make an exception for myself.
3382000	3391000	What I command others to do, I must myself feel commanded to do. What I forbid others to do, I must also forbid to myself.
3391000	3400000	As such, Kant thinks, and I think he has rightly achieved this, he has gotten a vision of ethics which is universal. It can apply to everybody.
3400000	3409000	It's certainly objective in the sense that it can be articulated in so many words and discussed, and it's something which is intelligible. It's something that's able to be understood.
3409000	3424000	Whether it has enough meat, whether it has enough substances is a matter for great discussion. It does certainly achieve his own objective of focusing on freedom as the grounds for morality rather than focusing on nature or some natural end.
3424000	3434000	Now, despite the great differences between this system of ethics and traditional natural law theory, as we have been describing it earlier in these lectures,
3434000	3450000	I find it very interesting to note that as Kant is trying to explain his theory, as he's trying to give a philosophical justification for this categorical imperative and this ethics of duty rather than, say, an ethics of nature or an ethics of virtue,
3450000	3463000	he does, however, still refer to any number of formulations that have a kind of a natural law subtle implication, that there's sort of a quiet advertence to it.
3463000	3471000	And so furiously and paradoxically, there's a way in which even Immanuel Kant can be thought of as part of the natural law tradition.
3471000	3477000	In the original formulation of the categorical imperative, there's no hint of it. It's purely formal. Let me read it to you.
3477000	3487000	Act in such a way that the maxim of your action can become a law for all mankind. That's merely suggesting that what you've got to do is be universal about it.
3487000	3495000	If you command it to others, you're yourself under the command. If you want to permit it to yourself, everybody else must equally be permitted it.
3495000	3504000	So it, for instance, tells us not to lie because we wouldn't want people lying to us. And it can apply to any particular example that we might come up with.
3504000	3513000	But in his subsequent formulations of the categorical imperative, what formulations which he urges are equivalent, are the same thing.
3513000	3522000	He claims he's not introducing something new. I find that there's a subtle reference to that substantive tradition about human nature.
3522000	3526000	Let me read you the formulation that occurs a little bit later in his text.
3526000	3537000	So act as to treat all men not simply as a means, but always at the same time as ends in themselves.
3537000	3547000	Now this is to focus on ends and means. That is, it's to focus on what is something that's so important that it's a goal or a purpose or something that has an intrinsic dignity.
3547000	3553000	And what, on the other hand, is something that's a means to that end, that which has a purely utility value.
3553000	3566000	And it's a suggestion that while we can use lots of things, money, property, food, paintings, all sorts of things in this world, we may legitimately use them as means for our chosen ends.
3566000	3576000	What this principle is suggesting is we may never use a human being as a mere means. We must always respect that human being as an end.
3576000	3581000	It doesn't forbid us to use a human being as a means so long as we respect them as an end.
3581000	3587000	And so, for example, if I have employees in a company of mine, admittedly, they are the means for making profit for my company.
3587000	3598000	What this formulation forbids is that I merely treat them as slaves, merely take them as agents for the profitability of my company or myself or my particular party.
3598000	3611000	That's so long as I'm respecting them as human beings, as ends in themselves, I may also use them and collect their energies together as means toward our common end, but I never may treat them as merely means.
3611000	3618000	As such, one is invoking now not a pure reason claim, but I think one is invoking a nature claim.
3618000	3627000	Why is it that all human beings should be treated as ends and never mere means, where everything else in the universe may be treated as a mere means?
3627000	3634000	This is, I think, subtly to be recognizing the intrinsic dignity of the human being as a separate kind.
3634000	3642000	And hence, in a way, it invokes some of the very substance and basis and fundamental principle of the natural law without saying so.
3642000	3652000	It manages to bring into the ethics that which we all agree on without forcing a fight about metaphysics and how much we're willing to grant about natures and natural ends.
3652000	3662000	One then, I think, can try to form a balanced assessment of Immanuel Kant as someone who, in fact, supports and gives us a new way to think about natural law,
3662000	3668000	even if it's not the whole and complete tradition of natural law, such as we found it in earlier thinkers.
3668000	3677000	He does give us reason to think in terms of a common human nature, precisely in order to ask the questions of what reason will find reasonable.
3677000	3689000	What is it that a human reason trying to think about ethics will find to be universal and intelligible and objective so as to promote the goal of as much freedom as possible,
3689000	3696000	and especially to promote freedom in a way that enhances our human dignity rather than in some way detracts from it?
3696000	3700000	Hence, he proposes something that is new and very interesting for the history of ethics.
3701000	3712000	Now, in lectures to come, I will forgo trying to tell the rest of the history of natural law, for as we enter the contemporary period, there are so many thinkers who contribute to it in a number of ways.
3712000	3724000	And instead, for the remaining eight lectures in this series, what I will try to do is appreciate contemporary dimensions of natural law, not by attempting a historical approach, but by taking a topical approach,
3724000	3727000	looking at problems, because I think we'll find them very interesting.
3730000	3732000	Thank you.
3745000	3749000	Lecture 17 Can Rights Exist Without Natural Law?
3749000	3762000	Up until this point in our series, we have been focusing on questions about the history of natural law.
3762000	3774000	From this point on, lecture 17, through the end, I'd like to try to embrace consideration of natural law in our contemporary world by focusing on some of the great problems about natural law,
3774000	3782000	rather than trying to do an historical review of the many important and interesting figures who have been involved in that discussion.
3782000	3794000	For today's lecture, I'd like to focus on the question about rights, and whether there can be natural rights or human rights, any kind of rights, without natural law someplace at the base of it.
3794000	3805000	I ask that question mindful of the fact that it's not the specific wording, but it's rather the thought and the concept and the ultimate justification that we need to be concerned about.
3805000	3814000	The natural law history that we have been reviewing proved, I think, that natural law theory can use quite a considerable variety of terms.
3814000	3823000	It has some preferred terms, like the very term natural law, the term natural end or teleology, the notion of reason reflecting on nature.
3823000	3835000	But it does not need to use any one of those terms for the theory to be still working in people's minds, for it still to be at the real core of what the discussion about ethics is.
3836000	3851000	This lecture will be devoted to, I think, one of the most frequent instances of natural law thinking today, and yet one that almost never invokes the language natural law, namely the concern with human rights and with natural rights.
3851000	3865000	We have seen international organizations during the 20th century regularly appealing to the notion of natural rights or human rights or human dignity, and they incorporate this in their charters and their declarations.
3865000	3880000	Likewise, discussion about human rights in some social movements, such as the civil rights movement, have often appealed to the human dignity of the individuals as the ground, as the real reason why we should respect one another.
3881000	3899000	Whether it be a question about the right to life or questions of right to liberty or pursuing happiness, or about much more specific things like access to education and jobs and communications, that the real basis, the foundation upon which arguments turn at some point or other,
3899000	3905000	consists of what human beings are and what it is that is so important about that.
3905000	3919000	I would want to argue, and we'll try to do so in this lecture, that fundamentally this is natural law thinking, for it is a case of appealing to a higher and unwritten standard that is rooted in the type of being we are,
3919000	3928000	and that whether you actually invoke the term nature and carry around the metaphysical baggage is irrelevant if long as that is really at the core of the ethical argument.
3929000	3939000	I think one can see that this is at the core when one considers the vast disagreements that exist about what should be counted on the list of natural rights or human rights.
3939000	3950000	And as we try to debate the whether a given claim is one or is a civil right or something accorded simply by virtue of living in this political sphere rather than some other,
3950000	3959000	we are using the concept of natural right based on nature all the time and distinguishing it from what is merely contractual or what is somehow or other civil.
3959000	3976000	I'd also point out, as just a general introductory point, how important it is to be asking the question about what natural law is in itself as opposed to how a given community at a given time under given conditions understands that.
3976000	3985000	That even in a given community, if we understand only some part of it, that may be enough for our purpose and there may not be an explicit thinking about the rest of it.
3985000	3997000	That doesn't alter what the natural law is, it alters what we think about the natural law and how useful it will be to us or how we'll need to reinvent it as so often has been the case in history.
3998000	4008000	What I'll be doing in this lecture then is beginning the lecture by talking about rights in general as a rhetoric and then focusing on some of the great social movements of our century.
4008000	4022000	Secondly, I'll be looking at some of the international movements that the charters that have invoked natural rights and human rights and finally I'd like to ask some philosophical questions that will concern how all of this is ultimately founded.
4022000	4025000	But first, just the phenomenon of rights.
4025000	4039000	Mary Ann Glendon, a professor at the Harvard University School of Law, recently composed a book called Rights Talk and I think she's got it exactly right in her title of her book for one so frequently hears the language of rights today.
4039000	4048000	Sometimes under the formulation of human rights, sometimes civil rights, sometimes human dignity, very seldom natural law.
4049000	4068000	Rhetorically, all of these references to rights in any of their formulation strike me and certainly appeal to Glendon as trump cards that we hold in our hand that are supposed to overwhelm other considerations that are somehow supposed to be decisive in political and legal discussions.
4069000	4082000	The question that emerges when we are mindful of this phenomenon of so frequent a use of the language of rights is whether the current romance with the rhetoric of rights, whether it has anything to do with natural law or not.
4082000	4095000	And I would point out that sometimes there's a hesitancy or perhaps a premature readiness to move on to debate the issues without reflecting enough on what the philosophical implications of this are.
4095000	4100000	The very use of different adjectives, human rights, civil rights, natural rights.
4100000	4116000	The adjectives are extremely important because I think they're trying to give us a sense of what the ground of all this is, namely our participation in citizens when we have civil rights or our being human when we have human rights or our having a nature when we talk of natural rights.
4116000	4141000	And that those adjectives make an enormous contribution to the hint, the what else we're thinking about when we're trying to ground these trump cards and assert that they really do have such heavy moral and political weight for us so that when we reflect on what the basis of those are, we will have a readiness to philosophize and in fact have a better and stronger claim.
4141000	4157000	Whereas if we simply focus on hearing rights and are oblivious to what the adjective is communicating, not only do we lack an adequate ground for what it is we're saying, but there can be great confusion about what the real limit and extent of the right is.
4158000	4180000	Just by one interesting example of that, in the controversy that has erupted over the detention of various foreign nationals during the campaign against terror in the course of the year 2001, one has found that there have been foreigners who have been detained by our government and are not being given quite the same treatment that American citizens are given.
4181000	4201000	Some people have raised the alarm. Is this an attack upon their natural rights? But I think it's a good question whether it's actually a natural right that is being violated or whether there has been a suspension of civil rights because civil rights only properly speaking belong to citizens and that the effort to stem terror and to meet violence in the society might require at least the temporary
4201000	4222000	suspension of civil rights which even aliens in our country have been given to enjoy because those are so powerful and so wonderful a set of things, but so long at least as the individuals are not being themselves tortured as long as there is not an arbitrary ending of their life or an ending of their health, perhaps the curtailment of their liberty might be justified.
4222000	4231000	I don't try to settle that right now, but simply urge that a consideration of what a civil right is as opposed to a human right or a natural right might add to that discussion.
4232000	4252000	As we look in the history of our country for the reason I think why we have this romance with rights, a large part of it goes back to the Declaration of Independence and goes back to the justifications that were offered for this declaration that especially borrowed from the language of John Locke and his theory of natural rights.
4253000	4265000	It was for him an assertion that individuals have rights including even the right to rebellion and very strong sense that these natural rights are ours by our nature.
4265000	4277000	I think we value that still even if we have not chosen or have not had the opportunity to consider philosophically the necessity of thinking about nature as actually the ground for it.
4277000	4293000	But on the other hand, one of the things that bothers me a little bit and I want to raise it as a question for you is whether the set of natural rights that the Declaration of Independence talks about and that we have found so frequently in 4th of July speeches and in political oratory,
4294000	4308000	whether there is a sufficient sense of the correlation between rights and duties. In that document there is not. There is largely an assertion about rights and frequently rights are taken and are spoken about independently of any particular duties.
4308000	4318000	I pointed out when we were discussing those chapters historically that this is a divergence from the larger natural law tradition which tends to see duties first.
4318000	4328000	Our obligation, for instance, to take care of our children, therefore giving us rights to certain property that we need to have as families in order to make possible the care of those children.
4329000	4336000	Duties in a way came first and rights immediately flow from them. The Declaration and much political oratory does not mention that.
4336000	4349000	By contrast, there is another document from almost the same time, a document that has a much more bloody and sad and checkered history, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen in the year 1789.
4350000	4356000	For all of its checkered history, curiously, it does have a strong sense of the correlations of duties and rights.
4356000	4368000	So even while I am not ready to adopt the French Declaration in preference to the American one, I think there is something that we can learn from it that might help us with our sense about this romance with rights that we are presently enjoying.
4369000	4374000	The rhetoric of rights has become so extremely influential in our country.
4374000	4382000	I think that part of the way in which this has come about is that we do cherish the notion of living under the rule of law.
4382000	4390000	And the rule of law has been a protection for us, a protection from that interplay of party politics and the assertions of power,
4390000	4402000	that we expect that everybody and every party will still play by the same rules and that we can calculate our options and are likely consequences of our actions because we know what the rule of law will be.
4402000	4403000	That's a wonderful thing.
4403000	4408000	But it has also meant a very pervasively legal character to our society.
4408000	4416000	Laws intrude upon our life far more than they do in most communities, in most cultures, in most parts of history.
4416000	4420000	Our country has come to have a pervasively legal character.
4420000	4422000	Various authors have noticed this.
4422000	4427000	I refer to one author near the beginning of our republic as well as to a more recent author.
4427000	4443000	Alexis de Tocqueville, a very astute French commentator from near the time of the beginning of our republic, was skeptical about whether law had sufficient power to exert much influence upon social behavior.
4444000	4449000	And even though he was skeptical about whether law could do so, he had to notice.
4449000	4464000	It was one of those insights that he writes about in his Reflections on America in which it went exactly opposite to the way he expected, namely that he couldn't help but noticing that the American people were starting to have a character formed by their law.
4464000	4488000	Likewise, in a more contemporary vein, Mary Ann Glendon, to whom I referred a moment ago, in her book, Right's Talk, notices that how far the domain of law reaches in our society and that now, for us, law probably exerts more control over how we envision ourselves and how we act than does shared religion or a shared culture.
4488000	4497000	I mean, we have been a melting pot in which many, many cultural traditions from Europe and from other parts of the world have come, and how many different religions have come.
4497000	4500000	And we have no real commonness in that.
4500000	4512000	Perhaps there are some basic abiding groups that are persisting in this, but she notes that law has come to have a much more significant impact as the carriers of our values, whether that's for good or bad.
4512000	4528000	She doesn't think of it as a sub-scepticism about it, but she's trying simply to observe the fact that in terms of giving us a way to understand why we think of liberty or equality or justice as so important, probably law is carrying much more of the burden now than it used to.
4528000	4538000	One can see this, for instance, in our recent history in the struggle for civil rights that occurred, especially during the 1950s and 60s and since.
4538000	4554000	The landmark case here is a case in law, namely, in 1954, a decision by the name of Brown versus Board of Education, in which there was a reform with respect to the way in which blacks and whites were to be integrated in our educational system.
4554000	4566000	Not only was this a matter of social reform, but it was an effort by justices to insist that there had to be extra constitutional reasons for making the decision they did.
4566000	4586000	It is a departure from the point of view of judicial review and a much more interesting and aggressive force on behalf of the court using natural law or natural rights, human dignity, human importance to say we need to overturn something for the sake of social reform because legislative activity is not going
4586000	4602000	forward fast enough or far enough, is dragging its heels and is perpetuating a certain injustice. There is not only the fact that it was such a tremendous influence of a moral vision upon the state of our law, but the law itself began to change.
4602000	4630000	That is, the justices in 1954 voted unanimously and therefore gave an enormous moral weight. This wasn't a 5-4 decision where you say there's simply a power of politics still shaping the court, but rather an effort by the court to say the law has to determine how we will arrange our social policies because there isn't sufficient progress at the level of popular understanding, at the level of gradual organic social reform.
4630000	4650000	I point out that until that time, American constitutional law had had a much stronger sense of the division of authority between what the states were to do and what the federal government was to do, and a much stronger sense of the way in which the power of the federal government was to be allocated among its branches.
4650000	4674000	That is, there was not anywhere nearly the strong sense that justices should use their discretion under judicial review to argue for a campaign of social reform or even to argue for personal liberty. It was rather, I think, as I read the history of our jurisprudence, it was presumed that personal liberty would be protected by the structural features of our government having a division of the powers.
4674000	4703000	And it didn't need any particular attention by the court overturning laws so as to protect personal liberties or new social programs. But since then, since that decision of the court in 1954, a decision that was, I think, very helpful in achieving social reform, the courts have taken a liberty that they found in that particular decision and carried it so as to remove from local and legislative control all sorts of other issues.
4704000	4720000	They have found very new and relatively broad constitutional protections for various aspects of personal liberty. And this, it takes the whole range of issues. I don't think it's even liberal or conservative so much, but it's a new activist court.
4721000	4740000	The issues range as diversely as the protection of children from abuse, treatment of the mentally and physically handicapped, the diversity of lifestyles, consumer protection, cruelty to animals, how we administer our prisons and our hospitals, how school systems should work, and even the environment.
4741000	4755000	Now in that range of things, I think you have some very conservative interests and some very liberal interests, but there rather is a sense that somehow the courts under the rubric of finding natural rights can overturn all sorts of legislation.
4755000	4764000	And it's so fascinating to watch how these things get argued by the courts as well as how these things get argued for in the domain of public reason.
4764000	4776000	Sometimes the argument will tend to consist in utilitarian arguments. That is, let's simply look at the law under a very pragmatic consideration and simply see what are the likely consequences.
4776000	4787000	Are we somehow going to promote greater values, things that we find more important at the cost of less pain, or shall we turn to considerations of natural right?
4787000	4798000	And very frequently I think the justices have used both prongs in the argument. Sometimes people are oblivious and will try to argue the point simply on a utilitarian calculus.
4798000	4809000	Whereas as near as I can read the dimensions and directions that the court has found in its decisions, there has been increasing reliance upon rights and the need somehow to ground them in human dignity.
4809000	4816000	It has even meant, I think, in the last 50 years, the reconceptualization of what a right or an entitlement is.
4816000	4829000	It's not just a matter of taking a relatively narrow list, Jefferson's list, for instance, of life, liberty in the pursuit of happiness, or Locke's list of life, liberty, and property, or perhaps the list that's in the Bill of Rights.
4829000	4841000	But now it's an extremely expanded list, rights to education, rights to health care, and such. And it's not just a matter of extending the scope, but it's a matter of asking what the law is telling.
4841000	4852000	Mary Ann Glendon likes to talk about the story that the law is teaching. And I think that she's right in trying to indicate how this works in the course of our legislative system.
4852000	4862000	One of Mary Ann Glendon's other books is a very interesting comparative study. It's called Abortion and Divorce in Western Law. Let's consider, for example, the divorce question.
4862000	4873000	What she notes is that the change in the divorce laws in our country, in the liberalization of those laws, occurred right around the same time as the change in the insurance laws.
4873000	4882000	So that when there was no fault insurance coming in, that you didn't need to prove who was at fault in the collision, the insurance companies will sort that out later when they fight it out.
4882000	4890000	But there will be an already payment, because the people have a right to go on with their lives, and that's what the purpose of insurance is.
4890000	4897000	It was about the same time that a change in the divorce laws occurred, and one had what was called, at least in literature, no fault divorce.
4897000	4905000	So that if the parties were both at least generally agreeable, there could be a divorce settlement without finding fault.
4905000	4917000	And what Mary Ann Glendon does is to show how different that form of jurisprudence, how different that way of the law teaching its own story is from, say, Western European jurisdictions,
4917000	4924000	where even where there has been a comparable liberalization of divorce laws, the story that the law is telling is usually different,
4924000	4930000	because there is still a different kind of fact finding and fault finding in the European courts.
4930000	4938000	And even more important, there is usually a schedule of child payments that is required by the court in the European jurisdictions,
4938000	4947000	where frequently here in the U.S. jurisdictions, it's become a matter of compromise and bargaining, and has led, in fact, to the feminization of poverty,
4947000	4958000	when women sometimes are willing to trade away some of the rights of child payment for the sake of having child custody, thereby impoverishing the children and the women themselves,
4958000	4960000	and I think to a great tragedy.
4960000	4967000	But my point is not to discuss the details so much as to show what has happened when the court starts to tell a different story.
4967000	4978000	Civil rights legislation in the 50s and 60s, I think, was the beginning of this particular trend, and it has had broad reaching effects on other areas of life.
4978000	4988000	The Bill of Rights, for instance, until the 1950s jurisdictions, jurisprudence, the 1950s saw a change in how we understand the Bill of Rights.
4988000	4997000	That is, until that time, I think that normally those rights that are listed in the Bill of Rights, and even the vast open-ended Ninth Amendment,
4997000	5004000	where there are other rights not so enumerated, those rights were primarily taken to be the rights of the states against the federal government,
5004000	5009000	things that the federal government could not do in order to preserve states' rights.
5009000	5017000	However, increasingly, the court has been operating under the incorporation doctrine, namely, to incorporate the first eight amendments,
5017000	5023000	which had dealt primarily with the states, to incorporate it under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment,
5023000	5033000	and to suggest that these are rights which are personal liberties, and so are personal liberties which the court must protect over against even state legislation.
5033000	5042000	That may be a good idea. I'm not trying right now to debate the merits of what they did, so much as to point out the fact of the change in what they did,
5042000	5050000	namely, to enormously enhance the role of rights and rights talk and rights argument, individual freedoms and individual liberties,
5050000	5060000	keeping them and protecting them from intervention by the states as well as by the federal governments, and the federal court has been seeing itself as the arbiter of that movement.
5061000	5067000	In the international arena, there has been a similar interest in the dominance of rights.
5067000	5074000	One sees, for instance, in 1948, the United Nations making its universal declaration of human rights.
5074000	5080000	The European nations, at various points in time, tried to imitate that.
5080000	5088000	One sees, for instance, in 1965, the European Social Charter, and in 1966, the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.
5088000	5095000	Even now, as there are movements to try to establish an international court again, one sees some of this kind of documentation,
5095000	5099000	but it is not yet clear exactly what form that legislation will take.
5099000	5106000	But in general, these international documents try to stress some balance between duties and rights.
5106000	5114000	In a way, I think they are more mindful of that 1789 French Declaration than they are, say, of our 1776 American Declaration.
5114000	5122000	But what is also interesting, even as they try to articulate a notion of rights and usually put them in correlation with duties,
5122000	5128000	they almost never make an argument about why human beings have these rights.
5128000	5135000	Now, perhaps this is simply good politics, and perhaps this is simply a good sense of how rhetoric works as opposed to how philosophy works,
5135000	5139000	but as a philosopher, I can't help but notice the lack of a philosophical argumentation,
5139000	5144000	namely that they are treating these various rights as simply self-evident.
5144000	5148000	And we ask ourselves philosophically, what is it to be self-evident?
5148000	5154000	To be self-evident, I think, is to be simply obvious that any reasonable person will see it.
5154000	5159000	Any reasonable person will be willing to admit it, and that those who are unwilling to admit it,
5159000	5163000	and are willing to, in fact, violate it, are not being perfectly reasonable,
5163000	5167000	because they are unwilling to see what the rest of us see as so obvious.
5167000	5172000	But that is a reason, I think, why it's important to give a philosophical justification,
5172000	5179000	and to try to bring people into being reasonable for reason, philosophical precision in this matter,
5179000	5184000	can at least do the hard labors of trying to bring people to agreement,
5184000	5189000	where there is disagreement about what is intuitively obvious or what is not intuitively obvious.
5189000	5195000	So while the documents, such as the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
5195000	5200000	or the subsequent European agreements, are admittedly legal documents,
5200000	5203000	or political manifestos, and not philosophical treatises,
5203000	5208000	it is important, I think, to ask about what is it that's so important here,
5208000	5214000	and if we are not, rather, in a stage where we're simply presuming some things about human nature,
5214000	5218000	which the larger natural law theory in itself finds the need to make obvious,
5218000	5223000	and hence we're doing a part of the work of natural law, even though we're not calling it that,
5223000	5226000	and perhaps for some good reason.
5226000	5230000	In claiming that this is a legitimate philosophical question, namely,
5230000	5234000	what is the ultimate basis for this declaration of rights,
5234000	5237000	or these various rhetorical uses of the term rights,
5237000	5241000	and why might it be useful to have a philosophical basis for it,
5241000	5244000	I'd like to try to make five points.
5244000	5250000	First, to make a claim about rights and entitlements for one group or another,
5250000	5253000	it is certainly necessary to specify the group.
5253000	5256000	So if one wants to articulate a notion of civil rights,
5256000	5261000	as in the questions of how people who are defendants against crime should be treated,
5261000	5266000	even defendants against charges of terrorism, one needs to identify what the group is,
5266000	5270000	and if one is claiming that these are rights that come only on the basis of citizenry,
5270000	5273000	well, so be it, then they are admitted the only the rights of citizens
5273000	5277000	and the aliens should not necessarily be expected to have them.
5277000	5283000	But if what we are claiming is that there is a right that belongs to someone on the basis of their being human,
5283000	5287000	and which a given regime, for instance, is not willing to admit,
5287000	5291000	we're saying that there is a natural right, but the regime won't admit it as a civil right,
5291000	5297000	then we've got to identify in so many words what the group is and what the basis for the right claim is.
5297000	5304000	But to say that the entire human race, the race as a whole is given certain rights
5304000	5309000	and that every member of that race has rights, well, ultimately that's to make a natural claim.
5309000	5314000	It's to make a claim on the basis of our nature and saying that humans have it, animals don't,
5314000	5317000	and that humans have it regardless of regime.
5317000	5321000	That's to say that it's a right that is higher than merely civil rights.
5321000	5325000	It's a right that precedes a constitution or some declaration of power.
5325000	5329000	It's the claim about universality, which we've seen to be so important about ethics
5329000	5332000	throughout the entirety of this lecture course.
5332000	5339000	Second point, appeals to human rights and to human dignity are often used not just by courts,
5339000	5341000	but are often used by legislators.
5341000	5344000	They're used as arguments trying to ground legislation.
5344000	5350000	And as such, they can be used to try to correct what comes to be perceived as bad legislation
5350000	5353000	or bad policies and bad customs.
5353000	5360000	In this respect, the appeal to rights is often taking the same course that appeals in judicial review do,
5360000	5364000	because judicial review doesn't necessarily mean we have an activist court.
5364000	5368000	It could mean simply that the court is pointing out, as it does in Germany,
5368000	5373000	namely that there's some problem with this legislation against our fundamental law,
5373000	5375000	but we're not going to be legislative about it.
5375000	5378000	It's simply a matter of throwing it back onto the legislator.
5378000	5383000	But when the legislator has to make a good case trying to make the argument
5383000	5388000	that such and such a right ought to be codified within a given country's law,
5388000	5391000	what is it that's going to be the ultimate basis here,
5391000	5394000	except that the legislator is concerned about all the citizens,
5394000	5398000	even about the weakest citizens and those who cannot speak for themselves.
5398000	5400000	But that, again, is to enter into natural law thinking,
5400000	5404000	whether used the term or not is quite irrelevant.
5404000	5411000	Third, the adjudication of apparent clashes between rights, sometimes when one finds this claim against that claim
5411000	5413000	and how do you put the two together?
5413000	5418000	The right, for instance, to freedom to choose how we'll live and yet the ties of matrimony.
5418000	5421000	Should there be such a thing as a legal toleration of divorce
5421000	5427000	or any of the issues where rights claims and freedom claims and autonomy claims come into clash?
5427000	5432000	There is a matter, I think, of thinking through not only our rights and our freedoms
5432000	5437000	and what we want to do, important as that is, but there's also a need to consider what duties we have
5437000	5442000	because we never find ourselves living as pure isolated atomic individuals
5442000	5450000	and that to think that we do is to risk gray violations to those who are unable sufficiently to voice their rights.
5450000	5454000	Again, to just use that marriage example for a moment, given all the tremendous hard cases
5454000	5457000	that there are to be considered in that domain,
5457000	5463000	there are also matters of children and of families and that at least a consideration of duties and rights together
5463000	5468000	will help to make a reasonable case and lead us to reasonable public policies.
5468000	5473000	Fourth, even without explicitly invoking the language of natural law,
5473000	5480000	the various rights claims and the approach to morality that takes place by considerations of right,
5480000	5486000	it actually bears tremendous similarity to the tradition of natural law ethics
5486000	5490000	because, as we have tried to focus in the earlier part of this lecture course,
5490000	5495000	natural law thinking is not committed to any one set of terminology.
5495000	5500000	What it's committed to is a set of concepts under whatever terms we invoke those concepts
5500000	5507000	and the concept that we are so committed to and which I think that natural rights language in its best sense is committed to
5507000	5511000	is the sense that there's something distinctive about human beings.
5511000	5519000	Granting, sometimes in our short-sightedness, we may not be willing to do the long and difficult work of anthropology,
5519000	5525000	trying to appreciate the fullness of that nature, especially as we think about how long and how many years
5525000	5529000	that that human nature requires careful cultivation in order to unfold well,
5529000	5537000	that sometimes we're inclined to a somewhat more short-sighted approach because of the immediate liberty interest that is at issue
5537000	5541000	or because of some of the immediate benefits of the short term.
5541000	5546000	But when one thinks about, say, the security that a person needs in order to grow up well
5546000	5551000	and for good maturation and psychological health, that one needs a real security,
5551000	5556000	it may be that we need the longer standing view and need to bring in all that anthropology
5556000	5560000	in order to think about rights and make sure they're balanced rather than arbitrary.
5560000	5566000	Finally, merely to couch a claim in terms of rights doesn't settle it.
5566000	5571000	It doesn't amount to a trump card, even though many groups claiming rights would like them to be trump cards.
5571000	5575000	Just as in the case of natural law, so in the case of natural rights,
5575000	5581000	what one is trying to do is to make an argument that will convince the proverbial impartial spectator
5581000	5587000	about what is good and bad, right and wrong, obligatory, forbidden or permissible,
5587000	5592000	and do so in ways that are intelligible and objective and universal so far as possible.
5592000	5596000	And for this, we do well to make sure we have a sufficient nature thinking
5596000	5599000	in order to make a good ethical case.
5617000	5621000	Lecture 18, The Question of Evolution.
5622000	5635000	One of the important presuppositions of classical natural law theory is the presence of such a thing as human nature.
5635000	5641000	But modern biology has raised all sorts of interesting questions for natural law theory,
5641000	5645000	particularly associated with the theory of evolution.
5645000	5651000	Does the theory of evolution, for instance, simply negate all natural law theory whatsoever,
5651000	5657000	as well as natural rights claims, by reducing us to just one more animal species,
5657000	5662000	maybe something that's more intelligent, more clever, more powerful, more funny,
5662000	5666000	but in short, not any different in kind?
5666000	5673000	Among the related points that I think we need to cover in this series on natural law vis-à-vis evolution
5673000	5677000	is the very assumption of evolutionary theory, materialism,
5677000	5682000	that is often really just assumed without proof by evolutionary theorists,
5682000	5686000	as well as some of the other claims they make.
5686000	5692000	I mean, to assume materialism is to assume there is no such thing as an immaterial or a spiritual reality.
5692000	5694000	Is that justified?
5694000	5697000	But it will also be helpful to distinguish between natural law,
5697000	5703000	as I have been using the term throughout this course, as a moral term, the natural moral law,
5703000	5709000	as distinct from the laws of nature, the things that are regarded generally as laws of science.
5709000	5715000	We got nature and law in the same phrase, but we've got it in some very distinct ways in which we're using it there.
5715000	5720000	My claim will be that natural law, when used in ethics, and laws of nature,
5720000	5725000	as we tend to use that term in science, are in fact related but distinct,
5725000	5729000	and it's important to see that distinction as well as see their commonness.
5729000	5735000	The imperatives that are typical of natural law theory in any of the senses of which we've been using natural law theory
5735000	5739000	always involve evaluation of human conduct,
5739000	5745000	whereas the laws of nature are matters of observing and commenting upon regularities in nature,
5745000	5748000	regularities in the physical universe.
5748000	5753000	But moral conduct might be just one of those in which these two spheres combine.
5753000	5758000	For this lecture, then, what I'd like to consider is natural law and evolutionary theory
5758000	5763000	and begin to talk about the status of evolutionary theory for just a bit,
5763000	5768000	and my reason for doing so is that it makes a difference to natural law theory
5768000	5771000	whether evolution is true or whether it's not.
5771000	5776000	That is, it has a different implication for natural law theory, so I need to consider both options.
5776000	5783000	And then finally, toward the end, to try to articulate some defense of natural law theory, whichever way we decide the question.
5783000	5787000	First, the status of evolutionary theory.
5787000	5792000	I think that there are good cases that can be made both for and against the theory of evolution,
5792000	5795000	and I'm not going to try to settle the matter during this hour.
5795000	5801000	Much depends on exactly what one means by the theory of evolution, what one is including and excluding.
5801000	5804000	It's one of those terms I think that everybody thinks they know what it means,
5804000	5810000	but as a matter of fact, in the technical literature, there is a number of theories that are involved here,
5810000	5812000	and they have different implications.
5812000	5817000	So I will attempt to discuss it only as far as I need to for the sake of natural law.
5817000	5824000	Perhaps the dominant theory of evolution goes under the name of Darwinianism and Neo-Darwinianism.
5824000	5832000	And the two main principles that are invoked by all forms of evolutionary theory that are Darwinian and Neo-Darwinian
5832000	5836000	are random variation and natural selection.
5836000	5841000	Random variation, of course, refers to how novelty comes into the world.
5841000	5846000	The kind of novelty that can produce new species from time to time.
5846000	5851000	Various mechanisms have been produced to try to explain this variation.
5851000	5858000	Sometimes it's radiation from the sun, sometimes it's the way in which chemicals by chance interact with one another and so on,
5858000	5862000	and these have been proposed as explanation for how the novelty springs up,
5862000	5864000	so that we really do have variety.
5864000	5868000	That's one of the key components of an evolutionary theory, random variation.
5868000	5873000	That is, variation without any designing intelligence, without any God who is arranging the system,
5873000	5877000	or without intelligence in any other sphere, but truly random.
5877000	5885000	Second principle that is key to Darwinian and Neo-Darwinian explanations is the notion of natural selection,
5885000	5891000	the winnowing process by which some species succeed and procreate and develop,
5891000	5894000	while other species manage to fall by the wayside.
5894000	5899000	They fail to adapt to their environment, fail to meet one of the challenges that arise,
5899000	5902000	somehow fail to reproduce themselves.
5902000	5910000	It seems to me that whether or not this is true, there are implications for natural law theory.
5910000	5912000	So I need to discuss both points.
5912000	5919000	That is, first I'll begin to discuss a strong objection that has been raised to evolutionary theory being true.
5919000	5924000	And obviously, if evolutionary theory is untrue, then the effect is that natural law can just go on as it's always gone on.
5924000	5929000	Whereas, in the second part of the hour, what I'll try to consider is supposing evolution is true.
5929000	5932000	What effect does that have on natural law theory?
5932000	5937000	I think that one can make a strong plausible case, I don't know that it's a definitive case,
5937000	5942000	but one can make a strong plausible case against the theory of evolution that doesn't beg the question.
5942000	5947000	Sometimes I find that arguments against evolution, for instance, creation science,
5947000	5951000	are simply begging the question because they assume already the answer
5951000	5956000	and are trying to construct an argument that will repudiate the opposition.
5956000	5961000	But invariably, there is some question about whether the science really meets the claim of science.
5961000	5967000	But I think that you can make an interesting case against evolution even from the best of contemporary science.
5967000	5975000	Namely, I'm inverting to the writings of a contemporary microbiologist and a biochemist by the name of Michael Behe,
5975000	5982000	who is a book by a very charming name, Darwin's Black Box, the biochemical challenge to evolution.
5982000	5985000	The Black Box idea refers to something like your television.
5985000	5989000	We all know how to flip the channels using the remote control,
5989000	5992000	but do we really understand what's going on in the Black Box?
5992000	5994000	And, of course, most of us haven't got a clue.
5994000	6001000	And Behe's idea is that evolutionary theory often makes the same kind of use of a Black Box,
6001000	6007000	namely to produce the random variation one assumes that the biochemistry works.
6007000	6012000	The part that's more easy to see is the natural selection,
6012000	6018000	and one can see how a challenge in the environment that's a new species coming into play or a new chemical process.
6018000	6021000	One can see how the natural selection works easily enough,
6021000	6025000	but that the random variation is the thing that deserves our investigation
6025000	6029000	because it often operates like a Black Box in the theories,
6029000	6033000	providing random variation when perhaps it is actually unable to do so.
6033000	6038000	Random variation, by definition, means that there is no guiding hand
6038000	6045000	that in advance knows the purpose for which the process of development is somehow headed.
6045000	6049000	This is absolutely crucial to a theory of evolution in the strict sense of the word.
6049000	6055000	Now, granting in a looser sense of the word evolution, one can have an evolution with a guiding hand.
6055000	6058000	One could imagine, for instance, God designing a set of steps
6058000	6062000	so that ultimately we'll get to where evolutionary history has headed us,
6062000	6064000	but that's not strictly speaking evolution.
6064000	6069000	That's design, intelligence, somehow providential control of the process.
6069000	6074000	What we're referring to here are those stricter senses of evolutionary theory where there is no guiding hand.
6074000	6081000	But the problem at the biochemical level is that living organisms all have biological structures
6081000	6086000	of enormous sophistication, enormous biological complexity,
6086000	6092000	and they need a very careful assembly at each level from the level of atoms,
6092000	6099000	the level of molecules, and all the way up through proteins and enzymes and cells as well as organs.
6099000	6105000	Hence, the philosophical question emerges as we're dealing with the fact that the little structures
6105000	6108000	are enormously detailed and are very complicated,
6108000	6113000	building bigger structures, being building yet bigger structures, building yet bigger structures,
6113000	6119000	and eventually making a cell or eventually making an organ and eventually producing an organism
6119000	6121000	is that we've got an awful lot of structure there.
6121000	6127000	And it's not just random structure, but it's very interestingly efficient structure.
6127000	6133000	In fact, as Beehe likes to claim, it's complexity in the technical sense of the word.
6133000	6144000	To claim that a structure is complex philosophically is to say that a structure is composed of irreducibly different kinds of parts.
6144000	6150000	Now, the phraseology here is extremely important that it's to say we're not just dealing with, say, Legos,
6150000	6155000	where we've got the basically the same building part and we're adding lots of them together into different shapes
6155000	6161000	that I'm making out of the same basic part, but rather that the parts are also different in kind.
6161000	6169000	And in the case of an irreducibly complex structure, all the parts have to be there for the whole to work.
6169000	6176000	Consider by way of a very simple example, something like a mousetrap and the parts that are involved in a mousetrap.
6176000	6183000	At very least, one has a platform and one will have a spring and one will have a sort of a hammer and a catch
6183000	6188000	and a holding bar and a couple of staples, other fasteners to keep things in place.
6188000	6194000	Now, we've got parts there doing different jobs. Admittedly, we could make them all out of the same material.
6194000	6201000	I suppose we could make them out of wood and yet they don't work quite as efficiently as when we've got the made out of different substances.
6201000	6206000	So we've got steel in the bar in one place and we've got something else that's more pliable that can be the fastener
6206000	6210000	and we've got something nice and stable that can be the platform.
6210000	6218000	What the purpose of bringing up this example of a very artificial object like a mousetrap is, is that you've got parts of different kinds
6218000	6224000	and the parts don't just evolve into one another. That is, no matter how much you start tinkering with a platform, you don't get a spring.
6224000	6228000	And no matter how much you start tinkering with a hammer, you don't get the catch.
6228000	6231000	You've got something that has a very different structure.
6231000	6237000	And when one considers the biochemistry of all this, one has similarly different kinds of structures
6237000	6242000	so that you have not only the building block atoms that are hydrogen and carbon and nitrogen and so on,
6242000	6249000	but you've got the various kinds of molecules that they form and the various kinds of proteins and enzymes and such all the way up the ladder.
6249000	6256000	Without all of the parts being in the right place, the whole structure does not yet function.
6256000	6265000	Organic objects of even the simplest kind, so you don't have to deal with something anywhere nearly as complex as a human being or a dog or a cat,
6265000	6272000	but if you're dealing with an amoeba or if you're dealing with a very simple kind of virus, you still have enormous biochemical complexity.
6272000	6280000	They are made up even at the most basic levels of different kinds of atoms which have to come together under the right circumstances
6280000	6288000	to form one kind of molecule rather than another, and then the molecules have to come together in just the right quantities and arrangements
6288000	6292000	to form the proteins and so on up the biochemical ladder.
6292000	6303000	Now, the constituent structures here are of enormously long chains and are of very different kinds of proteins and enzymes that need to come together.
6303000	6311000	And remember, if we're going to be strict constructionist evolutionists, they have to come together without any kind of assistance that a mind could offer,
6311000	6318000	not just my mind working in the chemical laboratory or the biochemical laboratory, but God's mind organizing a universe.
6318000	6326000	And they have to come together in just the right amounts and just the right quantities in order for even a simple biological structure to be present
6326000	6334000	so that it will perform a certain function that will be advantageous for the organism as a whole, because it's only when we have the function in place
6334000	6340000	in an organism that is already existing that it can meet the challenge of natural selection.
6340000	6350000	Often in the course of evolutionary displays, what one will see is imagination, imaginary presentations of a long string of animals
6350000	6353000	in which something like eyesight is gradually developing.
6353000	6360000	And the suggestion is that eyesight, of course, gives enormous advantage in the evolutionary struggle providing for natural selection,
6360000	6368000	because once it's in place, of course, the creature can see and can see things that other creatures can't and it can succeed in the great evolutionary struggle.
6368000	6375000	But the problem that Beehe is raising is that no sight is present at all until sufficient structure is present,
6375000	6384000	but that there's no particular reason why the structure would develop, because the biochemical permutations that have to occur are in such enormously long chains
6384000	6395000	of 17,000 and 25,000 and 50,000 units that there's no reason to think that the first, second, third, fourth, 17th, 135th, 288th changes
6395000	6402000	and permutations would have continued to develop toward that end unless there were a mind designing
6402000	6411000	and knew what the purpose and the function that the organism as a whole needs to have in this constituent organ made of these constituent parts.
6411000	6413000	It's worthwhile reading the book on its own.
6413000	6418000	My point here is not to say that this utterly makes evolutionary theory impossible.
6418000	6427000	My point is rather to suggest that challenges can be raised about evolutionary theory on a purely scientific basis and deserve to be handled.
6427000	6433000	Michael Beehe's arguments are right now being very hotly contested in the current literature.
6433000	6443000	And it's interesting to me to watch the vigorous exchange within the community of scientists in this very crucial but insufficiently scrutinized part of the theory of evolution.
6443000	6449000	Needless to say, the debate remains open and I am not capable of settling at all, let alone capable of settling it here.
6449000	6459000	But my point for the purpose of this lecture is, is that if evolutionary theory were to fall on the basis of science, for instance, on the basis of biochemistry
6459000	6470000	and require some different theory to explain the incredible complexity and the incredible differentiation among species, all objections to natural law from that quarter would fall.
6471000	6477000	On the other hand, it seems to me that it's only appropriate to note that evolutionary theory may be true,
6477000	6486000	whether it's a guided evolution or whether they solve the problem of biochemical complexity and the vast variety that is needed for random variation.
6486000	6490000	And so for a few minutes now, let's consider the other possibility.
6490000	6497000	Namely, if for the sake of discussion we are simply to accept that evolutionary theory is true in any of its forms,
6497000	6501000	we still need to ask about the implications for natural law thinking and ethics.
6501000	6509000	It will be important, I think, to divide the question so as to give proper consideration to both the question about natural kinds,
6509000	6514000	as well as the question about morality, such as natural law theory likes to present.
6514000	6519000	So first I'd like to consider assuming evolution now, not in any way questioning it,
6519000	6526000	but to consider the question about natural kinds and then in a minute I'll turn to the properly moral questions.
6527000	6533000	Supposing there has been such a thing as evolution, what is it that it has produced?
6533000	6536000	Has it indeed produced different species?
6536000	6542000	I think that most evolutionary theorists would be inclined to say, yes, that's the whole point of evolutionary theory,
6542000	6549000	is that in the course of history we have seen by this purely random development and random process,
6549000	6552000	we've got creatures which are truly different in kind.
6552000	6559000	Hence the philosophical question comes up, well, what is a difference in kind as opposed to a difference in degree?
6559000	6565000	Earlier on in our course I raised this question and cited the works of Mortimer Adler to whom I am enormously indebted
6565000	6572000	in what I have to say next, namely that to say that we have two things, two groups that are different in kind,
6572000	6580000	is to say that we have identified a group, all of which, every member of which, has a certain property or trait.
6580000	6585000	Maybe it has that trait in wonderful maturity and in complete form.
6585000	6587000	Maybe it only has that trait a little bit less.
6587000	6589000	Maybe it has the trait much less.
6589000	6591000	Maybe it has the trait only in germ.
6591000	6597000	But our very reason for saying that there's a difference in kind is that every member of the group has a certain trait,
6597000	6600000	a certain set of properties to some degree.
6600000	6606000	Whereas if we have a difference in kind, everything else will lack that trait or lack those properties.
6606000	6612000	That is what it means in anybody's philosophy to say that we have a difference in kind and not merely a difference in degree.
6612000	6615000	Clearly we have differences in degree all over the place.
6615000	6624000	But if we have, by evolution, true difference in kind, then what we've got are natural kinds produced by an evolutionary mechanism.
6624000	6634000	In his book, The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes, Mortimer Adler gives us a wonderful way to apply this sense of the difference in kinds
6634000	6641000	to question of the human species and to ask, all right, maybe we have in general differences in kind in evolutionary theory.
6641000	6645000	Do we have a true difference in kind with regard to the human species?
6645000	6653000	And he reviews the options that are available to us for asking about whether we have a true difference in kind for the humankind.
6653000	6660000	He notices, as any good Aristotelian is, and any Aristotelian would do, and Mortimer Adler clearly is an Aristotelian,
6660000	6664000	he notices that there's lots of ways in which you can consider the similarities,
6664000	6668000	the similarity that we have, for instance, in bodily structure to many of the primates,
6668000	6674000	the similarities that we bear with many of the mammals with regard to processes of reproduction.
6674000	6680000	But he notices that there are certain properties which are present in the human species,
6680000	6688000	and he particularly directs our consideration to the focus on language as a manifestation of our rationality.
6688000	6695000	This is to admit that there will be human beings, that is, creatures produced by other human beings
6695000	6702000	and who are at least biological members of the same species, who do not yet have language, the unborn or the smallest children,
6702000	6707000	and there will be members of the species who will not get language because of some genetic defect
6707000	6711000	or because of some injury or some accident where they lose the powers of speech.
6711000	6721000	And yet he asks the question, is the phenomenon of language itself rationality, or is language a manifestation of rationality?
6721000	6726000	And so that some creatures, some human creatures, which are not yet possessing language
6726000	6734000	or are no longer capable of language, or in which language never managed to develop the cases of autism
6734000	6740000	or questions at some point in some children with Down syndrome or various kinds of accidents that have occurred.
6740000	6743000	Do they manifest their rationality in other ways?
6743000	6749000	And I think what he's been finding and what other behavioral psychologists have certainly found
6749000	6754000	is that one can manifest one's rationality, for instance, one's discrimination in powers of loving,
6754000	6757000	knowing how to love one's parents and how to be afraid of strangers,
6757000	6761000	that one can manifest even in one's patterns of likes and dislikes,
6761000	6765000	one's patterns of love, of giving love and receiving love,
6765000	6769000	one can manifest one's rationality even when powers of language are gone.
6769000	6774000	But that, as we noted in those very first lectures that we did together,
6774000	6782000	the privilege of the normal case, the way in which we identify what is normal and natural and appropriate for our species,
6782000	6786000	is not by looking at things at the very beginning or things at the end,
6786000	6790000	not looking at the really hard cases, but looking at what is typical of the normal case.
6790000	6796000	Not trying to insist that every time we lack the function, we lack a membership of the species,
6796000	6801000	but rather that we look at the normal case to contrast the species as a whole with another species.
6801000	6807000	In this respect, almost all of our psychology, almost all of behavioral sciences,
6807000	6814000	almost all of the social sciences, utterly depend upon the recognition that we have a true difference in kind
6814000	6820000	that is present precisely by virtue of rationality manifested, for example, in language.
6820000	6827000	And one can consider the details of language and can understand yet new things about our rationality.
6827000	6832000	There is, for example, the fact that other animal species manifest something like language,
6832000	6835000	that is, they have some forms of communication.
6835000	6839000	And whether we're dealing with the dolphins or dealing with the chimps or dealing with the honeybees,
6839000	6843000	there certainly are patterns of communication that they exhibit.
6843000	6848000	What is so typical of human language and that lets it be this property that is present,
6848000	6851000	at least as a power in every instance of the humankind,
6851000	6856000	and lacking even in other animal species that do indeed have means of communication,
6856000	6862000	are things like its flexibility, its ability to express so many different kinds of thought and to do so abstractly.
6862000	6867000	Or, as I recently saw in a book by Alistair McIntyre called Dependent Rational Animals,
6867000	6872000	even the ability to say no, the ability to use negations,
6872000	6879000	the ability to do intentional conscious deception of others, to tell lies, to make jokes.
6879000	6885000	That even this phenomenon registers something about the kind of rationality that is behind our powers of language.
6885000	6892000	Not only a flexibility, but a capability for error and for deception, as well as for truth and for insight.
6892000	6895000	They show us something about how distinctive we are.
6895000	6900000	Now, for Adler in that book, The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes,
6900000	6907000	he is willing to grant that neither rationality nor language absolutely definitively decides the question
6907000	6919000	whether this difference in kind was produced by divine creation or by some evolutionary theory using random selection and natural variation.
6919000	6923000	But supposing, in fact, that it was produced by an evolutionary process,
6923000	6928000	supposing that there was no guiding hand of some divine creator,
6928000	6941000	even if evolutionary theory proves true, this does nothing to attack natural law theory in so far as natural law theory is based on the difference of kind.
6941000	6950000	And an analysis of what that difference in kind, our rationality, our ability to make free choices, includes within the scope of its rationality.
6950000	6957000	Even if, for instance, we should find that the dolphins or that the chimpanzees are our kissin' cousins in ways that we had never imagined,
6957000	6966000	even if we were to find that out, I think all it would do is move the line of what species are protected by rights precisely because of their rationality.
6966000	6975000	So that, while I right now do not yet see compelling evidence to say that dolphins or chimpanzees are persons in the sense of being moral subjects,
6975000	6982000	the bearers of rights precisely because of their rationality, even if we discovered that they do possess such rationality.
6982000	6989000	Or perhaps that creatures from outer space, some of those proverbial aliens that show up in science fiction movies,
6989000	6998000	even if we should, in fact, find such a culture, it would simply move the line of what it is that deserves moral protection rather than to erase the line.
6998000	7002000	It would not do anything to erase the fact that there is a difference in kind.
7002000	7008000	It would simply give us other creatures who are different in kind and also deserve such moral protection.
7009000	7020000	Hence my claim is that whether the human species is the product of random variation or not, I think it is obvious beyond the shadow of a doubt that we are a distinct natural kind,
7020000	7030000	and that rationality is our specific difference, distinguishing us from all other animal species, even those who are similar to us in all other respects.
7030000	7038000	Among the activities that are specifically distinctive of humanity as a natural kind are thinking and choosing,
7038000	7046000	and it is precisely on the basis of the powers of thought and the powers of choice that we make any moral assertions whatsoever,
7046000	7050000	and in particular that natural law theory finds its basis.
7050000	7058000	We are only culpable morally for what we know and for what we have chosen to do or to have refrained from doing.
7058000	7066000	To the extent that we did not know enough to make a deliberate choice or to the extent that we were forced to do something,
7066000	7073000	whether forced by physical coercion or by an addictive habit or by psychological pressure or by some other factor,
7073000	7079000	our responsibility is only diminished or perhaps removed altogether if that power were too strong,
7079000	7085000	and it does not in any way deny or negate the fact that we are responsible for what we have chosen,
7085000	7092000	even if what we have chosen to do comes about as a result of our nature that is the product of an evolutionary scheme.
7092000	7100000	It is precisely because no animal of any other species, so far as we now know, has either that kind of knowledge
7100000	7107000	or the power of making deliberate choices that are needed for entering into the whole sphere of morality and immorality
7107000	7111000	that we do not hold any of these other creatures praiseworthy or blameworthy.
7111000	7115000	One could imagine, I suppose, if one were trying to think of an instance to the contrary,
7115000	7119000	of a tiger who was retiring to its den and saying to its mate,
7119000	7122000	gosh darn, I'm going to go have to see a shrink.
7122000	7128000	I just can't get over that proclivity I have toward eating human children, much as I know that it's wrong.
7128000	7134000	Of course, they do know such thing and it's a wonderful example for comic strips,
7134000	7140000	but I think it brings out the point about what it is that we mean of the sphere of our own rationality
7140000	7142000	and the sphere of our own morality.
7142000	7148000	But sometimes we are inclined to praise the loyalty of our fido or of some other dog,
7148000	7153000	but upon reflection I think that what we have to say when we're praising Fido's fidelity
7153000	7157000	is that we're appreciating the devoted affection that these pets show.
7157000	7159000	We're not praising their moral judgment.
7159000	7164000	Rather, we have a sense of how much we have come to love them and they have come to love us
7164000	7167000	and how dogs in particular are so willing to embrace danger.
7167000	7171000	But we do something that is actually misconstruing the animal
7171000	7176000	if we think that the animal sat and thought about it, if the animal deliberated upon it.
7176000	7181000	At least the burden of proof is on those to show that an animal is capable of such deliberation
7181000	7187000	and, if I may reassert the point, if we should find on the basis of interesting experiments
7187000	7193000	in animal psychology that Fido did really sit and think about it and decided for himself
7193000	7197000	that we were worthy of embracing danger, that would be reason for including Fido
7197000	7202000	in the realm of protection as persons, as opposed to blurring the line between those creatures
7202000	7207000	which are persons and deserving of moral protection rather than those that are not.
7207000	7212000	But using the proverbial Occam's razor, I think that we're able to explain animal behavior,
7212000	7217000	even the kind of loyalty that we love to praise, on the basis of simpler explanations
7217000	7221000	and hence we do not need the more complicated hypothesis.
7221000	7226000	We do increasingly hold human beings morally accountable as they grow,
7226000	7232000	as they come to the age of reason and start manifesting some ability to show discrimination
7232000	7236000	and some ability to be responsible for their choices.
7236000	7240000	For those human beings who are unable to think those things out for themselves,
7240000	7245000	whether children or people who have severe emotional problems or mental difficulties,
7245000	7250000	even so they remain members of our species and we treat them with the appropriate sympathy
7250000	7254000	and the appropriate sense of inclusion within the human community
7254000	7257000	even while we excuse them from moral responsibility.
7257000	7262000	And I think that this too is a measure of our own level and sphere of morality
7262000	7265000	that to which we are challenged constantly to rise.
7265000	7270000	So to conclude, my question at the beginning of the lecture remains,
7270000	7274000	does evolutionary theory invalidate natural law ethics?
7274000	7278000	And I'd like to make five points by which to try to bring this together.
7278000	7282000	First, natural law ethics in any of its forms,
7282000	7286000	and I'll happily grant the diversity of forms that natural law takes.
7286000	7291000	Natural law theory stands or falls with the claim that there is a distinctive human nature,
7291000	7295000	not with the claim of whether that nature has evolved or been created.
7295000	7300000	And although I think that there are some grounds to question whether evolutionary theory is in fact correct,
7300000	7305000	I don't think that natural law theory stands or falls with deciding that question.
7305000	7310000	Second, natural law theory claims that there are certain patterns of activity
7310000	7316000	that intrinsically frustrate our natural ends, the things that are intrinsic to us as human beings,
7316000	7322000	just as there are certain kinds of conduct that foster the fulfillment of those natural ends.
7322000	7328000	If that is not true, if there are not such ends, then indeed natural law theory has been defeated
7328000	7331000	and I will happily have to hang up the lecture series at this point
7331000	7333000	and go on and sign something else to do.
7333000	7340000	But thirdly, I would contend evolutionary theory does not invalidate either the first or the second assumption,
7340000	7345000	namely the assumption that there is a distinctive kind and that there are natural ends.
7345000	7350000	There are admittedly some evolutionary theorists who make sweeping assertions
7350000	7355000	that now we can understand that morality is only a matter of custom
7355000	7360000	or perhaps that morality is only the imposition by one group of another group
7360000	7366000	of sufficient force so that they are willing to understand allegedly moral claims.
7366000	7372000	But I don't believe that those sweeping assertions are in any way intrinsic to evolutionary theory
7372000	7377000	and in fact I think that there are arbitrary assertions which are made by experts in one field
7377000	7381000	when they start speaking about a field other than their own expertise.
7381000	7385000	I tremble myself, I hope I haven't said anything wrong about evolutionary theory
7385000	7389000	lest I be an expert in one field commenting on a field which is not my expertise
7389000	7391000	but I've tried to be cautious.
7391000	7396000	Fourth, natural law students, like all students of human history,
7396000	7401000	have observed again and again that there is no biological determination
7401000	7404000	that human beings always act morally.
7404000	7406000	In fact, it is just the contrary.
7406000	7411000	I think that what we would expect if evolutionary theory could explain morality
7411000	7417000	in the ways that some of its proponents want, that there would be an automatic human moral response.
7417000	7422000	But I would reassert that acting morally always requires making a choice
7422000	7426000	in all of those circumstances where individuals need to make choices
7426000	7430000	and the fact that people make immoral choices as well as moral choices
7430000	7434000	goes to show, I think, that even if evolutionary theory is true,
7434000	7437000	it has not determined us to a particular morality.
7437000	7444000	Finally, what natural law theory offers is not a description of how human beings necessarily act
7444000	7448000	but rather some prescriptions rather than descriptions.
7448000	7452000	Prescriptions for how they ought to act in order to fulfill their end
7452000	7454000	as rational animals of the human species.
7454000	7457000	It is for this reason that we study it.
7457000	7465000	Applause
7465000	7473000	Music
7473000	7478000	Lecture 19, The Paradox of Cultural Relativism
7478000	7484000	Applause
7484000	7491000	Cultural relativism or a standard for measuring cultural progress and regress?
7491000	7496000	Throughout the 20th century the thrust of anthropology as a discipline
7496000	7501000	was often to show the irreducible diversity of cultures
7501000	7508000	and that idea of irreducible diversity proved rather appealing to those who wanted to
7508000	7512000	demean the idea that there were moral standards that were universal
7512000	7515000	as something that was provincial at best.
7515000	7518000	But at recent studies in the area of anthropology
7518000	7522000	have cast doubt on the accuracy of some of even the most famous researchers,
7522000	7527000	Margaret Mead, for instance, and the tide seems to be turning toward a position
7527000	7532000	closer toward what natural law theory has long claimed
7532000	7537000	so long as that natural law theory is alert and alive to the fact of cultural diversity.
7537000	7542000	It is not that there is any one form of government or one form of child rearing
7542000	7548000	or one form of marriage ritual that is natural and alone is right,
7548000	7553000	but rather human beings do need to devise appropriate forms
7553000	7557000	and that where natural law comes into play is in the healthy respect
7557000	7562000	for a sense of the natural need we have that it isn't a need of artificial construction.
7563000	7569000	Further, in noting the enormous diversity that does exist among human cultures,
7569000	7573000	it will be appropriate to try to reflect on some of the limits
7573000	7578000	as well as some of the powers of natural law theory to settle questions in ethics.
7578000	7583000	For just as I have often been criticizing those who were attacking natural law theory
7583000	7588000	and will today try to meet some of their objections here in the name of cultural diversity,
7588000	7591000	I think there's also a need to be cautious about natural law theory
7591000	7597000	and not to claim too much for it because to claim too much could bring the subject into disrepute.
7597000	7601000	There's no quicker way, in fact, to bring an ethical theory into contempt
7601000	7605000	than to claim that it can do what it cannot and then when it falls,
7605000	7608000	the whole theory is repudiated when in fact it had use
7608000	7612000	so far as it was given a more restricted and rational approach.
7612000	7616000	What I'd like to do then for this lecture is to consider the claims
7616000	7619000	that are made generally in the name of cultural diversity
7619000	7625000	and associated with that the claims that are made in the name of moral subjectivism
7625000	7628000	and to try to make an adequate response to those claims
7628000	7633000	on the basis of what I consider to be a measured and moderate view of natural law theory
7633000	7637000	and then to try to propose some distinctions that I think will help us
7637000	7642000	to sort out some of the more particular questions when those particular topics arise.
7642000	7647000	First, then, it's a matter of trying to appreciate cultural differences, not to deny them.
7647000	7651000	At the scholarly level of professional anthropology,
7651000	7655000	as well as at the popular level of primetime television,
7655000	7659000	there is, I think, a widespread mindfulness of the huge differences
7659000	7662000	that exist among the world's cultures.
7662000	7666000	It is not just that there is sort of a mutual amazement that takes place
7666000	7671000	when an American encounters ways of life that are very different from our own,
7671000	7674000	the ways of life of sub-Saharan Africa
7674000	7678000	or the type of life patterns that are customary in the Orient,
7678000	7681000	whether Korea or Japan or China.
7681000	7686000	There's not just those amazements we have that are typical of National Geographic specials,
7686000	7690000	but sometimes there are rather violent clashes of culture.
7690000	7693000	We see this, I think, in the recent terror campaign
7693000	7696000	by certain fundamentalists sects within Islam,
7696000	7700000	attacks that have been directed not just against the liberal West,
7700000	7703000	but in fact have also been directed against
7703000	7709000	what those particular and extreme sects have perceived as mainstream Islam,
7709000	7715000	or perhaps mainstream Islam is attempting to deal with questions of liberalization
7715000	7717000	when they try to confront modernity,
7717000	7722000	that there are enormous cultural clashes here and trying to understand them is so hard,
7722000	7728000	because we often just do not grasp right off what the assumptions of these different cultures are,
7728000	7732000	just as the other cultures do not understand our own assumptions.
7732000	7735000	Whatever one makes of the particular encounters,
7735000	7740000	whether the friendly encounters where we just express our mutual astonishment at difference
7740000	7746000	or the violent repudiation of what seems not just different but actually dangerous,
7746000	7751000	these things give us pause in our considerations about natural law ethics.
7751000	7756000	There is actually something very astonishing about natural law claims
7756000	7764000	to be able to get to objectivity and universality and intelligibility in matters of ethics,
7764000	7769000	given the wide divergences among cultures that we can observe in the world.
7769000	7773000	Cultural relativism is a particular point of view
7773000	7779000	that suggests that there are no absolute or objective moral standards
7779000	7783000	that apply to all people everywhere and at all times.
7783000	7788000	And when people make the claim that cultural relativism invalidates natural law
7788000	7791000	or any other form of objectivity and ethics,
7791000	7795000	they offer a number of reasons that I'd like to investigate now.
7795000	7801000	First reason that they typically offer is that societies, human societies differ so much
7801000	7804000	in what they consider to be morally right or wrong,
7804000	7810000	that it is impossible that there would be universal moral standards held by all societies.
7810000	7815000	In short, the fact of having different moral evaluations seems to some people to say,
7815000	7818000	well, there simply are different moralities,
7818000	7822000	moralities that are irreducible and perhaps certainly incompatible.
7822000	7827000	Second reason that is offered is that the relativists assert
7827000	7834000	that the decisive factor in whether it is right for an individual to act in a particular way
7834000	7837000	depends on that person's society.
7837000	7840000	The focus is not just on the fact of difference,
7840000	7845000	but trying to account for why it is that in any given culture we're so committed to saying
7845000	7849000	that it's this way or that way, that we're morally right or morally wrong,
7849000	7854000	and the claim is generally made that the reasons why we hold something to be right or wrong
7854000	7857000	depend on the society that we're in.
7857000	7861000	This is to say a point that I think that natural law theorists would readily agree with,
7861000	7864000	namely that morality is never found in a vacuum,
7864000	7868000	but rather morality, a certain sense of morality,
7868000	7871000	a certain level of appreciation for morality,
7871000	7874000	is always found in a context and a social context,
7874000	7878000	and that one's appreciation for morality insofar as one has it
7878000	7885000	very much depends upon the beliefs and the history and the goals and the desires of a given society.
7885000	7888000	I've been trying to bring this out for natural law ethics
7888000	7891000	when I've been attempting to make the distinction between
7891000	7895000	what natural law theory in a philosophical purity would hold
7895000	7899000	and what any given culture understands about natural law theory,
7899000	7902000	because I very much want to try to hold the position
7902000	7907000	that there can be different levels of appreciation for what the natural law demands.
7907000	7911000	The example that we've often enough given, starting from the very first lecture,
7911000	7916000	had to do, for instance, with the appreciation that only grew over the centuries that slavery was wrong,
7916000	7922000	and that this seems to me to indicate not that slavery was ever right,
7922000	7927000	but rather there were times when people did not sufficiently appreciate that slavery was wrong,
7927000	7932000	and hence that a person might not be culpable at that time or in that culture,
7932000	7936000	that a person might not be as culpable for holding the position,
7936000	7939000	and yet that it is possible to distinguish among the cultures
7939000	7942000	and to argue that there is really such a thing as moral progress,
7942000	7945000	just as there really is such a thing as moral regress.
7946000	7950000	Well, how are we to meet these objections and meet these reasonings
7950000	7953000	that the cultural relativists provide?
7953000	7958000	It seems to me that in the debates that presently dominate the academy on this subject,
7958000	7965000	cultural relativism often seems to many people to be a rather enlightened moral stance.
7965000	7971000	It seems to recognize the social matrix of any moral values,
7971000	7975000	and it seems to avoid any hint of ethnocentricity
7975000	7979000	by implying inappropriate tolerance toward other points of view.
7979000	7982000	So it seems to be just a measure of our enlightenment,
7982000	7985000	acknowledging perhaps that there are ways we do things
7985000	7988000	that would be inappropriate to do it otherwise here,
7988000	7992000	but to acknowledge that there can be different ways of doing it in other cultures,
7992000	7994000	and that's the more enlightened thing.
7994000	7997000	And then the conclusion quickly follows from that
7997000	8001000	that even within our own culture that there are appropriate stances we take
8001000	8005000	in which we grow more and more tolerant of difference and of diversity.
8005000	8010000	Now, I'd like to try to meet those challenges and do it in a respectful way
8010000	8014000	because I think that there is a certain element of tremendous truth here,
8014000	8018000	namely in moral diversity, in the fact that different cultures have different approaches,
8018000	8023000	but I would urge that position from the point of view of progress and regress
8023000	8028000	and to say that the toleration that we need to exhibit in order to live together rationally
8028000	8033000	and the sense historically we have of the possibilities of moral growth
8033000	8039000	allow a different explanation of the phenomenon that the relativist so quickly leans upon.
8039000	8045000	First, I'd like to ask the relativist exactly on what basis one would ever dare
8045000	8047000	to criticize those who are intolerant.
8047000	8052000	Now, this is a sort of a self-referential argument that a philosopher likes to make,
8052000	8058000	namely that if a relativist needs to insist that we need ultimately to be intolerant,
8058000	8062000	on what basis can you ever criticize those who choose not to be tolerant?
8062000	8067000	That is, it's another point of view and that there's some internal contradiction right in that point of view
8067000	8072000	unless they're willing to say that the principle of tolerance is absolute and not relative.
8072000	8074000	And so it's a kind of exception to relativism.
8074000	8077000	But I think that there's a problem there that needs to be met.
8077000	8081000	More substantially, however, I'd like to raise a second kind of problem, namely
8081000	8089000	how would a cultural relativist ever rationally criticize someone for a rather heinous position?
8089000	8093000	Here, the idea, I think, in terms of moral argumentation
8093000	8097000	is to start not with a hard case, but to start with an easy case.
8097000	8101000	So, for example, if one were to take Adolf Hitler's genocidal policies
8101000	8104000	or if one were to take a policy of blatant racism
8104000	8107000	or if one were to take an institution like slavery
8107000	8111000	or if one were to take wars that were fought purely for conquest
8111000	8116000	which offered no other rational consideration as justification,
8116000	8121000	on what basis can a cultural relativist oppose any of those?
8121000	8125000	That is, if it's something for which there is a tradition within a given culture
8125000	8128000	to be, for instance, prejudiced against certain groups
8128000	8132000	and not to regard them as included within human protection
8132000	8137000	or if there are opportunities to enslave certain kinds of people
8137000	8141000	if there are ways in which we can simply make for class systems
8141000	8144000	so that some people aren't enslaved but they are deprived
8144000	8147000	and not given the privileges of the rest
8147000	8151000	or if wars may be fought simply because this is natural
8151000	8154000	that the stronger should try to succeed,
8154000	8157000	on what basis could a cultural relativist oppose these?
8157000	8160000	And I find it difficult to imagine a consistent position
8160000	8162000	that a cultural relativist would maintain.
8162000	8165000	I think the cultural relativist would be in the position
8165000	8168000	of simply asserting that there are cultures of different strength
8168000	8172000	and that there is no such thing, no way, rationally, to criticize these
8172000	8178000	but rather that they are merely patterns of domination and contrasts of power.
8178000	8181000	Linked to the second objection is the third one, namely
8181000	8186000	the very curious problem about finding a justification within relativism
8186000	8188000	for social reform.
8188000	8192000	Because social reform is something that is, I think, highly important
8192000	8197000	and needs to be considered in every age, however enlightened we think we are
8197000	8202000	because what is enlightened by one generation may be not so enlightened
8202000	8204000	from another generation's point of view
8204000	8208000	when other insights have occurred about human nature and its needs.
8208000	8212000	But for cultural relativists there's an enormous problem in principle
8212000	8217000	about how one is ever going to get social reform within a culture.
8217000	8220000	It's not even criticizing someone outside the culture
8220000	8225000	but right within the culture how one is ever going to justify social reform
8225000	8228000	if it means going against prevailing cultural standards.
8228000	8231000	Considering our own culture, for instance, in the 18th century
8231000	8236000	in which a number of people of great seriousness and intelligence
8236000	8238000	supported slavery in the culture.
8238000	8241000	Or if one were to go to a different culture other than our own
8241000	8245000	one might consider, for instance, the practice that was current in India
8245000	8250000	of the sati, the burning of widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands.
8250000	8254000	Or perhaps just to take something that has been common to the entire West
8254000	8257000	the notion that I think that we would all subscribe to
8257000	8261000	namely that one should give women equal pay for equal work.
8261000	8265000	All of these strike me as in some way or other challenging a position
8265000	8267000	that is within one's own culture
8267000	8270000	and for which there is tremendous social support
8270000	8273000	and for which there has been long cultural tradition.
8273000	8277000	How on the basis of cultural relativism could one ever say
8277000	8281000	that the practice in question needs to be challenged and needs to be changed?
8281000	8284000	I think from the point of view of a natural law theory
8284000	8287000	or other theories of objectivity and ethics
8287000	8290000	it is possible now to debate any of those issues
8290000	8293000	and I don't think that natural law would immediately assume that
8293000	8297000	the old system was right or that the potential reform was right
8297000	8302000	but that rather you have to decide the question on the basis of the analysis of human nature
8302000	8306000	asking whether women are human as much as men are
8306000	8308000	presumably we say yes, maybe more so
8308000	8313000	whether any given group of people by their race or by their religion
8313000	8318000	are equally human and deserving of equal human protection, of equal human respect.
8318000	8324000	Hence, social reform strikes me as having necessarily a foot in the analysis of nature
8324000	8327000	and while it can be profitably promoted
8327000	8332000	in terms of what is advantageous and economically beneficial reasons
8332000	8334000	which can be given of a consequential nature
8334000	8337000	nonetheless there has to be some basis in human nature
8337000	8341000	for the very possibility of social reform and principle.
8341000	8345000	In short, unless we have an objective moral basis for law
8345000	8350000	it is difficult to see why there is any justification for reform
8350000	8354000	and even any justification for obedience to law in general
8354000	8358000	and unless there is a universal priority for moral law
8358000	8364000	it is hard for me to understand how there could ever be a basis for civil disobedience against unjust laws
8364000	8369000	the kind of thing, for instance, that Dr. Martin Luther King or Gandhi was so well known
8369000	8372000	all there would ever be would be power struggles
8372000	8376000	and if that's all there is, then morality in fact makes no sense
8376000	8378000	and we should give up the game.
8378000	8381000	Now, allied sometimes to cultural relativism
8381000	8385000	is the more particular form of relativism in matters of ethics
8385000	8390000	that generally goes under the name of subjectivism, subjective ethical relativism
8390000	8397000	and this is the position that morality always, ultimately, depends upon the individual
8397000	8401000	as if morality, like taste, were always in the eye of the beholder.
8401000	8406000	One sees this frequently, let me read one of my favorite quotes to try to bring this out
8406000	8411000	namely Ernest Hemingway, a great novelist but an ethical relativist if I ever saw one.
8411000	8412000	He says,
8412000	8419000	So far, about morals, I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after
8419000	8422000	and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.
8422000	8427000	Judged by these moral standards which I do not defend, he says,
8427000	8433000	The bullfight is very moral to me because I feel very fine while it is going on
8433000	8438000	and I have a feeling of life and death and mortality and immortality
8438000	8442000	and after it is over, I feel very sad but very fine
8442000	8447000	and that comes from his death in the afternoon and it wouldn't be hard to multiply other search quotes.
8447000	8453000	On a basis of anything like this, whether Hemingway expressing it in fine literary form
8453000	8457000	or on the basis of the much more immediate reaction that the college sophomore has,
8457000	8464000	morality is simply useless for there is no possibility of interpersonal criticism.
8464000	8470000	I do not mean that any of us should stand on a soapbox or stand in a pulpit and assume that we're right.
8470000	8477000	My point rather as philosopher here is to say that morality depends upon interpersonal criticism.
8477000	8485000	The suggestion that we need to examine our own presumptions and the things that we spontaneously and intuitively feel are right
8485000	8488000	and the things that other present to us as intuitively right.
8488000	8492000	Things that are somehow in their gut needing to be objected to
8492000	8497000	or things that with their feelings they need to support and to emphasize and to assert.
8497000	8503000	There is need for rational argument and there will be some limits to what rational argument can figure out
8503000	8507000	and there especially one will need to have great tolerance and great respect
8507000	8511000	for what rationality cannot figure out where there are many things in life
8511000	8514000	I think where it needs to stop short and be humble.
8514000	8520000	But if we took the position of a Hemingway or the position of any ethical relativist
8520000	8525000	then morality will simply be a matter of how we feel and it will make no difference
8525000	8530000	that a Francis of Assisi or a Teresa of Calcutta or anyone might feel differently.
8530000	8536000	Now in a philosophy class when I meet this I try to bring out the inadequacy of the point of view
8536000	8542000	by suggesting that alright I too may take the position of subjective relativism
8542000	8546000	and so when tests come back I mark them in great detail what I liked and what I disliked
8546000	8550000	what I thought was good reasoning and what is bad reasoning and then I give everybody F's.
8550000	8554000	And in the course of giving everybody an F there's of course enormous outrage
8554000	8560000	and they're unsatisfied by the notion that I have adopted subjective relativism as my standard.
8560000	8565000	Invariably they have a sense at this point that such a standard is objectively unjust.
8565000	8570000	I don't think that that's a full philosophical refutation it's more the practical refutation
8570000	8576000	which sometimes there is need when one is adhering to the subjective relativism
8576000	8582000	for reasons that are actually not the stated reasons but for reasons of seeing the consequences
8582000	8585000	that are going to come if there is an objective morality.
8585000	8590000	But how philosophically does one establish a more adequate response?
8590000	8597000	It seems to me that a more adequate response requires that we are mindful of some crucial distinctions
8597000	8604000	about what natural law in any of its forms does hold and what natural law does not claim.
8604000	8610000	The claim to objectivity and universality that I have been urging all this course
8610000	8616000	is not a claim that there is an absolute identity around the world in matters of morality.
8616000	8623000	In fact natural law I think tries to be attentive to the realm of creativity that is legitimate.
8623000	8628000	In fact it is to be expected given human understanding and all of its possibilities
8628000	8634000	and given the real factor of human freedom that is there are many ways in which we can try to sort out
8634000	8639000	how we arrange our families, how we arrange our governments, how we arrange our economies
8639000	8645000	and that it is only appropriate to mention that there needs to be certain limits on natural law claims.
8645000	8648000	There needs to be certain limits on how much we think we can settle
8648000	8652000	and I suspect that it is better to think in terms of a range.
8652000	8657000	This is one of the great contributions that virtue theory always adds to natural law theory
8657000	8660000	when the two of them are put together as a moral theory.
8660000	8665000	Namely that there are certain things which will be excessive and will be wrong regardless of who does them when.
8666000	8671000	There are certain things which will be deficient and will be always wrong no matter who does them when.
8671000	8675000	But that within the range there is a virtue that is possible.
8675000	8680000	There are things that are permissible on either side but that one can come to a peak of excellence
8680000	8684000	and understand by virtue what would be a truly excellent response
8684000	8688000	because it most brings out human maturation and human flourishing.
8688000	8692000	But we acknowledge that there is a bit of a bump,
8692000	8698000	that there is a bit of a range of excellence within a larger range of what is permissible.
8698000	8704000	The question then as I see it is not whether there is a range of legitimate human responses
8704000	8708000	to some of those basic and recurrent questions that life presents
8708000	8711000	such as how to take care of the needs of the young
8711000	8716000	or the needs of the old or the needs of those who have been rendered exceptionally dependent
8716000	8720000	or on questions about how to govern ourselves, how to arrange economics,
8720000	8724000	not only how to provide bare necessities but how to improve the standard of living.
8724000	8730000	Rather, the question that natural law or other allied theories need to face
8730000	8735000	is whether there are certain actions, certain practices and customs
8735000	8742000	and indeed certain character traits which are unacceptable at any time, anywhere.
8742000	8748000	If this is so, then natural law will have established against cultural relativism
8748000	8753000	or against ethical relativism that at least there is a set, however small,
8753000	8758000	there is a set of precepts, universal and kind but negative,
8758000	8762000	of things which are objectively injurious to human nature
8762000	8766000	and will be objectively injurious at all times and universally.
8766000	8771000	Likewise on the positive side one may ask if there are certain duties
8771000	8777000	that individuals and groups in any culture whatsoever will necessarily have
8777000	8781000	when they find themselves in a given set of circumstances,
8781000	8784000	recurrent situations that they have to face.
8784000	8789000	If, when a given circumstance, for example, now children have been generated by me,
8789000	8793000	if I find myself in the situation where children have been generated,
8793000	8797000	don't I bear the need somehow to make sure that they get educated,
8797000	8801000	that they get reared, that they get raised, that they are taught how to love
8801000	8804000	and how to receive love. The ways in which I do it might vary
8804000	8809000	but the natural obligation to make sure that I take care of what I'm responsible for
8809000	8813000	seems to be a positive duty that is obligatory always and everywhere,
8813000	8818000	even if the ways in which that obligation is answered are extremely varied
8818000	8821000	and human creativity allows a certain number of options.
8821000	8825000	These options might vary considerably within a culture
8825000	8828000	as well as varying from culture to culture.
8828000	8831000	Further, in the range of what is permissible,
8831000	8836000	there is also, I think, a question about whether certain policies and certain practices
8836000	8839000	might be preferable for human development,
8839000	8843000	whether preferable because they produce really virtuous individuals
8843000	8845000	or preferable for cultures,
8845000	8849000	precisely because they will allow the culture to make better progress
8849000	8854000	at providing for the material circumstances within which people may be free
8854000	8858000	and don't have to spend all of their time scratching out the daily necessities,
8858000	8862000	granting that a culture is still quite legitimate and moral
8862000	8866000	if it is arranged in such a way that people scratch out their daily necessities
8866000	8870000	and don't have time for the freedom that is necessary in politics
8870000	8874000	or in literature or in the devising of great accomplishments
8874000	8876000	or raising up heroic standards,
8876000	8879000	but nonetheless there will be something intrinsically better about a culture
8879000	8885000	which provides for the material necessities in a way that gives us the opportunities
8885000	8889000	that leisure and culture in the higher sense of high culture make possible
8889000	8892000	as well as gives us patterns of development
8892000	8895000	which increase our moral character,
8895000	8899000	which stand better for making us honest and virtue and even generous.
8899000	8902000	It seems to me that it is quite possible to identify
8902000	8906000	certain ways in which cultures may experience moral regress
8906000	8910000	and even be suffering from a kind of moral blindness.
8910000	8913000	Now with that said, I think that the test has to come
8913000	8916000	by examining the particularities of human nature
8916000	8919000	and I think that there is a certain body of evidence
8919000	8923000	that has been growing in the community of sociologists and anthropologists
8923000	8928000	which is refuting the cultural relativism which was so prominent
8928000	8931000	in advocates like Margaret Mead and such.
8931000	8934000	The sociologist Clyde Cluckhorn writes,
8934000	8938000	quote, every culture has a concept of murder,
8938000	8941000	distinguishing this from execution,
8941000	8945000	killing in war, and other justifiable homicides,
8945000	8949000	the notions of incest and other regulations upon sexual behavior,
8949000	8953000	the prohibitions upon untruth under defined circumstances,
8953000	8956000	of restitution and reciprocity,
8956000	8959000	of mutual obligations between parents and children.
8959000	8964000	These and many other moral concepts are altogether universal.
8964000	8966000	Likewise, the students of Margaret Mead
8966000	8968000	who have gone back to investigate
8968000	8971000	some of her detailed investigations in New Guinea
8971000	8978000	have found that she was often outwitted by some of the inhabitants of New Guinea
8978000	8979000	that she was investigating,
8979000	8983000	that the people were much more sophisticated than she thought that they were
8983000	8986000	and that they were unwilling to disclose some of the private practices
8986000	8989000	that they had and cherished so much in their civilization.
8989000	8994000	But as people have gone back and researched the very same groups which she investigated,
8994000	8998000	they have found that, in fact, people had precisely the moral standards
8998000	9001000	adapted to their culture and forms of expression
9001000	9003000	that she denied they're having,
9003000	9005000	but which she never saw or came to understand
9005000	9008000	precisely because they were unwilling to include her
9008000	9011000	within the range of their experience.
9011000	9014000	Certainly within my own religious order, the Jesuits,
9014000	9018000	many of our missionaries have found that it is very difficult to understand a culture
9018000	9022000	until one starts the practices of the culture.
9022000	9025000	One has to live long enough within the culture
9025000	9027000	and be trusted within the culture,
9027000	9029000	undertaking some of their rituals
9029000	9032000	before one will understand yet other rituals
9032000	9036000	to which they will never give access to someone who comes from outside the culture.
9036000	9038000	And as missionaries have had experience,
9038000	9040000	one finds that a missionary who comes into a country
9040000	9043000	full of his own ideas will get almost nowhere.
9043000	9046000	But rather, there requires a deep appreciation
9046000	9048000	for what that culture most treasures
9048000	9051000	and when one examines what that culture most treasures
9051000	9053000	and has a deep receptivity to it,
9053000	9056000	there is frequently a natural all basis to it
9056000	9058000	because they are dealing with humankind
9058000	9060000	and some of the need to formulate a response
9060000	9064000	to life's recurred questions about how to raise one's family,
9064000	9067000	how to care for the dependent, and how to govern oneself.
9067000	9070000	One can also see evidence of a negative nature.
9070000	9076000	The sociologist Colin Turnbull has done research on tribes in northern Uganda,
9076000	9078000	and I found some of his studies very illuminating.
9078000	9080000	One is called the Mountain People,
9080000	9083000	and he's commenting upon how a tribe self-destructs
9083000	9085000	in a very sadistic manner.
9085000	9089000	He argues that a people like the Iqt people of northern Uganda,
9089000	9092000	a people who which have for reasons that are largely
9092000	9095000	the result of their interaction with other tribes
9095000	9098000	when they were losing ground and became extremely frustrated,
9098000	9101000	that when they lose principles such as kindness,
9101000	9103000	loyalty, and cooperation,
9103000	9106000	they will swiftly fall into a state of nature
9106000	9108000	very much like Hobbes described,
9108000	9110000	in which there is war of all against all,
9110000	9112000	and that this reinforces the notion
9112000	9115000	that there are certain moral principles which have to be respected
9115000	9118000	if the tribe is to last, if the tribe is to succeed.
9118000	9122000	Now it seems to me as we ponder these questions philosophically
9122000	9124000	and try to appreciate what the sociologists
9124000	9127000	and the anthropologists have been discovering,
9127000	9130000	it seems to me that a philosophical distinction
9130000	9132000	has come to great effect here,
9132000	9135000	namely that the cases that are usually brought up
9135000	9138000	as instances of cultural relativism
9138000	9141000	can be handled better if we distinguish more carefully
9141000	9144000	between questions of moral principle
9144000	9147000	and questions about how to interpret the facts.
9147000	9149000	If we grow confused about those,
9149000	9151000	we will take difference in the facts
9151000	9153000	to indicate difference in moral principle.
9153000	9156000	But if instead we distinguish those a little bit more carefully,
9156000	9159000	there are ways of handling some of these great cases.
9159000	9161000	Let me try two or three and ask you to judge
9161000	9164000	and see if you think the distinction makes sense.
9164000	9167000	Hindu refusals to eat the flesh of animals.
9167000	9172000	Clearly contrasts very sharply with our western carnivorous diets.
9172000	9176000	But the difference seems to me to turn on a question of fact
9176000	9178000	and not a question of principle.
9178000	9181000	That is, neither culture tolerates cannibalism
9181000	9183000	as a matter of moral principle.
9183000	9186000	Where we disagree is whether the flesh of animals
9186000	9189000	could be the repository of human spirits.
9189000	9192000	For the reason that Hindus give, as near as I can tell,
9192000	9195000	that they will not eat certain kinds of animal flesh
9195000	9199000	is that they could be the repository of human spirits.
9199000	9201000	The principle in question is the same,
9201000	9205000	a refusal to in any way undertake cannibalism.
9205000	9208000	Even when one deals with those isolated cannibal tribes
9208000	9210000	who do eat human flesh,
9210000	9212000	what the anthropologists have discovered
9212000	9214000	is that they never eat members of their own tribe,
9214000	9216000	but only those of other tribes,
9216000	9219000	which they have by a certain kind of verbal semantics
9219000	9221000	to consider not human.
9221000	9224000	In my judgment, they are mistaken as questions of fact
9224000	9226000	and how to interpret the fact of their nature,
9226000	9228000	but they still have an understanding,
9228000	9230000	however limited, of the principle.
9230000	9232000	Even within our own culture,
9232000	9234000	I think you can use the same distinction
9234000	9236000	and I propose this next example
9236000	9238000	in light of the fact that we shouldn't just consider
9238000	9241000	our difference with the Hindus or our difference with the cannibals,
9241000	9242000	even when our own culture
9242000	9245000	when we have such enormous moral differences sometimes.
9245000	9249000	On a question as contentious as the permissibility of abortion,
9249000	9252000	there is, I think, this much of a common moral principle
9252000	9255000	in those who favor legally permitting abortion
9255000	9257000	and those who are opposed to it,
9257000	9261000	namely that we should never kill innocent persons.
9261000	9263000	But what we disagree about is a fact,
9263000	9267000	namely we disagree about whether the unborn really are persons
9267000	9269000	and whether zygots and embryos and fetuses
9269000	9272000	deserve protection as persons.
9272000	9275000	If this is true that what we disagree about are the facts,
9275000	9278000	then I welcome all further investigation
9278000	9281000	and all further consideration about the natures of
9281000	9284000	human embryos and zygots and fetuses
9284000	9286000	for a resolution of the question of the fact
9286000	9289000	if we indeed agree upon the question of principle
9289000	9291000	will help in the discussion.
9291000	9294000	In the next hour, we'll turn to yet other interesting questions
9294000	9296000	that natural law must face.
9297000	9302000	APPLAUSE
9306000	9314000	MUSIC
9314000	9317000	Lecture 20, The Problem of God
9317000	9323000	APPLAUSE
9323000	9325000	In our lecture series,
9325000	9328000	we have been considering some of the problems
9328000	9331000	that contemporary natural law theory must face,
9331000	9333000	things like question of evolution,
9333000	9336000	things like cultural relativism.
9336000	9338000	Today I'd like to take up yet one more topic
9338000	9340000	in that particular line,
9340000	9343000	namely the question about religious commitment,
9343000	9346000	whether natural law is a religious philosophy,
9346000	9349000	whether natural law necessarily presumes
9349000	9352000	belief in the existence of God.
9353000	9356000	The existence of a natural moral law
9356000	9358000	does at least seem prima facie
9358000	9360000	to suppose the existence of a law giver.
9360000	9362000	How can you have a law without someone
9362000	9364000	who promulgated that law?
9364000	9366000	And I suppose it's for this reason
9366000	9369000	that many religious traditions have sensed
9369000	9372000	some kind of very deep-seated compatibility
9372000	9375000	between a basic natural law ethics
9375000	9377000	and their own beliefs.
9377000	9380000	And yet there have been a number of thinkers
9380000	9383000	in various traditions who have not made
9383000	9385000	this particular connection.
9385000	9387000	One thinks of Aristotle, for instance,
9387000	9389000	whose God is just so remote and distant
9389000	9391000	and doesn't seem to play much role
9391000	9394000	in his explicitly ethical writings.
9394000	9397000	One thinks of the Stoics in antiquity,
9397000	9400000	who had a sense of a cosmic God,
9400000	9403000	but it's a very pantheistic sort of universe.
9403000	9405000	It's not a personal God.
9405000	9407000	In the early modern period,
9407000	9409000	atheists, whom we discussed,
9409000	9411000	who at least raised the question,
9411000	9413000	wouldn't there still be a natural law
9413000	9415000	even if there were no God?
9415000	9417000	And then there are some explicit atheists
9417000	9419000	who are natural law thinkers.
9419000	9421000	I consider, in particular,
9421000	9423000	Ernst Bloch, the Marxist to be one of those,
9423000	9425000	who is explicit in his denials
9425000	9427000	of the existence of God,
9427000	9429000	and yet is a natural law thinker
9429000	9431000	in many respects.
9431000	9433000	On the other hand, there are some thinkers
9433000	9435000	for whom the very existence
9435000	9437000	of natural law is something
9437000	9440000	that demonstrates the existence of God.
9440000	9442000	Cardinal Newman is one of those
9442000	9444000	whose argument for the existence of God
9444000	9446000	from conscience seems to work
9446000	9448000	in just the opposite direction.
9448000	9450000	So what we do well, I think,
9450000	9452000	is to consider, for this lecture period,
9452000	9454000	various questions pertaining
9454000	9456000	to religion and natural law.
9456000	9459000	I'd like to divide up our time in this lecture.
9459000	9462000	First, considering just the nature of the questions,
9462000	9464000	because it's a very complicated issue, I think.
9464000	9467000	Secondly, I'd like to propose a distinction.
9467000	9469000	A distinction between the way in which
9469000	9472000	natural law is grounded itself,
9472000	9474000	as opposed to what we must know
9474000	9477000	about the natural law and about its ground.
9477000	9480000	And I think the God question is relevant there.
9480000	9482000	And then, thirdly, I'd like to consider
9482000	9485000	some of the ramifications of this set of positions.
9485000	9488000	First, then, just some general questions
9488000	9491000	about how God is related to natural law theory.
9491000	9494000	Some of the questions that are raised
9494000	9496000	pertain to the reality of the matter,
9496000	9498000	whether there is a God.
9498000	9500000	So, for instance, we could ask,
9500000	9502000	does natural law obligation
9502000	9504000	rest upon there being a God
9504000	9506000	who is the source of the obligation?
9506000	9508000	What if there is no God?
9508000	9510000	Is there still natural law?
9510000	9512000	I think that's the first set of questions.
9512000	9514000	And that's a set of questions dependent upon
9514000	9516000	how the reality is.
9516000	9518000	But there's a second set of questions
9518000	9520000	about one's knowledge of all this.
9520000	9522000	And one could ask, for instance,
9522000	9525000	suppose a given person doesn't believe in God.
9525000	9527000	Now, that's separate from whether there is one.
9527000	9529000	We're now talking about the subjective side.
9529000	9532000	The person doesn't believe in God.
9532000	9535000	Can there still be a knowledge of natural law,
9535000	9537000	or at least of objective morality,
9537000	9539000	for such a person?
9539000	9541000	Or what if the person is not
9541000	9543000	in the state of actual disbelief,
9543000	9545000	but rather is more agnostic
9545000	9547000	and seeking and searching?
9547000	9549000	What if a person just doesn't know about God?
9549000	9551000	What will be the likely stance
9551000	9553000	as regards to natural law?
9553000	9555000	Or, finally, with questions of knowledge
9555000	9557000	and questions of the subject,
9557000	9559000	what if you have two people in a discussion
9559000	9561000	or several who have different assumptions
9561000	9563000	about God?
9563000	9565000	About what kind of God there is,
9565000	9568000	or how active and involved this God might be?
9568000	9571000	What is the relation of that to natural law?
9571000	9574000	It seems to me, in the study of this subject,
9574000	9576000	that there is absolutely no doubt
9576000	9579000	that there is some sort of connection
9579000	9582000	between the problem of natural law
9582000	9584000	and the problem of God.
9584000	9586000	But I think it really is difficult
9586000	9588000	to establish exactly what connection there is.
9588000	9590000	The way I'd like to discuss this
9590000	9592000	is to ask you to think about direction.
9592000	9595000	Some of the thinkers in our survey,
9595000	9597000	some of the thinkers like to move
9597000	9599000	from morality to God.
9599000	9601000	Others, on the other hand,
9601000	9603000	like to move from God to morality.
9603000	9606000	And I think that will help us at least divide the question.
9606000	9609000	First, is the study of morality
9609000	9611000	and the study of natural law
9611000	9614000	a way to come to know that there is a God?
9614000	9616000	Or does one already have to know
9616000	9619000	that God exists before one can show
9619000	9621000	that there is such a thing as a really binding
9621000	9623000	and obligatory natural law?
9623000	9625000	The first figure I would consider with you
9625000	9627000	is John Henry Cardinal Newman,
9627000	9630000	who was a great British thinker
9630000	9632000	in the end of the last century,
9632000	9634000	and he certainly preferred the route
9634000	9636000	of going from morals to God.
9636000	9638000	That the acquaintance we have
9638000	9640000	with objective morality
9640000	9642000	is something that will give us a reason
9642000	9644000	for thinking that there is a God
9644000	9646000	even if we're unable to establish
9646000	9648000	the existence of that God philosophically
9648000	9650000	in any other way.
9650000	9653000	The argument here is that we might very well
9653000	9655000	come to a sense of moral duty,
9655000	9657000	a sense of moral obligation.
9657000	9659000	But for that moral duty
9659000	9661000	and that moral obligation
9661000	9664000	to be entirely and completely and absolutely true,
9664000	9667000	there's got to be someone to whom we are obliged.
9667000	9670000	Let me read a short passage from his book
9670000	9672000	A Grammar of Ascent.
9672000	9673000	He says,
9673000	9675000	If, as is the case,
9675000	9677000	we feel responsibility,
9677000	9679000	if we are ashamed,
9679000	9681000	frightened at transgressing
9681000	9683000	the voice of conscience,
9683000	9685000	this implies that there is one
9685000	9687000	to whom we are responsible,
9687000	9690000	before whom we are ashamed,
9690000	9692000	whose claim upon us we fear.
9692000	9694000	And from that point,
9694000	9696000	Newman goes on to try to make his argument
9696000	9698000	for the existence of God.
9698000	9700000	Other thinkers, however,
9700000	9702000	starting from that same position,
9702000	9704000	namely the fact of conscience,
9704000	9706000	the inescapability of moral obligation,
9706000	9708000	others come to a very different stance
9708000	9710000	on whether or not we must
9710000	9712000	then come to a knowledge of God.
9712000	9714000	Immanuel Kant, whom we were discussing
9714000	9716000	a few lectures ago,
9716000	9718000	is one of these.
9718000	9720000	He holds that we can indeed
9720000	9722000	be very, very certain
9722000	9724000	about the nature and strictures
9724000	9726000	involved in morality,
9726000	9728000	but he is so insistent at the same time
9728000	9730000	that we can never transcend
9730000	9732000	the realm of space and time
9732000	9735000	to a spiritual or transcendent entity
9735000	9738000	that we can still not rely upon
9738000	9740000	their being a God on the basis
9740000	9742000	of our morality.
9742000	9744000	Rather, we must postulate
9744000	9745000	such a God.
9745000	9747000	And so he is famous for the theory
9747000	9749000	of postulatory theism,
9749000	9751000	saying, although we can't know for sure
9751000	9753000	that there is one, we must live
9753000	9755000	as though there is one.
9755000	9757000	And so it's a philosophy of the as-if.
9757000	9759000	But in just the opposite spirit,
9759000	9761000	the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre
9761000	9763000	contends that we have to be
9763000	9765000	postulatory atheists
9765000	9767000	because of morality.
9767000	9769000	His idea, I disagree with it strongly,
9769000	9771000	but it's only fair to represent it,
9771000	9773000	his idea is that the very
9773000	9775000	existence of a God
9775000	9777000	would compromise our freedom,
9777000	9779000	would compromise our liberty
9779000	9781000	because it would restrain
9781000	9783000	and restrict and confine
9783000	9785000	human autonomy to a set of
9785000	9787000	external standards in such a way
9787000	9789000	that he thinks that we could never be
9789000	9791000	adequately free.
9791000	9793000	I'll return to that question of freedom
9793000	9795000	a little bit later in this lecture series.
9795000	9797000	Many theorists, on the other hand,
9797000	9799000	I would say the mainstream
9799000	9801000	with regard to natural law thinking
9801000	9803000	would hold that we should really
9803000	9805000	change the direction, not from
9805000	9807000	morals to God, but rather
9807000	9809000	from the existence of God to morality.
9809000	9811000	And in so arguing,
9811000	9813000	they think that it is
9813000	9815000	necessary to clarify what sort
9815000	9817000	of God this is.
9817000	9819000	Those figures who have a sort of
9819000	9821000	an impersonal cosmic deity,
9821000	9823000	not in any way loving or just,
9823000	9825000	come to a certain stance with regard
9825000	9827000	to justice and virtue.
9827000	9829000	Other figures think that we
9829000	9831000	must start from God and know
9831000	9833000	that God is a personal God,
9833000	9835000	that this God is someone who is truly
9835000	9837000	loving and deeply concerned
9837000	9839000	and that that makes a difference for
9839000	9841000	how the nature of morality is set up.
9841000	9843000	Thomas Aquinas, for instance,
9843000	9845000	who we have been citing throughout our series,
9845000	9847000	is very much inclined
9847000	9849000	to a personal notion of a God
9849000	9851000	who has created the world
9851000	9853000	and loves this world, and he thinks
9853000	9855000	of natural law very distinctively
9855000	9857000	as our human participation
9857000	9859000	in God's own providence.
9859000	9861000	That God who set up the world
9861000	9863000	and set up all the natures of things
9863000	9865000	within the world, each one having
9865000	9867000	a natural directedness
9867000	9869000	toward their end, similarly
9869000	9871000	has given us human beings
9871000	9873000	a nature with an end directedness
9873000	9875000	to which we are naturally inclined,
9875000	9877000	and yet we share
9877000	9879000	even more deeply in God's
9879000	9881000	own loving and providential
9881000	9883000	and personally directed plan
9883000	9885000	by having personal intelligence ourselves.
9885000	9887000	For us, it's a matter
9887000	9889000	of sharing in the work of divine providence
9889000	9891000	by coming to realize
9891000	9893000	what the natural law is,
9893000	9895000	thinking out how to get to this
9895000	9897000	end, and not just thinking it out
9897000	9899000	for ourselves, but being immediately
9899000	9901000	responsible for our families
9901000	9903000	and for our communities, even for all mankind.
9903000	9905000	One thinks of Aquinas'
9905000	9907000	own great source in the matter
9907000	9909000	of ethics, which is as frequently
9909000	9911000	Aristotle as it is the Bible,
9911000	9913000	and one sees in someone like Aristotle
9913000	9915000	a thinker who has
9915000	9917000	a notion of God,
9917000	9919000	who has a notion that natural
9919000	9921000	law is as eternal as God is,
9921000	9923000	and yet his God is so distant,
9923000	9925000	so cool. Aristotle's God
9925000	9927000	is pure mind, and mind
9927000	9929000	not thinking about the world, but mind
9929000	9931000	thinking about itself,
9931000	9933000	only concerned with thinking
9933000	9935000	about the very best object.
9935000	9937000	In a way, this is part of the reason
9937000	9939000	why the sage for Aristotelian
9939000	9941000	philosophy has, as his own
9941000	9943000	natural and pure contemplation,
9943000	9945000	and only secondarily, the world of action.
9945000	9947000	There are, however,
9947000	9949000	a number of natural law thinkers
9949000	9951000	who fall in the category
9951000	9953000	of thinking that the question of God
9953000	9955000	and the question of natural law
9955000	9957000	are simply utterly separate.
9957000	9959000	Hugo Grotzius, I suppose,
9959000	9961000	falls into this category,
9961000	9963000	for he was the one who, at the beginning
9963000	9965000	of the modern period,
9965000	9967000	very mindful of ecclesiastical
9967000	9969000	debates and for
9969000	9971000	separation of the churches,
9971000	9973000	thought that perhaps natural law would be
9973000	9975000	a wonderful way for
9975000	9977000	reconciling these religious divergences
9977000	9979000	and finding practical ways
9979000	9981000	to work at social harmony.
9981000	9983000	And at one point in his book
9983000	9985000	on the right of war and peace,
9985000	9987000	on the law of war and peace,
9987000	9989000	he writes, what we have just said
9989000	9991000	about natural law would
9991000	9993000	still hold, even if we granted
9993000	9995000	that there is no God, or that
9995000	9997000	he is not concerned with human affairs.
9997000	9999000	There you have a thinker who is not denying
9999000	10001000	the assistance of God. In fact,
10001000	10003000	to think he is a very God-fearing man,
10003000	10005000	he simply thinks that morality
10005000	10007000	is independent of the God question.
10007000	10009000	The ancient Stoics, in a way,
10009000	10011000	are sort of in this category,
10011000	10013000	for although they have a God,
10013000	10015000	the God is so impersonal,
10015000	10017000	their system is so pantheistic
10017000	10019000	and so deeply material,
10019000	10021000	that there is no particular relevance
10021000	10023000	that the God has, except that he is
10023000	10025000	part of the system, and that somehow
10025000	10027000	our own moral living and use
10027000	10029000	is a participation, a seeking
10029000	10031000	of harmony in this divine system.
10031000	10033000	But one could do the thought experiment
10033000	10035000	and ask what difference it makes
10035000	10037000	in practice. And then finally,
10037000	10039000	as I mentioned in the introduction,
10039000	10041000	there are a number of contemporary Marxist theories,
10041000	10043000	and this might be a little surprising,
10043000	10045000	because we don't tend to associate
10045000	10047000	natural law with Marxism,
10047000	10049000	except when we think back
10049000	10051000	to the way in which Marxism
10051000	10053000	invariably tends to think of
10053000	10055000	the nature of the entire species.
10055000	10057000	They would consider, at least in their pure
10057000	10059000	theorists, they would consider
10059000	10061000	human nature to be the decisive
10061000	10063000	category, because you're thinking of species
10063000	10065000	being, rather than thinking
10065000	10067000	of individuals as having
10067000	10069000	the greatest worth. And
10069000	10071000	for Ernst Bloch, religion is simply
10071000	10073000	one of those tools by which
10073000	10075000	there is oppression of the weak
10075000	10077000	by the powerful, and
10077000	10079000	that natural law instead is part of the way
10079000	10081000	to rescue this, by remembering what the
10081000	10083000	nature of the species is. He writes
10083000	10085000	about this in a very interesting book called
10085000	10087000	Natural Law and Human Dignity.
10087000	10089000	Another group that
10089000	10091000	I should mention here briefly to conclude
10091000	10093000	this part of the survey are the people
10093000	10095000	who want to urge that one
10095000	10097000	cannot get to a natural law ethics
10097000	10099000	at all, but rather that one
10099000	10101000	must look to God as the source of morality.
10101000	10103000	So instead of someone like Aquinas
10103000	10105000	who thinks that these are overlapping
10105000	10107000	sources who both can give
10107000	10109000	you the same insight, whether the insight
10109000	10111000	about morality comes from God
10111000	10113000	or whether the insight about morality
10113000	10115000	comes from nature, there are a number
10115000	10117000	of figures for whom
10117000	10119000	it is not possible to get from
10119000	10121000	God to a natural law claim,
10121000	10123000	but rather one must depend upon
10123000	10125000	God for a set of divine
10125000	10127000	commands, that this is the
10127000	10129000	only realistic and reliable
10129000	10131000	source of moral obligation and
10131000	10133000	our only source of knowledge
10133000	10135000	of those moral obligations.
10135000	10137000	The two or three books that I've seen come out
10137000	10139000	in the last two years on this
10139000	10141000	try to make that case that God
10141000	10143000	is the source of our obligation
10143000	10145000	and yet it's interesting to me that a work
10145000	10147000	like John Keeks or some of the other theorists
10147000	10149000	who've tried divine command
10149000	10151000	morality actually come down
10151000	10153000	to something very close to natural
10153000	10155000	morality in the way in which
10155000	10157000	they depend so heavily upon
10157000	10159000	the way God has established humankind
10159000	10161000	and therefore given appropriate laws
10161000	10163000	it's almost God
10163000	10165000	conforming himself to human nature
10165000	10167000	for the expression of these divine
10167000	10169000	commands. Well after
10169000	10171000	that survey let me turn more to the
10171000	10173000	philosophical problem, namely
10173000	10175000	I think that we can make some progress
10175000	10177000	by making a careful
10177000	10179000	distinction between the natural
10179000	10181000	law and how it is grounded
10181000	10183000	what it really rests on
10183000	10185000	as opposed to how we
10185000	10187000	know what natural law is grounded on
10187000	10189000	so the second
10189000	10191000	part of the discussion there is
10191000	10193000	about what our knowledge contributes
10193000	10195000	to this and how our knowledge is obtained
10195000	10197000	in my judgment there are
10197000	10199000	simply irresolvable
10199000	10201000	problems and internal
10201000	10203000	contradictions within
10203000	10205000	some of the positions I named above
10205000	10207000	in particular the Stoics and the Marxists
10207000	10209000	so I regard them as
10209000	10211000	insufficiently attentive to this
10211000	10213000	distinction and unable really
10213000	10215000	to meet its demands.
10215000	10217000	Stoic materialism for instance
10217000	10219000	seems to me to be unable
10219000	10221000	to provide an adequate
10221000	10223000	philosophical explanation
10223000	10225000	of how we're free, let alone
10225000	10227000	an adequate explanation of how there can be
10227000	10229000	moral responsibility
10229000	10231000	because of that freedom and not just
10231000	10233000	the pragmatic counsel of wise people
10233000	10235000	in the community. That is the problem
10235000	10237000	is in any materialist
10237000	10239000	system how do you ever
10239000	10241000	account for something being
10241000	10243000	free? A materialist system
10243000	10245000	is one in which there is complete
10245000	10247000	determination, complete causal
10247000	10249000	determinism so that the
10249000	10251000	material things in the
10251000	10253000	system are causing other things
10253000	10255000	in a very closed system
10255000	10257000	and what freedom requires is that
10257000	10259000	there be something that is not
10259000	10261000	caused by a causal chain
10261000	10263000	exterior to the being we say to be free
10263000	10265000	so I find an internal contradiction
10265000	10267000	in the Stoic system, an assertion
10267000	10269000	of freedom but no grounds
10269000	10271000	within a philosophy that is completely
10271000	10273000	materialist for managing this
10273000	10275000	let alone how there could be
10275000	10277000	a God who's outside the system
10277000	10279000	and of course for Stoicism there is not
10279000	10281000	likewise in the system of atheist
10281000	10283000	Marxism and there are versions
10283000	10285000	of natural law when we find
10285000	10287000	such natural law versions in thinkers like
10287000	10289000	Ernst Bloch there are
10289000	10291000	recurrent problems that face any
10291000	10293000	ethical naturalism here
10293000	10295000	beyond the mere problem about
10295000	10297000	materialism which is again insuperable
10297000	10299000	I think there's also a problem
10299000	10301000	in a system that is atheistic
10301000	10303000	how can there ever be a
10303000	10305000	law without a law giver?
10305000	10307000	At that point I think you would have
10307000	10309000	basically transformed the meaning of law
10309000	10311000	and would have be taking the meaning
10311000	10313000	of law to be simply our record
10313000	10315000	for how things normally work
10315000	10317000	we are stating it in some law
10317000	10319000	like version but at that point
10319000	10321000	there isn't a source of real obligation
10321000	10323000	that you can respond to
10323000	10325000	or fail to respond to there rather
10325000	10327000	is an effort to
10327000	10329000	codify and an effort to describe
10329000	10331000	what it is that people normally do
10331000	10333000	but that isn't enough for natural
10333000	10335000	law purposes precisely
10335000	10337000	because natural law purposes deal
10337000	10339000	with those who obey the law
10339000	10341000	and those who disobey the law
10341000	10343000	and when we're dealing with natural law
10343000	10345000	the claim is not that we've got a statistical
10345000	10347000	majority in favor of the option
10347000	10349000	that we're naming as normal
10349000	10351000	but rather we're claiming that there's something
10351000	10353000	intrinsically right that is not just
10353000	10355000	normal in fact sometimes
10355000	10357000	an entire culture may be blind to it
10357000	10359000	we're not talking about the normal
10359000	10361000	but the normative that for which
10361000	10363000	there is an obligation and so I fail
10363000	10365000	to see a way in which a system
10365000	10367000	of moral law without a law
10367000	10369000	giver truly makes any sense
10369000	10371000	the frequent
10371000	10373000	recourse that
10373000	10375000	is had by some of these
10375000	10377000	thinkers to the question that
10377000	10379000	natural law if there is a natural
10379000	10381000	law would somehow be
10381000	10383000	alienating this is Sartre's
10383000	10385000	problem and perhaps Kant's problem
10385000	10387000	namely that if there were a moral law
10387000	10389000	imposed by a divine law giver
10389000	10391000	would be alienating to human nature
10391000	10393000	would somehow deprive us
10393000	10395000	of human autonomy strikes me
10395000	10397000	as having a fundamental confusion
10397000	10399000	about the very meaning of freedom
10399000	10401000	let's consider that for just a moment at this point
10401000	10403000	does freedom mean
10403000	10405000	uncaused activity
10405000	10407000	if freedom meant
10407000	10409000	simply uncaused activity
10409000	10411000	then I think freedom would ultimately be
10411000	10413000	arbitrariness freedom would be chaos
10413000	10415000	freedom would be randomness
10415000	10417000	I grant you that there's a sense
10417000	10419000	in which we're free if we're not
10419000	10421000	uncaused but I don't think that that's really
10421000	10423000	at the heart of freedom
10423000	10425000	I would rather urge that
10425000	10427000	freedom doesn't refer to being uncaused
10427000	10429000	but freedom refers to being
10429000	10431000	not determined by something outside
10431000	10433000	rather it's a matter of being
10433000	10435000	self-caused
10435000	10437000	self-determined it's a matter of
10437000	10439000	self-mastery as such
10439000	10441000	we are not saying that
10441000	10443000	our free choices have no causality
10443000	10445000	rather we're saying that when we
10445000	10447000	human beings make a free
10447000	10449000	choice what we are doing is
10449000	10451000	being aware of some
10451000	10453000	maybe all of our options
10453000	10455000	A, B, C, D
10455000	10457000	and perhaps even the option of not
10457000	10459000	acting at all and then with
10459000	10461000	that mindfulness whether we have a complete
10461000	10463000	mindfulness or perhaps only a restricted
10463000	10465000	limited mindfulness
10465000	10467000	of several options
10467000	10469000	what we are doing is feeling the
10469000	10471000	attraction we can't help but feel
10471000	10473000	the attraction we're not free
10473000	10475000	in the sense of
10475000	10477000	we choose to
10477000	10479000	we're not free in the sense that we
10479000	10481000	ourselves cause our attraction to what is desirable
10481000	10483000	rather our freedom
10483000	10485000	consists in our ability to say no
10485000	10487000	to a number of the options
10487000	10489000	and then to move ahead
10489000	10491000	with something else that is attractive to us
10491000	10493000	that our freedom
10493000	10495000	consists precisely in
10495000	10497000	our ability to negate
10497000	10499000	our ability to refuse
10499000	10501000	any number of things which we do find
10501000	10503000	attractive it's still
10503000	10505000	self-caused in that we have to
10505000	10507000	be the gatekeepers we have to be the ones
10507000	10509000	who will say no to these things
10509000	10511000	even powerful as they may be
10511000	10513000	in the case of an addiction or in the case
10513000	10515000	of something where there's been a long
10515000	10517000	standing pattern of association
10517000	10519000	but our freedom has to be rendered
10519000	10521000	in terms of self-causation
10521000	10523000	self-determination to be meaningful
10523000	10525000	as such this
10525000	10527000	eliminates a problem that some people
10527000	10529000	have raised about there being a God
10529000	10531000	in association with morality
10531000	10533000	for a God to have laid down
10533000	10535000	a number of moral claims
10535000	10537000	saying for instance that God dislikes
10537000	10539000	murder, that God dislikes adultery
10539000	10541000	that God dislikes stealing
10541000	10543000	and cheating and other forms of nastiness
10543000	10545000	still does not in any way
10545000	10547000	impinge upon our freedom
10547000	10549000	we are quite free to choose those things
10549000	10551000	or to choose against them and to choose
10551000	10553000	things that are authentically desirable
10553000	10555000	but that there is a law does not
10555000	10557000	in any way preclude a freedom
10557000	10559000	it rather involves us in a much larger
10559000	10561000	way of having the responsibility
10561000	10563000	and the obligation
10563000	10565000	to accept the consequences
10565000	10567000	for the free choices that we make
10567000	10569000	hence I find that it is not
10569000	10571000	something that is alienating
10571000	10573000	or threatening to human autonomy
10573000	10575000	it is rather something that makes us rise
10575000	10577000	to the challenge of responsibility
10577000	10579000	and gives us a reason for
10579000	10581000	considering very carefully the consequences
10581000	10583000	of our actions and asking about the nature
10583000	10585000	of those choices that we make
10585000	10587000	now with this in mind
10587000	10589000	this stream of natural law theory
10589000	10591000	has tended to find
10591000	10593000	therefore a way to combine
10593000	10595000	belief in God and
10595000	10597000	attentiveness to nature without
10597000	10599000	on the other hand making human freedom
10599000	10601000	or the natural law
10601000	10603000	obligations something that are alienating
10603000	10605000	to us rather
10605000	10607000	natural law thinking puts a tremendous
10607000	10609000	amount of stress on
10609000	10611000	our innate intrinsic
10611000	10613000	end directedness
10613000	10615000	that we are for instance directed towards
10615000	10617000	responsibility toward looking toward
10617000	10619000	the friendship of other people
10619000	10621000	that we are designed for the
10621000	10623000	maturation of our own organism
10623000	10625000	and the maturation of our communities
10625000	10627000	but this end directedness
10627000	10629000	can sometimes
10629000	10631000	give us a sense of moral obligation
10631000	10633000	without particularly
10633000	10635000	adverting to the God question
10635000	10637000	but if we choose to go deeper
10637000	10639000	if we choose to study the matter further
10639000	10641000	we can well ask question
10641000	10643000	how is it that we are so naturally
10643000	10645000	good for things which are authentically good for us
10645000	10647000	how is it that we find ourselves
10647000	10649000	repulsed
10649000	10651000	by things which are actually bad for us
10651000	10653000	this might well be rooted
10653000	10655000	in the way in which we have been designed
10655000	10657000	by an intelligent designer
10657000	10659000	hence the natural law thinker
10659000	10661000	often finds that his moral theory
10661000	10663000	fits very well with the notion
10663000	10665000	of a divine being
10665000	10667000	and yet it allows us
10667000	10669000	from the point of view of theory
10669000	10671000	to distinguish between the questions
10671000	10673000	that natural law is ultimately grounded
10673000	10675000	in God I think you have to say yes to that
10675000	10677000	and on the other hand
10677000	10679000	the question of whether one needs
10679000	10681000	in the course of a conversation
10681000	10683000	to advert to God
10683000	10685000	as the ground of moral obligation
10685000	10687000	for somebody else to know the obligation
10687000	10689000	and that frequently there is no necessity
10689000	10691000	to go all the way back
10691000	10693000	to the metaphysical roots
10693000	10695000	because it is quite possible
10695000	10697000	to see at the more immediate level
10697000	10699000	to see at the level of what is simply evident
10699000	10701000	and experience what the nature
10701000	10703000	of our obligations are
10703000	10705000	one can see for instance that there is
10705000	10707000	a prohibition
10707000	10709000	on the deliberate taking
10709000	10711000	of innocent human life
10711000	10713000	or one can see that there is a direct
10713000	10715000	and immediate duty
10715000	10717000	to care for one's own offspring
10717000	10719000	without having to think about the source
10719000	10721000	of this in God
10721000	10723000	and yet when one is more reflective
10723000	10725000	and is not immediately under the pressure
10725000	10727000	of crisis needing to make a decision
10727000	10729000	why is so important about human life anyway
10729000	10731000	why is it that human life
10731000	10733000	deserves such respect
10733000	10735000	why is it that human life
10735000	10737000	might be considered sacred or inviolable
10737000	10739000	and then when one is asking
10739000	10741000	those very remote questions
10741000	10743000	those very deep metaphysical questions
10743000	10745000	then I think it is very likely
10745000	10747000	that one will see because
10747000	10749000	the human being is made in the image
10749000	10751000	and likeness of God in a way
10751000	10753000	that no other such creature is
10753000	10755000	but one need to advert to that
10755000	10757000	to consider a number of
10757000	10759000	natural law obligations
10759000	10761000	then we turn in the time that remains
10761000	10763000	to consider a number of
10763000	10765000	possible ramifications
10765000	10767000	that these questions about God
10767000	10769000	and natural law have
10769000	10771000	for the organization of society and culture
10771000	10773000	I'd like first to consider some matters
10773000	10775000	of political authority and legitimacy
10775000	10777000	and then secondly to consider
10777000	10779000	how we ought to write our laws
10779000	10781000	or have our laws composed
10781000	10783000	with respect to questions
10783000	10785000	some thinkers have taken
10785000	10787000	a very strong stand on the questions
10787000	10789000	I have been discussing
10789000	10791000	and they seem to think that we need to know
10791000	10793000	the existence of God
10793000	10795000	in order to recognize moral obligation
10795000	10797000	I've tried to divide that question and say
10797000	10799000	we probably don't need to know
10799000	10801000	the existence of God in the immediate sphere
10801000	10803000	even though we do ultimately have to take it back
10803000	10805000	to the existence of God
10805000	10807000	but if one takes a strong stand and say
10807000	10809000	no to know any moral obligation
10809000	10811000	we've got to know the source
10811000	10813000	of the obligation, the God who is obliging us
10813000	10815000	those people will probably
10815000	10817000	have to take a stand that
10817000	10819000	even human authority in government
10819000	10821000	human authority in society
10821000	10823000	will need divine support
10823000	10825000	in order to be legitimate
10825000	10827000	and there certainly have been thinkers who argued
10827000	10829000	for the divine right of kings
10829000	10831000	or for various forms of theocracy
10831000	10833000	on the other hand
10833000	10835000	if one is willing to say that
10835000	10837000	there is a remote and ultimate
10837000	10839000	dependence upon God for natural
10839000	10841000	obligation but that one
10841000	10843000	does not immediately need to call upon that
10843000	10845000	that one can instead
10845000	10847000	see moral obligation
10847000	10849000	without adverting to those questions
10849000	10851000	then it is quite possible to think of other
10851000	10853000	justifications for a political regime
10853000	10855000	including the possibility
10855000	10857000	of the justification of a regime
10857000	10859000	by popular consent
10859000	10861000	even the social contract theories
10861000	10863000	for instance of Jean Locke
10863000	10865000	Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others
10865000	10867000	have very much
10867000	10869000	adverted to the fact that its
10869000	10871000	political authority comes
10871000	10873000	from human consent
10873000	10875000	from the consent of those governed
10875000	10877000	but it's a very different system
10877000	10879000	and this will also make it possible
10879000	10881000	to consider how various forms
10881000	10883000	of government in modernity
10883000	10885000	are very differently organized
10885000	10887000	namely that we have a much
10887000	10889000	greater scope and latitude
10889000	10891000	for what it is that is acceptable conduct
10891000	10893000	and we regard something like religious freedom
10893000	10895000	as a freedom to pursue
10895000	10897000	the truth about God which we
10897000	10899000	in this country respect so deeply
10899000	10901000	and enshrine as part of our law
10901000	10903000	and yet we do not insist upon
10903000	10905000	a certain kind of worship
10905000	10907000	as being required by the state
10907000	10909000	whereas there have been many a state
10909000	10911000	before us in the course of
10911000	10913000	the long history of humanity that
10913000	10915000	insisted that there be uniformity
10915000	10917000	in matters of religion
10917000	10919000	because the authority of the state
10919000	10921000	was grounded precisely on a recognition
10921000	10923000	of a certain claim about God
10923000	10925000	which is true.
10925000	10927000	There are questions besides
10927000	10929000	questions of political legitimacy
10929000	10931000	there are lots of questions about
10931000	10933000	how much of moral obligation
10933000	10935000	how much of moral value
10935000	10937000	we should bring into civil law
10937000	10939000	that is it's a question about
10939000	10941000	what moral obligations
10941000	10943000	we should try to codify
10943000	10945000	obviously there are some
10945000	10947000	sorts of moral obligations
10947000	10949000	which it would be impossible to codify
10949000	10951000	the obligation of gratitude for instance
10951000	10953000	if someone has given something to us
10953000	10955000	or done something to us
10955000	10957000	it's very hard to imagine that there would be
10957000	10959000	an unenforceable law on that subject
10959000	10961000	but there's also questions about
10961000	10963000	the state establishment of religion
10963000	10965000	because if one does think
10965000	10967000	that there's a moral obligation
10967000	10969000	to worship the true God
10969000	10971000	whoever the true God is
10971000	10973000	some figures would want to bring in
10973000	10975000	that obligation into civil law
10975000	10977000	and there have been states which have had
10977000	10979000	religious tests
10979000	10981000	and many of us I think feel
10981000	10983000	that it's probably a better thing
10983000	10985000	to keep religious belief in the realm
10985000	10987000	entirely and completely of freedom
10987000	10989000	and never to force faith upon someone
10989000	10991000	and as such what one must do
10991000	10993000	is to say that pursuit
10993000	10995000	of the truth about religion
10995000	10997000	is better protected by not codifying
10997000	10999000	that part of morality
10999000	11001000	if we do succeed
11001000	11003000	in avoiding the temptations
11003000	11005000	of a theocratic government
11005000	11007000	nonetheless we need to ask the questions
11007000	11009000	of morality should be codified
11009000	11011000	because the moral law
11011000	11013000	does
11013000	11015000	remain consistent
11015000	11017000	and does remain obliging
11017000	11019000	no matter what our position is
11019000	11021000	the law for instance against murder
11021000	11023000	the law against adultery
11023000	11025000	the law against stealing
11025000	11027000	but how much of this can and should be brought into law
11027000	11029000	most of us I think would want to say
11029000	11031000	that laws against murder need to be part of the civil law
11031000	11033000	that laws against stealing need to be
11033000	11035000	but when we turn to questions
11035000	11037000	there have been much discussion recently
11037000	11039000	about how much of this should be codified
11039000	11041000	and how it should possibly be enforced
11041000	11043000	it's interesting to
11043000	11045000	think about the great difference between
11045000	11047000	ancient and modern systems
11047000	11049000	in this regard because many
11049000	11051000	ancient law codes always
11051000	11053000	presented themselves as divine in origin
11053000	11055000	and they took part of their justification
11055000	11057000	to be the fact that these were
11057000	11059000	divine laws which they were recording
11059000	11061000	I've been arguing that part
11061000	11063000	of the reason why our own US
11063000	11065000	constitution has received so much
11065000	11067000	veneration
11067000	11069000	has had so much of a sense
11069000	11071000	of the supremacy of that law
11071000	11073000	is not just because it was adopted by the people
11073000	11075000	but because it was recognized
11075000	11077000	to include all
11077000	11079000	or so many of the
11079000	11081000	values that need to be brought into law
11081000	11083000	without on the other hand
11083000	11085000	attempting to insist
11085000	11087000	upon the codification
11087000	11089000	of every kind of moral value
11089000	11091000	but it was recognized to have and to embody
11091000	11093000	a certain amount of justice
11093000	11095000	a final point that I'd like to make
11095000	11097000	concerns the very notion of toleration
11097000	11099000	toleration has been an
11099000	11101000	extremely important part of the
11101000	11103000	modern system of government
11103000	11105000	and society but it has had
11105000	11107000	two very distinct and different
11107000	11109000	meanings namely it arose
11109000	11111000	I think in questions of religious freedom
11111000	11113000	when people agreed for the sake
11113000	11115000	of civil harmony
11115000	11117000	to tolerate differences of opinion
11117000	11119000	even on ultimate truths like the truth
11119000	11121000	of God and to allow religious
11121000	11123000	freedom to be codified in law
11123000	11125000	as a way to respect the
11125000	11127000	obligation that individuals have
11127000	11129000	to try to worship truly
11129000	11131000	and worship in ways that are fitting
11131000	11133000	but toleration has come to mean
11133000	11135000	in some modern discourse
11135000	11137000	not just the acceptance of disagreement
11137000	11139000	but it has come to mean even the
11139000	11141000	direct approval of things that we
11141000	11143000	might find morally reprehensible
11143000	11145000	this is a very different sense of
11145000	11147000	tolerance but one I think that
11147000	11149000	is imperiled the understanding
11149000	11151000	of the moral nature that needs
11151000	11153000	to be embodied in law
11153000	11155000	a very difficult question
11155000	11157000	we'll have opportunity in the next lecture
11157000	11159000	to consider some other things that law will do
11159000	11167000	applause
11167000	11175000	music
11175000	11177000	lecture 21
11177000	11179000	current applications
11179000	11181000	jurisprudence
11181000	11187000	applause
11187000	11189000	in this lecture I'd like to
11189000	11191000	turn to the subject of law
11191000	11193000	and natural law and thereby
11193000	11195000	continue in a formal way
11195000	11197000	what we hit peripherally
11197000	11199000	at the end of the last lecture
11199000	11201000	when we were considering questions about
11201000	11203000	God and natural law
11203000	11205000	the way in which natural law
11205000	11207000	has an impact and should be represented
11207000	11209000	or should not be represented
11209000	11211000	within civil law
11211000	11213000	in particular there has been a lot of debate
11213000	11215000	in the last decade and a half
11215000	11217000	about whether it is legitimate
11217000	11219000	to bring principles of natural law
11219000	11221000	into the processes
11221000	11223000	of legislation
11223000	11225000	and in particular into judicial review
11225000	11227000	the subject has arisen
11227000	11229000	in all sorts of venues including
11229000	11231000	biomedical ethics
11231000	11233000	we'll save that for lecture 22
11233000	11235000	but also things like the congressional
11235000	11237000	hearings that have been held about
11237000	11239000	nominations to the supreme court
11239000	11241000	for example in the cases of
11241000	11243000	Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas
11243000	11245000	when nominated for seats on the supreme court
11245000	11247000	the one was attacked
11247000	11249000	for an unwillingness to use
11249000	11251000	any form of natural law
11251000	11253000	especially a liberal stance
11253000	11255000	on natural law for purposes of social
11255000	11257000	reform insisting instead
11257000	11259000	that he would only argue
11259000	11261000	and decide cases on the basis
11261000	11263000	of a purely positive jurisprudence
11263000	11265000	the other was
11265000	11267000	attacked for the very
11267000	11269000	hint that he might use natural law
11269000	11271000	but natural law of a somewhat more conservative
11271000	11273000	bent on the application
11273000	11275000	to the problems facing the court
11275000	11277000	in addition to questions
11277000	11279000	like supreme court nominations
11279000	11281000	natural law is also
11281000	11283000	a question with respect to
11283000	11285000	any number of constitutional issues
11285000	11287000	and legislative issues
11287000	11289000	things that involve tort law
11289000	11291000	things that involve penal law
11291000	11293000	and even questions like the nature
11293000	11295000	of our tax system the graduated income tax
11295000	11297000	for the purposes
11297000	11299000	of this lecture what I'd like to do
11299000	11301000	is to focus first on the question
11301000	11303000	of judicial review
11303000	11305000	and the principle of equity
11305000	11307000	and then after considering it in terms
11307000	11309000	of the development of that doctrine
11309000	11311000	in our American jurisprudence
11311000	11313000	I'd like to consider the way in which
11313000	11315000	natural law touches on some substantive issues
11315000	11317000	in particular things like
11317000	11319000	punishment and taxation
11319000	11321000	but first and most
11321000	11323000	importantly I think here the very
11323000	11325000	principle of using
11325000	11327000	natural law in judicial review
11327000	11329000	repeatedly
11329000	11331000	in the development of the theory
11331000	11333000	of natural law its proponents
11333000	11335000	over the centuries
11335000	11337000	have made appeal to a
11337000	11339000	higher law important
11339000	11341000	that law in terms
11341000	11343000	of legislation and constitution
11343000	11345000	must always consult the standard
11345000	11347000	of objective justice
11347000	11349000	whether this is called natural law or higher law
11349000	11351000	there has regularly been such
11351000	11353000	reference law as
11353000	11355000	made by human beings
11355000	11357000	in any of the forms in which we make law
11357000	11359000	the basic laws that are
11359000	11361000	constitutions written and unwritten
11361000	11363000	statutory law
11363000	11365000	administrative law
11365000	11367000	sometimes even just a matter of cultural laws
11367000	11369000	that are cultural specific practices
11369000	11371000	all of these things somehow
11371000	11373000	need to be determined
11373000	11375000	just in order to be law
11375000	11377000	to be valid law
11377000	11379000	but on the other hand to recognize the need
11379000	11381000	for a law to be just
11381000	11383000	in order to be valid
11383000	11385000	yet decide in
11385000	11387000	practice what we are to do
11387000	11389000	about those human laws
11389000	11391000	maybe we could call them attempts at human law
11391000	11393000	that are somehow recognized as
11393000	11395000	unjust it seems to me
11395000	11397000	that in the review of the history
11397000	11399000	there have been at least three different attitudes
11399000	11401000	to what we do about those that are deemed
11401000	11403000	unjust one
11403000	11405000	attitude is that we should declare them
11405000	11407000	null and void no longer applying
11407000	11409000	secondly is that
11409000	11411000	we might have the court
11411000	11413000	simply declare that
11413000	11415000	this particular piece of legislation
11415000	11417000	is somehow
11417000	11419000	out of conformity with the natural law
11419000	11421000	and yet refer the matter back
11421000	11423000	to the legislature and not attempt
11423000	11425000	to deal with it itself
11425000	11427000	a third in a much more aggressive stance
11427000	11429000	is in the form of judicial review
11429000	11431000	as judicial legislation
11431000	11433000	in which the court not merely declares
11433000	11435000	a law null and void
11435000	11437000	but actually tries to correct it in some way
11437000	11439000	one saw that practice for instance in the Roman
11439000	11441000	jurists
11441000	11443000	whether a judiciary
11443000	11445000	in any given country is
11445000	11447000	given the power to overturn
11447000	11449000	statutory and administrative laws
11449000	11451000	that are somehow perceived to be
11451000	11453000	unjust is a matter that
11453000	11455000	needs to be determined explicitly
11455000	11457000	in a constitution
11457000	11459000	or if not the
11459000	11461000	actual practice of the courts
11461000	11463000	over the course of history
11463000	11465000	will have to decide that
11465000	11467000	in our own situation the US Constitution
11467000	11469000	does not decide it explicitly
11469000	11471000	but rather it has been determined by judicial practice
11471000	11473000	over the years
11473000	11475000	some cases in some countries
11475000	11477000	there actually is a more formal determination
11477000	11479000	in the German
11479000	11481000	Supreme Court for instance
11481000	11483000	has a special division that is a
11483000	11485000	constitutional court deciding on
11485000	11487000	constitutional issues and only that
11487000	11489000	the Austrian courts likewise have a little bit more
11489000	11491000	explicit power in this matter
11491000	11493000	but in our own country
11493000	11495000	there has never been an explicit
11495000	11497000	in the constitution in the matter
11497000	11499000	it is rather a practice that has grown up
11499000	11501000	prepared I think especially
11501000	11503000	by reason of the operation
11503000	11505000	of some natural law principles
11505000	11507000	in our history especially the
11507000	11509000	natural law doctrines of limited government
11509000	11511000	that government isn't all powerful
11511000	11513000	and secondly the doctrine of inalienable
11513000	11515000	rights namely that there are
11515000	11517000	certain rights that we hold
11517000	11519000	by virtue of being human and having a human
11519000	11521000	nature that are always a kind
11521000	11523000	of trump card
11523000	11525000	in legal history the practice
11525000	11527000	of judicial review began with
11527000	11529000	Chief Justice John Marshall
11529000	11531000	in the case called Marvary versus Madison
11531000	11533000	in 1803
11533000	11535000	but in that first period from
11535000	11537000	John Marshall's use of it
11537000	11539000	through about the 1860s
11539000	11541000	natural law
11541000	11543000	had only a very limited scope
11543000	11545000	and judicial review was generally limited
11545000	11547000	to trying to assess
11547000	11549000	whether particular legislation
11549000	11551000	did indeed conform to the
11551000	11553000	constitution and there was
11553000	11555000	a great hesitance
11555000	11557000	about invoking any other
11557000	11559000	standards of natural justice
11559000	11561000	that might be used to overturn statutes
11561000	11563000	so it was a very purely formal matter
11563000	11565000	it was a matter of looking at
11565000	11567000	procedure of legislation and only
11567000	11569000	about the technical conformity
11569000	11571000	to the constitution but there were
11571000	11573000	other moves afoot in 1793
11573000	11575000	Chief Justice John J
11575000	11577000	in a case called Chisholm
11577000	11579000	versus Georgia argued
11579000	11581000	that reason and the nature
11581000	11583000	of things
11583000	11585000	was a good reason for trying
11585000	11587000	to decide a case about
11587000	11589000	whether private citizens have
11589000	11591000	a right to bring suits
11591000	11593000	against various state governments
11593000	11595000	and what Chief Justice John J
11595000	11597000	clearly felt was a natural law obligation
11597000	11599000	is that governments are not just
11599000	11601000	under the law of the constitution
11601000	11603000	but that governments are also under justice
11603000	11605000	and hence the private
11605000	11607000	citizens may indeed bring suits to them
11607000	11609000	Justice Cooley
11609000	11611000	in the course of the 1860s
11611000	11613000	begins a movement
11613000	11615000	that I think is very important
11615000	11617000	for the next segment of this
11617000	11619000	and the development of the doctrine
11619000	11621000	if I try to sketch out the history
11621000	11623000	of the development of judicial review
11623000	11625000	I would urge that there are
11625000	11627000	three periods when the natural law
11627000	11629000	doctrine starts to grow
11629000	11631000	in judicial review after
11631000	11633000	Justice
11633000	11635000	John Marshall initially
11635000	11637000	begins the practice
11637000	11639000	the first period will be the 1860s
11639000	11641000	1870s and in that
11641000	11643000	portion of the history
11643000	11645000	of our constitution and our
11645000	11647000	judiciary one sees the use
11647000	11649000	by some jurists of
11649000	11651000	natural law in a very conservative
11651000	11653000	way to defend property claims
11653000	11655000	secondly one will see
11655000	11657000	in the 1930s
11657000	11659000	a willingness to use another
11659000	11661000	kind another insight about natural
11661000	11663000	law for social welfare
11663000	11665000	legislation and then again
11665000	11667000	in the 1960s and 1970s
11667000	11669000	one sees all sorts of
11669000	11671000	civil liberties and personal liberties
11671000	11673000	being introduced and defended
11673000	11675000	by the court on what are
11675000	11677000	natural law grounds at least
11677000	11679000	natural law of a certain sort
11679000	11681000	under the doctrine of judicial review
11681000	11683000	so to take the first period namely
11683000	11685000	a relatively conservative period
11685000	11687000	that I think begins in the 1860s
11687000	11689000	1870s until that time
11689000	11691000	judicial review had generally
11691000	11693000	been limited to matters of procedure
11693000	11695000	and conformity to the constitution
11695000	11697000	and hence one spoke of
11697000	11699000	questions only of procedural
11699000	11701000	due justice but
11701000	11703000	with the passage of the 14th amendment
11703000	11705000	and the reinterpretation
11705000	11707000	by the court of the 5th amendment
11707000	11709000	there the
11709000	11711000	justice is moved from
11711000	11713000	a notion of purely procedural
11713000	11715000	due process to questions of
11715000	11717000	substantive due process
11717000	11719000	I think this may be very useful to just to think about
11719000	11721000	for a minute when one is trying to follow
11721000	11723000	the news about various court decisions
11723000	11725000	those two terms will
11725000	11727000	frequently come up and if one is clear
11727000	11729000	on that I think one has a great purchase
11729000	11731000	on what the courts are doing namely that
11731000	11733000	if it's a question of procedural due justice
11733000	11735000	all they're examining are
11735000	11737000	formalities about whether legislation
11737000	11739000	was enacted rightly and whether the courts
11739000	11741000	proceeded correctly according
11741000	11743000	to very technical standards on the other
11743000	11745000	hand when people start talking about
11745000	11747000	substantive due process
11747000	11749000	then what is being considered
11749000	11751000	is not just the technical formalities
11751000	11753000	of legislation but whether
11753000	11755000	people's natural rights
11755000	11757000	or natural liberties
11757000	11759000	or some kind of social right or civil
11759000	11761000	liberty is somehow involved and it's
11761000	11763000	a more heady use of the courts power
11763000	11765000	it's not always the case
11765000	11767000	that there's a natural law claim involved
11767000	11769000	but sometimes there is.
11769000	11771000	In the 1860's after that passage
11771000	11773000	of the 14th amendment justice Cooley
11773000	11775000	wrote a book in 1868
11775000	11777000	called constitutional
11777000	11779000	limitations and what he was doing
11779000	11781000	was commenting on the works of Blackstone
11781000	11783000	whom we met when we were considering
11783000	11785000	the natural law sources for
11785000	11787000	the thinking of our founding fathers
11787000	11789000	what he urged
11789000	11791000	in his commentary on Blackstone
11791000	11793000	was that questions about
11793000	11795000	private property were
11795000	11797000	very appropriate for the courts
11797000	11799000	consideration and that in general
11799000	11801000	the judiciary had a right
11801000	11803000	to reverse legislation
11803000	11805000	that had been enacted by Congress
11805000	11807000	which in any way interfered
11807000	11809000	with private property
11809000	11811000	one especially I think had railroad questions
11811000	11813000	in those days and questions about
11813000	11815000	eminent domain the taking
11815000	11817000	of property for the sake of a common purpose
11817000	11819000	and in general justice Cooley
11819000	11821000	and a number of his compatriots were
11821000	11823000	urging that there's a natural law protection
11823000	11825000	involved and hence that there needs to be
11825000	11827000	compensation and not merely the claiming
11827000	11829000	of the land. Justice Cooley
11829000	11831000	in his book and then frequently in his
11831000	11833000	decisions urges that the 5th
11833000	11835000	and the 14th amendments considered
11835000	11837000	in light of one another give
11837000	11839000	judges a far more expansive
11839000	11841000	power here that is they can determine
11841000	11843000	not only procedural claims about
11843000	11845000	whether all the formalities
11845000	11847000	have been followed but that the court
11847000	11849000	is right in considering whether
11849000	11851000	the legislature was
11851000	11853000	considering rightly the needs of
11853000	11855000	the government and the needs of the property
11855000	11857000	holders. When
11857000	11859000	follows thereafter in the course of the next
11859000	11861000	30 years an increasing
11861000	11863000	use of these natural law claims
11863000	11865000	and I think that they're attributable to
11865000	11867000	one single justice namely Justice
11867000	11869000	Steven Field in the course
11869000	11871000	of the 1870s and 80s that
11871000	11873000	eventually lead to the famous
11873000	11875000	1877 case Munn vs Illinois.
11875000	11877000	It begins earlier though
11877000	11879000	in 1871
11879000	11881000	Justice Field writes in a case
11881000	11883000	called the legal tender case
11883000	11885000	he writes a dissenting opinion he's not
11885000	11887000	even in the majority but he starts
11887000	11889000	to make an argument that the rest
11889000	11891000	of the justice is eventually by
11891000	11893000	in the 1871 case he's
11893000	11895000	attacking a congressional law
11895000	11897000	that allowed the use of green backs
11897000	11899000	or green dollars
11899000	11901000	as acceptable payment for
11901000	11903000	various debts and he regarded
11903000	11905000	this as something that
11905000	11907000	contravened quote the
11907000	11909000	unchangeable principles of right
11909000	11911000	and morality without which society
11911000	11913000	would be impossible. Likewise
11913000	11915000	he thought it violated quote
11915000	11917000	fundamental principles of eternal justice
11917000	11919000	upon the existence of which
11919000	11921000	all constitutional government is founded
11921000	11923000	that he has a strong sense of
11923000	11925000	private property and is very
11925000	11927000	very suspicious about various
11927000	11929000	kinds of governmental interference.
11929000	11931000	Likewise in 1873
11931000	11933000	Justice Field again is in dissent
11933000	11935000	so he doesn't win the victory
11935000	11937000	of the day on the court's decision on that
11937000	11939000	case but he begins to get the court
11939000	11941000	thinking in some of these natural
11941000	11943000	law categories of a very conservative sort.
11943000	11945000	It's a case called the slaughterhouse
11945000	11947000	case and it was about a question
11947000	11949000	of monopolies which the courts were deeply
11949000	11951000	concerned about then.
11951000	11953000	Dissenting Justice Field argues
11953000	11955000	that there is a natural
11955000	11957000	law basis in the 14th
11957000	11959000	amendment that guarantees
11959000	11961000	the quote privileges
11961000	11963000	and immunities of U.S. citizens
11963000	11965000	as a way of guaranteeing
11965000	11967000	all sorts of rights
11967000	11969000	to our property against
11969000	11971000	various infringements by the state.
11971000	11973000	He says they are of right
11973000	11975000	they belong to citizens of all free governments
11975000	11977000	and his suggestion is that this
11977000	11979000	transcends anything that's
11979000	11981000	strictly in the constitution
11981000	11983000	that there are natural rights of property
11983000	11985000	and I think what we're supposed to be hearing here
11985000	11987000	is John Locke's political philosophy
11987000	11989000	which he very much imbibed
11989000	11991000	which he very much agreed with
11991000	11993000	and he's using Locke and natural law
11993000	11995000	political philosophy as a basis
11995000	11997000	for his court decisions in ways
11997000	11999000	that are extraneous to the strict
11999000	12001000	constitution. Finally in 1877
12001000	12003000	with that case of Munn
12003000	12005000	vs Illinois Justice Field
12005000	12007000	is the third time in dissent
12007000	12009000	here he's interpreting the due process
12009000	12011000	clause of the 14th amendment
12011000	12013000	as a guarantee against any interference
12013000	12015000	which the judges deem
12015000	12017000	unreasonable. Now that's a very
12017000	12019000	strong claim because it's making
12019000	12021000	unreasonable into the important
12021000	12023000	standard that the justice is used
12023000	12025000	but even though Justice Field loses
12025000	12027000	is on the dissenting side
12027000	12029000	the rest of the judges and for the first time
12029000	12031000	I think there is a majority opinion
12031000	12033000	that admits in some
12033000	12035000	circumstances state regulations
12035000	12037000	may be simply so arbitrary
12037000	12039000	as to be unconstitutional
12039000	12041000	and they have a readiness to buy
12041000	12043000	some of the logic even if they don't grant
12043000	12045000	him his whole point. Thereafter
12045000	12047000	for the next 20 years one sees the majorities
12047000	12049000	using Justice Field's
12049000	12051000	basic argument in the majority
12051000	12053000	opinions. In 1886
12053000	12055000	for instance in a case called
12055000	12057000	Munn vs the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company
12057000	12059000	it's a matter of
12059000	12061000	dealing with questions of railroad
12061000	12063000	rate regulations. The court
12063000	12065000	claims that it would be in
12065000	12067000	that it needs to invalidate
12067000	12069000	a statute which quote
12069000	12071000	amounts to a taking of private property
12071000	12073000	for public use without
12073000	12075000	just compensation or without due
12075000	12077000	process of law. But it's not just
12077000	12079000	a procedural question here they're into substantive justice
12079000	12081000	trying to reinforce
12081000	12083000	property rights. In 1890
12083000	12085000	the case called Chicago, Minneapolis
12085000	12087000	and St. Paul Railroad Company
12087000	12089000	vs. Minnesota ended up striking down
12089000	12091000	a Minnesota statute
12091000	12093000	for depriving a railroad
12093000	12095000	of the right of judicial appeal
12095000	12097000	quote by due process of law
12097000	12099000	pertaining to questions about
12099000	12101000	the reasonability of those rates.
12101000	12103000	This is an extra constitutional standard.
12103000	12105000	In 1897 the case of
12105000	12107000	Allguyer vs. Louisiana
12107000	12109000	not only do a majority of the
12109000	12111000	justices on this court accept
12111000	12113000	the view that due process
12113000	12115000	clause here protects
12115000	12117000	in a substantive way property
12117000	12119000	against quote unreasonable
12119000	12121000	infringement but also
12121000	12123000	they extend the interpretation of the
12123000	12125000	liberties that are guaranteed by the clause
12125000	12127000	to the whole realm of the
12127000	12129000	liberty of contracts and then
12129000	12131000	for the next gosh until our present day
12131000	12133000	tremendous defense of the courts
12133000	12135000	of these liberties of contract
12135000	12137000	as a natural law right.
12137000	12139000	Probably the most notorious case
12139000	12141000	in the whole series is the 1905
12141000	12143000	Lochner vs. New York case.
12143000	12145000	This was one that involved striking down
12145000	12147000	some
12147000	12149000	maximum hour laws that is
12149000	12151000	how much one could legitimately work
12151000	12153000	and there was an attempt at social reform
12153000	12155000	to have a certain limited number of hours
12155000	12157000	that a person would have to work every week
12157000	12159000	and they struck this down on the grounds
12159000	12161000	that it was unreasonable interference
12161000	12163000	with liberty of contract
12163000	12165000	and hence a violation of the 14th amendment.
12165000	12167000	Now that whole
12167000	12169000	domain that I've just been discussing
12169000	12171000	is an effort to use
12171000	12173000	substantive due process
12173000	12175000	on one particular track
12175000	12177000	namely the track of property and property rights.
12177000	12179000	It's to
12179000	12181000	argue not on the basis of some vague
12181000	12183000	natural law principles but rather
12183000	12185000	now to make the vagueness
12185000	12187000	consist in the due process clause
12187000	12189000	and allow it to have substantive
12189000	12191000	uses
12191000	12193000	particular on property questions.
12193000	12195000	It met its opponents especially in those last
12195000	12197000	20 or 30 years when the courts
12197000	12199000	were very inclined to support it
12199000	12201000	other justices deeply opposed it
12201000	12203000	the famous Oliver Wendell Holmes
12203000	12205000	for instance is a severe
12205000	12207000	critic when he dissents in the Lochner
12207000	12209000	case he accuses the
12209000	12211000	rest of the court of using the 14th
12211000	12213000	amendment to legislate
12213000	12215000	its own economic and social programs
12215000	12217000	into the Constitution
12217000	12219000	and he urges at one point
12219000	12221000	in the course of that opinion that unless
12221000	12223000	there is a clear and explicit prohibition
12223000	12225000	the rest of these justices
12225000	12227000	will make the law to be
12227000	12229000	whatever the majority wants the law to be
12229000	12231000	the debate was getting acrimonious
12231000	12233000	in the extreme.
12233000	12235000	In the 1930s the court which was happily
12235000	12237000	going along on its defensive property
12237000	12239000	claims met Franklin Roosevelt
12239000	12241000	and one had a
12241000	12243000	whole new dimension
12243000	12245000	and the dimension of the
12245000	12247000	economic problems that our country was in
12247000	12249000	which led to a new emphasis upon the need
12249000	12251000	for various social reforms
12251000	12253000	even if at the expense of
12253000	12255000	private property.
12255000	12257000	At first the court resisted this for the court
12257000	12259000	I think was newly inconstant in its own version
12259000	12261000	of how to use natural law
12261000	12263000	of a certain sort in property
12263000	12265000	cases and now there was a strong
12265000	12267000	movement to try to defend
12267000	12269000	social welfare legislation
12269000	12271000	and to use this natural law reasoning
12271000	12273000	that is use the claim that the 14th
12273000	12275000	amendment calls not just for
12275000	12277000	procedural due process
12277000	12279000	but substantive due process
12279000	12281000	you can make substantive claims
12281000	12283000	on the basis of extra constitutional
12283000	12285000	considerations.
12285000	12287000	There was a need of course to try to find
12287000	12289000	ways to express this but once
12289000	12291000	the court backed down and was
12291000	12293000	willing to grant Roosevelt some of his
12293000	12295000	social reforms rather than have the court
12295000	12297000	expanded it's that famous
12297000	12299000	switch in time saves nine
12299000	12301000	when the court stayed
12301000	12303000	at nine justices instead of
12303000	12305000	becoming 15 but adopted
12305000	12307000	much of Roosevelt's welfare legislation
12307000	12309000	they needed to find
12309000	12311000	rules of law and rules of reason
12311000	12313000	which could allow them
12313000	12315000	to approve and to
12315000	12317000	strike down the legislation
12317000	12319000	that somehow protected
12319000	12321000	these new social reform
12321000	12323000	pieces of legislation. One interesting
12323000	12325000	case is the case of palco versus
12325000	12327000	Connecticut in 1937
12327000	12329000	this is a case in which
12329000	12331000	the majority opinion
12331000	12333000	uses the phrase quote these
12333000	12335000	rights are implicit in the
12335000	12337000	concept of ordered liberty
12337000	12339000	here one has a use
12339000	12341000	of the phrase of
12341000	12343000	rights and ordered liberty a lot
12343000	12345000	of natural law terminology
12345000	12347000	to make the case that natural
12347000	12349000	law not so much natural law
12349000	12351000	in the sense of the nature of a human being
12351000	12353000	but natural law in the sense
12353000	12355000	of the nature of free society
12355000	12357000	requires that there be certain
12357000	12359000	guarantees requires that
12359000	12361000	there be certain kinds of welfare
12361000	12363000	legislation which would be
12363000	12365000	available to those who are
12365000	12367000	in the past otherwise disenfranchised
12367000	12369000	and one sees progressively
12369000	12371000	in the course of the 1930s and 40s
12371000	12373000	a willingness to do this. In 1938
12373000	12375000	for instance Justice Stone
12375000	12377000	in the case of the United States
12377000	12379000	versus Caroline products
12379000	12381000	is asking questions about
12381000	12383000	whether legislation
12383000	12385000	which would be inclined to
12385000	12387000	remove certain
12387000	12389000	social reforms by virtue
12389000	12391000	of popular initiative
12391000	12393000	these things should be given
12393000	12395000	a stricter federal scrutiny
12395000	12397000	and he argues that yes
12397000	12399000	stricter federal scrutiny
12399000	12401000	does come into the court's purview
12401000	12403000	when you have a 14th amendment case
12403000	12405000	and questions where
12405000	12407000	the courts have to require
12407000	12409000	tests by extra constitutional standard
12409000	12411000	where the court will use
12411000	12413000	not just literal formal
12413000	12415000	conformity to the constitution
12415000	12417000	but will be concerned with
12417000	12419000	natural rights especially of
12419000	12421000	religious groups and it moves
12421000	12423000	from various social classes to various
12423000	12425000	religious questions and to other
12425000	12427000	groups which here therefore
12427000	12429000	had simply operated in the realm of freedom
12429000	12431000	now their rights were to be more explicitly
12431000	12433000	protected. At the same time
12433000	12435000	one finds justices who disagree with this
12435000	12437000	in particular Justice Black
12437000	12439000	is constantly an opponent of it
12439000	12441000	in the famous 1947 case
12441000	12443000	of Adamson versus California
12443000	12445000	he urges that these are questions
12445000	12447000	about the interpretation of the bill
12447000	12449000	and whether they pertain to the states
12449000	12451000	or whether they pertain to private individuals
12451000	12453000	is the court not using
12453000	12455000	somehow a
12455000	12457000	natural law philosophy and substituting
12457000	12459000	its own particular
12459000	12461000	understanding of natural law philosophy
12461000	12463000	for what the constitution originally
12463000	12465000	intended and one frequently sees
12465000	12467000	the debate in terms of
12467000	12469000	should we honor the original intent
12469000	12471000	if indeed we can know the original intent
12471000	12473000	of the founders of our constitution
12473000	12475000	or should we consider the constitution
12475000	12477000	as a living document which is
12477000	12479000	in the hands of the jurists
12479000	12481000	to have them expand and develop
12481000	12483000	and to grow it in some organic
12483000	12485000	fashion. The third
12485000	12487000	case of this comes in the 1960s
12487000	12489000	especially in civil rights
12489000	12491000	legislation we've discussed that already
12491000	12493000	at some length in the ways in which
12493000	12495000	one saw with 1954 Brown
12495000	12497000	versus the Board of Education
12497000	12499000	and then all the follow-up decisions that
12499000	12501000	continue to defend and expand upon civil
12501000	12503000	rights but one sees it in other
12503000	12505000	domains as well. There is the
12505000	12507000	famous 1965 case Griswold
12507000	12509000	versus Connecticut which had to do
12509000	12511000	with the making
12511000	12513000	available and the selling of
12513000	12515000	contraceptives and the
12515000	12517000	way in which the court decided that
12517000	12519000	there should be no regulation of
12519000	12521000	contraception with respect
12521000	12523000	even to married couples let alone to
12523000	12525000	couples who were not married was on
12525000	12527000	an argument that justice Douglas
12527000	12529000	makes in which he uses a certain
12529000	12531000	kind of natural law reasoning namely
12531000	12533000	the rights of marital privacy
12533000	12535000	and very interesting language he says
12535000	12537000	these rights are in the
12537000	12539000	emanations that
12539000	12541000	come from the Bill of Rights
12541000	12543000	and this is a kind of language in which
12543000	12545000	the courts have often been
12545000	12547000	analyzed to be developing
12547000	12549000	new protections and new liberties
12549000	12551000	which are not explicitly there
12551000	12553000	and they root this notion in the emanations
12553000	12555000	or sometimes the penumbra
12555000	12557000	of the Constitution urging
12557000	12559000	that somehow their sense of what
12559000	12561000	natural justice is requires this
12561000	12563000	there was an enormous fight in that
12563000	12565000	case and in subsequent cases in
12565000	12567000	which some of the justices were writing
12567000	12569000	separate opinions about the right of
12569000	12571000	privacy as somehow related to the
12571000	12573000	liberty rights that are stressed
12573000	12575000	in the Ninth Amendment other
12575000	12577000	justices are for instance Justice
12577000	12579000	Black whom I mentioned a moment ago
12579000	12581000	were again worried about a
12581000	12583000	quote natural law due process
12583000	12585000	philosophy as giving the court
12585000	12587000	the power to invalidate any
12587000	12589000	legislative act which the justices
12589000	12591000	find irrational, unreasonable
12591000	12593000	or offensive.
12593000	12595000	This is also the period of course of the
12595000	12597000	Miranda case the 1966
12597000	12599000	United States versus Miranda
12599000	12601000	which required that people be
12601000	12603000	informed of their right to remain silent
12603000	12605000	after they are arrested and to have legal
12605000	12607000	counsel before they undertake
12607000	12609000	to answer any questions after an arrest
12609000	12611000	and the justification for this
12611000	12613000	was certain justices
12613000	12615000	understanding of what natural law requires
12615000	12617000	namely the natural law protections
12617000	12619000	that are codified when we presume
12619000	12621000	innocence before guilt and must
12621000	12623000	try to leave a person in that state
12623000	12625000	of innocence and not extract
12625000	12627000	confessions of guilt too soon.
12627000	12629000	Now as you can see I think from
12629000	12631000	this brief rehearsal of the history
12631000	12633000	there have been uses
12633000	12635000	and abuses of natural
12635000	12637000	law reasoning in jurisprudence
12637000	12639000	sometimes for conservative purposes
12639000	12641000	sometimes for liberal purposes
12641000	12643000	and I have not tried to sort those
12643000	12645000	out I have tried simply to describe
12645000	12647000	what is being taken place there
12647000	12649000	but it has led a number of commentators
12649000	12651000	in particular professor Robbie George
12651000	12653000	of Princeton whom I very much admire in this
12653000	12655000	to urge that perhaps we would
12655000	12657000	do better to restrict
12657000	12659000	judicial review
12659000	12661000	to purely formal and procedural
12661000	12663000	questions and instead
12663000	12665000	encourage those who want to use
12665000	12667000	natural law arguments as indeed Robbie
12667000	12669000	George wants to use but to restrict
12669000	12671000	those to the political process
12671000	12673000	and to get them out of the juridical process.
12673000	12675000	The alternative of course
12675000	12677000	is to say that
12677000	12679000	we depend upon a justice
12679000	12681000	to have justice in his
12681000	12683000	or her heart but the difficulty
12683000	12685000	of course is when in a pluralist society
12685000	12687000	there are extreme disagreements
12687000	12689000	about what that justice consists in
12689000	12691000	one risks being at
12691000	12693000	the whim of judicial legislation
12693000	12695000	so it's a very contested problem
12695000	12697000	and I hope that this account of the history
12697000	12699000	will at least make clearer where the current
12699000	12701000	debate is.
12701000	12703000	The possibilities for using
12703000	12705000	natural law in legislation
12705000	12707000	of course are enormous so here
12707000	12709000	dealing not so much with how the justices
12709000	12711000	deal with it but how the legislatures
12711000	12713000	deal with it let me just propose
12713000	12715000	in the time that remains three examples
12715000	12717000	of places where
12717000	12719000	natural law could very well come
12719000	12721000	with profit into our legislation
12721000	12723000	and then perhaps be respected by the court
12723000	12725000	because they have been included
12725000	12727000	in the legislation it's not something that
12727000	12729000	justices have to read into the situation
12729000	12731000	it's something that the legislatures themselves
12731000	12733000	have assented to.
12733000	12735000	One is the question about the theory of punishment
12735000	12737000	various
12737000	12739000	explanations are given
12739000	12741000	for what right anybody has
12741000	12743000	to punish somebody for crime
12743000	12745000	among the explanations that are frequently given
12745000	12747000	are deterrence, public
12747000	12749000	safety and retribution
12749000	12751000	my point here isn't to settle the matter
12751000	12753000	but simply to take note that deterrence
12753000	12755000	is not a natural law justification
12755000	12757000	deterrence arguments in which
12757000	12759000	we punish criminals so that other people
12759000	12761000	won't commit crimes because
12761000	12763000	they see how badly crimes
12763000	12765000	are punished is a utilitarian kind
12765000	12767000	of argument urging we'll get better
12767000	12769000	consequences in the long run if we do
12769000	12771000	this I simply point out
12771000	12773000	that that's not a natural law justification
12773000	12775000	for punishment because it doesn't speak
12775000	12777000	to the question of whether this person deserved it
12777000	12779000	rather all we would be interested
12779000	12781000	in is how other people later will react to it
12781000	12783000	whereas the justifications
12783000	12785000	for punishment that are found
12785000	12787000	in public safety arguments
12787000	12789000	and in retribution arguments
12789000	12791000	are natural law justifications
12791000	12793000	namely part of the natural law
12793000	12795000	is that a government
12795000	12797000	must be responsible for the safety
12797000	12799000	of its citizens especially
12799000	12801000	the safety of the innocent, the safety of the vulnerable
12801000	12803000	the safety of the weak
12803000	12805000	and precisely in order to secure
12805000	12807000	that common good of safety
12807000	12809000	the government has an obligation
12809000	12811000	to punish those who are in fact
12811000	12813000	convicted beyond a reasonable doubt
12813000	12815000	of a crime in a given
12815000	12817000	situation that the natural
12817000	12819000	law argument for punishing them
12819000	12821000	comes precisely because of the
12821000	12823000	the duty that the government has
12823000	12825000	in justice to protect the safety of its citizens
12825000	12827000	likewise the
12827000	12829000	debt of punishment to
12829000	12831000	a criminal comes as
12831000	12833000	a retribution argument namely
12833000	12835000	that this is in fact what is due
12835000	12837000	here I think of a figure like
12837000	12839000	Hegel the great German philosopher
12839000	12841000	who insisted that this is really
12841000	12843000	the only justification for
12843000	12845000	punishment namely to respect
12845000	12847000	the fact that the person was a reasonable
12847000	12849000	agent and not someone who is simply
12849000	12851000	insane whom we would do better
12851000	12853000	to confine to a mental asylum
12853000	12855000	to respect someone who does
12855000	12857000	out of their own free will
12857000	12859000	an act which is criminal requires
12859000	12861000	that we punish them when we catch them
12861000	12863000	and this is what we owe them to respect
12863000	12865000	their rationality namely some restriction
12865000	12867000	of their liberty
12867000	12869000	of course about how far punishment should
12869000	12871000	go questions about the time to be served
12871000	12873000	here's one of those places where I
12873000	12875000	suspect that natural law has to
12875000	12877000	stand back and say we can't
12877000	12879000	decide this it now has to be a
12879000	12881000	determination based upon the
12881000	12883000	the more specific considerations
12883000	12885000	of prudence how long the punishment
12885000	12887000	should be for something what type
12887000	12889000	of confinement natural law doesn't
12889000	12891000	on the other hand rule out certain
12891000	12893000	types of punishment as as
12893000	12895000	unreasonable and arbitrary as the
12895000	12897000	why I think we do not torture prisoners
12897000	12899000	it's a sense that somehow this is
12899000	12901000	an offense against their human dignity
12901000	12903000	even though they have so gravely offended
12903000	12905000	the community questions
12905000	12907000	of capital punishment occur here of course
12907000	12909000	because in the case of capital punishment
12909000	12911000	there is a very very severe
12911000	12913000	punishment that is being envisioned
12913000	12915000	for a crime and the question
12915000	12917000	is whether or not this is something that
12917000	12919000	is that is just we
12919000	12921000	might ask for instance what crimes
12921000	12923000	would be considered to be included
12923000	12925000	on a list of capital crimes
12925000	12927000	the biblical list for instance differs
12927000	12929000	considerably from most civil lists
12929000	12931000	the biblical list would include idolatry
12931000	12933000	and adultery neither of which
12933000	12935000	would be presently punishable under
12935000	12937000	civil law the civil law on the other
12937000	12939000	hand tends to focus on crimes like
12939000	12941000	murder and kidnapping treason
12941000	12943000	and terror and in doing so
12943000	12945000	I think is making a very interesting
12945000	12947000	claim about what the purpose of government
12947000	12949000	is namely to preserve
12949000	12951000	the safety of the people and
12951000	12953000	to identify those crimes
12953000	12955000	especially crimes which cannot
12955000	12957000	be undone like murder or
12957000	12959000	torture or terror and to insist
12959000	12961000	that in this case a person has
12961000	12963000	sacrificed some of
12963000	12965000	the natural rights that would normally
12965000	12967000	be present to that person
12967000	12969000	on the other hand I don't go too far
12969000	12971000	with that argument especially when we
12971000	12973000	consider natural rights to be inalienable
12973000	12975000	then even criminals convicted
12975000	12977000	of capital crimes nonetheless
12977000	12979000	have some ongoing rights
12979000	12981000	one could consider other matters
12981000	12983000	of taxation for instance and note
12983000	12985000	the distributive justice that's
12985000	12987000	involved in which we share the burdens
12987000	12989000	of taxation but it brings
12989000	12991000	up very interesting questions which could be
12991000	12993000	discussed here is a flat rate tax
12993000	12995000	the appropriate sort of tax
12995000	12997000	or does one require some kind
12997000	12999000	of a graduated tax is a sales tax
12999000	13001000	or is a property tax just
13001000	13003000	these are questions on which natural
13003000	13005000	law by virtue of its advertence to
13005000	13007000	the nature of justice the objective
13007000	13009000	and universal claim could have
13009000	13011000	an interesting role in our legislation
13029000	13031000	lecture 22 current applications
13031000	13033000	bioethics
13037000	13039000	it is hard to imagine
13039000	13041000	an area of
13041000	13043000	moral, political and legal
13043000	13045000	landscape that is
13045000	13047000	more contentious
13047000	13049000	and more fragmented than the area
13049000	13051000	of bioethics and medicine today
13051000	13053000	there are such fundamental
13053000	13055000	disagreements about these matters
13055000	13057000	that the debates can
13057000	13059000	seem interminable
13059000	13061000	this lecture will not try to oversimplify
13061000	13063000	what is admittedly
13063000	13065000	a very complex question
13065000	13067000	but it will attempt to show how
13067000	13069000	a natural law approach to ethics
13069000	13071000	would apply to the range
13071000	13073000	of current issues
13073000	13075000	including the areas of abortion
13075000	13077000	infanticide, stem cell
13077000	13079000	research, euthanasia,
13079000	13081000	position assisted suicide
13081000	13083000	I will give the bulk of the time
13083000	13085000	just to considering one case namely abortion
13085000	13087000	and infanticide and to
13087000	13089000	try to show not only what the content
13089000	13091000	of the natural law contribution is
13091000	13093000	but also by this example
13093000	13095000	to show how one uses
13095000	13097000	a natural law approach in practice
13097000	13099000	and then in what time remains look at some
13099000	13101000	of the other issues more briefly
13101000	13103000	natural law analysis
13103000	13105000	of the question about abortion
13105000	13107000	and infanticide
13107000	13109000	is a question about of course the
13109000	13111000	permissibility of the taking
13111000	13113000	of the lives of the unborn
13113000	13115000	abortion or the lives
13115000	13117000	of the defective newborn
13117000	13119000	infanticide and a natural
13119000	13121000	law approach would urge
13121000	13123000	that there is a need to consider
13123000	13125000	the nature of all of
13125000	13127000	those who will be in any way affected
13127000	13129000	as well as other factors
13129000	13131000	that enter into any ethical analysis
13131000	13133000	things like the intention that the agent
13133000	13135000	has, the likely consequences
13135000	13137000	over the long term, the circumstances
13137000	13139000	this is very typical
13139000	13141000	of natural law analysis namely
13141000	13143000	that you have to focus on those
13143000	13145000	three issues explicitly what kind
13145000	13147000	of act on whom
13147000	13149000	is it being done and what is their
13149000	13151000	nature, what is the intention
13151000	13153000	what are the likely consequences
13153000	13155000	what are the circumstances
13155000	13157000	now in questions of abortion and infanticide
13157000	13159000	we need to ask
13159000	13161000	some of those basic questions about nature
13161000	13163000	and I would like to remind us right here
13163000	13165000	at the start of one of those
13165000	13167000	principles that we saw at the very beginning
13167000	13169000	of this lecture series
13169000	13171000	and ask you to bear it in mind and consider
13171000	13173000	in the abstract whether you think this is a good
13173000	13175000	principle and then see how it seems
13175000	13177000	to apply here
13177000	13179000	it's as simple as this that both
13179000	13181000	legally and morally
13181000	13183000	there is no justification
13183000	13185000	for a difference
13185000	13187000	in the way we treat
13187000	13189000	individuals unless there is
13189000	13191000	a difference of kind but rather
13191000	13193000	the beings that are of the same kind
13193000	13195000	need to be treated in the same way
13195000	13197000	arbitrarily treating
13197000	13199000	individuals of the same kind
13199000	13201000	differently would be unfair
13201000	13203000	would be a kind of discrimination
13203000	13205000	and we saw in those early
13205000	13207000	lectures it's a point worth repeating
13207000	13209000	here that there clearly is
13209000	13211000	a plurality of kinds
13211000	13213000	of things in the world
13213000	13215000	denying that there is a genuinely
13215000	13217000	distinct set of kinds
13217000	13219000	would entail unacceptable
13219000	13221000	consequences for instance
13221000	13223000	again to take as a really obvious case
13223000	13225000	if there were no such difference
13225000	13227000	of kind then there would
13227000	13229000	be no difference between killing a human
13229000	13231000	being and killing a horse but rather
13231000	13233000	we say that it's wrong to kill a human
13233000	13235000	being because of the kind that's there
13235000	13237000	where to kill a horse or to kill a cow
13237000	13239000	one shouldn't be arbitrary about it
13239000	13241000	one shouldn't be trying to torture the poor animal
13241000	13243000	but that there's not the same
13243000	13245000	moral prohibition
13245000	13247000	now in the cases we have at hand here
13247000	13249000	abortion and infanticide
13249000	13251000	those who are going to be
13251000	13253000	most deeply affected
13253000	13255000	include of course the mother
13255000	13257000	include the physicians who would be involved
13257000	13259000	but especially include
13259000	13261000	those beings whose lives will be
13261000	13263000	ended and if one can
13263000	13265000	ascertain and be convinced
13265000	13267000	that the individuals
13267000	13269000	who are going to be slain
13269000	13271000	are innocent human beings
13271000	13273000	the natural law does not allow
13273000	13275000	that they would be treated differently
13275000	13277000	than any other innocent human being
13277000	13279000	and hence that they be protected by the right
13279000	13281000	to life this is
13281000	13283000	of course to insist again
13283000	13285000	and again that there's a need to be concerned
13285000	13287000	about all the individuals but
13287000	13289000	especially to focus on those who are most
13289000	13291000	deeply affected and in this particular
13291000	13293000	case since it's a case of killing
13293000	13295000	they are affected in a way that cannot be
13295000	13297000	undone now to establish
13297000	13299000	that those to be affected in this way
13299000	13301000	are human strikes me as a biological
13301000	13303000	question namely
13303000	13305000	it can be shown that they are members
13305000	13307000	of the human species and this
13307000	13309000	can be shown in any number of ways
13309000	13311000	it can be shown by direct observation
13311000	13313000	if one can see what they're doing
13313000	13315000	what they look like their structure
13315000	13317000	one can do this by DNA analysis
13317000	13319000	one can do this by noticing
13319000	13321000	that they were conceived and are
13321000	13323000	in the process of being born from human parents
13323000	13325000	that even
13325000	13327000	those who are born with genetic
13327000	13329000	defects are still human beings
13329000	13331000	can I think be established by the fact
13331000	13333000	of continuity in their lives
13333000	13335000	that is they have
13335000	13337000	not yet undergone that kind of
13337000	13339000	transformation that is death
13339000	13341000	some kind of transformation into members
13341000	13343000	of another species but rather
13343000	13345000	are still members of the same species
13345000	13347000	and will remain so if
13347000	13349000	given simply normal nutrition
13349000	13351000	normal care but
13351000	13353000	death would be a radical transformation
13353000	13355000	what in the technical language of philosophy
13355000	13357000	is called a substantial change
13357000	13359000	were they not alive and alive
13359000	13361000	indeed as human beings the
13361000	13363000	question would not even come up
13363000	13365000	the inability that
13365000	13367000	a defective newborn might have
13367000	13369000	to perform some function is
13369000	13371000	not death it is not the
13371000	13373000	transformation of that being
13373000	13375000	into a being of a new species
13375000	13377000	it is rather the inability
13377000	13379000	to perform a certain operation
13379000	13381000	and hence I think you can hear even in the
13381000	13383000	definitions that I am using those
13383000	13385000	discussions that we had near the beginning
13385000	13387000	of our course about the importance
13387000	13389000	of proper definition namely to try
13389000	13391000	to define a given species
13391000	13393000	in terms of its function is something
13393000	13395000	which can ignore
13395000	13397000	it can fail to appreciate
13397000	13399000	some of the structural features
13399000	13401000	and hence there is a need to make sure
13401000	13403000	the definitions are definitions in structural
13403000	13405000	terms and that our consideration
13405000	13407000	of functions will help us to focus
13407000	13409000	on what structural features are important
13409000	13411000	but that the definition can't be
13411000	13413000	content simply with analysis
13413000	13415000	of function the
13415000	13417000	question of species membership then
13417000	13419000	for the unborn or for the newborn defective
13419000	13421000	turns on the question
13421000	13423000	of the kind or nature
13423000	13425000	one can test the genetic
13425000	13427000	composition the DNA for
13427000	13429000	the fact is that every cell in
13429000	13431000	our bodies contains
13431000	13433000	our own distinctive DNA
13433000	13435000	signature that is our
13435000	13437000	individuality as the specific person
13437000	13439000	that we are as well as the kind
13439000	13441000	of creature that we are
13441000	13443000	the tissues that are involved
13443000	13445000	in every one of our organs is always
13445000	13447000	recognizably human it's very
13447000	13449000	interesting when one has the chance to discuss
13449000	13451000	these matters with a forensic pathologist
13451000	13453000	because they are very concerned
13453000	13455000	with finding tissue
13455000	13457000	and determining what species it came from
13457000	13459000	human what organ it came from
13459000	13461000	the complexity here
13461000	13463000	and the DNA signatures are
13463000	13465000	extremely important
13465000	13467000	now given those biological questions
13467000	13469000	and when those biological questions
13469000	13471000	are determined adequately
13471000	13473000	then one returns to the moral question
13473000	13475000	and I return to the point about
13475000	13477000	natural kind and fair treatment
13477000	13479000	namely there is no
13479000	13481000	non-arbitrary
13481000	13483000	demarcation point
13483000	13485000	for species membership
13485000	13487000	at any point in an individual's development
13487000	13489000	from the time when
13489000	13491000	the gametes the sex cells
13491000	13493000	have been joined and fused at the time
13493000	13495000	of fertilization
13495000	13497000	the new being
13497000	13499000	has a different DNA signature
13499000	13501000	than either its mother or its father
13501000	13503000	whether this is done in the natural
13503000	13505000	place within the uterus of a woman
13505000	13507000	whether this is done in a test tube
13507000	13509000	in the case of in vitro fertilization
13509000	13511000	all of the changes
13511000	13513000	that occur thereafter
13513000	13515000	that newly constituted individual
13515000	13517000	and a newly constituted individual
13517000	13519000	which we can know
13519000	13521000	as a biological fact
13521000	13523000	by current scientific testing
13523000	13525000	all of the changes that take place thereafter
13525000	13527000	are not changes in the nature
13527000	13529000	not changes in the kind
13529000	13531000	of being but rather
13531000	13533000	are matters of the growth
13533000	13535000	and unfolding of the species
13535000	13537000	specific determinants
13537000	13539000	and the person specific determinants
13539000	13541000	that are already identified
13541000	13543000	in the structure
13543000	13545000	now given this I think it's possible
13545000	13547000	to formulate a natural law argument
13547000	13549000	and the argument has three steps
13549000	13551000	first
13551000	13553000	only a difference in kind or nature
13553000	13555000	warrants difference in treatment
13555000	13557000	second point
13557000	13559000	the nature of the zygote
13559000	13561000	the embryo the fetus
13561000	13563000	even though we call these things by technical names
13563000	13565000	the nature of these is the same
13565000	13567000	as the nature of the infant
13567000	13569000	the child the adult
13569000	13571000	the infant is not a natural human being
13571000	13573000	and that is the nature of the human being
13573000	13575000	at one or another stage
13575000	13577000	of that nature's development
13577000	13579000	third
13579000	13581000	there is no private license
13581000	13583000	to kill an innocent human being
13583000	13585000	that is there's no license
13585000	13587000	that we have arbitrarily to take
13587000	13589000	an innocent individual's life
13589000	13591000	the conclusion that I think follows from this
13591000	13593000	by a natural law argumentation
13593000	13595000	is that induced abortion
13595000	13597000	that is the deliberate killing
13597000	13599000	of an innocent human being
13599000	13601000	at this stage in the beings development
13601000	13603000	is unwarranted
13603000	13605000	for it would be a matter of arbitrarily
13605000	13607000	treating innocent beings
13607000	13609000	that are the same in kind
13609000	13611000	namely all human treating them differently
13611000	13613000	now given that kind of
13613000	13615000	of analysis the natural law
13615000	13617000	I think is clear about the point in general
13617000	13619000	a sound ethical analysis
13619000	13621000	of this issue like a sound analysis
13621000	13623000	of any issue
13623000	13625000	also requires that we consider
13625000	13627000	questions about intention
13627000	13629000	and consequences and circumstances
13629000	13631000	the first point then
13631000	13633000	I think to be made is that if the analysis
13633000	13635000	of the nature of this act
13635000	13637000	had determined that the act
13637000	13639000	in question were somehow morally permissible
13639000	13641000	one can ask
13641000	13643000	with respect to how we care for the young
13643000	13645000	about the kind of food we give them
13645000	13647000	the kind of time we give them for play
13647000	13649000	or the way in which we make them go to school
13649000	13651000	there we would have questions
13651000	13653000	about activities which were all permissible
13653000	13655000	and at that point once we had decided
13655000	13657000	that the act was permissible
13657000	13659000	then we would go on to considerations
13659000	13661000	about the intention that a person has
13661000	13663000	in doing a given act
13663000	13665000	but in a case like this
13665000	13667000	where the action strikes me as intrinsically immoral
13667000	13669000	because of unfairly treating
13669000	13671000	of being whose nature has been established
13671000	13673000	it is impossible to proceed
13673000	13675000	with the analysis of possible intentions
13675000	13677000	or likely consequences
13677000	13679000	utilitarians for instance
13679000	13681000	like to focus only on consequences
13681000	13683000	and say there is no act
13683000	13685000	that is intrinsically immoral
13685000	13687000	rather we try to weigh the benefits and the burdens
13687000	13689000	or situation morality
13689000	13691000	suggests that we focus on the intention
13691000	13693000	why we are doing something
13693000	13695000	as though that were the main emphasis
13695000	13697000	the natural law analysis however
13697000	13699000	suggests that one may only
13699000	13701000	proceed to questions about intention
13701000	13703000	which are important
13703000	13705000	and questions about consequences and circumstances
13705000	13707000	which are important
13707000	13709000	but one may only do so
13709000	13711000	a permissible act by this first test
13711000	13713000	the reason
13713000	13715000	because one may not do evil
13715000	13717000	so that good may come
13717000	13719000	even if there are tremendous good consequences
13719000	13721000	one may not do something
13721000	13723000	that one knows to be an evil
13723000	13725000	even if one has a great motive
13725000	13727000	it is morally impermissible
13727000	13729000	to do evil that good may come
13729000	13731000	why? because to do so
13731000	13733000	would involve directly willing
13733000	13735000	an evil means
13735000	13737000	for some end that one desires
13737000	13739000	whether the end that one envisions
13739000	13741000	is good because it is
13741000	13743000	well intentioned
13743000	13745000	or because one judges that there will be
13745000	13747000	greater benefit than burden
13747000	13749000	important as these considerations
13749000	13751000	about consequences and intention are
13751000	13753000	the end does not justify
13753000	13755000	the use of immoral means
13755000	13757000	now I said at the beginning
13757000	13759000	and I want to repeat here
13759000	13761000	that I recognize that these situations
13761000	13763000	are often very complex
13763000	13765000	the analysis that I've given so far
13765000	13767000	is intended as a basic analysis
13767000	13769000	when the situations become
13769000	13771000	more complex and we need
13771000	13773000	to make a moral evaluation
13773000	13775000	natural law theory
13775000	13777000	recognizes this and it tries
13777000	13779000	to handle it by the use
13779000	13781000	of an additional principle
13781000	13783000	it's called the principle of double effect
13783000	13785000	this was a principle which was
13785000	13787000	historically developed
13787000	13789000	in order to handle things like self defense
13789000	13791000	may one use lethal force
13791000	13793000	in one's own defense
13793000	13795000	for instance is being attacked
13795000	13797000	and one is innocent and the person
13797000	13799000	doing the attacking is somehow
13799000	13801000	rightly considered to be an aggressor
13801000	13803000	and the natural law said there's got to be a way
13803000	13805000	to defend the use of lethal force
13805000	13807000	force which would even result in the death
13807000	13809000	of the attacker
13809000	13811000	this likewise happens in the case
13811000	13813000	of the defense of one's country
13813000	13815000	let me talk first about the principle
13815000	13817000	of double effect in general
13817000	13819000	and then suggest a way in which it might apply
13819000	13821000	to some cases of abortion
13821000	13823000	what you think about the matter
13823000	13825000	first let me do the principle of double effect
13825000	13827000	in general the principle of double effect
13827000	13829000	is a principle that is designed
13829000	13831000	to be used in moral analysis
13831000	13833000	when what we do is
13833000	13835000	foresee that the action that we are intending
13835000	13837000	has a double
13837000	13839000	effect or perhaps a plural effect
13839000	13841000	but for simplicity's sake let's just take two
13841000	13843000	namely a good effect
13843000	13845000	that we foresee and intend
13845000	13847000	and an evil effect
13847000	13849000	which we also foresee but which we
13849000	13851000	intend and the question is
13851000	13853000	may one undertake the action
13853000	13855000	which has this double effect
13855000	13857000	according to the natural
13857000	13859000	law analysis of the situation
13859000	13861000	there are four conditions that must be met
13861000	13863000	if we are permitted
13863000	13865000	to do the action under this principle
13865000	13867000	first the action itself
13867000	13869000	that we perform must be good
13869000	13871000	or indifferent
13871000	13873000	it must be something which by its nature
13873000	13875000	is not intrinsically immoral
13875000	13877000	second the good
13877000	13879000	the agent intends
13879000	13881000	must not be obtained by means
13881000	13883000	of the evil effect
13883000	13885000	that's the causal line it's a matter of
13885000	13887000	not doing one thing that's evil
13887000	13889000	so that another good thing will come
13889000	13891000	it's a matter of keeping the analysis
13891000	13893000	in terms of one action that truly has
13893000	13895000	plural effects
13895000	13897000	the evil effect is a kind of side effect
13897000	13899000	a side effect of the same action
13899000	13901000	third the evil effect
13901000	13903000	must not be intended for itself
13903000	13905000	but only permitted
13905000	13907000	we foresee that it's happening
13907000	13909000	but we don't ourselves choose it
13909000	13911000	fourth there must be a proportionally
13911000	13913000	grave reason for permitting
13913000	13915000	the evil effect to occur
13915000	13917000	that's where we get into the analysis of consequences
13917000	13919000	let me give one simple example
13919000	13921000	of a different nature just to sort of show
13921000	13923000	how this works
13923000	13925000	if for example we were considering a fireman
13925000	13927000	entering into a burning building
13927000	13929000	to save the lives of some individuals
13929000	13931000	entering into the burning building
13931000	13933000	is a situation of danger
13933000	13935000	or a fireman undertaking this
13935000	13937000	can foresee that entering into this
13937000	13939000	has possible bad consequences
13939000	13941000	his own death or injury
13941000	13943000	or the death of his fellow fireman
13943000	13945000	and yet entering into this
13945000	13947000	especially if one has the right gear on
13947000	13949000	and has enough training
13949000	13951000	well the action itself is quite good
13951000	13953000	and the entering into the building
13953000	13955000	is not in any way done for the sake
13955000	13957000	of trying to have the fireman die
13957000	13959000	if the fireman had a death wish
13959000	13961000	this is a person who needs therapy
13961000	13963000	but rather presuming the reasonability
13963000	13965000	of the fireman and all the training
13965000	13967000	and the very careful
13967000	13969000	rules that they follow in entering the building
13969000	13971000	the fireman does so
13971000	13973000	and in doing so
13973000	13975000	he intends to save some individuals
13975000	13977000	he in no way intends his own death
13977000	13979000	he doesn't intend that his family
13979000	13981000	should profit by the insurance policy
13981000	13983000	if in fact he is
13983000	13985000	somehow injured in the line
13985000	13987000	nor would the evil effect
13987000	13989000	if it were to occur be the cause
13989000	13991000	of the good effect but it would truly be a side product
13991000	13993000	if the fireman enters the burning building
13993000	13995000	and dies
13995000	13997000	or is severely wounded
13997000	13999000	that isn't what saves the party
13999000	14001000	that he's trying to save
14001000	14003000	but rather it's a byproduct
14003000	14005000	it's a side effect it's something that may happen
14005000	14007000	in the course of things
14007000	14009000	the evil effect is not being intended for itself
14009000	14011000	the evil effect is not the cause of the good effect
14011000	14013000	the evil effect is simply foreseen
14013000	14015000	the fourth condition
14015000	14017000	the matter of analyzing
14017000	14019000	the consequences is extremely important
14019000	14021000	one may enter the burning building
14021000	14023000	say to save persons
14023000	14025000	but one may not risk
14025000	14027000	grave danger to one's life
14027000	14029000	to save merely pets
14029000	14031000	or to save paintings or something of the sort
14031000	14033000	that is the risk would have to be very minimal
14033000	14035000	in order to save something else
14035000	14037000	because the proportions wouldn't be handled well
14037000	14039000	there are lots and lots of cases
14039000	14041000	where the principle of double effect
14041000	14043000	comes into play
14043000	14045000	my point here in using that example
14045000	14047000	is simply to try to illustrate the principle in general
14047000	14049000	namely all four conditions
14049000	14051000	have to be fulfilled
14051000	14053000	the violation of any of them
14053000	14055000	would make the evil somehow
14055000	14057000	directly willed
14057000	14059000	and not just an incidental byproduct
14059000	14061000	for which the agent would still be responsible
14061000	14063000	the principle of double effect
14063000	14065000	does not eliminate responsibility
14065000	14067000	but rather it makes it possible
14067000	14069000	for us to deal with conflict situations
14069000	14071000	without incurring
14071000	14073000	moral guilt or blame
14073000	14075000	or the evil effect that we are foreseeing
14075000	14077000	and allowing but in no way desiring
14077000	14079000	now when we turn to the question of abortion
14079000	14081000	natural law theorists
14081000	14083000	have examined the possible
14083000	14085000	uses of this general
14085000	14087000	principle of double effect
14087000	14089000	and often they have agreed that there are some
14089000	14091000	scenarios where it may apply
14091000	14093000	this is not going to be a blanket justification
14093000	14095000	for the permissibility of abortion
14095000	14097000	but rather for some
14097000	14099000	foreseeable and well
14099000	14101000	determined scenarios
14101000	14103000	for example in the case of a pregnant woman
14103000	14105000	who is discovered to have a cancerous
14105000	14107000	uterus
14107000	14109000	in that particular case
14109000	14111000	the removal of the cancerous uterus
14111000	14113000	will certainly produce a good effect for the patient
14113000	14115000	namely a removal of the cancer
14115000	14117000	and as such it's a recognized medical procedure
14117000	14119000	that is a good procedure
14119000	14121000	the death of the baby that could come
14121000	14123000	about is handled as a
14123000	14125000	tragic but foreseen effect
14125000	14127000	of the hysterectomy
14127000	14129000	it is not the means to the good
14129000	14131000	effect and you can prove that
14131000	14133000	by analyzing
14133000	14135000	if the baby were killed
14135000	14137000	but the uterus were not removed
14137000	14139000	then the good effect that is desired
14139000	14141000	namely the restoration of health
14141000	14143000	would still not be achieved
14143000	14145000	so it's not the death of the baby
14145000	14147000	which is the cause of the good effect
14147000	14149000	in the scenario that we are envisioning here
14149000	14151000	the death of the baby is in no way desired
14151000	14153000	this of course is often a matter
14153000	14155000	of what medical technology
14155000	14157000	at a present time can achieve
14157000	14159000	there are certain times when
14159000	14161000	even a baby who is premature
14161000	14163000	can be saved outside the womb
14163000	14165000	and that question about viability
14165000	14167000	is very much a question that has to be handled
14167000	14169000	in terms of the science
14169000	14171000	and the medical technology of the day
14171000	14173000	finally the situation
14173000	14175000	here does involve
14175000	14177000	two human lives
14177000	14179000	and there is at least some proportionality
14179000	14181000	that would not have been the case if the deliberation
14181000	14183000	had turned on some other factor
14183000	14185000	such as weighing the baby
14185000	14187000	against a future career
14187000	14190000	or weighing the baby against financial considerations
14190000	14192000	that we do need to have tremendous care
14192000	14194000	for the women who are involved
14194000	14195000	and tremendous compassion
14195000	14197000	and at the same time in our moral analysis
14197000	14199000	we have to also have great care for the baby
14199000	14201000	it's a matter of caring for both
14201000	14203000	because we have done our analysis
14203000	14205000	of the nature of both
14205000	14207000	now my efforts have not been to try
14207000	14209000	to settle all the questions of abortion
14209000	14211000	but rather to show in the time allowed
14211000	14213000	what a natural law analysis
14213000	14215000	could contribute to the situation
14215000	14217000	let me now turn to some other questions
14217000	14219000	that might well be worth discussing
14219000	14221000	and show how
14221000	14223000	natural analysis can similarly be helpful
14223000	14225000	and I think I'll be able to go more quickly
14225000	14227000	through them because we've
14227000	14229000	done our work showing how the natural law argument
14229000	14231000	is made
14231000	14233000	right now there are great questions
14233000	14235000	afoot in our country about
14235000	14237000	physician assisted suicide
14237000	14239000	for those who have been incapacitated
14239000	14241000	by age, illness or accident
14241000	14243000	and I think these are
14243000	14245000	a group of cases which can be
14245000	14247000	fruitfully subjected to natural
14247000	14249000	analysis
14249000	14251000	the analysis will be very similar
14251000	14253000	to what was just considered above
14253000	14255000	in terms of abortion and infanticide
14255000	14257000	first, once one has established
14257000	14259000	that those to be affected
14259000	14261000	are human beings
14261000	14263000	and indeed innocent human beings
14263000	14265000	the natural law requires the protection
14265000	14267000	of their lives as a right
14267000	14269000	namely it is something which is only good
14269000	14271000	and true and right because of their nature
14271000	14273000	but rather than laying
14273000	14275000	out the entire argument again
14275000	14277000	I think I've done that in the first part
14277000	14279000	it may be more helpful to address certain
14279000	14281000	additional factors that tend to come into
14281000	14283000	the consideration of this question
14283000	14285000	these issues of course are very complex
14285000	14287000	and I have to admit here
14287000	14289000	that there is no way to cover all the
14289000	14291000	important aspects here rather
14291000	14293000	I simply want to stress how one might
14293000	14295000	let natural law approach the case
14295000	14297000	unlike the question of
14297000	14299000	abortion and infanticide
14299000	14301000	where those who are affected
14301000	14303000	are not yet able to speak for themselves
14303000	14305000	it can sometimes be the case
14305000	14307000	that the individuals who are
14307000	14309000	ill and are in great pain
14309000	14311000	may themselves be seeking the
14311000	14313000	assistance of a physician
14313000	14315000	to end their own lives or even if
14315000	14317000	they have lost the power to speak
14317000	14319000	and the power to communicate
14319000	14321000	they may already have done so by living will
14321000	14323000	it is important to note here
14323000	14325000	a great variety of related issues
14325000	14327000	but at the broader level of these issues
14327000	14329000	namely euthanasia in general
14329000	14331000	as well as in the more specific
14331000	14333000	issues that are correlated with euthanasia
14333000	14335000	such as decisions about
14335000	14337000	those who are no longer able to express
14337000	14339000	their own preferences
14339000	14341000	what we have is a case where we're dealing
14341000	14343000	with human beings and asking
14343000	14345000	whether there is a right to kill
14345000	14347000	either to kill oneself or to
14347000	14349000	commission a physician to do the killing
14349000	14351000	while those who are inclined
14351000	14353000	to a utilitarian analysis
14353000	14355000	tend to argue in favor of euthanasia
14355000	14357000	in favor of
14357000	14359000	physician assisted suicide
14359000	14361000	and sometimes even a policy
14361000	14363000	to euthanize those who are
14363000	14365000	terminally ill but who cannot any
14365000	14367000	longer express their consent
14367000	14369000	it is my view that a natural law
14369000	14371000	analysis will forbid all such activity
14371000	14373000	the utilitarian
14373000	14375000	case as before will consider
14375000	14377000	only that fourth factor
14377000	14379000	namely the relative
14379000	14381000	products of the action
14381000	14383000	the relative consequences
14383000	14385000	and will try to weigh benefit and burden
14385000	14387000	and will not only try to weigh
14387000	14389000	benefit and burden something we must do
14389000	14391000	but will try to insist that the whole
14391000	14393000	moral analysis is in terms
14393000	14395000	of benefit and burden
14395000	14397000	perhaps the
14397000	14399000	easiest way to understand the point
14399000	14401000	is to consider how there are
14401000	14403000	natural rights and wrongs
14403000	14405000	that are
14405000	14407000	already decisive for the question
14407000	14409000	and we in the United States
14409000	14411000	have a special way of doing this
14411000	14413000	when we think back to something like
14413000	14415000	the Declaration of Independence
14415000	14417000	I do not mean that the Declaration of Independence
14417000	14419000	has legal standing for us for it does not
14419000	14421000	our legal standing begins with the Constitution
14421000	14423000	but in terms of the moral analysis
14423000	14425000	those lines
14425000	14427000	in the declaration that pertain
14427000	14429000	to our basic rights
14429000	14431000	talk about those rights as inalienable
14431000	14433000	and they list among the inalienable
14433000	14435000	rights the right to life
14435000	14437000	liberty and the pursuit of happiness
14437000	14439000	well when we focus on a right to life
14439000	14441000	and call it inalienable
14441000	14443000	what we are saying is not only that
14443000	14445000	it may not be arbitrarily
14445000	14447000	removed by someone else
14447000	14449000	but also that it cannot be
14449000	14451000	arbitrarily waived that is it
14451000	14453000	is unable to be given away
14453000	14455000	by us just as it is unable to be
14455000	14457000	taken away by someone else
14457000	14459000	if either of those things were the case
14459000	14461000	then the right would not be inalienable
14461000	14463000	the counter examples
14463000	14465000	which perhaps come to mind on
14465000	14467000	whether these rights are indeed inalienable
14467000	14469000	help us understand the issue
14469000	14471000	doesn't for instance
14471000	14473000	the soldier who enters the battlefield
14473000	14475000	or the religious martyr
14475000	14477000	someone willing to witness to the faith
14477000	14479000	even to the point of death
14479000	14481000	don't they involve giving away our rights
14481000	14483000	I would say no
14483000	14485000	that instead they are cases in which
14485000	14487000	one person will undertake
14487000	14489000	an action in which one can foresee
14489000	14491000	that another person
14491000	14493000	namely the enemy on the battlefield
14493000	14495000	or the enemy in matters of religion
14495000	14497000	who is going to make a martyr out of this poor soul
14497000	14499000	the enemy is somehow taking a life
14499000	14501000	but the right
14501000	14503000	is something that does not belong to the soldier
14503000	14505000	or to the martyr to give away
14505000	14507000	rather one has to see
14507000	14509000	those individuals the soldier
14509000	14511000	who is standing under obedience
14511000	14513000	for the common good of the country
14513000	14515000	or the martyr who is standing for the truth of the faith
14515000	14517000	are simply
14517000	14519000	witnessing to something else of very high value
14519000	14521000	and they themselves are willing
14521000	14523000	to put themselves in harm's way
14523000	14525000	but they are not yielding their right
14525000	14527000	one may not have a martyr complex
14527000	14529000	for instance that seeks death
14529000	14531000	nor should we rashly toss away soldiers
14531000	14533000	in a battlefield
14533000	14535000	natural law then does enter
14535000	14537000	the question I think by reinforcing
14537000	14539000	natural rights and urging us
14539000	14541000	to consider that euthanasia
14541000	14543000	fails to respect those natural rights
14543000	14545000	and instead tries to weigh the matter
14545000	14547000	only in terms of the likely consequences
14547000	14549000	and in doing so
14549000	14551000	fails to give an appropriate
14551000	14553000	analysis of the situation
14553000	14555000	natural law does not require
14555000	14557000	never has required
14557000	14559000	that we use every possible means
14559000	14561000	to save a life
14561000	14563000	and so in the case of someone who is very ill
14563000	14565000	someone who is at death's door
14565000	14567000	even someone in great pain
14567000	14569000	it is not required that we use every means
14569000	14571000	extraordinary means
14571000	14573000	to prolong that life at all costs
14573000	14575000	rather what it forbids
14575000	14577000	is that there be any direct attack
14577000	14579000	on human life
14579000	14581000	even an attack at the patient's own request
14581000	14583000	there is instead a natural law
14583000	14585000	obligation to try to find
14585000	14587000	palliative care
14587000	14589000	to try to find ways to relieve the pain
14589000	14591000	and in my own studies on euthanasia
14591000	14593000	it has been a tremendous
14593000	14595000	revelation to me
14595000	14597000	of the new possibilities in pain management
14597000	14599000	that are now possible
14599000	14601000	palliative care I think is an extremely
14601000	14603000	helpful development
14603000	14605000	so too on this question
14605000	14607000	there may be instances where we need
14607000	14609000	to invoke the principle of double effect
14609000	14611000	some forms of pain
14611000	14613000	relief medication for example
14613000	14615000	have side effects
14615000	14617000	and when we've got a side effect we're in that double effect
14617000	14619000	situation where the action we're performing
14619000	14621000	the giving of a medicine
14621000	14623000	will relieve pain but it could also
14623000	14625000	be something that makes a person more vulnerable
14625000	14627000	to death
14627000	14629000	as before one has to examine the matter
14629000	14631000	carefully to make sure that one's
14631000	14633000	motives are pure
14633000	14635000	not trying to bring about the death more hastily
14635000	14637000	but it's only trying
14637000	14639000	to relieve the pain
14639000	14641000	the relief of pain of course
14641000	14643000	is not a causal factor in producing
14643000	14645000	the death and hence we are okay
14645000	14647000	on that second condition
14647000	14649000	because the relief of pain is not the cause
14649000	14651000	of producing the death
14651000	14653000	and hence it may well be permissible
14653000	14655000	and indeed very prudent
14655000	14657000	to administer certain forms of pain relief
14657000	14659000	even though there is a by-product
14659000	14661000	that means a greater vulnerability
14661000	14663000	to death so long as they themselves
14663000	14665000	are not the medicine which turns
14665000	14667000	out to be a poison and in some way
14667000	14669000	causing the death.
14669000	14671000	Let me turn in the time that remains
14671000	14673000	to another question that is very much
14673000	14675000	in the news right now and deserves our consideration
14675000	14677000	the debates over stem cell research
14677000	14679000	this too I think has the same
14679000	14681000	kind of analysis and so we'll be able
14681000	14683000	to rely upon what we have covered
14683000	14685000	earlier in this lecture
14685000	14687000	once again I'm making no claim
14687000	14689000	to have a thorough analysis of this
14689000	14691000	but only to try to show how natural law applies.
14691000	14693000	Let us presume
14693000	14695000	something here for the sake of argument
14695000	14697000	let's presume that
14697000	14699000	research on stem cells
14699000	14701000	will actually be helpful.
14701000	14703000	Stem cells are those cells
14703000	14705000	that have not yet become differentiated
14705000	14707000	in our body our tissue cells
14707000	14709000	are very different than our nerve cells
14709000	14711000	are different than our blood cells
14711000	14713000	are different than our muscle cells and so on
14713000	14715000	they have been differentiated
14715000	14717000	in such a way that the structure of the cell
14717000	14719000	very highly determined
14719000	14721000	to do a particular job in the body.
14721000	14723000	A stem cell refers to a cell
14723000	14725000	which has not yet been differentiated
14725000	14727000	so as to have just one particular
14727000	14729000	biological function but these are cells
14729000	14731000	that are still open to development
14731000	14733000	in various ways for various
14733000	14735000	different purposes in the body.
14735000	14737000	What I'd like to presume for the sake of argument
14737000	14739000	something which has not yet been scientifically established
14739000	14741000	is that it will actually be
14741000	14743000	helpful to manipulate these cells
14743000	14745000	to remedy various diseases
14745000	14747000	and afflictions
14747000	14749000	that are of a genetic order
14749000	14751000	or can perhaps be cured by a genetic therapy.
14751000	14753000	I cannot stress enough
14753000	14755000	that as yet the evidence isn't in
14755000	14757000	this is even going to work
14757000	14759000	but let's presume for a minute that it will work.
14759000	14761000	Natural law analysis can be helpful
14761000	14763000	when we're considering the source
14763000	14765000	for these stem cells.
14765000	14767000	As in any natural law analysis
14767000	14769000	one needs to consider the nature
14769000	14771000	of those who will be affected
14771000	14773000	by the proposed action.
14773000	14775000	When we are trying to gather stem cells
14775000	14777000	from an existing adult
14777000	14779000	for the sake of the research
14779000	14781000	the cells can be obtained
14781000	14783000	without any ill effect upon the donor
14783000	14785000	so if they were to try to take them from me
14785000	14787000	or from you it would not cause our death
14787000	14789000	or indeed cause our injury
14789000	14791000	and this invokes one of the main principles
14791000	14793000	that is involved in
14793000	14795000	the moral analysis of medical research.
14795000	14797000	Namely that experimentation
14797000	14799000	should either directly benefit
14799000	14801000	the person experimented on
14801000	14803000	or if it's not going to directly
14803000	14805000	benefit the person experimented on
14805000	14807000	but will affect and benefit
14807000	14809000	other generations or other people
14809000	14811000	we should at least not in any way harm
14811000	14813000	the person who is being affected to the donor.
14813000	14815000	Experimentation on stem cells
14815000	14817000	from adults is thus in general permissible
14817000	14819000	but experimentation
14819000	14821000	on embryonic stem cells
14821000	14823000	is different. In this case the stem
14823000	14825000	cells are being obtained by removing
14825000	14827000	from already existing
14827000	14829000	but very very young embryos
14829000	14831000	precisely those portions
14831000	14833000	of the embryos structure
14833000	14835000	the DNA which contains
14835000	14837000	the determinants of a new person
14837000	14839000	and which will remain unique to that person
14839000	14841000	throughout the whole of his life
14841000	14843000	precisely because the destruction
14843000	14845000	of the embryo is entailed
14845000	14847000	in trying to get stem cells
14847000	14849000	from embryos for the sake of research
14849000	14851000	in order to do these various
14851000	14853000	biochemical developments
14853000	14855000	it seems to me forbidden by the natural law
14855000	14857000	because the natural law prohibits
14857000	14859000	taking any human life and this is
14859000	14861000	a new human life. Hence the argument
14861000	14863000	relies upon identifying
14863000	14865000	the nature of the being and
14865000	14867000	natural law analysis seems to identify
14867000	14869000	a new human life from the moment
14869000	14871000	of conception until we experience
14871000	14873000	that radical discontinuity
14873000	14875000	that we know as personal death.
14875000	14877000	For this reason even embryos seem to me
14877000	14879000	to enjoy the protection of the right to life.
14879000	14881000	In the next hour we'll try
14881000	14883000	to turn to yet other moral questions.
14887000	14889000	Thank you.
14911000	14913000	The attempt to apply
14913000	14915000	principles of morality
14915000	14917000	to our current situations
14917000	14919000	always is extremely
14919000	14921000	complex and requires great
14921000	14923000	consideration, requires that
14923000	14925000	we attempt to be reasonable in trying
14925000	14927000	to bridge disagreements.
14927000	14929000	How does one bridge
14929000	14931000	the vast differences of opinion
14931000	14933000	within a secular and pluralistic
14933000	14935000	society about some of the
14935000	14937000	really important questions
14937000	14939000	that anyone must face in life
14939000	14941000	questions about marriage and family
14941000	14943000	or questions about the relations
14943000	14945000	of labor and capital
14945000	14947000	questions about private property
14947000	14949000	and the legitimacy of one's control over that
14949000	14951000	questions about the proper
14951000	14953000	distribution of tax burdens
14953000	14955000	this is in general the field
14955000	14957000	of social ethics and these are
14957000	14959000	questions that are extremely difficult
14959000	14961000	I think because there is often
14961000	14963000	no basis, no common
14963000	14965000	fundamental agreement
14965000	14967000	on which one may then attempt more
14967000	14969000	detailed applications
14969000	14971000	and try to settle more complex
14971000	14973000	questions.
14973000	14975000	Natural law theory has a voice in this
14975000	14977000	discussion and what I would like to do
14977000	14979000	in this lecture is to contribute
14979000	14981000	some of the ways in which natural
14981000	14983000	law theories has been and can be
14983000	14985000	used to try to make a
14985000	14987000	profitable contribution on the subject
14987000	14989000	of social ethics.
14989000	14991000	In earlier in the 20th century
14991000	14993000	figures like Walter Lippmann in his
14993000	14995000	book The Public Philosophy
14995000	14997000	and then much more recently in figures
14997000	14999000	like Alistair McIntyre or Edith
14999000	15001000	decided to articulate the conditions
15001000	15003000	that are needed for talking about
15003000	15005000	morality in a constitutional
15005000	15007000	democracy such as our own
15007000	15009000	where there is a pluralist society.
15009000	15011000	Likewise some religious traditions
15011000	15013000	have found natural law to be extremely
15013000	15015000	helpful. Catholic moral theology
15015000	15017000	for instance in my own tradition
15017000	15019000	has employed natural law as a
15019000	15021000	complementary source alongside
15021000	15023000	of scripture for the purpose of
15023000	15025000	trying to present a position
15025000	15027000	that is publicly defensible
15027000	15029000	to those questions of social ethics
15029000	15031000	and thus provide a way for
15031000	15033000	religiously motivated people
15033000	15035000	to be heard in a secular context
15035000	15037000	in a way that is publicly reasonable.
15037000	15039000	In this lecture what I'd like to focus
15039000	15041000	on is the question of social ethics
15041000	15043000	by first considering
15043000	15045000	questions about whether society
15045000	15047000	has a nature and then
15047000	15049000	after having gotten at least
15049000	15051000	a reasonable position on that subject
15051000	15053000	turning to one of the ways
15053000	15055000	in which society is found and seems
15055000	15057000	very natural namely the family
15057000	15059000	as a way in which natural law can make
15059000	15061000	a contribution and then at the end
15061000	15063000	to turn just briefly to some of the other
15063000	15065000	kinds of social institutions
15065000	15067000	some of those intermediary
15067000	15069000	associations in which we
15069000	15071000	find ourselves as members
15071000	15073000	in which we consciously join
15073000	15075000	and then society as a whole
15075000	15077000	in ways in which we find ourselves in
15077000	15079000	government or in a nation or among
15079000	15081000	a people. But first let's consider
15081000	15083000	questions about simply society
15083000	15085000	and nature. We have seen
15085000	15087000	very different answers being given to this
15087000	15089000	in the course of natural
15089000	15091000	law's history that in the
15091000	15093000	ancient and medieval periods there was
15093000	15095000	already willingness to see
15095000	15097000	and to argue that societies
15097000	15099000	themselves have natures.
15099000	15101000	On the other hand in the early modern period
15101000	15103000	one saw in John Locke
15103000	15105000	and in some of the other figures
15105000	15107000	of the Enlightenment a strong suspicion
15107000	15109000	that we should think of
15109000	15111000	societies as having a nature
15111000	15113000	instead an inclination to
15113000	15115000	regard society as a matter of
15115000	15117000	a construct, perhaps a social contract
15117000	15119000	in which case there is
15119000	15121000	much less that one can do in arguing
15121000	15123000	about the nature of society.
15123000	15125000	But then in the course of our review
15125000	15127000	of the practice of judicial review
15127000	15129000	in this country we notice that certain
15129000	15131000	American jurists of a liberal persuasion
15131000	15133000	were very inclined to talk about
15133000	15135000	the nature of free democratic society
15135000	15137000	as indeed entailing
15137000	15139000	various kinds of moral obligation.
15139000	15141000	The question then is does society
15141000	15143000	have a nature?
15143000	15145000	And it's a debate I think within natural
15145000	15147000	law. Does society
15147000	15149000	have a structure such
15149000	15151000	that we can make a moral implication
15151000	15153000	from it? Society does
15153000	15155000	not seem to me to have a nature
15155000	15157000	in precisely the same sense
15157000	15159000	that an organic entity does
15159000	15161000	when we talk about a squirrel
15161000	15163000	or a horse or a human being
15163000	15165000	there we are talking about a biological
15165000	15167000	entity that has a very complicated
15167000	15169000	structure both at the biological
15169000	15171000	level, at the psychic or
15171000	15173000	psychological level, at the spiritual
15173000	15175000	level. And this structure
15175000	15177000	is something that flows right
15177000	15179000	from the very being from the beginning
15179000	15181000	of its existence and has an
15181000	15183000	indirectedness, has a goal, has a
15183000	15185000	teleology, precisely because
15185000	15187000	there is a unified organic substance
15187000	15189000	with a certain nature.
15189000	15191000	Societies are not biological
15191000	15193000	entities, they don't have that tight
15193000	15195000	a sense of unity. But
15195000	15197000	I think that there is an analogical
15197000	15199000	sense of the word in which we can
15199000	15201000	say that society does have a nature
15201000	15203000	and that the reason for
15203000	15205000	saying that society has a nature
15205000	15207000	at least analogously is
15207000	15209000	precisely because the human person
15209000	15211000	is so intrinsically social
15211000	15213000	because human persons
15213000	15215000	form associations whose
15215000	15217000	end or purpose is so
15217000	15219000	closely related to the natural
15219000	15221000	purpose intrinsic to any
15221000	15223000	one human being.
15223000	15225000	If one pursues this line of reasoning
15225000	15227000	what nature is it that we're
15227000	15229000	saying that society has?
15229000	15231000	Well, here we face an enormously
15231000	15233000	difficult question because of the
15233000	15235000	breadth and range of associations
15235000	15237000	which the term society covers.
15237000	15239000	They vary from the most
15239000	15241000	immediate form of association
15241000	15243000	that is the family through
15243000	15245000	various and diverse levels
15245000	15247000	of voluntary association, the kind
15247000	15249000	of clubs we join, the institutions
15249000	15251000	to which we come to belong. If we
15251000	15253000	join the military, if we join a religious
15253000	15255000	order such as I have, or any kind
15255000	15257000	of voluntary association
15257000	15259000	these have structures.
15259000	15261000	And finally we reach up to the level
15261000	15263000	of a state, the levels at which
15263000	15265000	we're normally governed, but also
15265000	15267000	two various forms in which there are
15267000	15269000	peoples even though there is not a government.
15269000	15271000	I think in the history of for instance
15271000	15273000	my own nationality that the Polish
15273000	15275000	people existed for about
15275000	15277000	a century and a little bit more even
15277000	15279000	when there was no state of Poland
15279000	15281000	nonetheless there was a people that felt themselves
15281000	15283000	to be together. One sees this
15283000	15285000	frequently in the case of the breakup
15285000	15287000	of the Soviet Union where various
15287000	15289000	peoples have found that they had
15289000	15291000	a kind of commonness which they think
15291000	15293000	deserves sovereignty.
15293000	15295000	Sometimes they have managed to achieve
15295000	15297000	political sovereignty, sometimes they have not
15297000	15299000	or at least not done so as yet.
15299000	15301000	And then of course at the top most level
15301000	15303000	there are various international
15303000	15305000	associations and forms of cooperation
15305000	15307000	and each of these is properly
15307000	15309000	a society of a certain sort and hence
15309000	15311000	what we're asking about philosophically
15311000	15313000	in the question of whether society
15313000	15315000	has a nature is that we're asking
15315000	15317000	given this enormous variety
15317000	15319000	and range of associations
15319000	15321000	is there something natural about society?
15321000	15323000	At each level
15323000	15325000	it seems to me there are
15325000	15327000	inclinations of a social nature
15327000	15329000	that is we find ourselves
15329000	15331000	very spontaneously in families
15331000	15333000	and attracted to families and we form
15333000	15335000	families and likewise there's
15335000	15337000	an inclination of sociability
15337000	15339000	that we experience when we enter
15339000	15341000	these voluntary associations
15341000	15343000	and when we feel national pride
15343000	15345000	pride in our own country perhaps
15345000	15347000	a certain delight in humanity as a whole.
15347000	15349000	How should we define it
15349000	15351000	in order to bring out this analogous
15351000	15353000	sense of nature? Let me propose this.
15353000	15355000	Society I think is
15355000	15357000	a unity of human individuals
15357000	15359000	and groups which serves
15359000	15361000	the purpose of satisfying
15361000	15363000	their mutual needs
15363000	15365000	and which relies on their capacities
15365000	15367000	to provide such help.
15367000	15369000	This is to put it in terms of the give and take.
15369000	15371000	There's certain things we get from that association
15371000	15373000	and certain things that we give
15373000	15375000	and can be expected to give
15375000	15377000	from this association.
15377000	15379000	And yet I'm not trying to define it overly narrowly
15379000	15381000	precisely because of the vast
15381000	15383000	variety of societies that there are
15383000	15385000	we have to keep it at the somewhat general level.
15385000	15387000	Nonetheless we can assert
15387000	15389000	that all of these forms of association
15389000	15391000	are systems of mutual
15391000	15393000	assistance. They make possible
15393000	15395000	results that are greater
15395000	15397000	in number and different in kind
15397000	15399000	than the sum total
15399000	15401000	that is possible through separate individual
15401000	15403000	efforts alone.
15403000	15405000	And the various societies are rightly identified
15405000	15407000	on the basis of the ends
15407000	15409000	which they serve, the purposes
15409000	15411000	which they have, whether it be at the small
15411000	15413000	level of the immediate nuclear family
15413000	15415000	or whether it be at the range
15415000	15417000	of a slightly greater extended family.
15417000	15419000	Or in the case of those
15419000	15421000	voluntary associations, it is
15421000	15423000	precisely because of some purpose
15423000	15425000	that we hope to achieve that we join them
15425000	15427000	at the level of the state.
15427000	15429000	There are things that we can accomplish
15429000	15431000	only by our common assistance,
15431000	15433000	by our common contributions to the
15433000	15435000	common good and things which we
15435000	15437000	draw from which will be possible
15437000	15439000	only because there is a form
15439000	15441000	of association here. In this sense
15441000	15443000	we have an entity, I think
15443000	15445000	which can rightly make
15445000	15447000	certain claims upon us just
15447000	15449000	as we make certain claims upon it.
15449000	15451000	There are entities from which
15451000	15453000	we may rightly call forth for protection
15453000	15455000	and which we may
15455000	15457000	rightly undertake certain
15457000	15459000	duties. We need to honor them precisely
15459000	15461000	because of the form of the association.
15461000	15463000	Now this is a controversial point
15463000	15465000	and I think that one finds in the history
15465000	15467000	of the discussion, not only the recent
15467000	15469000	history in our own generation
15469000	15471000	but in the course of at least the
15471000	15473000	entire modern period, that there has
15473000	15475000	been great sense that societies
15475000	15477000	are somehow human artifacts
15477000	15479000	that human societies are of human
15479000	15481000	invention or in the most recent
15481000	15483000	terminology of the discussion
15483000	15485000	that societies are constructed
15485000	15487000	rather than natural. And I think it's
15487000	15489000	important to keep that discussion in mind
15489000	15491000	because it has enormous
15491000	15493000	significance and influence upon the
15493000	15495000	moral conclusions that we reach.
15495000	15497000	If however in that discussion
15497000	15499000	we keep in mind that all societies
15499000	15501000	however formed, some of them much
15501000	15503000	more artificial, some of them much more
15503000	15505000	natural, that all these societies
15505000	15507000	are composed of a very
15507000	15509000	unique type of being, namely
15509000	15511000	human beings, whose
15511000	15513000	nature can be ascertained, namely
15513000	15515000	that nature is a rational nature,
15515000	15517000	a nature capable of understanding
15517000	15519000	and free choice, and likewise
15519000	15521000	a nature that has certain ends
15521000	15523000	intrinsic to it, certain ends
15523000	15525000	that are built into us, then the
15525000	15527000	societies that we form are admittedly
15527000	15529000	constructed, invented
15529000	15531000	or at least their forms are devised
15531000	15533000	in such a way as to promote some of those
15533000	15535000	ends. At very least they must be
15535000	15537000	sure not to frustrate them, not
15537000	15539000	to violate them, but generally
15539000	15541000	the purpose of the society is to promote
15541000	15543000	them and to some way fulfill them.
15543000	15545000	Now the variety that is possible
15545000	15547000	is just enormous, even
15547000	15549000	at any one level, let alone at
15549000	15551000	the vast
15551000	15553000	diversity of levels. The family,
15553000	15555000	for instance, certainly can
15555000	15557000	take very different forms. We think
15557000	15559000	about the nuclear family and we think about
15559000	15561000	extended families, and when we reflect
15561000	15563000	I think on what our own family has meant
15563000	15565000	and then compare it with what the family
15565000	15567000	of our friends has been, we notice
15567000	15569000	the great diversity that is possible.
15569000	15571000	Nonetheless, all of these families
15571000	15573000	insofar as they work and are not
15573000	15575000	simply dysfunctional, are
15575000	15577000	effective at securing
15577000	15579000	and promoting a specific end.
15579000	15581000	At very least finding shelter,
15581000	15583000	finding nutrition.
15583000	15585000	Not all the forms that families
15585000	15587000	take will be equally effective
15587000	15589000	at serving the end.
15589000	15591000	Serving the end of providing us with shelter,
15591000	15593000	providing us with nutrition, let alone
15593000	15595000	at providing for the
15595000	15597000	fulfillment of some of the more
15597000	15599000	advanced ends that are typical
15599000	15601000	of human beings as rational agents.
15601000	15603000	That we should get an education,
15603000	15605000	of course, is enormously aided by having
15605000	15607000	a secure family structure, and one
15607000	15609000	can still get an education when families
15609000	15611000	are dysfunctional. We all admit
15611000	15613000	how difficult it is, and that's precisely
15613000	15615000	why we try to remedy the situation
15615000	15617000	by providing some kind of surrogates
15617000	15619000	or substitutes or some form of
15619000	15621000	assistance, because we are mindful
15621000	15623000	of the way in which the dysfunctionality
15623000	15625000	of the family makes it very difficult
15625000	15627000	to get the education that we esteem,
15627000	15629000	especially for free democratic societies.
15629000	15631000	There are also matters
15631000	15633000	of personal character. One thinks,
15633000	15635000	for instance, about cultivating habits
15635000	15637000	of truthfulness in families
15637000	15639000	and ways in which the easy
15639000	15641000	and steady trustworthy communication
15641000	15643000	that we like to see in families
15643000	15645000	is that basic pattern of truthfulness.
15645000	15647000	I had a very interesting
15647000	15649000	experience once flying back
15649000	15651000	from Atlanta, I think, back to New York,
15651000	15653000	and I was sitting next to a banker
15653000	15655000	who was very much engaged
15655000	15657000	in the project of setting up
15657000	15659000	banking institutions in post-Soviet
15659000	15661000	Russia, and what he was explaining
15661000	15663000	to me was the way in which
15663000	15665000	contracts are written and the way
15665000	15667000	in which so often word of
15667000	15669000	honor telling the truth, keeping
15669000	15671000	one's promises, is important
15671000	15673000	in doing a business. And what he was saying
15673000	15675000	was that one of the difficulties
15675000	15677000	that his firm was experiencing
15677000	15679000	in post-Soviet Russia is
15679000	15681000	the way in which word of honor,
15681000	15683000	promise keeping, telling of truth
15683000	15685000	had broken down so often, namely
15685000	15687000	that in certain portions of that Soviet
15687000	15689000	society, anyone could be
15689000	15691000	an informer, even someone within
15691000	15693000	one's family, and as such
15693000	15695000	one didn't have quite the same
15695000	15697000	security and the same trust in telling
15697000	15699000	the truth and keeping one's promises
15699000	15701000	and the difficulty they were having
15701000	15703000	in writing the contracts extended even
15703000	15705000	to the term word of honor.
15705000	15707000	They tried translating it idiomatically
15707000	15709000	in Russian, they tried to translate it
15709000	15711000	in terms of, that were very literal,
15711000	15713000	they tried to appeal to stories
15713000	15715000	in Russian literature, and he says
15715000	15717000	the people that he was dealing with
15717000	15719000	often just couldn't get it. It wasn't
15719000	15721000	even that they couldn't now suddenly
15721000	15723000	start giving a word in honor,
15723000	15725000	but that they just were unable to grasp
15725000	15727000	the concept, and at least as far as
15727000	15729000	me, an amateur anthropologist was concerned,
15729000	15731000	it was a matter of having had
15731000	15733000	trust broken down so severely
15733000	15735000	that word of honor just
15735000	15737000	didn't make sense. Instead
15737000	15739000	what they had to do of writing just one
15739000	15741000	contract in which so much is presumed
15741000	15743000	about the word of honor, and the
15743000	15745000	establishment of a whole business relationship
15745000	15747000	is that they had to write a series of
15747000	15749000	discrete contracts, and such
15749000	15751000	that one would not come into effect
15751000	15753000	until the other had been completely
15753000	15755000	and entirely satisfied and fulfilled.
15755000	15757000	One finds that that's sometimes the case
15757000	15759000	when word of honor or trust has broken
15759000	15761000	down. My point
15761000	15763000	for the purposes of this discussion of society
15763000	15765000	is that our social relations
15765000	15767000	imply certain moral
15767000	15769000	obligations for us, and that
15769000	15771000	granting the great variety of
15771000	15773000	institutions that can be the social
15773000	15775000	arrangements in which we live,
15775000	15777000	some of them do a much better job
15777000	15779000	at promoting the human development.
15779000	15781000	Some of them are much more effective
15781000	15783000	in promoting those virtues of character
15783000	15785000	as rational beings we need
15785000	15787000	in order to enjoy the benefits of social
15787000	15789000	living.
15789000	15791000	Hence the criteria for examining the
15791000	15793000	various variety of possible
15793000	15795000	social forms must always include
15795000	15797000	their suitability for
15797000	15799000	genuinely producing
15799000	15801000	the end for which they're designed,
15801000	15803000	and it's a matter of appreciating that variety
15803000	15805000	of ends as human ends.
15805000	15807000	Let me take as my example for most of this
15807000	15809000	lecture the question of family structure.
15809000	15811000	It's an issue I think that is extremely
15811000	15813000	controversial for there are great disagreements
15813000	15815000	with respect to how much of this is
15815000	15817000	natural and how much of this is a
15817000	15819000	product of nurture, how much of this
15819000	15821000	is something that natural law can
15821000	15823000	truly make a contribution to,
15823000	15825000	and how much of it on the other hand is a product
15825000	15827000	of history and of social forces
15827000	15829000	so that we really have
15829000	15831000	questions of nurture or even questions
15831000	15833000	of power entering in rather than
15833000	15835000	truly questions of nature.
15835000	15837000	I would like to urge that this
15837000	15839000	discussion, mindful of the controversies
15839000	15841000	and mindful of the disagreements,
15841000	15843000	nonetheless can profit by some of the
15843000	15845000	natural law analysis and at least
15845000	15847000	be submitted to our common reasonable
15847000	15849000	investigation in order to try to
15849000	15851000	see how such moral claims are generated.
15851000	15853000	I'd like to begin by first
15853000	15855000	considering simply the question of human
15855000	15857000	sexual complementarity because
15857000	15859000	at the level of family what we are
15859000	15861000	generally dealing with in the traditional
15861000	15863000	family is a family in which there
15863000	15865000	are spouses of different sexes.
15865000	15867000	Here there is certainly contributions
15867000	15869000	that nature makes as well as nurture
15869000	15871000	makes, that our bodily structure
15871000	15873000	is one thing in which there is an obvious
15873000	15875000	difference, but there are also suggestions
15875000	15877000	that there are questions
15877000	15879000	of psychic differentiation,
15879000	15881000	that is the way in which we see things.
15881000	15883000	Certainly it's the subject of much good humor
15883000	15885000	how men see things and how women see
15885000	15887000	things and what I would like to just urge
15887000	15889000	for the point of view of natural law analysis
15889000	15891000	is that it is important to remember
15891000	15893000	that we are both of the same species
15893000	15895000	hard as that may be to understand
15895000	15897000	in certain occasions when we're having a good spat,
15897000	15899000	but that we are truly members
15899000	15901000	of the same species and that
15901000	15903000	our equality as human
15903000	15905000	beings, our equality as bearers
15905000	15907000	of rights, our equality as
15907000	15909000	being subjects which owe duties to one
15909000	15911000	another should not be fought
15911000	15913000	in terms of an identity, that just
15913000	15915000	as there is not an identity at the level
15915000	15917000	of biological structure, in
15917000	15919000	mind judgment there is not an identity
15919000	15921000	at the level of psychological or
15921000	15923000	spiritual structure either, but that
15923000	15925000	rather there is a kind of a complementarity
15925000	15927000	and this complementarity
15927000	15929000	very evident at the biological
15929000	15931000	level, I think is also evident at the
15931000	15933000	psychological level.
15933000	15935000	Figuring out exactly what this complementarity
15935000	15937000	looks like and exactly what the
15937000	15939000	benefits and what the difficulties
15939000	15941000	of seeing the world differently,
15941000	15943000	having different habits of judgment,
15943000	15945000	having some somewhat different habits
15945000	15947000	of thought, even having some
15947000	15949000	different habits of virtue, how this
15949000	15951000	complementarity allows for genuine
15951000	15953000	human progress and how infinitely
15953000	15955000	poorer we would be if we fail
15955000	15957000	to appreciate in our moral deliberations
15957000	15959000	the extent of this complementarity
15959000	15961000	so long as we constantly
15961000	15963000	remember that fundamental natural
15963000	15965000	law thesis of our human equality.
15965000	15967000	To put it in the simplest form
15967000	15969000	equality doesn't have
15969000	15971000	to mean identity, I think there can be
15971000	15973000	an equality in which there are
15973000	15975000	complementary forms. My point is
15975000	15977000	then that there are natural lawyers
15977000	15979000	myself included who would like
15979000	15981000	to argue that this complementarity
15981000	15983000	within a system of equality
15983000	15985000	is something that makes families work
15985000	15987000	and make families prosper. They
15987000	15989000	aid and assist both the immediate
15989000	15991000	parties to the family who have made this
15991000	15993000	voluntary union, the union
15993000	15995000	of spouses, but they are also of
15995000	15997000	enormous help to the children who are generated
15997000	15999000	in offspring and enormously
15999000	16001000	helpful to the larger
16001000	16003000	groups and societies in which they live.
16003000	16005000	The kind of strengths and the
16005000	16007000	kind of support and the kind of renewal
16007000	16009000	and the kind of refreshment and the kind
16009000	16011000	of encouragement and the kind of
16011000	16013000	challenges that we give to one another
16013000	16015000	within the family is of
16015000	16017000	enormous help to people who are outside
16017000	16019000	the family and are in the larger communities
16019000	16021000	within which families are found.
16021000	16023000	Now this is a point I think that has been
16023000	16025000	made controversial by those
16025000	16027000	who have a very different take on it.
16027000	16029000	There are many today I think who regard
16029000	16031000	gender as a matter of something
16031000	16033000	that is entirely a social construct,
16033000	16035000	something that is a matter of
16035000	16037000	gender rather than nature entirely
16037000	16039000	and completely.
16039000	16041000	The mainstream natural law position
16041000	16043000	I think would regard these differences
16043000	16045000	as of complementarity
16045000	16047000	as differences that are somehow natural
16047000	16049000	and indeed crucial.
16049000	16051000	I think we had best not get dogmatic
16051000	16053000	about that, but rather insist
16053000	16055000	that there is a good legitimate argument
16055000	16057000	here for which the data of anthropology
16057000	16059000	and the data of psychology are
16059000	16061000	extremely important. Consider
16061000	16063000	for example from a natural law point of
16063000	16065000	least as I see it, what this
16065000	16067000	complementarity adds for the sake
16067000	16069000	for instance of procreation and rearing
16069000	16071000	of children. I think it is pretty
16071000	16073000	obvious from the point of view of biology
16073000	16075000	that male and female make different
16075000	16077000	but equally important contributions
16077000	16079000	to procreation. This is a factor
16079000	16081000	which has not always been appreciated
16081000	16083000	in history for there were long ages
16083000	16085000	when it was thought that only the male
16085000	16087000	contributed significantly to the generation
16087000	16089000	of children and that all women provided
16089000	16091000	was a place. The obvious
16091000	16093000	fallacy in that is now beyond
16093000	16095000	saying and we are now I think to the point
16095000	16097000	with biological knowledge of appreciating
16097000	16099000	the different complementary
16099000	16101000	but equally important contribution
16101000	16103000	that each sex makes.
16103000	16105000	Likewise at the level
16105000	16107000	of family life there is certainly
16107000	16109000	a kind of efficiency that comes
16109000	16111000	from the division in labor
16111000	16113000	that when some people do one job
16113000	16115000	some people do another job in terms
16115000	16117000	of providing food, drink,
16117000	16119000	shelter, clothing that there is an
16119000	16121000	efficiency for the family and yet
16121000	16123000	it doesn't seem to be immediately obvious
16123000	16125000	that one or the other sex has to
16125000	16127000	make this or that contribution and
16127000	16129000	that there is at least a certain variety
16129000	16131000	that can be made there. There seem to be
16131000	16133000	options within the legitimate range.
16133000	16135000	Beyond the questions of providing
16135000	16137000	food and shelter and clothing
16137000	16139000	and other such immediate needs for survival
16139000	16141000	there is the question about how
16141000	16143000	a child will develop within the context
16143000	16145000	of the family. There is questions
16145000	16147000	about learning of language skills
16147000	16149000	and learning of various kinds of skills
16149000	16151000	of interpersonal relation. Learning
16151000	16153000	how to give love and how to receive love.
16153000	16155000	This is one of the places where I think
16155000	16157000	it's so fascinating that not just
16157000	16159000	traditional natural law theory
16159000	16161000	but even some of the Freudian psychologists
16161000	16163000	of the present day people who would normally
16163000	16165000	not be in the same
16165000	16167000	part of the dispute
16167000	16169000	debate or discussion as natural
16169000	16171000	law theorists often make the case
16171000	16173000	with respect to the latency period
16173000	16175000	of childhood, the period when we are
16175000	16177000	still learning our language but are having
16177000	16179000	such enormously important
16179000	16181000	relationships with our parents
16181000	16183000	that some of the Freudian psychologists
16183000	16185000	that I think of people like Paul Vitz
16185000	16187000	or Elizabeth Moberley in their works
16187000	16189000	have brought out so clearly that
16189000	16191000	the ways in which a child
16191000	16193000	learns to love mother
16193000	16195000	and learn to love father and learn
16195000	16197000	to receive love from mother and
16197000	16199000	receive love from father have
16199000	16201000	enormous implications for the way in which
16201000	16203000	a little boy or a little girl
16203000	16205000	thereafter be related to figures
16205000	16207000	of the same sex and figures of the opposite sex.
16207000	16209000	Elizabeth Moberley's
16209000	16211000	work for instance with
16211000	16213000	children raising
16213000	16215000	and with the problems of
16215000	16217000	sometimes later on in a person's life
16217000	16219000	of homosexuality has
16219000	16221000	discovered to her satisfaction
16221000	16223000	and to the approval of at least a
16223000	16225000	significant portion of the scholarly community
16225000	16227000	that some of the things that are found
16227000	16229000	in homosexual activity later on
16229000	16231000	are related at least
16231000	16233000	to working out early childhood
16233000	16235000	traumas and I don't mean here to suggest
16235000	16237000	that all problems with regard
16237000	16239000	to sexual identity in later years
16239000	16241000	can be traced entirely to sexual
16241000	16243000	trauma that's not her position nor is it
16243000	16245000	mine but rather her suggestion is
16245000	16247000	is that some people who are having difficulty
16247000	16249000	in working out later forms
16249000	16251000	of sexual identity can indeed
16251000	16253000	be traced to sexual, trace
16253000	16255000	to childhood trauma in which
16255000	16257000	there was for example in the case of a little boy
16257000	16259000	an inability to deal
16259000	16261000	rightly with father, either not a giving
16261000	16263000	a love or not a receiving of love
16263000	16265000	adequately and in the course of working
16265000	16267000	this out one finds that all of one's life
16267000	16269000	is spent trying to find the right
16269000	16271000	relation, trying to establish
16271000	16273000	good relations with persons of the same sex.
16273000	16275000	Hence my point with respect
16275000	16277000	to natural law is the importance
16277000	16279000	of the complementarity of
16279000	16281000	mother and father for the sake of children
16281000	16283000	that they have different things
16283000	16285000	but equally important things
16285000	16287000	to teach their children and to teach them
16287000	16289000	just by way of the explicit teaching that goes on
16289000	16291000	with formal instruction
16291000	16293000	but to teach them in all of the subtle
16293000	16295000	ways in which being loved and giving
16295000	16297000	love challenged and being challenged
16297000	16299000	all of the ways in which this
16299000	16301000	helps to form a person's character
16301000	16303000	and brings about natural growth.
16303000	16305000	Certainly questions of more advanced
16305000	16307000	technical learning when we start going to
16307000	16309000	school, the acquisition
16309000	16311000	of various kinds of skills often
16311000	16313000	takes advantage of a
16313000	16315000	security at home and a disposition
16315000	16317000	at home in which there is an encouragement
16317000	16319000	of natural talent. I think
16319000	16321000	here we all have our favorite war
16321000	16323000	stories with respect to the ways
16323000	16325000	in which we were encouraged or when somebody
16325000	16327000	else was encouraged or
16327000	16329000	alternately the ways in which we were discouraged
16329000	16331000	from achieving something and
16331000	16333000	here it's so important to see
16333000	16335000	the importance of secure homes for
16335000	16337000	the sake of encouraging the natural talents
16337000	16339000	that occur in any of our children
16339000	16341000	so that they can indeed actualize
16341000	16343000	their various potentials.
16343000	16345000	If on the other hand something is
16345000	16347000	stunted, something is injured,
16347000	16349000	a person can sometimes spend much of one's life
16349000	16351000	in a kind of reaction, in a psychic
16351000	16353000	attempt to compensate.
16353000	16355000	This at least is some of the work that
16355000	16357000	Paul Vitz and Elizabeth Moverly have been doing.
16357000	16359000	If we turn
16359000	16361000	to the discussions about the ways
16361000	16363000	in which this maturation at home
16363000	16365000	has a contribution to make for the rest
16365000	16367000	of public and private life, one can
16367000	16369000	think about even the way in which
16369000	16371000	home life is a part of this nature
16371000	16373000	of a family, namely that we
16373000	16375000	cannot be in public all the time
16375000	16377000	that we require places of rest
16377000	16379000	and refreshment, places in which there is
16379000	16381000	privacy as well as places in which
16381000	16383000	we can step out on the public stage.
16383000	16385000	Again, here I think it's important not to be
16385000	16387000	too dogmatic because the lines of
16387000	16389000	exactly what are public and exactly what are
16389000	16391000	private are variable.
16391000	16393000	There is a certain range within this subject
16393000	16395000	and yet we all know that we appreciate
16395000	16397000	a certain privacy, that
16397000	16399000	we dare not live in a home with purely
16399000	16401000	private walls, that such people
16401000	16403000	who are exhibitionists of course
16403000	16405000	might relish the exhibitionism
16405000	16407000	but that most of us
16407000	16409000	find that we need for the sake of
16409000	16411000	our own rest and refreshment and our
16411000	16413000	readiness to again to appear in public
16413000	16415000	that there be places of genuine privacy.
16415000	16417000	Likewise, we insist
16417000	16419000	about the need for the opportunities
16419000	16421000	to use one's powers and abilities.
16421000	16423000	Hannah Arendt in her book
16423000	16425000	The Human Condition has a lovely
16425000	16427000	description of the way in which the
16427000	16429000	ability to step forth in public and to
16429000	16431000	try to urge people on
16431000	16433000	to common effort or common action.
16433000	16435000	The ways in which we try to convince someone
16435000	16437000	else of our own opinion and do so
16437000	16439000	not by the imposition of power
16439000	16441000	but by attempting to be extremely reasonable
16441000	16443000	requires that there be a certain
16443000	16445000	native rest and refreshment
16445000	16447000	that we attend to the needs of the natural
16447000	16449000	not just good sleep but also
16449000	16451000	times of privacy and ways in which
16451000	16453000	we can enjoy the perfect security
16453000	16455000	and the unconditional love of those
16455000	16457000	whom we are associated.
16457000	16459000	Whereas when one finds reasons for
16459000	16461000	insecurity because there is something
16461000	16463000	dysfunctional about a family
16463000	16465000	or when there has been for instance
16465000	16467000	an infidelity in one's promises of marriage
16467000	16469000	there is an insecurity there
16469000	16471000	that manifests itself and that translates
16471000	16473000	itself so very easily into the public
16473000	16475000	domain. We're not as comfortable
16475000	16477000	we're not as free to act
16477000	16479000	we're not able to rely upon the same
16479000	16481000	sources of security as when our families
16481000	16483000	are working well.
16483000	16485000	The question is that what natural law
16485000	16487000	analysis likes to bring out in this situation
16487000	16489000	is the importance of something
16489000	16491000	like marriage for the sake of
16491000	16493000	that security and that harmony
16493000	16495000	that providing of the place for us
16495000	16497000	as individuals and the place
16497000	16499000	for us to act upon the public stage.
16499000	16501000	Traditionally this has been
16501000	16503000	the role of marriage for marriage
16503000	16505000	is to provide not only for a special
16505000	16507000	form of friendship in which we are
16507000	16509000	to commit ourselves to one another
16509000	16511000	but ways in which the marriage itself
16511000	16513000	brings about our further maturation.
16513000	16515000	I myself like to think about it in this way
16515000	16517000	and would be wondering of course if people
16517000	16519000	would agree on the basis of more experience
16519000	16521000	but it seems to me that part of
16521000	16523000	what goes on in marriage is that
16523000	16525000	a man becomes even more of a man
16525000	16527000	by becoming a husband and a father
16527000	16529000	that it is that he is to
16529000	16531000	have this drawn out of him and elicited
16531000	16533000	from him precisely by the ways
16533000	16535000	in which his wife deals with him
16535000	16537000	and likewise that a woman becomes even more
16537000	16539000	of a woman by becoming wife and mother
16539000	16541000	this is not to say that those who have
16541000	16543000	never been privileged to be married
16543000	16545000	myself included never been privileged
16545000	16547000	to have children myself included
16547000	16549000	cannot be a man or cannot be a woman
16549000	16551000	but rather that there has to be some other form
16551000	16553000	of dealing in one's life in my own
16553000	16555000	case as a priest it's sometimes a matter
16555000	16557000	of dealing with the students and we educate
16557000	16559000	at the university dealing with parishioners
16559000	16561000	and finding forms of charity.
16561000	16563000	So my claim is certainly that anybody
16563000	16565000	in any situation can find
16565000	16567000	other forms to help bring out
16567000	16569000	some of these more mature responses
16569000	16571000	as man or as woman.
16571000	16573000	That wasn't the point. The point was rather
16573000	16575000	that marriage is a natural institution
16575000	16577000	that is it's something to which we are naturally
16577000	16579000	inclined and which natural
16579000	16581000	law so much promotes and
16581000	16583000	so much tries to perfect
16583000	16585000	precisely because it is a vehicle for doing that
16585000	16587000	regularly. I'm reminded of
16587000	16589000	the famous story of Mrs. McGillicuddy
16589000	16591000	talking about the priest who has just finished lecturing
16591000	16593000	on marriage and said why
16593000	16595000	that was so beautiful
16595000	16597000	and if I knew about it as little as he does
16597000	16599000	of course I'd say the same thing
16599000	16601000	and I think that brings out a little bit
16601000	16603000	of the fact that we need to be realistic here
16603000	16605000	about how this works in practice.
16605000	16607000	I'm not trying to idealize a situation
16607000	16609000	that shouldn't be idealized
16609000	16611000	but should in fact be dealt with
16611000	16613000	in all of its practical affairs.
16613000	16615000	My point simply is that this is a natural
16615000	16617000	institution not natural
16617000	16619000	in the sense of an organic institution
16619000	16621000	or an entity like our bodies
16621000	16623000	but a natural institution because
16623000	16625000	it satisfies the needs of our nature.
16625000	16627000	Finally when we come to
16627000	16629000	questions about our senior years
16629000	16631000	one finds that this will be a time
16631000	16633000	of increased needs, increased
16633000	16635000	demands precisely because
16635000	16637000	our health is now jeopardized because
16637000	16639000	our powers are weakened and it is
16639000	16641000	crucial to see here that this too
16641000	16643000	is a part of that necessity
16643000	16645000	and duty that families have
16645000	16647000	the care of their elders.
16647000	16649000	On the other hand one shouldn't think
16649000	16651000	of this as the only time when there is a
16651000	16653000	renewal of dependence.
16653000	16655000	Not only was there dependence
16655000	16657000	of great nature when we were children
16657000	16659000	but even in the time of our greatest strength
16659000	16661000	and the time of our maturing
16661000	16663000	and the time of our real flourishing
16663000	16665000	there are tremendous needs and dependence
16665000	16667000	as we have hence the very institution
16667000	16669000	of marriage as well as the various forms
16669000	16671000	of friendship that we cultivate.
16671000	16673000	It is important I think to see
16673000	16675000	that our range of needs go far
16675000	16677000	beyond food and shelter.
16677000	16679000	It is a matter of all the ways
16679000	16681000	that in order to flourish we need to be
16681000	16683000	loved, honored, and revered
16683000	16685000	as well as to give love, honor, and reverence.
16685000	16687000	On the part of the aged person
16687000	16689000	and the care for them by a family
16689000	16691000	there is need to find ways that cultivate
16691000	16693000	the virtues and the wisdom that are possible
16693000	16695000	to the aged and to do this all
16695000	16697000	the way through life. Hence the
16697000	16699000	importance in a natural law analysis
16699000	16701000	of the family, the smallest unit
16701000	16703000	of the society, to be arranged
16703000	16705000	in such a way as to respect and honor
16705000	16707000	the inherent rationality
16707000	16709000	and the inherent sociality of our nature.
16709000	16711000	It entails I think that we
16711000	16713000	never treat a person as merely
16713000	16715000	a means to an end or as a commodity
16715000	16717000	but value that spouse,
16717000	16719000	that child, that senior as indeed
16719000	16721000	an end in him or herself
16721000	16723000	and to appreciate the various ways
16723000	16725000	in which these goals can be affected
16725000	16727000	to allow for human creativity
16727000	16729000	to give us a sense of the variety
16729000	16731000	of customs and practices that serve
16731000	16733000	the purpose but on the other hand be willing
16733000	16735000	to argue that some forms of this
16735000	16737000	association do not serve the purpose
16737000	16739000	and hence natural law tries to make
16739000	16741000	its contribution.
16741000	16743000	applause
16757000	16759000	lecture 24
16759000	16761000	the eternal return
16761000	16763000	of natural law
16763000	16765000	applause
16769000	16771000	One of the crucial aspects
16771000	16773000	of any understanding
16773000	16775000	of philosophy is to
16775000	16777000	go over again the material that one
16777000	16779000	has covered and we've now reached that point
16779000	16781000	in this attempt to consider
16781000	16783000	natural law theory. It's our
16783000	16785000	opportunity in this lecture to
16785000	16787000	look at what we have covered
16787000	16789000	and to look ahead to the future
16789000	16791000	to what else it is that needs to be considered
16791000	16793000	in our study of natural law
16793000	16795000	in this course we have
16795000	16797000	tried to investigate some of the general
16797000	16799000	ideas that are true
16799000	16801000	of all kinds of natural law theory
16801000	16803000	we've looked over the history of
16803000	16805000	natural law to try to
16805000	16807000	understand the various ways in which
16807000	16809000	these insights emerged
16809000	16811000	not just to appreciate the
16811000	16813000	details of that flow
16813000	16815000	but to appreciate how difficult it was
16815000	16817000	sometimes to articulate it
16817000	16819000	and I have little doubt that philosophy
16819000	16821000	of natural law is an ongoing
16821000	16823000	affair that we still have much
16823000	16825000	to understand about human nature
16825000	16827000	and human society and so that this kind
16827000	16829000	of thinking can lead us yet
16829000	16831000	to further progress in other areas
16831000	16833000	where it has not yet been applied at all
16833000	16835000	or where there is still disagreement
16835000	16837000	and discussion.
16837000	16839000	When we look in particular at something
16839000	16841000	like modern political theory we see
16841000	16843000	the ways in which natural law
16843000	16845000	theory has sometimes used different
16845000	16847000	terminology that the
16847000	16849000	ways that are so important to the
16849000	16851000	earlier history of natural law
16851000	16853000	things such as the very term
16853000	16855000	natural law that focus on
16855000	16857000	human nature
16857000	16859000	has yielded in the course of time
16859000	16861000	to considerations about natural rights
16861000	16863000	considerations of human dignity
16863000	16865000	and in these things
16865000	16867000	the natural law theory still
16867000	16869000	abides in fact some of the great
16869000	16871000	books on natural law speak about
16871000	16873000	the eternal return of the natural law
16873000	16875000	that is that it's one of those
16875000	16877000	theories which will continue to be
16877000	16879000	rediscovered even when an age
16879000	16881000	has forgotten it precisely
16881000	16883000	because of the source
16883000	16885000	that natural law theory uses
16885000	16887000	namely human nature in
16887000	16889000	the various ways in which that
16889000	16891000	human nature manifests itself.
16891000	16893000	What I'd like to do in this final
16893000	16895000	lecture then is to concern ourselves
16895000	16897000	with some of those great
16897000	16899000	themes the central concepts
16899000	16901000	that are true of any natural law
16901000	16903000	theory the ways in which
16903000	16905000	the central concepts manifest
16905000	16907000	themselves in some of the stronger
16907000	16909000	contenders of genuine natural law
16909000	16911000	the ways in which the terms
16911000	16913000	are sometimes used or even
16913000	16915000	abused by those surrogates
16915000	16917000	and counterfeits of natural law
16917000	16919000	and finally an attempt to review
16919000	16921000	some of the important ways in which
16921000	16923000	this can be applied to practical
16923000	16925000	questions.
16925000	16927000	Central to the long but very
16927000	16929000	tradition of natural law thinking
16929000	16931000	has been a concern with three
16931000	16933000	primary characteristics of
16933000	16935000	ethical thinking namely
16935000	16937000	objectivity, universality
16937000	16939000	and intelligibility.
16939000	16941000	I think that any ethical theory
16941000	16943000	any natural laws competitors
16943000	16945000	utilitarianism for instance
16945000	16947000	or divine command ethics
16947000	16949000	or canton duty ethics
16949000	16951000	has to struggle with some of these same
16951000	16953000	criteria namely how to
16953000	16955000	make a claim that is objective
16955000	16957000	something that any reasonable person
16957000	16959000	can see
16959000	16961000	and find grounded and is not
16961000	16963000	just sort of an idea or an opinion
16963000	16965000	but rather is something that has
16965000	16967000	a root and a strength and is
16967000	16969000	objective granting that it's
16969000	16971000	difficult to get there. Likewise
16971000	16973000	there's a concern that any ethical
16973000	16975000	theory worth its salt has with
16975000	16977000	universality an effort to try
16977000	16979000	to apply across the board in such
16979000	16981000	a way that it deals with not
16981000	16983000	just with me and my own particular
16983000	16985000	group but as much as possible
16985000	16987000	deals with all of humanity
16987000	16989000	and finally a claim about
16989000	16991000	intelligibility namely that
16991000	16993000	any ethics that is
16993000	16995000	truly deserving the name will
16995000	16997000	find a way in which its concepts
16997000	16999000	will be intelligible, will be
16999000	17001000	able to be understood, will indeed
17001000	17003000	seem reasonable and insightful.
17003000	17005000	Now for natural law theory
17005000	17007000	the stress on nature
17007000	17009000	that is recurrent in this theory
17009000	17011000	is the effort to provide an
17011000	17013000	objective grounding for moral claims
17013000	17015000	it's not always easy
17015000	17017000	to ascertain, it's not
17017000	17019000	something that can be read off
17019000	17021000	easily but rather requires
17021000	17023000	much reflection, much study
17023000	17025000	much generalization
17025000	17027000	with all the appropriate cautions about
17027000	17029000	generalization from empirical
17029000	17031000	investigation. Nonetheless
17031000	17033000	it's a claim to find a certain
17033000	17035000	objectivity for moral claims
17035000	17037000	a sense that one will find
17037000	17039000	a fruitful source of information
17039000	17041000	here for moral insight
17041000	17043000	this I think will be solid
17043000	17045000	ground for natural law theory
17045000	17047000	as long as the questions
17047000	17049000	that we are asking as long as the things
17049000	17051000	that we are trying to settle on this basis
17051000	17053000	do still stand on that solid
17053000	17055000	ground. Sometimes
17055000	17057000	I think however we get on to
17057000	17059000	the ground that turns into cracking ice
17059000	17061000	cracking under our own weight
17061000	17063000	when the kind of uses that we are
17063000	17065000	inclined to make are simply justifications
17065000	17067000	of what we're used to
17067000	17069000	what we're comfortable with
17069000	17071000	what perhaps is customary
17071000	17073000	in our society or what may
17073000	17075000	be habitual for us personally
17075000	17077000	at that point we are no longer dealing
17077000	17079000	with nature but we're dealing
17079000	17081000	with something which is idiosyncratic
17081000	17083000	which is personal or perhaps familial
17083000	17085000	or maybe just cultural
17085000	17087000	and so merely the fact that a person claims
17087000	17089000	that something is natural is
17089000	17091000	not its own authentication
17091000	17093000	or justification but rather what
17093000	17095000	a natural law theory must do
17095000	17097000	is to show that it is natural
17097000	17099000	and hence we find ourselves
17099000	17101000	locating the burden of argument always
17101000	17103000	with the affirmative locating
17103000	17105000	the burden of argument with those who would
17105000	17107000	claim that something or other is natural
17107000	17109000	even the word nature
17109000	17111000	has had many meanings in the course of history
17111000	17113000	the one that I prefer to use
17113000	17115000	and that I think is the mainstream
17115000	17117000	tradition in natural law
17117000	17119000	is that sense of nature when we use
17119000	17121000	the term to refer to an
17121000	17123000	inner source of
17123000	17125000	intelligibility to an inner
17125000	17127000	principle that makes
17127000	17129000	a given being some kind
17129000	17131000	of being so once human
17131000	17133000	nature is that which makes us truly
17133000	17135000	human whereas
17135000	17137000	those things which make us of one
17137000	17139000	nationality those things which make us
17139000	17141000	of one religion or another
17141000	17143000	those things which make us a member of some
17143000	17145000	voluntary group are not natural in that
17145000	17147000	sense those things are acquired those
17147000	17149000	things are external but rather nature
17149000	17151000	in this strongly Aristotelian sense
17151000	17153000	of the word refers to those
17153000	17155000	inner principles that are typical
17155000	17157000	of a given kind of being
17157000	17159000	by which individuals who belong
17159000	17161000	to that kind tend to grow
17161000	17163000	so as to have a structure
17163000	17165000	both a bodily structure
17165000	17167000	a psychic structure but also
17167000	17169000	to have typical activities
17169000	17171000	things that we do as a matter of course
17171000	17173000	and do because of our
17173000	17175000	natures obviously
17175000	17177000	in the course of trying to appreciate this
17177000	17179000	it is a matter of long study
17179000	17181000	because frequently we can mistake
17181000	17183000	merely what is customary or merely habitual
17183000	17185000	merely what we happen to be comfortable
17185000	17187000	with but when
17187000	17189000	one looks more deeply and tries
17189000	17191000	to analyze natures one finds
17191000	17193000	that those typical activities
17193000	17195000	the operations that are recurrent
17195000	17197000	and present in all the members
17197000	17199000	of the group or in most of the mature
17199000	17201000	members of the group and likewise
17201000	17203000	those typical structures the biological
17203000	17205000	structures and the psychological structures
17205000	17207000	they lead us to another
17207000	17209000	discovery that has been extremely
17209000	17211000	important for the thinking on natural
17211000	17213000	law namely a discovery of the
17213000	17215000	natural ends the goals
17215000	17217000	or purposes and we saw
17217000	17219000	in lecture after lecture
17219000	17221000	from the very beginning of the course
17221000	17223000	that this is to use a category
17223000	17225000	the notion of end or goal or purpose
17225000	17227000	which admittedly comes from
17227000	17229000	human invention human creativity
17229000	17231000	that when we are for instance
17231000	17233000	sculptors we have an end
17233000	17235000	in our mind an object of beauty
17235000	17237000	or an object of some kind of representation
17237000	17239000	that we want to make the goal
17239000	17241000	that we have directs the activities
17241000	17243000	but those goals and purposes
17243000	17245000	of course are highly subjective
17245000	17247000	that is they are very much a matter
17247000	17249000	of what I have chosen to act upon
17249000	17251000	the reasons for which I have chosen
17251000	17253000	to move or to do or to operate
17253000	17255000	what we are referring to here
17255000	17257000	is the use of that category derived
17257000	17259000	from choice derived from
17259000	17261000	freedom derived from
17261000	17263000	purposeful activity that has been
17263000	17265000	chosen and we apply
17265000	17267000	that category to the realm of nature
17267000	17269000	asking whether or not
17269000	17271000	there are not certain natural
17271000	17273000	or intrinsic ends certain goals
17273000	17275000	in the general
17275000	17277000	sphere of biological nature
17277000	17279000	one finds that all the
17279000	17281000	subsystems that are involved in a
17281000	17283000	given organism contribute
17283000	17285000	to the good of the organism just as
17285000	17287000	in the course of the development of that
17287000	17289000	entities life that entities
17289000	17291000	existence the early
17291000	17293000	periods when the being is still immature
17293000	17295000	move toward maturity
17295000	17297000	move toward that period when the
17297000	17299000	being is a full healthy
17299000	17301000	mature instance of the species
17301000	17303000	obviously many things can go
17303000	17305000	wrong there can be disease
17305000	17307000	there can be sickness there can be illness
17307000	17309000	there can be accident or cross purposes
17309000	17311000	and yet there is a natural
17311000	17313000	development a natural process
17313000	17315000	and and for this reason
17315000	17317000	natural law thinkers are always
17317000	17319000	inclined to say we need to look at nature
17319000	17321000	but not to look at it in a
17321000	17323000	frozen frame we need to look
17323000	17325000	at it rather and to respect the flow
17325000	17327000	and we need to try to ascertain
17327000	17329000	what we can fairly claim as
17329000	17331000	truly developmental and on the
17331000	17333000	other hand what is something that is only
17333000	17335000	idiosyncratic or typical of a small
17335000	17337000	portion this
17337000	17339000	insight about final causality
17339000	17341000	that is the kind of causality
17341000	17343000	that an intrinsic goal or
17343000	17345000	purpose has for an organism
17345000	17347000	and for a specific kind within the natural
17347000	17349000	world joined
17349000	17351000	with some analysis of the
17351000	17353000	distinctive goals of human
17353000	17355000	nature as personal nature
17355000	17357000	allows us to have a
17357000	17359000	full blown natural law theory
17359000	17361000	what I mean by that last remark is
17361000	17363000	that in addition to our biological
17363000	17365000	goals in addition to our psychic
17365000	17367000	drives there are things that
17367000	17369000	are our ends precisely
17369000	17371000	because we are persons
17371000	17373000	because we are beings capable of
17373000	17375000	knowing and beings capable of
17375000	17377000	deliberately choosing there's
17377000	17379000	matters of awareness and appreciation
17379000	17381000	but there are also matters of our loves
17381000	17383000	and the deliberate decisions
17383000	17385000	we make with respect to our loves
17385000	17387000	all of this requires
17387000	17389000	that natural law ethics
17389000	17391000	take into account in the
17391000	17393000	course of trying to give a sense of
17393000	17395000	human being, human existence
17395000	17397000	human values and human institutions
17397000	17399000	in my judgment then
17399000	17401000	those portions of the
17401000	17403000	history of natural law that we were considering
17403000	17405000	are most authentic and
17405000	17407000	mainstream in natural law
17407000	17409000	when there is not only ethics
17409000	17411000	but when there's a really solid anthropology
17411000	17413000	and behind that anthropology
17413000	17415000	a theory about how the being
17415000	17417000	works, how the universe is
17417000	17419000	there are principles of metaphysics
17419000	17421000	on the other hand we've also seen
17421000	17423000	that the natural law tradition
17423000	17425000	as a very
17425000	17427000	wide ranging tradition
17427000	17429000	includes some theories of natural law
17429000	17431000	which do not have a metaphysical component
17431000	17433000	which insists that there's a strong
17433000	17435000	separation between theory and practice
17435000	17437000	and likewise there are some portions
17437000	17439000	of the natural law
17439000	17441000	camp which only talk about
17441000	17443000	human nature in terms
17443000	17445000	of its biological and perhaps its psychic
17445000	17447000	structure but it's extremely doubtful
17447000	17449000	about whether human institutions
17449000	17451000	can be included within the scope of that
17451000	17453000	and they would prefer to think of human institutions
17453000	17455000	whether families or
17455000	17457000	perhaps at the larger level of societies
17457000	17459000	as things of human construction
17459000	17461000	rather than of human nature
17461000	17463000	this is I think a good and honest
17463000	17465000	ongoing debate within the tradition
17465000	17467000	of natural law
17467000	17469000	all of this was said by way of
17469000	17471000	objectivity on that second
17471000	17473000	criteria namely the great concern
17473000	17475000	that one has for universality
17475000	17477000	a philosophical approach to natural law
17477000	17479000	tries to
17479000	17481000	get beyond merely tribal loyalties
17481000	17483000	tries to get beyond
17483000	17485000	simply privileged standpoints
17485000	17487000	it's the sort of thing which in a
17487000	17489000	religious ethics one has
17489000	17491000	a claim that one has a privileged
17491000	17493000	standpoint if one for instance is a follower
17493000	17495000	of a revealed religion
17495000	17497000	if God has revealed his will then one has
17497000	17499000	a special standpoint one has a privileged
17499000	17501000	access the claim made in
17501000	17503000	natural law theory is that
17503000	17505000	while the only standpoint that one has
17505000	17507000	is the standpoint
17507000	17509000	of reason reflecting upon nature
17509000	17511000	and one asks and one tries
17511000	17513000	to see how far and how
17513000	17515000	broad one can in fact
17515000	17517000	get one's ethical theory
17517000	17519000	it may be that it coheres with a religious
17519000	17521000	point of view but nonetheless that
17521000	17523000	special privileged standpoint
17523000	17525000	that revelation might provide
17525000	17527000	isn't something that's an intrinsic
17527000	17529000	part of natural law theory it's
17529000	17531000	something rather that might come to confirm it
17531000	17533000	or might come to challenge it
17533000	17535000	or might come perhaps simply to supplement it
17535000	17537000	but the claim here in philosophy
17537000	17539000	is that we try to get
17539000	17541000	as much as possible
17541000	17543000	to a universal standpoint that is
17543000	17545000	to look across the human history
17545000	17547000	and to look across the human race
17547000	17549000	to see what sort of things are indeed
17549000	17551000	really perennial and valid
17551000	17553000	necessary causes to see
17553000	17555000	where the insights that are universally
17555000	17557000	compelling or cogent at least
17557000	17559000	to a great probability are
17559000	17561000	for this reason natural law theory has always
17561000	17563000	tried to balance concerns
17563000	17565000	about the needs that specific
17565000	17567000	individuals have in
17567000	17569000	discrete and particular circumstances
17569000	17571000	with a concern for
17571000	17573000	universal principles that apply always
17573000	17575000	and across the board
17575000	17577000	but it does so by being willing
17577000	17579000	to distinguish between precepts
17579000	17581000	that are really universal in character
17581000	17583000	most of them are negative things
17583000	17585000	we cannot may not do
17585000	17587000	it's sort of the silver
17587000	17589000	rule do not do unto others
17589000	17591000	what we'd rather not have done to us
17591000	17593000	but there are also
17593000	17595000	a number of positive commands
17595000	17597000	the golden rule do unto others
17597000	17599000	as you have them do unto you
17599000	17601000	and in that golden rule it's a matter
17601000	17603000	of suggesting that in a given
17603000	17605000	circumstance one might have duties
17605000	17607000	and that these duties are universally
17607000	17609000	recognized even though
17609000	17611000	they are different and creative
17611000	17613000	ways of fulfilling those duties
17613000	17615000	to use for several examples
17615000	17617000	when one is thinking about what is
17617000	17619000	bad or wrong for every member
17619000	17621000	of the species one
17621000	17623000	can find on the basis of natural law
17623000	17625000	that some things for instance the
17625000	17627000	arbitrary taking of
17627000	17629000	innocent human life are regularly
17629000	17631000	condemned by one culture after another
17631000	17633000	that is that there's something wrong there
17633000	17635000	on the other hand on the positive side
17635000	17637000	not everybody is in the position
17637000	17639000	of having offspring immediately to hand
17639000	17641000	and yet there is a positive
17641000	17643000	duty that can be recognized
17643000	17645000	simply on the basis of our human nature
17645000	17647000	of our dependencies
17647000	17649000	in the course of our childhood
17649000	17651000	so that we desperately need
17651000	17653000	someone to help take care of our needs
17653000	17655000	and that this normally
17655000	17657000	and usually falls upon parents
17657000	17659000	or parents are unable to do so
17659000	17661000	for some reason unwilling that they still
17661000	17663000	have an obligation to see to the
17663000	17665000	care and raising of those offspring
17665000	17667000	in this respect it is
17667000	17669000	it is a matter of finding
17669000	17671000	what is reasonable when we reflect
17671000	17673000	upon human nature
17673000	17675000	it allows us to make relatively
17675000	17677000	great progress about universalization
17677000	17679000	even in matters that are
17679000	17681000	touching on things like politics
17681000	17683000	it allows us to say for instance
17683000	17685000	that there is a
17685000	17687000	positive case that can be made
17687000	17689000	for political authority
17689000	17691000	not that everything that the political
17691000	17693000	authority decides is right
17693000	17695000	by no means but rather that there is
17695000	17697000	a legitimacy
17697000	17699000	in the obedience that is in general
17699000	17701000	expected to authority
17701000	17703000	precisely because the authority has
17703000	17705000	an obligation to look out for the good
17705000	17707000	of the whole whereas individuals
17707000	17709000	have to look out primarily for
17709000	17711000	their own good and the good of their family
17711000	17713000	what implications
17713000	17715000	this will have will be extremely varied
17715000	17717000	depending on the creativity
17717000	17719000	in the ways our societies have
17719000	17721000	managed in trying to
17721000	17723000	devise institutions which can
17723000	17725000	carry out these natural duties
17725000	17727000	again let me take just one example
17727000	17729000	capital punishment has always been
17729000	17731000	a great subject for ethical discussion
17731000	17733000	precisely because it is
17733000	17735000	a tremendous and terrible
17735000	17737000	punishment a punishment from which
17737000	17739000	there is no recourse
17739000	17741000	many natural lawyers have argued
17741000	17743000	that there is at least
17743000	17745000	correctness to capital punishment
17745000	17747000	for certain capital crimes
17747000	17749000	precisely because
17749000	17751000	the authority has an obligation
17751000	17753000	to look for the safety of the community
17753000	17755000	and if that safety cannot
17755000	17757000	be secured short of the
17757000	17759000	death of criminals those who have
17759000	17761000	been convicted of crime there is
17761000	17763000	indeed a right on the part of the society
17763000	17765000	to
17765000	17767000	subject those criminals to capital punishment
17767000	17769000	on the other hand one can have
17769000	17771000	a legitimate debate about whether
17771000	17773000	the public safety requires capital
17773000	17775000	punishment if there are other
17775000	17777000	means available to defend the society
17777000	17779000	societies for instance which are stable
17779000	17781000	enough to imprison individuals
17781000	17783000	without threatening the
17783000	17785000	public good and the public safety
17785000	17787000	might well be excused from using
17787000	17789000	such a severe punishment so
17789000	17791000	the natural law approach to this
17791000	17793000	matter is to see what it is that is reasonable
17793000	17795000	reflecting upon our nature
17795000	17797000	reflecting not only on our particular
17797000	17799000	nature but on our
17799000	17801000	special nature and our nature as
17801000	17803000	in desperate need of various forms
17803000	17805000	of association and to try to
17805000	17807000	establish what is reasonable
17807000	17809000	reasonable across the board as so far
17809000	17811000	as possible universally but with
17811000	17813000	attentiveness to where circumstances
17813000	17815000	and where conditions prevent us
17815000	17817000	simply from saying one thing across
17817000	17819000	the board but perhaps articulating
17819000	17821000	the range of permissible options
17821000	17823000	the range of alternatives that are
17823000	17825000	possible given our other
17825000	17827000	circumstances in the
17827000	17829000	natural law tradition this quest for
17829000	17831000	universality has usually
17831000	17833000	led to a very fruitful distinction
17833000	17835000	between negative precepts
17835000	17837000	those that apply always and everywhere
17837000	17839000	like that prohibition on murder for instance
17839000	17841000	the prohibition on deliberately taking
17841000	17843000	innocent human life
17843000	17845000	and those various positive precepts
17845000	17847000	that apply only in certain circumstances
17847000	17849000	the obligation for instance
17849000	17851000	to tell the truth presuming that people
17851000	17853000	with whom one is talking have a right
17853000	17855000	to that truth or the obligation
17855000	17857000	to care for one's children if one has
17857000	17859000	children there's no sense that one
17859000	17861000	must tell all the truth that one knows
17861000	17863000	all the time but rather that one
17863000	17865000	must refrain from deliberately
17865000	17867000	intending to deceive
17867000	17869000	now on the assumption that one
17869000	17871000	only bears responsibility
17871000	17873000	for that which one knows
17873000	17875000	and that which one has chosen
17875000	17877000	natural law theory has often
17877000	17879000	been concerned with talking about
17879000	17881000	how one knows the natural law
17881000	17883000	and it tries to meet the third
17883000	17885000	criterion the criterion about intelligibility
17885000	17887000	by investigating
17887000	17889000	how natural law is known
17889000	17891000	sometimes it's known by teaching
17891000	17893000	this per venue that the teaching
17893000	17895000	company offers a wonderful chance
17895000	17897000	to do it in so many words and explicitly
17897000	17899000	and yet natural law
17899000	17901000	is not thought to be
17901000	17903000	dependent upon such
17903000	17905000	formal teaching as this
17905000	17907000	rather the claim that natural law makes
17907000	17909000	is that we have access
17909000	17911000	we have an ability
17911000	17913000	to understand some of these
17913000	17915000	natural law obligations
17915000	17917000	even without such explicit teaching
17917000	17919000	and that the intelligibility
17919000	17921000	of natural law comes by
17921000	17923000	noticing two very interesting
17923000	17925000	aspects of human existence
17925000	17927000	one is that we're filled with various
17927000	17929000	kinds of inclination that we're
17929000	17931000	given in our very nature
17931000	17933000	we find given the various
17933000	17935000	attractions and desires to good
17935000	17937000	things desires to good food
17937000	17939000	especially when we're hungry desires
17939000	17941000	to the refreshment of drink and the refreshment
17941000	17943000	of sleep attraction to members
17943000	17945000	of the opposite sex that we're
17945000	17947000	having various kinds of
17947000	17949000	attractions that are due to our animal nature
17949000	17951000	but also things that are due to our
17951000	17953000	rational nature namely we have a desire
17953000	17955000	to know we have a desire to
17955000	17957000	to express our affections we have
17957000	17959000	a desire to form friendships
17959000	17961000	especially friendships that will last
17961000	17963000	we have a desire to
17963000	17965000	to work together in community
17965000	17967000	precisely because we like the sociability
17967000	17969000	of others and because we desire
17969000	17971000	some of the goods that are only possible
17971000	17973000	with common participation
17973000	17975000	with a real contribution
17975000	17977000	by many people no one of
17977000	17979000	which alone could manage those goods
17979000	17981000	that source of
17981000	17983000	intelligibility namely our
17983000	17985000	own inclinations is thought
17985000	17987000	by natural law theory to be extremely
17987000	17989000	important it's a way to reflect
17989000	17991000	on the fact that we know
17991000	17993000	the natural law in our very bones
17993000	17995000	that we at least have a spontaneous
17995000	17997000	and direct inclination toward these goods
17997000	17999000	and yet
17999000	18001000	merely to have an inclination
18001000	18003000	doesn't by itself prove that anything
18003000	18005000	is natural law here the problem
18005000	18007000	is is that as we find
18007000	18009000	ourselves we are products not just
18009000	18011000	of nature but also of nurture
18011000	18013000	that we have not only what is given
18013000	18015000	but we also have various histories
18015000	18017000	some of those histories being extremely
18017000	18019000	helpful other histories
18019000	18021000	being frustrating being in some
18021000	18023000	way or other disordered and hence
18023000	18025000	there is a need to reflect upon
18025000	18027000	our various inclinations
18027000	18029000	and to that reason try to test
18029000	18031000	those inclinations to see
18031000	18033000	which are indeed valid
18033000	18035000	and legitimate and helpful and which
18035000	18037000	on the other hand need to be restrained
18037000	18039000	which need to be disciplined which need to
18039000	18041000	be dealt with aesthetically
18041000	18043000	or perhaps dealt with even heroically
18043000	18045000	here a second avenue
18045000	18047000	of intelligibility
18047000	18049000	surfaces namely that for
18049000	18051000	the sake of natural law we invariably
18051000	18053000	look at experience
18053000	18055000	of other than our own
18055000	18057000	we look at the wise in our community
18057000	18059000	we look at the wise in our families
18059000	18061000	and we ask what is it that really
18061000	18063000	prospered them natural law
18063000	18065000	always bears an enormous debt
18065000	18067000	to history and to story
18067000	18069000	to the traditions of literature as well
18069000	18071000	as the formal traditions of recounting
18071000	18073000	the deeds and the speeches that make up
18073000	18075000	any of our national histories
18075000	18077000	as such natural law
18077000	18079000	theory is claiming that we
18079000	18081000	can learn and understand what some
18081000	18083000	of the obligations are
18083000	18085000	by considering with our reasons
18085000	18087000	what it is that is fruitful
18087000	18089000	and what it is that is frustrating
18089000	18091000	and that this too is a source of intelligibility
18091000	18093000	I have emphasized
18093000	18095000	and accentuated the role of reason in all this
18095000	18097000	precisely because the
18097000	18099000	theories against which natural
18099000	18101000	law sets itself over the course
18101000	18103000	of history have tended to emphasize
18103000	18105000	other factors when for instance
18105000	18107000	we are considering natural law
18107000	18109000	as a theory of jurisprudence
18109000	18111000	when we are considering it in its influence
18111000	18113000	upon the formation of society
18113000	18115000	and the adjudication that is done by law
18115000	18117000	natural law theory stands
18117000	18119000	in opposition to things like legal positivism
18119000	18121000	and to ethical relativism
18121000	18123000	invariably systems
18123000	18125000	such as these try to privilege the will
18125000	18127000	as a source of moral
18127000	18129000	value and to limit in one
18129000	18131000	way or another intellect
18131000	18133000	to a merely instrumental role
18133000	18135000	to a matter of figuring out how to obtain
18135000	18137000	what we want
18137000	18139000	how to get what it is that we desire
18139000	18141000	but natural law tradition
18141000	18143000	in its mainstream approach
18143000	18145000	has always favored the priority
18145000	18147000	of intellect to will
18147000	18149000	I mean this both for theological
18149000	18151000	as well as for purely secular theories
18151000	18153000	of natural law
18153000	18155000	namely it stresses a view of reason
18155000	18157000	as deeply receptive
18157000	18159000	it's worthwhile thinking about this for a minute
18159000	18161000	namely that our powers of reason
18161000	18163000	are such that they are
18163000	18165000	active and then active
18165000	18167000	that we must if for instance
18167000	18169000	we want to change some situation
18169000	18171000	maybe we don't like the way our society
18171000	18173000	is presently organized
18173000	18175000	or maybe we don't like something in our own character
18175000	18177000	or something in our own family
18177000	18179000	any effort at change
18179000	18181000	any effort at the practical reason
18181000	18183000	when we're devising a solution
18183000	18185000	inventing a new structure
18185000	18187000	urging someone or perhaps urging ourselves
18187000	18189000	to take a new stand
18189000	18191000	requires first that we understand
18191000	18193000	the way things are
18193000	18195000	not that we'll keep things the way they are
18195000	18197000	but that we have to understand the way things are
18197000	18199000	and why they are what they are
18199000	18201000	I consider this to be one of the chief virtues
18201000	18203000	that is needed for a natural
18203000	18205000	law approach and it's the virtue of humility
18205000	18207000	a sense not of being
18207000	18209000	the world's doormat not humiliation
18209000	18211000	but humility in the sense
18211000	18213000	say that Bernard of Clairvaux used to use it
18213000	18215000	namely as a reverent love for the truth
18215000	18217000	a truth about our nature
18217000	18219000	a truth about our common human nature
18219000	18221000	a truth about our social nature
18221000	18223000	as well as our individual nature
18223000	18225000	and a truth that doesn't mind being challenged
18225000	18227000	that doesn't mind being investigated
18227000	18229000	with all the tools that reason
18229000	18231000	and philosophy can summon
18231000	18233000	precisely because the consequences
18233000	18235000	and the stakes are so important
18235000	18237000	it is a matter of reflecting on
18237000	18239000	those principles that are so basic
18239000	18241000	that we cannot not know them
18241000	18243000	for instance that we always should
18243000	18245000	pursue the good and avoid the evil
18245000	18247000	but that we have to educate ourselves
18247000	18249000	and form ourselves about
18249000	18251000	what is it that's good and what is it
18251000	18253000	that's evil because there are things
18253000	18255000	that are merely apparently good
18255000	18257000	but are in fact not so good for us
18257000	18259000	they are inauthentic desires
18259000	18261000	rather than authentic desires
18261000	18263000	and knowing the difference between the two
18263000	18265000	is a project that requires
18265000	18267000	enormous humility and a readiness
18267000	18269000	to submit to interpersonal dialogue
18269000	18271000	and criticism so that we aren't
18271000	18273000	merely being comfortable with what we're used to
18273000	18275000	as such
18275000	18277000	basic principles of natural law
18277000	18279000	are in us as operating principles
18279000	18281000	rather than as
18281000	18283000	explicitly known, thematically stated
18283000	18285000	explicitly expressed
18285000	18287000	propositions
18287000	18289000	when we come to a course like this
18289000	18291000	we try to state them in so many words
18291000	18293000	for example that we should never
18293000	18295000	do evil that good may come
18295000	18297000	but in us it's an operating principle
18297000	18299000	in us it's something that is innate
18299000	18301000	or native to us
18301000	18303000	and that we need to learn how
18303000	18305000	in the course of time by experience ourselves
18305000	18307000	and by the consultation of the wives
18307000	18309000	we need to form our
18309000	18311000	consciences in such a way that we
18311000	18313000	regularly do this
18313000	18315000	on that subject the theme of conscience
18315000	18317000	is an extremely important subject
18317000	18319000	within the tradition of natural law
18319000	18321000	and conscience is understood
18321000	18323000	not as just a Freudian super ego
18323000	18325000	conscience is understood
18325000	18327000	not necessarily as a little voice
18327000	18329000	perhaps a voice of God
18329000	18331000	or the voice of an angel
18331000	18333000	conscience is understood typically
18333000	18335000	in natural law theory as
18335000	18337000	a power of our minds
18337000	18339000	to judge, to evaluate
18339000	18341000	actions we have done
18341000	18343000	or actions we're considering doing
18343000	18345000	in light of principles that we did not choose
18345000	18347000	in light of principles
18347000	18349000	that are things that are already
18349000	18351000	established by our nature
18351000	18353000	if we would only look carefully enough
18353000	18355000	at that nature
18355000	18357000	and mindful for instance of the ways
18357000	18359000	in which conscience needs to be better understood
18359000	18361000	when I think of a wonderful
18361000	18363000	popular movie in play
18363000	18365000	perhaps you've seen at one point
18365000	18367000	or another in your life Robert Boltz
18367000	18369000	a man for all seasons
18369000	18371000	and it's a tremendous play about a great hero of mine
18371000	18373000	Thomas Moore
18373000	18375000	but the one reservation I have
18375000	18377000	about the presentation of Thomas Moore
18377000	18379000	in that particular piece of stage craft
18379000	18381000	is the way in which conscience is portrayed
18381000	18383000	Moore is made to say
18383000	18385000	at various points in the course of the play
18385000	18387000	that he has been faithful
18387000	18389000	to his conscience
18389000	18391000	faithful to his set of chosen principles
18391000	18393000	and I think that that probably does a bit
18393000	18395000	of disservice to Thomas Moore
18395000	18397000	as well as to the notion of conscience
18397000	18399000	not that conscience shouldn't mean
18399000	18401000	fidelity to one's principles
18401000	18403000	for that is exactly what conscience means
18403000	18405000	my quibble is with the notion
18405000	18407000	that it is fidelity to one's chosen
18407000	18409000	principles for I think
18409000	18411000	that what Thomas Moore himself stood for
18411000	18413000	were principles that he did not choose
18413000	18415000	principles that instead
18415000	18417000	he found already in practice
18417000	18419000	in operation and things
18419000	18421000	which he could not in truth deny
18421000	18423000	so too I think with respect
18423000	18425000	to us what adequate
18425000	18427000	formation of conscience means
18427000	18429000	is a training in a fidelity
18429000	18431000	to principles such as principles
18431000	18433000	about what fosters and fulfills
18433000	18435000	human nature and the avoidance
18435000	18437000	of what it is that frustrates human nature
18437000	18439000	and standing
18439000	18441000	fast standing steadfast
18441000	18443000	for those principles that we did not
18443000	18445000	choose but which are already
18445000	18447000	present as operating principles
18447000	18449000	of our nature coming of course
18449000	18451000	to understand these things to articulate
18451000	18453000	them to really grasp
18453000	18455000	them and to let them be useful
18455000	18457000	does require the mediation of
18457000	18459000	various authorities in our lives
18459000	18461000	parents the wise perhaps
18461000	18463000	clergy perhaps teachers
18463000	18465000	all of these
18465000	18467000	authorities consulted and
18467000	18469000	needing to be personally accepted
18469000	18471000	needed to be personally
18471000	18473000	regulated in our life and that we do
18473000	18475000	this precisely as we mature
18475000	18477000	under the careful guidance of some
18477000	18479000	natural structures such as the family
18479000	18481000	now with this in mind
18481000	18483000	the objectivity the universality
18483000	18485000	the intelligibility natural
18485000	18487000	law theory has often been
18487000	18489000	invoked by thinkers
18489000	18491000	political and social
18491000	18493000	it has been invoked sometimes for very
18493000	18495000	conservative purposes to maintain order
18495000	18497000	sometimes for very radical
18497000	18499000	and revolutionary purposes
18499000	18501000	founding and in refounding and in
18501000	18503000	revising and reforming various structures
18503000	18505000	in the
18505000	18507000	course of natural laws history there has been
18507000	18509000	a sense though that whether it be used
18509000	18511000	for things new or for the maintenance
18511000	18513000	of things old what we must
18513000	18515000	look at our principles of right
18515000	18517000	and justice that have prevailed
18517000	18519000	by reason of their intrinsic excellence
18519000	18521000	that are true regardless
18521000	18523000	of whether those in possession of power
18523000	18525000	are willing to recognize them
18525000	18527000	it is in this sense that we can talk
18527000	18529000	about inalienable rights in our own
18529000	18531000	Declaration of Independence or that we
18531000	18533000	can criticize certain practices
18533000	18535000	in our own cultures history such as slavery
18535000	18537000	in which these
18537000	18539000	inalienable rights in which these
18539000	18541000	native principles of justice were
18541000	18543000	somehow ignored that somehow the culture
18543000	18545000	was blind to them it allows
18545000	18547000	us to make judgments which are not
18547000	18549000	demeaning but which attend attempt
18549000	18551000	to be appreciative of
18551000	18553000	what this basic human nature is
18553000	18555000	it has allowed the practice of
18555000	18557000	judicial review to flourish in our society
18557000	18559000	but even that too can
18559000	18561000	be abused rather what
18561000	18563000	natural law tries to do as a
18563000	18565000	theory is to invoke principles
18565000	18567000	of right and justice that remain
18567000	18569000	the same and abide in our
18569000	18571000	nature and to try to find
18571000	18573000	ways to institutionalize them
18573000	18575000	we do so in government we do so
18575000	18577000	in forms of voluntary association
18577000	18579000	we do so in family and we need
18579000	18581000	to do so in the formation of our own character
18581000	18583000	thank you for this opportunity
18583000	18585000	to talk with you about the natural law
18585000	18587000	it gives us the venue for the discussion
18587000	18589000	of many other interesting moral and
