0	22660	In teaching science, we tend to celebrate the discoveries, Galileo spying the moons of
22660	29300	Jupiter, Cassini finding details in the rings of Saturn, or Herschel discovering Uranus.
29300	36500	We have it a habit of focusing on individual achievements, like Tommy's Geocentric Model,
36500	42220	or Copernicus' Helicentric Model, or Newton's Law of Gravity, and in doing this, we can
42220	46980	lose sight of the huge swath of general development in the field.
46980	54300	The field is continually advancing, and these advances provide the foundation for the discoveries.
54300	59900	One famously once said, if I have seen further, it is because I have stood on the shoulders
59900	61740	of giants.
61740	67660	The milestones are the end products of a long chain of evidence and argument.
67660	70580	And astronomy, this is particularly true.
70580	76340	The results can depend on data taken decades or even centuries earlier.
76340	82060	The Varier and Adams made predictions of Neptune, but they could not have been made without
82060	85660	Flamsteed's surveys over 100 years earlier.
85660	92660	Further, as the field has developed, specialization within the field has also developed.
92660	98820	Building telescopes, devising cameras and instruments, making observations, analyzing
98820	105020	the data, interpreting the results as physical theory, these are all subspecialties of astronomy
105020	109020	that are almost fields unto themselves.
109020	112860	Neptune is now required for discovery.
112860	117980	Remember that the Varier and Adams could predict Neptune, but neither one of them had
117980	122780	the skills to go to the telescope and actually do the search themselves.
122780	128700	So the sort of romantic ideal we have in our society of the lone astronomer, a lone on
128700	135020	the mountaintop, in a solo search for truth, well, that hasn't been true for hundreds
135020	136740	of years.
136740	141900	And in this lecture, I want to focus on the data gathering, the wide range of observations
141900	147580	that are necessary and how they enable breakthroughs in astronomy.
147580	151300	To start, let's look at astronomy before telescopes.
151300	156940	This was mostly concerned with positional astronomy or what we call astrometry.
156940	161860	Now our astrometry is basically defined, is initially defined, I should say, by the sun
161860	163460	and the stars.
163460	169420	If we look at the sun, here's a wonderful time-lapse image of the sun and you can see
169420	171700	it goes across the sky once per day.
171700	173700	This defines our day.
173700	179860	The meridian line, which is the line from north to south, is our local noon.
179860	186020	And we define one day from when the sun goes from meridian to the next time it crosses the
186020	187700	meridian.
187700	191980	The sun motion also varies over the year.
191980	195500	This is a wonderful image and it's called an analemma.
195500	200660	It's a picture of the sun taken at the same time every day over a year, well, not every
200660	205060	day, it looks like about 30 different days over the year.
205060	209500	And you can see it forms this very nice shape that it's highest in the sky in the summer
209500	212820	and it's lowest in the sky during the winter.
212820	217620	And that fits because we have longer days in the summer and shorter days in the winter.
217620	222860	But the side to side shape shows you that the solar day is not constant.
222860	227060	It's not always 24 hours, sometimes it's a little bit more, sometimes it's a little
227060	228060	bit less.
228060	233300	24 hours is just the average solar day.
233300	238980	When we look at the stars at night, we take a similar time-lapse image, we can see that
238980	241980	they also show circles on the sky.
241980	245940	But the star motion is slightly different from the sun motion.
245940	253860	The time between meridian crossings for the stars is 23 hours 56 minutes and we call this
253860	259700	a sidereal day and it's the reason why there are different constellations of stars appearing
259700	262820	in the evening at different times of the year.
262820	267140	For example Orion, that is a constellation we in the northern hemisphere know as a winter
267140	268540	constellation.
268540	270560	We speak of the summer triangle.
270560	275780	If I see the great square in Pegasus up in the evening, I know it must be fall.
275780	280820	The stars can serve as a reference frame for the other motions.
280820	285820	If you look at the solar versus the sidereal day, there's a four minute difference and
285820	290500	over a year it adds up to an extra rotation for the stars.
290500	295700	That extra rotation is just due to the Earth's orbit around the sun.
295700	302060	Alternatively you can think of the sun moving through the stars once per year and this is
302060	307060	actually the derivation of how we get 360 degrees in a circle.
307060	311500	The Babylonians noticed that the sun moves about one degree per day.
311500	317780	You can see that it's really 365, 365th of a circle per day, but 360 was a very nice
317780	322140	multiple being a multiple of two, three, four, five, six and so on.
322140	326180	So they use 360 degrees in a circle.
326180	330940	When we look at the sun over the course of a year, it moves across the sky against the
330940	336860	background stars and in this image you can see that the path it takes goes against various
336860	338260	constellations.
338260	342300	These are the constellations we know as the constellations of the zodiac and the path
342300	347420	it traces out across the sky is called the ecliptic.
347420	353540	Now the coordinates on the sky are based on the idea of a celestial sphere.
353540	357500	On Earth we think of lines of latitude and longitude.
357500	363740	These are lines of latitude on Earth, the lines of latitude run around the globe and
363740	365300	they're measured from the equator.
365300	369540	We have the northern latitudes and we have the southern latitudes.
369540	373180	Conversely, these are the lines of longitude on Earth.
373180	378460	The lines of longitude run pole to pole and they are north-south lines so they are meridian
378460	379460	lines.
379460	384700	The zero point is called the prime meridian and it's arbitrarily defined to run through
384700	386940	Greenwich, England.
386940	390620	So the coordinates on Earth are defined like this.
390620	395380	We have the line from the north pole to the south pole going through the Greenwich meridian
395380	401100	as our zero point of longitude and our longitude is measured in an angle with respect to that
401100	405540	and then with respect to the equator we measure our latitude upward.
405540	412740	The same coordinate system is used for the celestial sphere but instead latitude becomes
412940	419460	a measure called declination and longitude becomes a measure called right ascension.
419460	426320	We have on the celestial sphere a northern celestial pole and a southern celestial pole.
426320	431580	The zero point of declination is still the celestial equator and things are measured
431580	436500	north-south from the celestial equator but the zero point of right ascension is where
436500	442700	the equator and the ecliptic intersect and that is the vernal equinox when the sun burns
442700	447860	and passes through the equator going northward in the spring.
447860	453260	So the right ascension is measured with respect to the vernal equinox.
453260	458260	Now the declination is measured in degrees, minutes and seconds but right ascension is
458260	463700	measured in hours, minutes and seconds and to understand that you have to understand
463700	466700	a little bit of observing.
466700	471300	This image here is of the famous observer Tico Brahe.
471300	476900	This is his great mural quadrant and you can see that what you would do with it is that
476900	482120	you would align it along your meridian, the north-south line and you can see the angular
482120	488260	measures along it and you would use it to measure the angle above the horizon of a star
488260	490580	or planet as it crosses the meridian.
490580	494960	This was one of the greatest astronomical instruments before the invention of the telescope
495040	499920	and really basically just a great big protractor.
499920	505360	You would also measure the time of crossing of the meridian and it was easier to measure
505360	512520	the time than any angle with respect to the prime meridian so that time became the convenient
512520	515400	unit for measuring right ascension.
515400	519680	Today however we find it to be an annoyance and we generally take our right ascension
519680	523320	measures and convert them to degrees.
523320	528640	The star positions are the basis for our measurements on the sky and really although
528640	533400	you hear a lot about constellations those really don't matter much to astronomers.
533400	536520	They are just geographical markers on the sky.
536520	541120	With your using the human eye to look at the sky they are familiar reference patterns
541120	548440	but they are not much help in how we do our orientation for professional astronomy.
548440	555040	So to use the stars as a reference system it's an important job to define a catalog
555040	556520	of star positions.
556520	561000	You need to have some known stars against which you can measure other things.
561000	567480	The position of all other stars would be measured relative to those known stars.
567480	573040	A strometry is when you are able to obtain a global solution of star positions.
573040	577520	You have your set of known star positions, you measure those star positions relative
577600	581920	to one another and in fact your known star positions end up being measured relative to
581920	583480	one another.
583480	588560	You can only measure relative star positions, you can't see the entire sky at once and
588560	593960	so the absolute solution across the whole sky must be calculated.
593960	597720	You need to use large surveys and large catalogs.
597720	603840	These are required just to define the coordinate system on the sky.
603840	608040	One thing that we found out when we started creating these catalogs was that the positions
608040	610200	of the stars were changing.
610200	613600	Now you might think this is natural, maybe the stars are actually just moving.
613600	619760	Well yes that's true they are moving but what really was moving was the vernal equinox.
619760	625600	The zero point of our coordinate system was changing and this was due to the procession
625600	627880	of Earth's rotation.
627920	635640	Now if I spin this top here you can see that its axis is wobbling.
635640	642360	It's spinning around but the axis which it's spinning around is wobbling around.
642360	648640	Earth is also spinning on its axis and its axis is also wobbling.
648640	656640	This is the procession of Earth's rotation axis and it causes a change in where the celestial
656800	659400	pole points on the sky.
659400	666400	This diagram shows the circle with which the north pole, the north celestial pole moves
667000	668800	throughout the sky.
668800	672000	Currently it's right near Polaris.
672000	679000	Polaris called the pole star but about 4,000 years ago it was near the star Thuban and
679880	686880	in about oh what 5,000 years from now it will be near the star Alderamin and in almost 10,000
688800	691600	years it will be near the star Vega.
691600	696040	Now when the pole is over near Vega it's going to look kind of stupid to have a star named
696040	702800	Polaris that's going to be several many degrees away from the pole but that's what Earth's
702800	703880	axis does.
703880	708720	Over 26,000 years it rotates around the sky.
708720	714800	This procession means that the coordinates we give a star needs to be tagged with a date
714800	720400	because the coordinates are relative to a defined equinox and the equinox is changing.
720400	727000	For my work I've had to deal with B1950 coordinates or J2000 coordinates and these are the coordinates
727000	732360	relative to the 1950 equinox or the 2000 equinox.
732360	739360	Now I'm about to tell you something that says sort of like what I just said was a lie because
739960	744440	recently we switched out of that coordinate system.
744440	749480	You need to know the idea of procession of the equinoxes because it's true and it happens
749480	753480	but our coordinate system has recently become rationalized.
753480	759000	We switched to something called ICRS, the International Celestial Reference System and
759040	766040	it was defined to match the J2000 equinox but it's going to retain fixed axes in space.
767200	773400	So even though the North Pole will not point to Polaris in a few thousand years the coordinates
773400	779400	of Polaris will not change because the orientation of ICRS is defined by some very distant radio
779400	780520	sources.
780520	785520	There are about 212 defining sources and they're mainly quasars that are way, way, way across
785560	789280	the universe and won't change their position relative to us.
789280	794120	So we're no longer truly using the sun or stars to define our coordinate system even
794120	798760	though historically that's the way they have been defined.
798760	802760	Well that completes a summary of the pre-telescopic concepts.
802760	808320	Now let's turn to how telescopes extend our capabilities.
808320	814560	Telescopes help us see objects that are small, faint and far away and there are two basic
814600	818720	types of telescopes, refractors and reflectors.
818720	822480	The refractors use lenses to collect and focus light.
822480	826200	The classical idea of a telescope would be a spyglass.
826200	830480	You have a spyglass, it has a lens at one end and a lens at the other end and you're
830480	832600	used to seeing people look through it.
832600	839360	Well that's the sort of telescope that Galileo used, only his was about 40 inches long.
839360	844360	It had a lens at one end to collect the light and a lens at the other end to focus the light
844360	845880	and look through it.
845880	852760	The largest refractors are limited by various factors, one being the length of the telescope.
852760	857280	It was hard for Galileo, you could not hold a 40 inch telescope steady, you of course
857280	859320	had to put it on a tripod.
859320	863320	You kind of get even larger ones, you have to have very large mounts.
863320	868240	They're also limited by the size of the lens, how big of a glass piece of glass you could
868240	869440	create.
869440	874280	The optical quality of that lens, can you keep a large piece of glass with a very clear
874280	878000	quality through it and the weight of the glass.
878000	885000	Once you get a piece of glass pretty big, this big, it starts to sag under its own weight.
885000	890160	This image here is an image of the Yerkes 40 inch telescope.
890160	896440	Now it's not 40 inches long, it's actually the lens at the end of it is 40 inches and
896440	902000	it's 62 feet long, it is the largest refracting telescope in the world.
902000	907400	The lens is 40 inches across and weighs a thousand pounds.
907400	912480	To give you a sense of scale, here's a picture of some famous astronomers at the Yerkes
912480	917440	telescope and you can look at it, you can definitely see that a lone astronomer could
917440	921760	not operate this telescope on his own, you definitely need somebody else to help you
921760	924640	run this telescope.
924640	929960	The second type of telescope, reflectors, use mirrors to gather light.
929960	933320	This idea actually originated with Isaac Newton.
933320	938960	He was frustrated with the quality of images you got from a refracting telescope and decided
938960	942480	to try using mirrors to gather the light.
942480	948800	This is a basic diagram of a reflecting telescope and the light comes in the barrel down here,
948800	954520	reflects off the mirror, comes back up to the secondary mirror here and goes out through
954520	955800	the eyepiece.
955800	962120	So this is the primary mirror at the bottom and the secondary mirror up here in the tube.
962120	968720	This allows you to collect light more efficiently because mirrors bounce the light and they
968720	973040	also do not suffer from chromatic aberration, which is one of the main problems that Newton
973040	978160	was trying to solve, that the different wavelengths of light are refracted slightly differently
978160	983960	in a lens, whereas they are handled equally by a reflecting telescope.
983960	988160	The other interesting fact about these telescopes is you'll notice this secondary mirror just
988160	991360	hanging out here in the middle of the tube.
991360	995560	Something has to hold up that secondary mirror and usually you have some struts holding
995560	997520	the secondary mirror.
997520	1003760	Those struts are the source of all these diffraction spikes on stars when you see them in telescope
1003760	1004760	images.
1004760	1010880	All of these crosses that you see are really diffraction around the struts holding up the
1010880	1014400	secondary mirror of the telescope.
1014400	1019440	The largest reflectors are limited basically by the size of the mirror.
1019440	1025400	You can build a cabinet to hold the telescope as almost as large as you want, depending
1025400	1029280	upon the machineries you've got, but you're really limited by the size of the mirror you
1029280	1034680	can make and of course by the optical quality of the mirror, but we're really good at making
1034680	1037040	very good mirrors.
1037040	1042280	This image here is the Lord Ross 72 inch telescope.
1042280	1044400	It's nicknamed the Leviathan.
1044400	1049360	It's 58 feet long and a 6 foot mirror.
1049360	1053560	The mirror itself weighs three and a half tons.
1053560	1059640	It was quite unwieldy, but they devised a novel way of mounting it so that they could
1059640	1061000	make use for it.
1061000	1066440	It was not able to point anywhere across the sky, instead these walls were constructed
1066440	1072000	around it and it mostly pointed north and south and you can get stars about one hour
1072000	1078360	of right ascension before meridian and one hour of right ascension after the meridian.
1078360	1083800	The mirror on this telescope was quite large and this is an image of the Palomar 200 inch
1083800	1091000	mirror, one of the largest mirrors ever made and they were taking this mirror off from the
1091000	1096320	telescope in order to polish it and you can't really get a sense of scale from here, but
1096320	1100880	while they are polishing it they took a picture of it and you can see just how large this
1100880	1102380	mirror is.
1102380	1107480	Every few years they have to take it down and repolish it, so this is the 200 inch mirror
1107480	1110720	at Palomar.
1110720	1116280	The telescope characteristics determine the usefulness of the telescope for scientific
1116280	1120720	research and there are several that are the most important.
1120720	1124720	The first is the magnification or the resolving power.
1124720	1130440	This is your ability to see fine details and it's measured in the smallest angle that
1130440	1132480	can be resolved.
1132480	1139080	For comparison, the human eye can resolve details about as fine as one arc minute, remembering
1139080	1145120	that there are 360 degrees in a circle, 60 arc minutes in a degree and 60 arc seconds
1145120	1150680	in an arc minute, so the human eye can see about one arc minute and telescopes are generally
1150680	1153440	measured in arc seconds.
1153440	1157560	For ground based telescopes, it really doesn't pay to try and build a telescope that can
1157560	1163440	get better resolution than that because you would be limited by the sky.
1163440	1169040	When we have twinkle twinkle little star, makes the stars beautiful, but it drives across
1169040	1177100	astronomers crazy because that scattering of the light blurs the light from distant objects
1177100	1181840	and we can't really get from the ground much better than about one arc second unless we
1181840	1185080	use some special techniques.
1185080	1190640	The second characteristic of a telescope is its light gathering power and this is mainly
1190640	1195600	just determined by the size of its primary lens or primary mirror.
1195600	1200840	The more light you gather, the fainter objects you can see and these fainter objects are
1200840	1204320	generally more distant objects.
1204320	1209680	The third characteristic would be the quality of the optical path.
1209680	1216040	You see every time light refracts or reflects, some of the light is scattered and you need
1216040	1222000	high quality optics to both focus the light cleanly and to retain as much of the light
1222000	1223000	as possible.
1223000	1227600	You're building a giant telescope in order to collect those valuable photons from these
1227600	1232240	very distant objects and you want to make sure the optical path is as clean as you can
1232240	1238440	get it so you retain as much light as possible for your research.
1238440	1244800	The craftsmanship in building telescopes has become a very important factor in scientific
1244800	1246720	discovery.
1246720	1251120	It has been shown throughout history that access to the best and largest telescopes
1251120	1253600	has enabled new discoveries.
1253600	1258800	Galileo improved the idea of a spyglass and was immediately able to see things that no
1258800	1261200	one else had ever seen.
1261200	1266440	William Herschel built the finest reflectors of his time and allowed an amateur astronomer
1266560	1269520	who was not a professional to discover Uranus.
1269520	1273920	He could see stars that some of the professionals could not see.
1273920	1279520	The telescope makers have become an important branch of astronomers and contribute greatly
1279520	1282040	to the research discoveries.
1282040	1285720	It's also important how you use the telescope.
1285720	1292000	While individual discoveries are trumpeted, I would argue that science benefits more
1292000	1294400	from general surveys.
1294400	1299600	Studies establish a reference set of knowledge against which future observations can be compared
1299600	1304360	and you don't know the benefits of it while you're doing the survey.
1304360	1310440	Herschel found Uranus while doing a survey and a search of previous surveys finds more
1310440	1316800	observations of Uranus and then we identify the problem with Uranus's orbit and that
1316800	1320480	leads to the discovery of Neptune.
1320560	1326840	What's further, Neptune's discovery was aided by a recent accurate star map that allowed
1326840	1330880	them to find, hey, this star is not on the map.
1330880	1337680	So while the survey work may be unglamorous, it's long, it's painstaking observations and
1337680	1343800	you may not see immediate benefits, the surveys are very important because the benefits extend
1343800	1350040	throughout history and often surveys that are done for one purpose end up being used
1350040	1354280	for different unrelated research.
1354280	1361240	Now sorting through an entire survey can be somewhat like looking for a needle in a haystack.
1361240	1364520	Another standard approach that we use is the targeted search.
1364520	1370600	We'll use a survey to develop a list of candidates and then use follow-up observations on those
1370600	1371600	candidates.
1371600	1377720	In fact, many surveys these days are not really for the general good of astronomy, they're
1377720	1383420	primarily to find candidates for follow-up study.
1383420	1387920	We can also limit the data that we're looking through by searching one small area of the
1387920	1388920	sky.
1388920	1394200	If we look through that one small area thoroughly and we do all our research there, we can get
1394200	1396080	detailed results.
1396080	1401000	But of course that means we then have to assume that that area of the sky is a representative
1401000	1406720	sample of the sky and we have to then extrapolate the results from one region to the whole region
1406720	1408360	of the sky.
1408360	1413920	For solar system objects, one search technique that works well is to search the area of the
1413920	1415880	sky that is opposite the sun.
1415880	1420320	If the sun is over here, we're going to examine this part over here.
1420320	1426080	And what we're going to look for is retrograde motion because if there's a solar system object
1426080	1432160	at opposition outside the earth, it will be going through retrograde motion.
1432160	1437000	And by looking in that over the course of a year, we sweep through the ecliptic.
1437000	1444960	Finally, and this is probably the most surprising point that I will make today, telescopes really
1444960	1447720	don't matter that much anymore.
1447720	1456800	I know I'm speaking crazy here now, but really matters when we go to a telescope is the instruments
1456800	1461000	that we put on the telescope that process and analyze the light.
1461040	1464600	The telescope's primary job is just to gather a lot of light.
1464600	1467040	And we've got really good telescopes for doing that.
1467040	1472480	And now what differentiates different observatories is the instruments that we put on them that
1472480	1475600	enable the deep research.
1475600	1478640	So let's go through a few examples of the instruments.
1478640	1482000	The simplest instrument would be a prism.
1482000	1488080	And here's a picture of a prism where the light comes in one side and it's broken into
1488080	1490980	its constituent colors on the other side.
1490980	1497940	This allows us to look at the light of a star or other object and examine each color separately.
1497940	1503700	And prisms are really just a basic idea of how we disperse light into its component colors.
1503700	1507540	They're also diffraction gratings and many other methods for looking at the dispersion
1507540	1508980	of light.
1508980	1514300	When you disperse the light far enough, you can actually see lines in the spectrum.
1514300	1520660	In this diagram, this drawing really, the light from a star comes through a prism and
1520660	1525340	then is dispersed out and you can see within the component colors, there are lines across
1525340	1526340	it.
1526340	1533020	These are called spectral lines and these are the absorption of specific elements.
1533020	1538620	As electrons change levels within the elements, they absorb specific wavelengths of light
1538620	1542420	and that reveals the chemical composition.
1542420	1549740	If we look at stars, this is a group of stellar spectra and each of these spectra across here
1549740	1554140	for the various stars shows you various spectral lines.
1554140	1556260	Some of the spectral lines are the same.
1556260	1562180	For example, this hydrogen delta line appears in the top three spectra.
1562180	1564060	Some of them are different.
1564060	1570020	What's fascinating is that we can actually study the makeup of stars by their light.
1570020	1574780	We can study what's in a star even though we can't bring it into the laboratory and
1574780	1577580	dissect it and take it apart.
1577900	1581100	What's also interesting is that we can discover new elements.
1581100	1590380	The element helium was discovered in the spectrum of the sun, helios meaning of course sun.
1590380	1595700	Another instrument that we use all the time in astronomy is photography.
1595700	1600780	Photography was a major advance for astronomy because it allowed us to accumulate light.
1600780	1605500	The human eye, when you look at something, only accumulates light for about a 30th of
1605500	1606500	a second.
1606620	1612740	You can tell this is the secret why movies work, because movies are just a sequence of
1612740	1617580	images playing through a projector and they're played at about 24 frames a second.
1617580	1624060	When you play the images through fast enough, they look continuous to the human eye.
1624060	1629900	When we look at a distant object through a telescope with the human eye, we're only
1629900	1633380	seeing one 30th of a second of that light.
1633420	1638220	If we want to see fainter details, we need to record that light.
1638220	1642100	And so as an example, let's take a look at this image sequence.
1642100	1646580	This is an image of an object, a one minute exposure.
1646580	1650340	Taking a one minute exposure, it looks like this and it's sort of a blobby thing.
1650340	1655460	If we expose instead for five minutes, we see a little bit more detail.
1655460	1661700	For 30 minutes, we see a lot more detail and for 45 minutes, we can recognize it as the
1661700	1663860	Andromeda galaxy.
1663860	1668620	You need to use short exposures to expose the bright regions and long exposures to see
1668620	1670420	the faint regions.
1670420	1674860	The telescope expanded what the human eye could see in terms of the size domain, how
1674860	1679900	much light we could gather, and photography expands what we can see in the time domain,
1679900	1682580	how long we can gather that light.
1682580	1686300	Many other specialized devices have been employed for astronomy.
1686300	1689300	One example that I will go through is the blink comparator.
1689300	1693980	And it allows you to quickly switch between two observations.
1693980	1700620	This is an image of Clyde Tombaugh using the Zeiss blink comparator at the Lowell Observatory.
1700620	1706380	The lever that he's holding allows him to switch between one image to another image.
1706380	1712540	And what Tombaugh did is he would take images of the same part of the sky on separate days
1712540	1717280	and then pull them into the blink comparator and look for things that moved.
1717280	1720640	This was in the great search to find Pluto.
1720640	1726080	These are actually the images that Tombaugh blinked in order to find Pluto.
1726080	1730720	And this was one image he took on January 23rd, 1930.
1730720	1734000	And this is an image he took on January 29th, 1930.
1734000	1742600	And if I go back and forth between them and you look really closely, you can see things
1742600	1744320	moving there.
1744320	1749960	Now it's kind of hard to see them because at this resolution they're very small.
1749960	1755800	But I put red boxes around about 10 objects where I see things moving between the two
1755800	1756800	images.
1756800	1763200	And if I blink back and forth, we can say, OK, the 23rd and the 30th, the 23rd and the
1763200	1767360	30th, the 23rd and the 30th.
1767360	1770520	And you can see several of those objects moving.
1770520	1772880	Which one is Pluto?
1772880	1779520	Well, Pluto is this one here and that one there.
1779520	1781360	How did he find it?
1781360	1785600	It's the one undergoing retrograde motion at opposition.
1785600	1789680	So astronomy has developed many different specialties.
1789680	1794360	Building and running an observatory requires a dedicated team of people.
1794360	1800800	The design and fabrication of sensitive instruments demand specialized talent.
1800800	1804880	Professional astronomers must be careful and patient.
1804880	1809560	And those who interpret those observations and speculate about their physical basis,
1809560	1811880	those are the ones we call theorists.
1811880	1816680	By its nature, astronomy has become a collaborative enterprise.
1816680	1822160	And it is excellence across all these aspects of astronomy that generally what leads to
1822160	1824880	scientific advance.
1824880	1825880	That's it for today.
1825880	1826840	We'll see you next time.
