0	23840	In 1864, Jules Verne published the book A Journey to the Center of the Earth.
23840	29960	In it, Professor Liedenbrock leads his nephew and a hired guide down a volcano in Iceland
29960	34500	and they have many adventures where they sail across a subterranean ocean,
34500	39720	they meet prehistoric creatures, they are hit by underground lightning,
39720	46280	and they see a 12 foot tall ape man, which they can't decide is it ape man or man ape.
46280	55620	And upon looking at that, I wondered is that related to the fact that Darwin's on the origin of species was published five years earlier.
55620	63200	But at the end of their adventures, they come to the surface in southern Italy by a steam vent of a volcano.
63200	68700	Now, unfortunately, I don't think truth is stranger than fiction in this case,
68700	73540	because as we explore planetary interiors, we will see a subterranean ocean,
73540	78660	but it will be made of magma, not water, so you couldn't really sail across it.
78660	85460	Instead of lightning, we'll find magnetism and we'll won't meet any prehistoric creatures.
85460	90040	Although, there is a chance of life on Europa.
90040	95060	Our trip to the interior will be based on bulk measures and external properties,
95060	101400	because really, we have no chance of making in situ measurements in the interior of any planet.
101400	105340	We'll spend most of our time looking at Earth, where the data is strongest,
105340	110420	and as we extrapolate to the other planets and bodies of the solar system,
110420	114540	we'll have to be guided by mathematical models.
114540	124380	And generally, when we look at the interior, we're really biased towards explaining the surface characteristics of the planets.
124380	129120	So we'll begin where Vern begins his adventure on Earth's surface.
129120	136760	Earth is a rocky planet, so let's take a look at the rocks and see what we can tell about the interior from just looking at the rocks.
136760	142660	There are three main types of rocks, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
142780	146960	Igneous rocks are rocks that cooled from molten state.
146960	151480	Now, molten rock is called lava when it flows across the surface,
151480	155120	and it's called magma when it's beneath the surface.
155120	160480	Examples of igneous rocks include basalt and granite.
160480	168280	Sedimentary rocks are rocks that have been deposited over time by wind, water, snow.
168280	173980	For example, layers of sand can be compressed and you get sandstone.
173980	180700	If the minerals precipitate out of the oceans and form on the ocean floor, you can create limestone.
180700	187700	It's interesting to note that the rocks at the top of Mount Everest are limestone.
187700	191540	These are sedimentary rocks that formed at the bottom of the ocean,
191540	197040	and then were pushed up to form the highest mountain in the world.
197040	200600	Metamorphic rocks are reprocessed rocks.
200600	205240	If you subject igneous or sedimentary rocks to high pressures and temperatures,
205240	207960	they will change their structure.
207960	212400	Fine-grained igneous rocks become a different type of rock called schist.
212400	215440	Limestone becomes marble.
215440	221840	So when you're picking out your countertops and you have a choice between granite and marble countertops,
221840	223220	here's the difference.
223220	225000	Granite are igneous rocks.
225000	227800	They've been molten once and then they solidified.
227800	232960	While marble is a metamorphic rock that was processed as a sedimentary rock
232960	236800	and then reprocessed to form marble.
236800	242640	Probably that extra step in production means that marble costs a little bit extra.
242640	249000	The implications from rocks for the interior of our planet are twofold.
249000	253400	One, it shows that magma flows up from the interior.
253400	257200	There must be some sort of magma ocean beneath our water oceans
257200	262400	where the magma can rise up and form our igneous rocks.
262400	267500	Second thing is that rocks must also flow down into the interior.
267500	273000	Some of the crust is recycled because you're taking these igneous and sedimentary rocks
273000	279600	and pushing them down into high temperatures and pressure to become the metamorphic rocks.
279600	283000	Next, let's take a look at the oceans.
283000	286700	Here is the standard picture of Earth's surface
286700	289900	and you can see that oceans cover 70% of the surface.
289900	294900	There are five major ones, the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian
294900	300200	and down near Antarctic there is the southern ocean that we don't talk about very much
300200	304400	and then at the northern latitudes we have the Arctic Ocean.
304400	309900	The average depths of these oceans is about 13,000 to 16,000 feet
309900	314800	about the height of a really good mountain but this is actually depth in the sea.
314800	318100	The only one that's different is the Arctic Ocean
318100	323600	and it's a rather shallow ocean goes only to about 4,000 feet deep.
323600	330100	The deepest points of the ocean are shown in this topo map where you can see trenches.
330100	334100	Now trenches tend to occur along the edges of continents.
334100	340900	Along the west coast of South America you can see the Peru Chile Trench.
340900	348400	Along the west coast of North America and stretching along past Alaska is the Aleutian Trench
348400	351800	and then down past Japan you have the Japanese Trench
351800	356900	and stretching out into the Pacific you have the Mariana Trench.
356900	362400	The depths of these trenches can reach to 36,000 feet
362400	369800	and that sounds really deep but let's put it in perspective with respect to our planet.
369800	374100	The average depth of the ocean is perhaps 5 kilometers
374100	377900	and the deepest is only 11 kilometers.
377900	381800	Now let's add in the mountains, 11 kilometers deep for the oceans
381800	384600	but you know add in the 9 kilometers of height for the mountains
384600	388400	you get about 20 kilometers of vertical relief.
388400	395600	That's really only 0.3% of Earth's 6,400 kilometer radius.
395600	402200	Now I have here a globe and some globes have vertical relief on them
402200	404800	where you can feel the mountain change.
404800	408400	If this globe had perfectly accurate vertical relief
408400	412700	going from the highest mountains to the deepest trenches
412700	417400	the thickness on a 12 inch globe or 6 inch radius
417400	420100	would be less than half a millimeter.
420100	425500	You could rub your hand across it and you still could not feel it.
425500	435200	That's why most globes have really really really exaggerated vertical relief.
435200	440200	The other feature of the sea floor are what we call ridges
440200	444200	and in this topo map we emphasize the ridges
444200	449300	and you can see running down the center of the Atlantic Ocean,
449300	454300	the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and off the west coast of South America
454300	456900	we have the East Pacific Rise
456900	460000	and flowing underneath Australia and India
460000	463500	we have the ridges in the East Indian Ocean.
463500	466000	These are like undersea mountain ranges.
466000	470400	They can reach up to 5,000 feet above the sea floor
470400	472900	and sometimes especially in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
472900	475000	they're cut by a rift valley.
475000	480300	So you have the mountains and then you have a rift valley cutting through them.
480300	486200	We interpret these ocean features under the guise of plate tectonics.
486200	490000	In this image we show you the plates of Earth.
490000	495600	Earth's crust is divided into 8 large plates and a few smaller ones.
495600	500500	We have the North American plate and the South American plate.
500500	504400	We have the Eurasian plate which stretches from Europe across Asia.
504400	506500	The African plate.
506500	511400	We have the Indo-Australian plate from India and Australia.
511400	514300	And we have the Pacific plate down bottom
514300	518200	and then we have one plate that's just to the west of South America
518200	520200	which is called the Nazca plate.
520200	522600	Those are the eight major plates.
522600	524600	There are also a host of minor plates
524600	528000	and the most easily recognizable one is the Arabian plate
528100	530100	that includes Saudi Arabia.
531300	536200	Now with these plates you can see the boundaries of these plates
536200	539100	fit with the ridges.
539100	543700	And where these plates intersect are the regions of the trenches.
543700	546900	The trenches are interpreted as regions of subduction
546900	550100	where one plate is going underneath another.
550100	553400	The ridges are the creation of new plate material.
553400	557500	The magma rises from the interior, pushes up these mountains.
557500	559900	It solidifies and creates new plate material
559900	563900	and then the plates spread away from the ridges.
563900	569900	This motion can be measured and it's about a few centimeters per year.
569900	574100	So if you think your flight from the US to Europe is long
574100	575900	it's only going to get longer
575900	580300	as they actually are spreading apart from one another.
580300	583500	The evidence for plate tectonics is incredibly strong
583500	587000	and they come from earthquakes and volcanoes.
587000	593000	This is a map where earthquakes have occurred over a five year period.
593000	597000	You notice that it very strongly matches the seafloor topography
597000	598700	that I just showed you.
598700	604000	The number and strength of earthquakes are highest at plate boundaries.
604000	608600	Now you'll also note that earthquakes can occur away from the plate boundaries.
608600	611400	I take a look and I live in the eastern United States
611400	615000	and I see there are significant number of earthquakes
615000	617000	that occur in the eastern United States.
617000	620400	I'm told that a moderate earthquake in Boston
620400	624300	could do more damage than a stronger one in San Francisco
624300	631000	because the building codes do not anticipate earthquakes in the northeast.
631000	633800	The same is true for volcanoes.
633800	638100	Here is a map of where volcanoes are found on our planet.
638100	641100	They are not randomly distributed throughout our planet
641100	645400	but again they match with the location of the trenches.
645400	649000	The subduction of a plate underneath another plate
649000	654100	leads to volcanic activity on the continental plate next to it.
654100	657600	But once again you will notice that the correlation is not perfect.
657600	663600	In particular, there are some volcanoes here in the middle of the Pacific plate.
663600	665400	This is Hawaii.
665400	667700	Why are there volcanoes in Hawaii?
667700	673800	This is as far away from either side of a plate as you can possibly get.
673800	677000	Well, let's take a look at the Hawaiian Islands.
677000	679600	This is an overhead map of the Hawaiian Islands
679600	683800	and you can see the big island actually contains two very large volcanoes.
683800	686900	The northern one is Mauna Kea and that's Dormant
686900	691300	and the southern one is Mauna Loa and that's still active.
691300	695800	The idea of how you can get these volcanoes out in the middle of the Pacific plate
695800	699000	is something called hotspot volcanism.
699000	703200	There is a magma hotspot underneath the Pacific plate
703200	709800	and that magma pushes up through the Pacific plate and forms these volcanoes.
709800	715300	As the plate moves across the hotspot, new islands in the chain grow
715300	718500	and you can see here from just the state of Hawaii
718500	721700	that the islands sort of continue off to the northwest.
721700	727100	If I take a wider view, you can see that it isn't just the islands that we see today
727100	731600	but there are considerably more islands that have been there previously
731600	738300	and if I look at a topo map, you can see that if I remove the water
738300	743300	then you can see that there is a huge long chain from Hawaii down here
743300	746100	all the way up across the Pacific plate.
746100	753100	There is at least 70 million years of hotspot volcanism in the Hawaiian island chain
753100	758700	and there's a new volcano that is forming just south of the big island
758700	765800	and they call it Loihi and that eventually would become the new island in the Hawaiian chain.
765800	770800	So that sort of inspires an intriguing question.
770800	773700	What is the history of the plate motion?
773700	776900	How have these plates been structured over history?
776900	780200	Well, here are how the continents look today
780200	786000	and one thing you will notice is how the bulge of South America on the east coast
786000	792100	would fit very neatly into the west coast of Africa.
792100	797900	The Mid-Atlantic Ridge has separated these two continents over millions of years.
797900	802500	If you look 60 million years ago, the continents were closer
802500	808300	and you can also note how far India is from the Eurasian plate.
808300	812800	India over the last 60 million years has been a relative speed demon.
812800	816400	It's been traveling at up to 15 centimeters per year.
816400	824300	If we look back 120 million years ago, this was the time when South America and Africa were in contact.
824300	828900	180 million years ago, the Atlantic Ocean disappears.
828900	835000	Matter of fact, you only have one much larger ocean and we have the continent that's called Pangaea,
835000	841100	one supercontinent composed of all the continents that we know today.
841100	847600	Going further back to 240 million years, the lion masses seem to migrate a little bit south
847600	856200	and going to 300 million years, it still remains mostly one continent as it continues to migrate south even further.
856300	862900	At 360 million years ago, you can see that most of the land mass is below the equator.
862900	867300	And when I look at this, I say, ah, maybe that north-south dichotomy on Mars
867300	873200	where there's a significantly different topography in the south compared to the north.
873200	877400	Well, I guess it doesn't look so strange anymore.
877400	881400	At 420 million years ago, it's no longer one continent.
881400	884900	So the supercontinent of Pangaea was just a temporary state.
884900	886900	North America has broken off.
886900	893400	And I also think it's kind of fun to look at this and say, hey, look, Alaska, Greenland and Russia,
893400	896900	all of them straddle the equator.
896900	905800	So we conclude that the continental plates have been drifting across an interior layer of the planet.
905800	911200	Well, I guess drifting is one word, but I think floating is a better word
911200	917900	because that will lead to the idea that's important to discuss next, and that's differentiation.
917900	920300	We all know that oil and water don't mix.
920300	924200	You put oil and water together and you shake it up and then let it sit.
924200	928400	Eventually the water will drop to the bottom and the oil will rise to the top.
928400	931900	The water is more dense and it sinks to the bottom.
931900	935500	For planets, this idea is called differentiation.
935500	941100	It's basically the simple gravitational separation of materials of different density.
941100	949500	It requires, however, that the body must have been liquid at some point during its formation.
949500	955300	So massive objects will have high temperature and pressure due to gravity.
955300	959000	They naturally will become differentiated.
959000	964900	What's more important for smaller bodies is the heat generated during formation.
964900	972100	The cooling efficiency of a body is really a ratio of its surface area to its volume.
972100	978500	And if these things are roughly spherical, the area is proportional to the radius squared
978500	983000	and the volume is proportional to the radius cubed.
983000	986900	So the cooling efficiency goes up with size.
986900	990300	Smaller objects will cool more efficiently.
990300	993700	So you will expect large objects to be differentiated,
993700	997100	but the smaller objects will be able to cool away their heat.
997100	1004100	They won't necessarily become liquid and we might expect those to be undifferentiated.
1004100	1011000	The tool that we'll use to explore the interior structure is seismology.
1011000	1015200	And it's simply that earthquakes trigger seismic waves
1015200	1018500	and some of those seismic waves will pass along the earth's surface.
1018700	1021600	These are the ones you feel when you're involved in an earthquake.
1021600	1024900	I did my graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley
1024900	1026900	and I experienced a number of these.
1026900	1030300	Most of them were kind of fun, a little rolling of the room,
1030300	1037400	but I was also there during the 7.2 Loma Prieta earthquake and that one scared me a little.
1037400	1042500	But the other seismic waves, the ones that are useful for exploring the interior,
1042500	1046300	are the ones that are going to go downward and through the interior.
1046300	1051500	And the speed of these waves is dependent on the density of the medium.
1051500	1055100	They can also change direction or bounce
1055100	1058000	when there are boundaries between different density mediums.
1058000	1063200	This is like refraction or reflection with light waves.
1063200	1068700	When the wave hits the boundary, it can bounce back or it can change its direction.
1068700	1071800	There are two types of waves that we will consider.
1071800	1073900	First are called primary waves.
1073900	1078600	These are what scientists call acoustic waves and they propagate like sound waves.
1078600	1081600	There is a compression and rarefaction as it moves along,
1081600	1084900	just like the sound waves that you hear.
1084900	1089100	The second type are called secondary waves and these are shear waves.
1089100	1090700	There is a side-to-side motion.
1090700	1094900	So this is like when you're wiggling a string or a bull whip back side-to-side.
1094900	1097300	That's a wave passing this way.
1097300	1101000	You will note that for a shear wave to work,
1101000	1104300	if I push this piece of a body to the side,
1104300	1108000	it needs to have some connection to the next piece of a body to pull it.
1108000	1111400	Therefore, the shear waves can't propagate through a liquid.
1111400	1115800	If I pull a little bit of liquid to the side, the next bit doesn't go side-to-side.
1115800	1121800	So it's an important property is that the primary waves can pass through solids and liquids,
1121800	1125800	but the shear waves can only pass through solids.
1125800	1129800	The basic idea is that you know the epicenter of the quake.
1129800	1132800	You measure the strength of the waves on the surface,
1132800	1134800	determine the epicenter of the quake,
1134800	1137800	and then around the globe at the seismic stations,
1137800	1141800	you measure which waves arrive and when they arrive.
1141800	1144800	If, for example, no secondary wave arrives,
1144800	1151800	then you know there must be a liquid layer between that seismic station and the epicenter of the quake.
1151800	1158800	The time of arrival will indicate the average density of the material that it passed through.
1158800	1163800	Now, in this way, you can work to build up a model of the interior.
1163800	1166800	It's not going to be a simple solution,
1166800	1171800	simply because you do have these boundaries and you have reflections and refractions,
1171800	1177800	but with enough data over many years, we've built up a very good model of the earth's interior.
1177800	1182800	Earth's interior structure is considered to be composed of several layers.
1182800	1187800	Basically, the basic layers are crust, mantle, and core.
1187800	1193800	The crust is roughly 60 kilometers thick, only about 1% of earth's radius.
1193800	1196800	It's composed of the low density materials,
1196800	1203800	and as you would expect, the low density materials are the stuff that's going to float to the top of a differentiation process.
1203800	1211800	It really is not very significant because it only contains 0.4% of earth's mass.
1211800	1216800	It is, however, very significant to us because it's where we live.
1216800	1220800	One question we have is, why isn't there more crust?
1220800	1228800	If you look at the materials that we think formed our earth, we expect there should be 200 kilometers of crust.
1228800	1237800	However, if you do the calculations, at around 60 kilometers, the pressure and temperature become so great
1237800	1241800	that the materials of the crust undergo what's called a phase change.
1241800	1248800	They become higher density materials, and the bottom of the crust peels off what they say delaminates and then starts to sink.
1248800	1254800	So the crust is kept at about 60 kilometers thick through this process.
1254800	1260800	The mantle, the middle layer, is composed of rock and extends about halfway down to the center.
1260800	1264800	It contains two thirds of earth's mass.
1264800	1267800	There are three subregions in the mantle.
1267800	1270800	You have the upper mantle, and that contains the asthenosphere.
1270800	1274800	This is a region that acts like a fluid on geologic times.
1274800	1283800	It's still rock, but over millions of years it actually flows, and there is a slow convection in the asthenosphere,
1283800	1289800	and the lithospheric plates float atop this plastic region.
1289800	1295800	At the bottom of the upper mantle is what they call the transition region.
1295800	1298800	This is maybe the source of the basaltic magmas.
1298800	1307800	This is where materials that have peeled off from the crust and dropped down become heated enough that they regain their buoyancy
1307800	1312800	and again start their rise back up to the surface.
1312800	1315800	The lower mantle is solid.
1315800	1319800	It contains the higher density materials that form under really high pressure.
1319800	1325800	About half the mass of the earth is in the lower mantle.
1325800	1328800	Below that we have the core.
1328800	1331800	This is mostly iron with a little bit of nickel.
1331800	1335800	It contains about one third of the mass of earth.
1335800	1346800	It was probably all liquid at one point, but the interior of the earth has cooled enough that there is an inner core which is solid.
1346800	1355800	Earth's interior structure, crust mantle core, serves as a template for understanding the other rocky planets.
1355800	1362800	If we look at Venus, Venus is expected to have a similar interior structure to earth.
1362800	1367800	The major difference is that Venus is a one plate planet.
1367800	1369800	We're not exactly sure why.
1369800	1376800	When we look at Venus, the tectonic features are spread everywhere, not like on earth where they were aligned with plate boundaries.
1376800	1379800	There are no plate boundaries on Venus.
1379800	1386800	The entire surface appears to be no older than a few hundred million years.
1386800	1394800	So the tectonics are expected to be compressional sideways and up and down.
1395800	1400800	Here is a view of the Aphrodite Terra on Venus.
1400800	1407800	And in the center, the red pinkish regions are Avda Regio and Thetis Regio.
1407800	1412800	These are called tesserae, and these are some of the oldest regions on the surface of Venus.
1412800	1422800	They show this complex deformation and probably were caused by convective motions in the mantle raising and lowering the crust.
1422800	1431800	This obviously was followed by planet wide resurfacing because over 80% of the planet is volcanic plains.
1431800	1439800	So for Venus, lava flows are the most significant interior manifestation on the surface.
1439800	1445800	Mercury has a very high density that indicates that it has a very large iron core.
1445800	1451800	The iron core extends more than two thirds of the radius of the planet.
1451800	1456800	Originally, we believed that it would have cooled off and become solid,
1456800	1462800	but recent observations have shown that at least it is partially molten.
1462800	1468800	Now Mercury shows no tectonics, but it does show an interesting feature called fault scarps.
1468800	1478800	This is an image of a scarf, and what the scarf is, is this line working from the center down through these craters.
1478800	1486800	This is a geologic fault, and the features like these indicate that the region of the surface has compressed.
1486800	1493800	We believe that perhaps there even was global contraction of the entire planet during its formation.
1493800	1498800	It formed and it was hot and slowly cooled and cracked as it cooled.
1498800	1502800	Mars has a lower density than the other rocky planets.
1502800	1505800	Earth's density is up over 5 grams per cubic centimeter.
1505800	1510800	Mars is more like our moon and down around 3 grams per cubic centimeter.
1510800	1519800	It likely has a lower percentage of iron in its composition and therefore has a correspondingly smaller core.
1519800	1527800	The core of Mars only extends out to about 30% of its radius instead of 50% as we see here on Earth.
1527800	1535800	The expression on its surface in Mars is most noticeable in a region called the Tharsis bulge.
1535800	1546800	In this topographic map you can see this giant red region over here that has been uplifted several kilometers above the average radius of Mars.
1546800	1553800	In the Tharsis bulge are the giant volcanoes, including Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system.
1553800	1562800	This likely indicates that in the mantle of Mars there has been sustained regional motions that have continued to push up.
1562800	1573800	We don't know why this should be and particularly why it should last for billions of years that it obviously has in order to produce the extensive volcanism we see here.
1573800	1585800	I would say that compared to Earth's plate tectonics, the other rocky planets have relatively mild expressions of their interiors in their surface features.
1585800	1591800	If we look at the large moons and the minor planets, we don't see any tectonics.
1591800	1598800	What we see is really a sequence from differentiated bodies down to undifferentiated bodies.
1598800	1600800	We start with the moon.
1600800	1609800	The moon has a relatively low density compared to Earth, about the same as Mars, and it means that it probably does not have a core.
1609800	1617800	This diagram here shows a core, but considering the density we really doubt that it has a true iron core.
1617800	1620800	The moon is geologically dead.
1620800	1632800	We see some ancient crustal extension and contraction, stuff that happened during its formation, but it has had no activity for the past two and a half billion years.
1632800	1644800	As for the asteroids, we would expect the small bodies of the asteroids to cool efficiently and the heat of formation would be lost and therefore they would not be differentiated.
1644800	1649800	Unfortunately, the evidence disagrees with our expectations.
1649800	1656800	We have the iron meteorites. They fall to Earth, and these can only come from a differentiated body.
1656800	1664800	They are pure iron on these meteorites, and they seem to indicate the complete breakup of differentiated bodies in the asteroid belts.
1664800	1669800	So some asteroids must be differentiated, and we would expect the largest ones to be.
1669800	1677800	Here's a diagram of the largest one, Ceres, and it is likely to have a differentiated interior.
1677800	1685800	We have observations that show it has a difference between its crust and an icy layer below that crust.
1685800	1696800	The density of Ceres requires that there be a rocky interior below that, and this diagram doesn't show an iron core, but we believe that to be present as well.
1696800	1704800	Only a few other asteroids are large enough to be differentiated, and most asteroids we believe are undifferentiated.
1704800	1709800	Moving on to the Galilean moons, the most interesting one is Europa.
1709800	1713800	This image here shows what we call the ice rafts of Europa.
1713800	1719800	This is a fractured surface that close a complicated jumble of ice.
1719800	1728800	In a global view, we see much longer striations, these long lines and fractures that extend across most of its surface.
1728800	1734800	This image looks somewhat like what we see here on Earth at the North Pole.
1734800	1744800	Now these radial lines are just indicating where the North Pole exists, but these other lines are fractures in the ice above the Arctic Ocean.
1744800	1755800	We take the same idea and apply it to Europa, and deduce that there might be a subsurface ocean on Europa.
1755800	1769800	So Europa's interior is differentiated, has metallic core and a rocky interior, but out towards the edge it has covered with ice and may have perhaps a 10 kilometer deep ocean.
1769800	1779800	The evidence is consistent with this ocean only existing in the past, so we're not entirely sure that the ocean exists at present.
1780800	1792800	If we look at the other Galilean moons, in the upper left we have Io, then we have Europa in the upper right, we have Ganymede in the lower left, we have Callisto in the lower right.
1792800	1798800	These are diagrams of their interiors as inferred from gravity field and magnetic field measurements.
1798800	1807800	All but Callisto are believed to be differentiated. They have an iron core surrounded by rock, and all but Io have an icy surface.
1807800	1813800	Io, of course, has extensive volcanism and would not have an icy surface.
1813800	1819800	It is interesting to note that Ganymede and Callisto may also have subsurface oceans.
1819800	1824800	The evidence for this comes from a small variability in their magnetic field.
1824800	1832800	We noticed on Europa that its magnetic field varies just a little bit, perhaps due to the subsurface ocean.
1832800	1840800	Now to do this, to create a magnetic field, you need an internal conducting fluid, because electricity and magnetism are complementary.
1840800	1844800	Wherever you have an electric current, you generate a magnetic field.
1844800	1848800	If a magnetic field changes, you generate an electric current.
1848800	1858800	So for Ganymede and Callisto, when we see changes in their magnetic field, the best explanation we can come up with is a subsurface ocean.
1858800	1865800	Now Europa and Callisto have only tiny magnetic fields. They're really not intrinsic to the body themselves.
1865800	1868800	They're more a response to Jupiter's magnetic field.
1868800	1877800	Ganymede, however, has a thick ocean layer and has a significant, or shall I say in this drawing, is drawn with a thick ocean layer
1877800	1882800	because it has a significant internal magnetic field.
1882800	1888800	Moving on to Saturn, its large moon Titan is also suspected of having subsurface ocean.
1888800	1895800	It is larger than Mercury, so we expect it to be differentiated, have rock and ice interior.
1895800	1903800	We also suspect that it has a water and ammonia liquid layer about 50 kilometers below its icy surface.
1903800	1908800	At the very outer edge of the solar system, Neptune has a large moon Triton.
1908800	1913800	Triton is thought to be undifferentiated mix of ice and rock.
1913800	1917800	This is due to its gentler formation in a cold region of the solar system.
1917800	1924800	I also note that ices can stick together under gentle collisions and don't need to heat up that much.
1924800	1932800	Pluto is very similar to Triton in most properties, but it's just a little smaller, so we expect basically the same interior for Pluto.
1932800	1936800	Finally, we turn to the giant planets.
1936800	1944800	The interiors for these are mostly determined by modeling, and we find that Jupiter and Saturn are different from Uranus and Neptune.
1944800	1953800	Jupiter and Saturn are composed roughly of solar composition of hydrogen and helium, 75% hydrogen, 25% helium.
1953800	1958800	The outer layer is gaseous molecular hydrogen. These are the atmospheres that we see,
1958800	1963800	but as you go deeper and deeper into it, that gas becomes really more like a hot liquid,
1963800	1974800	and at about one million times Earth's atmospheric pressure, the hydrogen breaks down and becomes a liquid called metallic hydrogen.
1974800	1983800	In the very center below this metallic hydrogen, there's a core, and we presume it to be a mass of rock about 15 times the mass of Earth.
1983800	1992800	We have no direct evidence for it, but we need to postulate this mass of rock as a nucleus for the formation of Jupiter and Saturn.
1992800	1999800	Basically, you need enough mass to attract and hold the gases that form the rest of the planet.
1999800	2007800	Jupiter's density indicates that it is dominated by its liquid hydrogen phase, so though we call it a gas giant,
2007800	2014800	from this viewpoint, it's really more a liquid giant, and Saturn's density is actually below that of water.
2014800	2018800	In fact, by volume, it's mostly gaseous hydrogen.
2018800	2026800	Uranus and Neptune are significantly smaller. They formed farther out in the solar system,
2026800	2032800	and instead of creating gas because they didn't have enough mass, they instead created ices.
2032800	2038800	The ices in this case means water, ammonia, and methane.
2038800	2044800	Uranus and Neptune's interior starts with a small rocky core of perhaps a few Earth masses.
2044800	2051800	Then, outside that, we have a dominant component that is hot, highly compressed liquid.
2051800	2056800	This is the ices and various chemical species derived from these ices.
2056800	2061800	The outer 15% of these planets is molecular hydrogen gas.
2061800	2066800	Uranus and Neptune show a completely different structure from Jupiter and Saturn,
2066800	2074800	and some people refer to these guys as ice giants compared to Jupiter and Saturn as gas giants, or even liquid giants.
2074800	2077800	That completes our journey to the centers of the planets.
2077800	2082800	You may notice that there is one external manifestation that we've not yet discussed.
2082800	2090800	Magnetic fields are generated in the interior of most planets, but the effects are seen on the exterior.
2090800	2095800	In particular, magnetic fields interact strongly with the solar wind.
2095800	2101800	We will discuss magnetic fields in detail in the context of solar storms in a few lectures.
2101800	2105800	In the meantime, we're going to work our way out to that region.
2105800	2110800	Our next lecture will move from planetary interiors to planetary atmospheres.
2110800	2113800	We'll see you then. Take care.
