0	21800	Our course so far has covered our solar system in depth.
21800	28800	We have explored the sun, the planets, their moons and rings, the asteroids, and the comets.
28800	34840	In the way, we have uncovered both new discoveries of the unexpected as well as new perspectives
34840	37120	on the familiar.
37120	42960	Now it is time for perhaps the greatest discoveries of recent times and the strongest change in
42960	45360	our perspective yet.
45360	50720	It is time to leave our solar system behind and to turn our attention to the other stars
50720	52680	in our galaxy.
52680	55900	We want to look for other planetary systems.
55900	57720	Do they exist?
57720	59580	How are they structured?
59580	62680	What kind of planets do they contain?
62680	67780	What we want to know is whether they match what we see in our solar system, whether there
67780	74340	are Earth-like planets there, and ultimately, if there is life.
74340	80140	The goal is to gain a broader perspective on how our solar system fits in with the other
80140	83300	planetary systems in our galaxy.
83300	87180	The main question here is where do we look?
87180	91280	Which stars are likely to harbor extrasolar planets?
91280	96280	And how do we know if planets form at all around other stars?
96280	101360	In the previous lecture, we discussed the formation of our solar system and we saw that
101360	106880	planet formation was coupled to the formation of the star.
106880	113520	Planets formed within a disk of material, the same disk that fed matter onto the protosun.
113520	119500	If that formation sequence is a general one, then looking for stars in formation and looking
119500	124460	for disks around them would be a good place to start.
124460	129820	Finding these disks would at least establish that the conditions for planet formation exist
129820	131460	elsewhere.
131460	136220	In truth, it shows us a good deal more.
136220	141620	We begin on scales much, much, much larger than solar systems, all the way out to the
141620	144480	scales of interstellar clouds.
144480	147560	These are the nebulae within our galaxy.
147560	153680	We will examine first the large-scale conditions within which stars form, and then we'll drill
153680	158280	down to looking at individual stars.
158280	161200	This is the Carina Nebula.
161200	164280	It is a star-forming region within our galaxy.
164280	168160	And the red glow you see here is typical of these regions.
168160	173180	It comes from hydrogen emission at a temperature of about 3,000 degrees.
173180	179420	Now clouds like this glow because stars have recently formed within them.
179420	186700	Only the hottest stars emit enough ultraviolet radiation to heat the gas to make it glow.
186700	190900	Such hot stars only live for tens of millions of years.
190900	197140	So when we see the glowing gas and infer the hot stars, we know that those hot stars formed
197160	201840	recently, and thus this is a star formation region.
201840	207680	We're going to examine this central region of the Carina Nebula, where there are diverse
207680	212640	examples of the various stages of star formation.
212640	217800	This is a Hubble image of the Carina Nebula, and it looks nothing like the large-scale
217800	218800	image.
218800	223400	Well, first of all, this image represents narrow filters that select wavelengths most
223400	225280	important to astronomers.
225280	232460	The red here corresponds to sulfur, the green to hydrogen, and the blue to oxygen emission.
232460	239700	On the right hand side of this image, you can see two knots of recently formed stars.
239700	244140	These star clusters are emitting a good portion of the ultraviolet radiation that makes the
244140	246460	surrounding gas glow.
246460	250460	They also emit very strong stellar winds.
250460	254840	Now you may remember that our sun's wind is the cause of the aurora that we see here
254840	260640	on Earth, and that the sun's wind also presses out into interstellar space and forms the
260640	266080	heliosphere, essentially a wind bubble around the sun.
266080	274080	The winds and radiation of these stars are so immense that they have blown a large bubble
274080	276560	clear across the nebula.
276560	282220	They have excavated this elliptical cavity some 10 light years across.
282220	287580	That's about 5,000 times larger than the sun's heliosphere.
287580	294260	Now down towards the bottom of this cavity, we can see a pillar of dark gas that is strongly
294260	298140	silhouetted against the background of glowing gas.
298140	304100	Dark clouds are dense clouds, and they are important because they are the real sites
304100	306140	of star formation.
306140	312680	A dense cloud at the top of this pillar is resisting the erosion of the stellar emissions.
312680	318320	The rest of the gas in the pillar, well, it may also be dense, or it may just be in the
318320	322440	shadow of the dense cloud at the top.
322440	328120	These pillars are sort of like gaseous fingers in the nebula, and they point directly towards
328120	330960	the nearby hot stars.
330960	336500	This connection between pillars and hot stars can be seen here in the Eagle Nebula.
336500	342660	These hot stars up here at the top are eroding the gas into pillars in several different
342660	344740	directions.
344740	349420	This group of pillars here, just above and to the right of center, are the source of
349420	353300	one of the most famous images in astronomy.
353300	357860	This is Hubble's image of the pillars in the Eagle Nebula.
357860	363560	And this image was really a watershed moment in astronomy, especially for someone like
363560	369920	me who works a lot with the public, because this image captured the imagination like no
369920	371960	other before.
371960	378640	This one picture truly showed the power of this Hubble Space Telescope, and it is for
378640	383560	Hubble sort of what the Earthrise image is for the Apollo missions.
383560	386680	Oh, but I digress.
386680	393020	These pillars, like the one in Karina, are about a light year in length, and they are
393020	399780	nicknamed the Pillars of Creation, because if you look at the top of the tallest pillar,
399780	403300	you can see little finger-like structures.
403300	409220	These fingers are about a thousand astronomical units across, a thousand times the distance
409220	411580	between the Earth and the Sun.
411760	418080	These are dense pockets of gas where individual stars are forming.
418080	424160	Within each finger, a star is about to be born.
424160	429520	Now back inside the Karina Nebula, we see another set of pillars.
429520	433320	This set of pillars has very bright edges around the dark gas.
433320	438800	The ultraviolet radiation is really illuminating the edges of these pillars.
438800	443500	You can also see that there are some fingers in these pillars, especially up here at the
443500	453420	top, but if we zoom in onto this finger, we can see direct evidence of star formation.
453420	459700	These two jets shooting out either side of the top of the finger are coming from the
459700	461860	protostar.
461860	470440	As a disk of material feeds onto the star, some of the energy released is directed perpendicular
470440	475080	to the disk in oppositely directed jets.
475080	480280	The connection can be made even stronger in the next two images.
480280	483320	On the left hand side is a visible light image.
483320	490160	It's an object called L1157, and really you don't see much here.
490160	493140	It's just a dark cloud.
493140	498420	On the right, however, is an infrared image of the central region.
498420	505340	Here you can see bright jets of emission going up and down, as well as a dark disk cutting
505340	507620	across the center.
507620	512380	You can plainly see the relationship between the disk of material in the center and the
512380	514460	jets of emission.
514460	518780	The disk is going around perpendicular to your line of sight, and the jets are shooting
518780	522840	out perpendicular to the disk.
522840	530360	These twin jets of star formation are the signature of what we call Herbig-Hero objects.
530360	533960	And here are four such Herbig-Hero objects.
533960	539720	They are observed in various wavelengths of light, and the scale bar on each image is
539720	542120	200 astronomical units across.
542120	546800	That's about twice the diameter of the Kuiper Belt in our solar system.
546800	552420	You can see in each one of these images that there is a dark disk across the center, and
552420	555180	jets shooting out either side.
555180	559100	This is common in star formation.
559100	565900	The jets are part of the birth pangs of stars, and indicate the energetic nature of the disk
565900	569540	interaction with the protostar.
569540	577280	So we can plainly see that disks of material play an important role in star formation.
577280	585640	Our picture of how the sun formed is the same as how other stars form.
585640	588640	But what about planets?
588640	592840	Can we see planets forming in these disks?
592840	599460	Unfortunately, the nature of these disks, as dense material accreting onto a protostar,
599460	604340	means that we generally see these accretion disks only in silhouette.
604340	612100	If instead we look at stars that have formed recently, but are still quite young, we should
612100	620100	be able to see the dusty debris disks around them, and those we could see in emission.
620100	625200	To see the emission from these disks, we use the technique of coronography.
625200	630280	This is the technique we developed to study the corona of the sun, but now we apply it
630280	632560	to other stars.
632560	634080	We do it like this.
634080	640680	We intentionally put a spot, a dark spot, in a light path of the telescope, and then
640680	647520	we position the telescope so that the star is directly behind this occulting spot.
647520	653060	The light from the star is blocked, and the light from the material around the star can
653060	656020	be seen.
656020	660220	This is one of the earliest dust disks that we found.
660220	663460	It surrounds the star Beta Pictoris.
663460	669620	The light of the star has been blocked, and it would be off the lower left of this image.
669620	675860	This image, when it was released in 1995, showed just how thin the dust disk around a star
675860	676860	is.
677400	683680	It's only about 10 astronomical units thick, and in comparison, it's hundreds of astronomical
683680	686240	units wide.
686240	693720	A later image from 2004 shows the full extent of one of these disks.
693720	697120	This one is around the star AU Microscopy.
697120	703200	It's a small red star, about 12 million years old.
703200	710020	This disk is similarly thin, and stretches about 200 astronomical units across.
710020	714740	If this were our solar system, the extent of the disk that we resolve here would go
714740	720180	from the giant planet region out to well past the Kuiper Belt.
720180	726960	Now it's significant that such disks are found around small red stars, because these
726960	732340	small red stars are the most numerous stars in our galaxy.
732340	738080	If we want to have lots of planetary systems in the galaxy, you've got to have them around
738080	745320	the most common stars, and this shows you that they do exist around red stars.
745320	752600	Now in contrast to those edge on disks around Beta Pic and AU Microscopy, here is an image
752600	754860	of a face on disk.
754860	760320	This one is around the yellow star HD 107 146.
760500	765980	This star is exciting because it's much like the sun, only it's a lot younger, it still
765980	768500	has its disk around it.
768500	773580	The image also shows you just how well coronography can work.
773580	777780	You can see there's just a really neat little hole taken out of the disk.
777780	782700	You just subtract the light of the star, and poof, the disk appears.
782700	787420	It's really not quite that easy, but the results are impressive.
787420	792920	This star is a bit further away than the stars that we previously looked at, and so we can't
792920	799880	see down into the planetary region, but we do find a full disk of dust out to a hundred
799880	806400	astronomical units, and we can even see the density decrease with radius.
806400	811320	As you look further and further out in this disk, you can see the density slowly falls
811320	812320	off.
812320	816640	Remember, as we talked about for the sun, we expect density gradients in these disks
816660	819060	around stars.
819060	827340	Now this is great, but what we really want to see is evidence of planet formation.
827340	835860	Around the star HR 4796A, we see a ring instead of a disk.
835860	840940	This ring is about 50 astronomical units across, and I was very excited to see this
840940	843740	ring back in 1999.
843740	848440	It screamed to me, oh, oh, Kuiper Belt around another star.
848440	854360	We were just filling out the Kuiper Belt in our own solar system, and here we are seeing
854360	859760	one, or what looked a lot like one, around another star.
859760	865640	This is a similar structure to what we were just discovering nearby.
865640	870960	And later I learned that that's important, but what's even more important is not the
870980	880060	ring, but the fact that it has an empty interior, because that suggests that planets have formed
880060	885820	and swept up all of the interior dust.
885820	891460	A really detailed ring observation can be seen around the star Fomalot.
891460	897420	And here is a wonderful image of it, although you'll notice there are a lot of radial striations
897420	903160	here, and that's due to effects of subtracting out the light of the star.
903160	908080	What's intriguing here is not the effects of the coronography, but the fact that the
908080	911280	ring is off-center.
911280	913540	We put some annotations on this image.
913540	918200	You can see this is the position of the star, it's at the center of the coronagraphic mask,
918200	923720	but the ring center is offset from that over here.
923720	931580	This implies that the ring is not a circle, instead it's an ellipse.
931580	933620	And how do you get an elliptical ring?
933620	942340	Well, we believe that the elliptical ring is due to interaction with a planet.
942340	948300	We see evidence for disk and planet interactions in many places.
948300	957720	The disk around this star, and this star's phone number is HD15115, is definitely lopsided.
957720	962720	You can see that the emission extends much further out to the right than it does to the
962720	964640	left in this image.
964640	971160	Now again, we can model this with an elliptical disk that has been perturbed by a planet.
971160	976280	But I have to caution you, there are also other models that can fit.
976280	981380	The other model that can fit is illustrated by this image.
981380	983900	Here we're back to our friend Beta Pictoris.
983900	987580	This is a different observation of Beta Pictoris.
987580	992620	And again, you can see the disk here, but if you look out at the edge of the disk, you
992620	994740	can see these four clumps.
994740	999100	They're marked A, B, C, and D in the image.
999100	1005100	We have clumping, or rings within this disk, that need to be explained.
1005120	1011880	And on the right is a computer model, which can produce that clumping as these rings.
1011880	1016200	And the reason for the production of these rings in this computer model is not due to
1016200	1021640	a planet within the disk, but rather due to a passing star.
1021640	1027800	The star makes a close pass by Beta Pict, Beta Pict is in a region where there are relatively
1027820	1034820	close stars and pulls the material out of the disk and forms these rings.
1035580	1042580	So this is a small caution that we shouldn't get overzealous in trying to see planets everywhere,
1043940	1049300	because there are other explanations that can explain these observations.
1049300	1056060	However, in the case of Beta Pict, we have other evidence that tells us we probably are
1056200	1058760	seeing planets.
1058760	1062920	Here are two more observations of Beta Pict from Hubble.
1062920	1068000	The top one shows the broad disk, and you can see the lopsidedness here.
1068000	1072680	On the left hand side, you can see where it stretches out, and this is where the clumps
1072680	1074480	in the disk were found.
1074480	1078160	And on the right hand side, you can see it doesn't stretch out quite as far, and that
1078160	1083200	there's a little bit of lopsidedness on large scales, and this was what was being explained
1083220	1086100	by the passage of the star.
1086100	1092600	Now the bottom image is a higher resolution one, and this covers the planetary scales
1092600	1095500	out to the Kuiper Belt scales, so you can see the drawing of the solar system at the
1095500	1097940	bottom for comparison.
1097940	1103300	When we study this disk in even greater detail, we find clumping.
1103300	1109180	There are clumps in here that look like planets in formation, or at least gravitational disturbances
1109180	1112580	caused by planets that have already formed.
1112960	1118840	The clumps are found at 65 AU, which would be outside of a Kuiper Belt in our solar system,
1118840	1124840	40 AU, smack dab on where the Kuiper Belt is in our solar system, and 15 AU, which is
1124840	1128760	around the orbit of Uranus in our solar system.
1128760	1135440	Now evidence of these as yet unseen planets is seen in this image, and here you can see
1135440	1141840	that Beta Pict has both a primary disk as well as a secondary disk, a very small secondary
1141860	1144340	disk in towards the center.
1144340	1151340	And this secondary disk is suggested of a giant planet in a tilted orbit.
1151460	1157660	This secondary disk is tilted by about 4 to 5 degrees from the primary disk.
1157660	1164340	So this is very exciting, because Beta Pict is about 20 million years old, which would
1164340	1170020	be prime time for either planets to be forming or to have already formed.
1170200	1176200	This provides powerful evidence that these dust disks, which we see around many, many
1176200	1181240	stars, are associated with planet formation.
1181240	1187280	The story that I told you about how the solar system formed, well it appears that it's
1187280	1193920	supported by what we see elsewhere in the galaxy.
1193920	1200920	The last topic I want to cover today is a cautionary tale for disk and planet formation.
1200980	1204860	It takes place within the Orion constellation.
1204860	1209520	Now I'm sure many of you are familiar with the constellation of Orion, it's a wonderful
1209520	1214900	one to observe on a winter evening, late in January in the evening, it's just hanging
1214900	1218020	up there right up high in the south.
1218020	1223800	And these three stars across the center are Orion's belt.
1223800	1228600	And the three stars going down from its belt are his sword.
1228600	1235600	However, the middle star in his sword is not really a star, it is the magnificent Orion
1237640	1241560	Nebula, or as they used to call it, the Great Nebula in Orion.
1241560	1244200	I think it's a great name for it.
1244200	1250860	This is one of the closest star-forming regions and certainly the best studied.
1250860	1255980	On its largest scales, it has a bowl-shaped structure.
1255980	1260500	This has been carved out by hot stars, like what we saw in Karina.
1260500	1265320	The energetic emissions of these hot stars have blown away the gas or evaporated the
1265320	1268860	gas to create this bowl-shaped structure.
1268860	1273780	Here the hot stars, instead of being located at the center of the bubble, are actually
1273800	1279720	located up at the top of the bowl, and this region is called the trapezium.
1279720	1284540	Let's zoom in on the trapezium, and you can see the brightest emission is located right
1284540	1291380	up at the top in this fairly bright structure here, and it's due to the four hot stars in
1291380	1293480	the center.
1293480	1300160	The Orion Nebula is what we call a blister nebula, because it really is on the skin of
1300160	1305680	a much larger dark cloud that's lying behind.
1305680	1312280	As a nearby star-forming region, we can see protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula,
1312280	1315720	and we can see them in great detail.
1315720	1323280	Here is an image of four such protoplanetary disks, and we can see what we saw previously,
1323280	1331480	these dark disks, but we also see the newborn stars peeking through.
1331480	1336680	Here we can see the gas and dust flowing on, well we can't really see them flowing on,
1336680	1341080	we can see the gas and dust, imagine them flowing on to these new stars, and they have
1341080	1343320	just turned on.
1343320	1345720	These are baby pictures.
1345720	1351520	These are stars still in their stellar nurseries, they're only about two million years old.
1352520	1360120	Now, we can also see in the Terpezium region the evidence of how strong the stellar winds
1360120	1362280	from these hot stars are.
1362280	1366440	Now here are the hot stars in the center, and we're going to examine this star way down
1366440	1368920	here in the lower right.
1368920	1374120	Notice how far away this star is from the central hot star.
1374120	1379200	We look at this image, of the image of this star, this star is LL Orionis.
1379240	1385960	The winds from the hot stars are so strong that they create a bow shock in the gas around
1385960	1388000	the star.
1388000	1394200	Such strong winds which reach all the way across this nebula could wreak havoc on planetary
1394200	1397120	systems forming nearby.
1397120	1401840	Let's take a closer look at that Terpezium region.
1401840	1406960	Here you can see the four stars whose trapezoidal arrangement gives the region its name, and
1406960	1413960	the brightest one here towards the center is Theta 1 Orionis C, and it is the source
1413960	1421520	of most of the emitted energy that causes the gas of the Orion Nebula to glow.
1421520	1428520	If you look here in the lower left, you can notice this tadpole shaped object.
1428520	1436560	Its tail points away from Theta 1 C, and there are several more of these tadpole shaped objects
1436560	1439040	all across this image.
1439040	1444800	Each one of them whose tail point away from the hottest star.
1444800	1445800	What's going on here?
1445800	1450320	You've got these bright heads to these tadpole shaped things, and then these sort of dark
1450320	1453320	tails swooping away.
1453320	1463480	Well, the width of the heads of these tadpoles is several hundred astronomical units across.
1463480	1467080	This is the scale of planetary systems.
1467080	1474560	The gas that is collapsing to form these systems is being blown away by the wind from Theta
1474560	1480960	1 C. It's swooshing back and creating a tail behind it.
1480960	1487360	So if you try to form planets near a massive star, you not only have to contend with the
1487360	1492080	emission from the protostar, remember that the protostar emissions start to evaporate
1492080	1497160	the disk on time scales of tens of millions of years, so you've got to form your planets
1497160	1504720	quickly and avoid the radiation of the protostar, but in this region, you also have to deal
1504720	1509320	with an external wind from the nearby massive star.
1509320	1516480	And there is the chance that the gas and dust could be ablated away before planets have
1516480	1519720	enough time to form.
1519720	1526000	Here is an incredible movie that takes you on a flight through the trapezium and illustrates
1526000	1527640	what's going on.
1527640	1531640	Now this model is not an artist's imagination.
1531640	1536320	The three dimensional shape of the nebula and the star positions have been modeled as
1536320	1538120	accurately as possible.
1538120	1542840	So as we fly into the Orion Nebula, you can see the region on the left called the bright
1542840	1547720	bar, and then we enter into the very energetic region.
1547720	1554680	You can see the stars around Theta 1c in the center, and all of these tadpole shaped objects
1554680	1559520	with their tails pointing away from it.
1559520	1564720	You can also see sort of the potato chip structure of the blister nebula.
1564720	1570000	Now this tadpole here is fictitious, it was just added for illustration, so that we could
1570000	1576620	peel back the gas around it, and perhaps we would find a disk, and we would find jets
1576620	1581720	shooting off from the disk, and we would see planet formation in progress.
1581720	1587680	We don't know if planet formation is really in progress within these tadpoles, or if it's
1587680	1590700	adversely affected by the wind.
1590700	1595500	But we do see these tails in other star forming regions.
1595500	1600420	Here is one in a region called Ic 1396.
1600420	1604780	On the right hand side you can see the hot massive star, and in the center you can see
1604780	1611660	the small star being ablated away, and the tail of dust swooping off to the left.
1611660	1617180	I should mention this is an infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and in this
1617180	1623380	image we can see the tail stretching for half a light year or more.
1623380	1629100	Remember that one light year is as long as the famous pillar in the Eagle Nebula, and
1629260	1637180	here we have the dust from a star that's forming being swooped back to about the same distance.
1637180	1643060	In the Karina Nebula we find this beautiful collection of dark clouds.
1643060	1648380	Now I call this the archipelago, because it resembles islands in the ocean.
1648380	1655420	But these are dense clouds of gas immersed in an ocean of energetic radiation.
1655420	1661380	The radiation from the hot young stars in the Karina Nebula is slowly ionizing the gas
1661380	1663940	and eating away at the edge of the clouds.
1663940	1670060	This is what we call an ionization front, and it's a race of gravity trying to collapse
1670060	1676860	and form stars versus the ionization trying to get rid of the gas to see whether stars
1676860	1683380	and planets can form before the clouds are photo evaporated away.
1683540	1689020	Now we can see what we can give us, and star formation take it away.
1689020	1695620	Overall, what we have learned is that the disks around young stars are common.
1695620	1698780	We can see them in silhouette in herbig harrow objects.
1698780	1702500	We can see the infrared emission from dusty debris disks.
1702500	1708780	We can see structures in the disk resembling Kuiper belts, and providing evidence of planet
1708780	1710860	interaction.
1710860	1716780	So if disks are common, then planets should be common.
1716780	1720340	We now need to go out and find them.
1720340	1727380	And that is the topic of the next lecture, taking on the incredible observational challenge
1727380	1730380	of finding planets around other stars.
1730380	1731020	I'll see you then.
