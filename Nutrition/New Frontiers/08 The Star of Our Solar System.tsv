0	20920	How many stars can you see in the night sky?
20920	26380	When you look up without a telescope, how many do you think you can see?
26380	31140	Most folks will answer millions of stars, because intellectually they know there really
31140	34380	are millions and millions of stars out there.
34380	41100	But if you actually went and looked and tried to estimate, what would you find?
41100	44300	Of course it would depend upon where you were looking.
44300	49020	When I was in New York City, we used to do a star party in Central Park, and really we
49020	51780	could only see a few hundred stars.
51780	56540	I've also done star parties at Bryce Canyon National Park, and there were too many stars
56540	58260	to count.
58260	63620	The truth is that the human eye can see about 6,000 stars.
63620	67700	And that's looking at stars all over the globe, since you can really only see about half the
67700	73940	sky at one time, you really can only see just a few thousand stars.
73940	81020	This is one such star field, it features the constellation Orion, and it has two very prominent
81460	82860	giant stars.
82860	88100	The shoulder of Orion, this red star here, is called Betelgeuse, it's a red supergiant
88100	94540	star, and the knee of Orion is Rigel, it's a blue supergiant star.
94540	99260	These are stars in their old age, they're on their way to die, and of course they're
99260	105420	going to die by a very spectacular way, a supernova explosion.
105420	111020	On the left side of this image, this bright star over here, is Sirius.
111020	113660	It's the brightest star in the night sky.
113660	117900	And it's not an old age star, it's actually a middle age star.
117900	121500	It's part of what we call the main sequence.
121500	125500	These are stars that are producing energy in what we call the normal fashion.
125500	131460	It's a stable phase that lasts for many stars billions of years.
131460	137700	Stars have a composition of about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium.
137700	142240	The reason for this is simply those are proportions made in the Big Bang.
142240	147500	In the Big Bang, the nucleus synthesis, as it forges the elements, creates three quarters
147500	152740	hydrogen by mass and 25% helium by mass.
152740	158460	Stars in the main sequence are turning hydrogen into helium, and these are the majority of
158460	161900	the stars that you'll see on the night sky.
161900	164900	Our sun is no exception.
164900	170860	It is part of the main sequence, but it's rather an unexceptional main sequence star.
170860	173460	By mass, it's not the biggest.
173460	179100	The biggest stars are about 100 times the mass of our sun, and it's not the smallest.
179100	185020	Our sun is about 14 times more massive than the smallest main sequence stars.
185020	191100	In its energy output, or what we astronomers call luminosity, the brightest stars have
191100	196860	a luminosity of a factor of one million greater than our sun, and the faintest are about one
196860	200820	one-thousandth the luminosity of our sun.
200820	207060	The temperature range of stars goes from about 2,000 degrees on the low end to about 50,000
207060	209420	degrees on the upper end.
209420	214580	Our sun has a temperature of about 5,500 degrees.
214580	220540	This is toward the lower end, and you might be thinking, our sun is below average, but
220540	227380	that's actually a good thing, because the most massive stars have a model of live fast,
227380	230420	die young, and leave a good looking corpse.
230420	234700	The corpse, of course, being those supernova remnants produced by those explosions that
234700	237380	I talked about earlier.
237380	243740	These most massive stars will only live for about 50 million years, not long enough for
243740	246700	life to develop on planets around them.
246700	253860	Our sun is about 4.6 billion years into an approximately 12 billion year lifetime, and
253860	258700	as we are evidence, it's long enough for life to develop around it.
258700	265500	Now, the most important thing about the sun is that it is our star.
265500	272500	Every other star is more than 250,000 times further away than our sun.
272500	277380	That means that the sun is the only one in which we can see detailed structure, and we
277380	283700	use it as a template for understanding all stars in the universe.
283700	289340	For our solar system, the sun can be thought of as the sine qua non, that without which
289340	296300	it doesn't exist, because it contains 99.9% of the mass in the solar system.
296300	302040	Understanding revolves around the sun, both metaphorically and literally, and the energy
302040	306580	produced by the sun enables life here on Earth.
306580	310900	If something's that important, well, I think we ought to know something about it.
310900	314220	So let's take a look at the sun's structure.
314220	317660	We'll start with the outer layers, its atmosphere.
317660	323140	There are three layers of the atmosphere that I will discuss, the photosphere, the chromosphere,
323140	324860	and the corona.
324860	327580	The photosphere is the visible surface of the sun.
327580	332540	Now the sun doesn't have a solid surface, but it does go through a very strong pressure
332540	333540	drop.
333540	339980	It goes from 10,000 times the atmospheric pressure of Earth down to 110,000th the atmospheric
339980	344220	pressure of Earth over a very small radius of the sun.
344220	346740	And that is where the surface of the sun is.
346740	351280	As I said before, it's about 5,500 degrees Celsius.
351280	354740	That is hot enough to melt any known substance.
354740	359580	It is also hot enough that the gas becomes a plasma.
359580	364380	Atoms are composed of an atomic nucleus and an electron cloud.
364380	369580	And when you heat them up, the electrons become dissociated with the atoms.
369580	374820	In a plasma, all of the electrons have become totally dissociated from all their atoms.
374820	382060	And what you've got is a mixture of atomic nuclei and electrons not attached to any particular
382060	384900	atomic nucleus running all around.
384900	387820	They're totally dissociated.
387820	392940	This is an image of the photosphere of the sun, and you can see it looks relatively calm.
392940	396060	It's a sort of smooth yellow ball.
396060	399140	You can also see that it has some freckles on it.
399140	402140	These freckles are called sunspots.
402140	408260	This is a close-up of the sunspot, and this has sort of the classic sunspot circular shape.
408260	411620	Looks a little bit like the iris of an eye.
411620	416660	Even a small sunspot is rather large on human scales.
416660	422820	If I put it up next to our planet, you can see that even a small sunspot is about the
422820	426460	size of our entire planet.
426460	429780	Some sunspots are much, much larger.
429780	434380	Here's a sunspot group that shows a wonderful spiral pattern, rather rare to find one with
434380	440820	a spiral pattern, and it is many times larger than our planet.
440820	445460	These sunspots are islands of intense magnetic fields.
445460	450860	They appear dark, not because they are not shining, but just because they are slightly
450860	453740	cooler than the surrounding photosphere.
453740	455540	They are still very, very bright.
455540	462100	It is just the contrast between the much brighter region around them and the material inside
462100	465460	the sunspot that makes them appear dark.
465460	469420	These sunspot groups can last for months.
469420	475220	Much smaller, and also shorter lived, are granules, which is fine structure on the surface
475220	477220	of the photosphere.
477220	482780	If I look in closer to the sun, you'll see a pattern like this.
482780	488100	These individual cells are the granules, and there are millions of them across the surface
488100	490060	of the sun.
490060	495900	Each of these granules is approximately 1,000 kilometers across, and what they are are the
495900	501620	tops of columns of material moving up from the interior of the sun, radiating their energy
501620	505260	away, and then flowing back down.
505260	511020	Each of these granules lasts for only about 10 minutes, so there are millions of them.
511020	515020	They regenerate themselves on the order of 10 minutes.
515020	521660	The surface of the sun is actually a very active place.
521660	528300	One of the photosphere is the chromosphere, and traditionally the chromosphere was a colored
528300	533220	portion of the sun that you could see during a total solar eclipse.
533220	535420	Here's an example of that.
535420	540580	This is a total solar eclipse when the moon has blocked out the full disc of the sun,
540580	547180	and you see that tiny little red region just along the edge of the moon?
547180	550420	That was traditionally identified as the chromosphere.
550420	554340	But our modern observations have sort of redefined the chromosphere.
554340	557600	We have the chromosphere that extends for about 1,000 kilometers above the surface of
557600	558760	the sun.
558760	563220	We also have something we call the transition region, which extends for another 100 kilometers
563220	565300	above that.
565300	569900	In this region, the temperature of the sun rises dramatically.
569900	578020	It goes from 10,000 degrees to a million degrees, and this is absolutely crazy, because if the
578380	582820	energy is being released from the sun at the photosphere, everything should be cooling
582820	583820	down.
583820	588340	If the energy is gone, here, everything should be cooling down as you get further out.
588340	591820	Instead, the energy is increasing.
591820	594620	Where is this energy coming from?
594620	602700	Well, the answer that we found so far is that it's coming from a structure called spikules.
602700	607740	This is an image of some spikules on the surface of the sun, and it's taken in ultraviolet
607780	609380	radiation.
609380	612500	You can see these very thin jets of gas.
612500	619000	They only last for about 5 minutes, and the energy is being transported from the photosphere
619000	623940	up through the chromosphere and transition region to the corona.
623940	629740	The energy is leaking out from the interior, it's creating a shockwave in the chromosphere,
629740	632180	and it's driving these spikules.
632180	638860	There's a wonderful little movie of these spikules.
638860	644820	This was taken by the Stereo spacecraft, and in it you can see these very fine spikules
644820	647140	flitting in and flitting out.
647140	653000	This is an image taken every 10 minutes for about one day of spikule activity.
653000	661000	It's very high temperature gas that's shooting up through the chromosphere.
661000	665320	But not all gas above the chromosphere is hot.
665320	669600	There are also some streamers of cooler gas that appear in.
669600	674280	And in this image, taken in hydrogen alpha, a specific wavelength emitted by hydrogen
674280	678580	atoms, you can see this very long dark thing here.
678580	685040	This is called a filament, and if I zoom in on it, what this filament is, is gas that
685040	690960	is cooler than the material behind it, and shows up dark, and it's being held alive
690960	695000	off above the photosphere by magnetic loops.
695000	700240	And these filaments can last above the chromosphere for several weeks.
700240	705400	They appear dark here when they're viewed against the sun, but if they are seen on the
705400	711560	limb, as in this image, you can see they are actually quite bright.
711560	714520	These are called prominences.
714520	718160	Prominences and filaments are really the same phenomenon.
718160	721520	One is seen against the disk of the sun and appears dark.
721520	725980	One is seen against the background sky and appears bright.
725980	730040	The third region of the sun's atmosphere is called the corona.
730040	736960	This is a very hot, very low density region, and its temperature is a few million degrees.
736960	742200	We really only see the corona well in ultraviolet and X-ray emissions.
742200	745520	Its pressure is extremely low.
745520	751220	It's down to one 10 billionth of Earth's atmospheric pressure.
751220	758160	We can see the corona with our own eye during total solar eclipses.
758160	763720	This is an image of a total solar eclipse, and you can see all these streamers coming
763720	767000	out on either side of the sun are part of the corona.
767000	773320	It's a rather wispy region, and that extends to several solar radii.
773320	780680	The material here is flowing outward, and eventually becomes the solar wind.
780680	785920	The physics of the corona is dominated by magnetic fields, and that's in contrast to
785920	789640	the photosphere and the chromosphere where gravity dominates.
789640	795600	When you saw those spikeules created, they fell back due to gravity.
795600	800840	Everything in the corona is generally held up by magnetic fields or pushed out by magnetic
800840	802280	fields.
802280	809200	You can see that in this image, where I show you coronal loops taken in the ultraviolet.
809200	815680	The plasma here, incredibly heated plasma, is arching high into the corona.
815680	823200	It's heated at the base and streaming up through the magnetic fields back down to the sun through
823200	826640	about half a million kilometers.
826640	832320	The corona is also the site of many storms and eruptions, but we're not going to discuss
832320	833800	those today.
833800	836280	Those are part of a later lecture.
836280	842840	So now we're going to turn inward and look at the interior structure of the sun.
842840	846600	The internal structure of the sun also has three layers.
846600	851920	There's the core, there's the radiative zone, and there's the convective zone.
851920	856880	Each layer is defined by how it transports energy.
856880	862160	To understand this a little bit, you have to get down the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium.
862160	868040	And it's not a difficult concept, it's really just the balance of forces.
868040	871600	Gravity is the major force pulling down on the sun.
871600	878360	The sun is incredibly massive and all that mass presses down towards the center and creates
878360	882460	a huge force pushing towards the core.
882460	883960	What pushes back?
883960	886480	Well, thermal pressure.
886480	890520	When you heat something up, it creates a pressure.
890520	895560	You may remember the ideal gas law from your chemistry courses in high school.
895560	899400	Increase the temperature, you increase the pressure.
899400	902880	This is the balance going on in the interior of the sun.
902880	907520	Gravity pushing down, thermal pressure pushing out.
907560	910880	We also have to think about heat transfer.
910880	917240	And there are three ways that you transfer heat, conduction, radiation, and convection.
917240	919960	And you can understand all of those by thinking about your stove.
919960	925920	If you've ever touched the burner on the stove and gotten a burn, that's conduction.
925920	929320	When heat flows directly from one substance to the next.
929320	934600	If you just hold your hand above the burner and you can feel the heat radiating off it,
934600	936520	that's radiation.
936520	941680	If instead you put a pot of water on your stove and you bring it to just before a boil,
941680	947720	where you can see the water roiling, rolling, it's heated at the bottom, rises to the top
947720	951920	and releases that heat, that's convection.
951920	955560	So this is the internal structure of the sun.
955560	957320	It basically is very simple.
957320	960240	The core occupies the inner 20%.
960240	967520	The radiative zone goes out to 70% and the convective zone is the last 30%.
967520	971680	In the core is where the sun does all of its energy generation.
971680	976200	It's at a temperature of 15 million degrees.
976200	981080	It contains about half the mass of the sun in that small core.
981080	987720	It creates all the energy that then diffuses out through the other zones of the sun.
987720	994520	The radiative zone is a relatively calm region because the energy is transported by photons.
994520	997580	It is in hydrostatic equilibrium.
997580	1001600	So material isn't moving back and forth for the radiative zone.
1001600	1005000	Just the energy is flowing through the radiative zone.
1005000	1011440	And that energy takes tens of thousands of years to cross the radiative zone.
1011440	1012440	Why?
1012440	1017480	Well, because the photons are doing what we call a random walk, the photons that are
1017480	1021760	emitted from the core travel out and they're quickly absorbed.
1021760	1025080	And then they are remitted in a random direction and they're quickly absorbed.
1025080	1029080	And they're remitted and absorbed and remitted and absorbed and remitted and absorbed.
1029080	1035360	And they go off in these random directions and slowly, slowly diffuse through the radiative
1035360	1036760	zone.
1036760	1044000	I've seen estimates that say it takes between 30,000 years to 170,000 years for a photon
1044080	1047800	to travel across the radiative zone.
1047800	1052280	In the radiative zone, the temperature starts out at the 15 million degrees of the core
1052280	1056920	and cools down to about 2 million degrees.
1056920	1060600	On top of the radiative zone is the convective zone.
1060600	1064960	And this, in contrast, is a very turbulent region.
1064960	1070320	Here is where movement of the gas transports the energy.
1070320	1073920	At the top of the radiative zone, the gas heats up.
1073920	1077480	That heated gas rises to the surface of the sun.
1077480	1082240	It cools by radiating the photosphere and then cycles back down.
1082240	1086200	It takes about 10 days to rise to the surface.
1086200	1090920	Quite a contrast to the tens of thousands of years it takes to cross the radiative zone
1090920	1095080	to get across the convective zone in a little over a week.
1095080	1099480	The convective zone is filled with large convective cells, but this is not what we see in the
1099520	1100920	photosphere.
1100920	1104720	At the photosphere, we see the tops of much smaller columns.
1104720	1108600	These are the granules that I showed you earlier.
1108600	1113960	In the convective zone, the temperature of the sun drops strongly.
1113960	1118760	Here is a plot of the temperature profile of the sun's interior.
1118760	1123560	And starting on the right, you can see it's very hot, the 15 million degrees in the core.
1123560	1129640	It cools slowly across the radiative zone, and then it cools very, very quickly down
1129640	1134560	to the 5,500 degrees in the convective zone.
1134560	1137880	This shows you the efficiency of convection.
1137880	1142360	It's a very efficient process for getting rid of heat.
1142360	1147440	It also shows you that the convective zone is actually quite large, even though it only
1147440	1150360	is the outer 30% of the sun.
1150360	1154120	It contains about two thirds of the sun's volume.
1154120	1158600	That helps it being a very efficient way of transporting heat.
1158600	1163360	Now you might be thinking to yourself, that's a nice story.
1163360	1166560	It's sure you know exactly what's going on inside the sun.
1166560	1169400	Do you have any proof of it?
1169400	1173240	And previously, I would have had to wave my hands and say, well, we've got these wonderful
1173240	1179320	hydrostatic equilibrium models, all this theoretical stuff, but I don't have to anymore.
1179320	1185200	In the last decade or two, we have a technique called helioseismology that allows us to look
1185200	1188640	into the interior of the sun.
1188640	1192040	Now you probably have encountered Doppler shift.
1192040	1197280	Doppler shift is a change in wavelength due to motion.
1197280	1202640	You're familiar with it when a car goes by, and it has a high pitch sound as it's approaching,
1202640	1204520	and a low pitch sound as it's receding.
1204520	1208360	It goes, nyeeerrrr.
1208360	1213160	That's Doppler shift because the sound of the car, the motion changes the sound of the
1213160	1214480	car as it goes past you.
1214480	1216800	As it's approaching you, it goes up.
1216800	1220400	As it's going away from you, it goes down.
1220400	1226200	Those same sort of acoustical waves, sound waves, occur inside the sun.
1226200	1232240	They oscillate the interior of the sun, and they cause the surface to pulsate.
1232240	1237800	We can measure those pulsations by seeing Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the
1237800	1239160	sun.
1239160	1244160	If you look at those spectral lines, those spectral lines will pulsate back and forth
1244160	1249320	with the Doppler motion of these sound waves.
1249320	1252920	Here's an image of a single sound wave mode.
1252920	1257680	This is a mode that is pulsating throughout the entire sun, and the receding portions
1257680	1262680	of the sun are in red, and the approaching parts are in blue.
1262680	1267060	And this wave here oscillates on a period of about five minutes.
1267060	1273380	There are millions of other waves that can be detected by a group known as the Global
1273380	1275920	Oscillation Network Group.
1275920	1283680	This is a collaboration of solar observatories spaced evenly across the globe so that one
1283680	1289120	of them is always in daylight and is always studying the sun.
1289120	1295080	We have a large heliocosismology consortium that is continuously studying the sun and
1295080	1298760	determining all of these oscillation periods.
1298760	1303000	As I said, there are millions of wavelengths that they have found, each with a different
1303000	1306000	size scale, and a different period.
1306000	1309960	And when you've got different wavelengths, they will penetrate to different depths within
1309960	1316860	the sun, and the varying strength of those wavelengths will enable us to determine the
1316860	1318800	sun's internal structure.
1318800	1324200	So we are extremely confident about that story I just told you about the sun's internal structure,
1324200	1328640	because finally we have actually measured it.
1328640	1334280	One little note, the sound waves that we talk about in this heliocosismology, they're usually
1334280	1338240	damped at the photosphere, and you need that in order for oscillations.
1338240	1346160	You need to have a harmonic between two points, but sometimes those sound waves leak through,
1346160	1351520	and that is the leakage of energy that powers the spikeules.
1351520	1357680	But the real energy of the sun is down in the core, and that's where nuclear fusion
1357680	1359400	occurs.
1359400	1361880	There are extreme conditions in the core.
1361880	1365320	As I said, the temperature is 15 million degrees.
1365320	1370440	The pressure is 200 million times that of Earth's atmosphere.
1370440	1375800	The density is 13 times that of lead.
1375800	1380840	In those extreme conditions, you could have nuclear fusion.
1380840	1385560	Nuclear fusion goes by a process we call the proton-proton chain.
1385560	1389680	In this diagram, we show you the basics of the proton-proton chain.
1389680	1395520	First, two protons, or you want to think of them as hydrogen nuclei, join together and
1395520	1398120	become a deuterium nucleus.
1398120	1404720	Then that deuterium nucleus is smashed by another proton, and you get a helium-3 nucleus.
1404720	1410680	When two helium-3 nuclei smash together, you get a helium-4 nucleus, or a normal helium
1410680	1414360	nucleus, and two protons come off.
1414360	1419720	The basic result is that four protons go into the reaction, and one helium nucleus
1419720	1421680	comes out.
1421680	1428120	And in that process, occurring at these incredible temperatures, incredible pressures, you can
1428120	1432280	convert mass to energy.
1432280	1440760	This comes through the famous equation E equals MC squared, where E is energy, M is mass, and
1440760	1443640	C is the speed of light squared.
1443640	1450520	You see the mass of the four protons going in, and the mass of the helium nucleus coming
1450520	1454600	out is slightly different.
1454600	1460920	The protons weigh slightly more than the helium nucleus.
1460920	1471600	The difference in energy is converted into energy via E equals MC squared.
1471600	1479960	At a rate 7% of the mass going into the reaction comes out as pure energy.
1479960	1488360	The sun shines because it is turning mass into energy at a rate of 5 million tons every
1488360	1490480	second.
1490480	1496520	I'm not talking about 5 million tons of protons, I'm talking 5 million tons as that 0.7% that's
1496520	1500320	being removed from the universe every single second.
1501160	1502440	Now that's going to scare you.
1502440	1507760	Wait a minute, how is the sun going to last long with that rate of energy burning?
1507760	1514160	Don't worry, the sun is about a billion, billion, billion tons.
1514160	1517400	So it's going to last for a little bit longer.
1517400	1522840	Matter of fact, we estimate that about 37% of the hydrogen in the core has been converted
1522840	1526400	to helium by this time.
1526400	1533560	In the nuclear process, you not only create energy, you also give off these ghostly particles
1533560	1536200	called neutrinos.
1536200	1541360	Neutrinos are a particle that don't interact with just about anything.
1541360	1548440	There are right now probably a billion neutrinos passing through my body and I don't know it.
1548440	1555760	They don't interact with matter at all, but sometimes you can get them to interact.
1555760	1561560	We have neutrino telescopes and the original neutrino telescope was basically a swimming
1561560	1564360	pool filled with chlorine.
1564360	1570280	And once in a great while, about once per day, a neutrino would interact with a chlorine
1570280	1574200	atom and turn it into an argon atom.
1574200	1579880	And to use this neutrino telescope, what they did is they filtered the chlorine and searched
1579880	1585400	for those elusive atoms of argon indicating an interaction with neutrino.
1585400	1591240	And in that manner, we're able to measure neutrino flux from the sun.
1591240	1597640	We have measured it and we do have evidence of the nuclear fusion processes going on in
1597640	1599720	the core of the sun.
1599720	1603800	So that is the structure of our star.
1603800	1607680	And it is also the structure of every other star.
1607680	1615600	A star may be described as a gravitationally confined nuclear fusion reactor.
1615600	1619800	Gravity provides the force that pushes down.
1619800	1625960	Nuclear fusion provides the temperature that creates the pressure that pushes back.
1625960	1630320	This is the same physical process that occurs in all stars.
1630320	1637880	For a fact, the main sequence is defined by a star's undergoing hydrogen fusion.
1637880	1643440	The energy is generated in the core and it very slowly diffuses through the radiative
1643440	1649440	zone and it's relatively quickly transported through the convective zone, it's radiated
1649440	1655480	from the photosphere, and it takes about eight minutes to reach Earth.
1655480	1661040	The time scale from when the energy is generated to when we see it on Earth could be as long
1661040	1664480	as about 170,000 years.
1664480	1669080	And if that's true, I've got an interesting thought for you.
1669080	1674260	This image is of the small Magellanic cloud.
1674260	1678480	It is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way galaxy.
1678480	1683640	And its distance is 170,000 light years away.
1683640	1693880	That means the light from the small Magellanic cloud has taken 170,000 years to reach us.
1693880	1700640	That is the same amount of time that the energy has taken in coming to us from the Sun.
1700640	1707480	The energy from our nearest star reaches us in the same amount of time as the light from
1707480	1711560	one of our satellite galaxies.
1711560	1717320	The temperature in the Sun decreases from the core to the surface and then increases
1717320	1719480	into the atmosphere.
1719480	1726400	The magnetic fields of the Sun provide enormous activity that drive that temperature increase
1726400	1733160	and even more in the atmosphere create explosions and huge coronal mass ejections.
1733160	1738560	But we're not going to get into those today, we'll get those in a later lecture on Solar
1738560	1743320	Storms and we'll just leave the story of the Sun there for now.
1743320	1744760	We'll see you next time, take care.
