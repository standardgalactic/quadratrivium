0	21400	Philosophers discuss truth and beauty.
21400	25040	Scientists discuss hypothesis and theory.
25040	30600	What happens in science when you have two competing hypotheses?
30600	33920	Then truth and beauty become part of science.
33920	36240	And which is more important?
36240	42760	And in science, how would you measure the truth or beauty of a hypothesis?
42760	47200	These ideas come into play as we look at the next perspective on the solar system, the
47200	50960	heliocentric hypothesis of Copernicus.
50960	55520	Heliocentric meaning sun-centered, helio being a root word for sun.
55520	60840	You'll notice that I said hypothesis and not fact, because I want to examine it in its
60840	62960	historical setting.
62960	67520	Although we now know that this is the correct model of the solar system, for about a hundred
67520	72880	years after it was proposed, it was still just a beautiful hypothesis.
72880	78400	Even one of science's greatest minds could not prove its truth.
78400	82720	The geocentric model had been successful for more than a thousand years, and it was
82720	87760	based on three geometric variations on circular motion.
87760	93760	If we have circular motion like this here, we would have uniform motion around a circle.
93760	99160	The eccentric circle was a variation where you viewed uniform circular motion, but from
99160	101440	a point off-center.
101440	107120	Then equant motion went a little bit further, and it not only took the observer off-center,
107120	110880	but also placed the center of the circular motion off-center.
110880	117120	Finally, the third construct was the epicycle indefinite, which was circular motion around
117120	118600	circular motion.
118600	124040	Together, these built up a wonderful model of the solar system where Earth was at the
124040	125840	center.
125840	131760	In the Middle Ages, however, that science was lost in Europe.
131760	136640	The knowledge of the geocentric model was carried on through Arabic astronomers.
136640	140160	Not only did they carry it on, they almost revered it.
140160	147240	They took Ptolemy's book and they called it Al-Mijisti, which comes down to us as Almagest.
147240	153160	They also improved some of Ptolemy's model to try and make it correspond more to reality.
153160	158160	There were some problems with Ptolemy's model, in particular because Ptolemy only thought
158160	162160	that it was a mathematical model designed to make predictions.
162160	168280	For example, if we watch this animation of the moon as it goes through its phases, you
168280	172880	can see that while the moon goes through its phases, it gets a little bit bigger and a
172880	174960	little bit smaller.
174960	180720	In Ptolemy's model, the variation of the moon in distance from the Earth was much, much
180720	187400	larger and would have produced a much larger amount of size change for the moon.
187400	192160	The Arabic astronomers improved not only the moon model, but also models for the outer
192160	196720	planets because the changes in size were true for them as well.
196720	202560	Here's an example of an Arabic model called the Al-Shatir model, and this is a model of
202560	203560	the outer planets.
203560	207720	If I put it in motion, you can see it has several epicycle deferents.
207720	214840	It's a rather complex model, but it was devised to make the size changes that actually observed
214840	219600	for the outer planets to match the size changes in the models.
219600	224960	They tried to improve it to make it correspond more to reality.
224960	229560	When the Renaissance came to Europe, the Ptolemaic models were rediscovered.
229560	235440	In 1175, there was a Latin translation of the Arabic translation of the Almagest, and
235440	239840	in 1515, shortly after the invention of the printing press, was the first printing of
239840	241680	the Almagest.
241680	247480	The other thing that came down in the Renaissance was the Aristotelian philosophy, that the idea
247480	253760	that the heavens were perfect, and that sphere and circles were the perfect shape.
253760	258280	There's a strong contrast in beliefs here of these two ideas that came down.
258280	263800	Ptolemy, believing that things are just a mathematical model, it's just a description
263800	269440	of movement in the universe, whereas Aristotle believed it was reality.
269440	273780	This model believed that there really were crystalline spheres in the heavens that guided
273780	278640	the motions of the sun, the moon, and the planets.
278640	281640	Into this, we bring the heliocentric model.
281640	287280	It is basically an alternative hypothesis to the geocentric model at this time.
287280	293840	If this is the geocentric model, you can see Earth is at the center with moon, Mercury,
293840	298160	Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbiting around it.
298160	304040	The heliocentric model simply switches the place of Earth, and moon, and the sun.
304040	309000	The sun switches to the center, the Earth and the moon switch out there.
309000	315800	This is the model embraced by Copernicus, and it was presented in his book on the Revolution
315800	319000	of Heavenly Spheres that was published in 1543.
319000	322880	Incidentally, it was published the same year that he died.
322880	328000	There is an apocryphal story that says on his deathbed they brought him a copy of his
328000	332760	book, and he was able to see his life's grand achievement before he died.
332760	334400	We don't really know if that's true.
334400	340800	There's a lot else we don't really know that's true, because Copernicus did not keep notebooks.
340800	343480	We don't know much about what he did.
343480	349840	All we really know is that he worked part-time on his heliocentric model for more than 30
349840	350840	years.
350840	356800	In the absence of knowing what did happen with Copernicus, filling in the void, there
356800	360720	are many myths that have grown up about the heliocentric model.
360720	365000	And so instead of studying what we do know, which is kind of scant, let's take a look
365000	372600	at all these myths, which are probably almost as large or larger than what we do know.
372600	378800	Myth number one, the heliocentric model is much more accurate than the geocentric model.
378800	384560	This is not true, because Copernicus did not use any new mathematical techniques.
384560	391320	There were no significant advances in either observations or observing tools, and therefore
391320	397320	the heliocentric model provided no greater accuracy in predictions.
397320	403200	Myth number two, the heliocentric model is much simpler than the geocentric model.
403200	408960	Well, I would argue that the heliocentric model is definitely simpler in terms of philosophy.
408960	415480	In science, it's not really simpler, because Copernicus used the eccentrics and epicycles,
415480	419720	the same geometric tools that are in the geocentric model.
419720	424120	There were no new mathematical techniques developed for Copernicus' model, so really
424120	429680	from a scientific standpoint, it wasn't any simpler.
429680	435200	Myth number three, the center of the universe is the most important place.
435200	441240	The idea here is that the critics of the heliocentric model resisted demoting Earth from its place
441240	442360	in the center.
442360	450000	Well, if you look at the Aristotelian philosophy, it says actually the opposite.
450000	455880	Perfection in the universe flows upward, the imperfect flows downward.
455880	460640	Instead of the Earth being in a revered place in the center of the universe, the heavens
460640	465880	were the revered place, and the Earth was the opposite of that, so the Earth not being
465880	472360	at the center from the Aristotle point of view would actually be a promotion.
472360	479480	Myth number four, Copernicus delayed publishing his work for fear of reprisal from the church.
479480	483880	This I refer to as sort of the Galileo myth, because Galileo got in trouble with the church
484160	488440	for his heliocentric views, so of course Copernicus had to get in trouble with the church for
488440	490600	his heliocentric views.
490600	496240	And that's totally wrong as well, because Cardinal Schoenberg and Bishop Giza were two
496240	501240	major supporters of Copernicus, and they urged Copernicus to publish.
501240	511400	Copernicus even dedicated his book to Pope Paul III, and Pope Paul III accepted the dedication.
511400	518000	Myth number five, Copernicus viewed his system as only a mathematical device, not as representation
518000	520200	of reality.
520200	525760	This myth arises because Andreas Ossiander inserted an introductory letter, and in that
525760	531000	introductory letter, fearing reprisal from the church, he put forth the idea that this
531000	535040	was just a mathematical model, that they shouldn't take it too seriously, and please don't get
535040	537120	mad at us for doing this.
537120	543880	Bishop Giza found this to be horrible, and he attempted to get the letter removed from
543880	548280	the publishing of the book.
548280	553240	Myth number six, astronomers quickly embraced the heliocentric model.
553240	557880	Well, this was not true, at least not for about a hundred years.
557880	560000	The Copernicans were few.
560000	564360	There were not many people who were willing to embrace the heliocentric model, simply
564360	569320	because it didn't provide any better predictions than the geocentric model.
569320	572920	It offered no practical advantages to the astronomers.
572920	577720	So by the time of Galileo, there were some Copernicans, folks who believed in the heliocentric
577720	581680	model, but not many.
581680	588040	And finally, myth number seven, Galileo proved that the heliocentric model was correct.
588040	592960	This comes from the fact that Galileo was tried by the Inquisition and got into a lot
592960	600600	of trouble for espousing the heliocentric viewpoint, but he did not prove the heliocentric
600600	606840	viewpoint, and the reason why he failed illustrates a fundamental physical principle discovered
606840	609440	by Galileo himself.
609440	616000	So the heliocentric model, as it would have been studied in the time of Galileo, was viewed
616000	618800	as an alternative to the geocentric model.
618800	621280	It provided several advantages.
621280	627200	If we look at the circles of the heliocentric model, it makes much more sense that the smaller
627200	634160	sphere of Earth moves through the universe instead of the much larger sphere of the sun,
634160	638240	and certainly makes a lot more sense than the much, much, much, much larger sphere of
638240	642080	the stars orbiting around Earth once per day.
642080	647120	The smaller things moving makes much more sense than the larger things moving.
647120	653640	It also provides a natural explanation for the bounded elongations of Mercury and Venus.
653640	656840	As you can see in this diagram, they are interior planets.
656840	662960	They're in between Earth and the sun, and therefore they could never appear on the opposite
662960	665200	side of Earth from the sun.
665200	669720	They would always appear interior and towards the direction of the sun, which is exactly
669720	672800	what we observe for Mercury and Venus.
672800	678360	For the exterior planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, that would explain why they appear
678360	683240	largest and are closest to Earth when they are opposite the sun.
683240	689040	Because when they are near the sun, in the sky, they are far away, and when they are
689040	692360	opposite the sun, when the sun is on one side and they are on the other side, they are passing
692360	695280	closest to Earth.
695280	702360	It also provides a natural explanation for the retrograde motion of these outer planets.
702360	707360	In this diagram, the blue dot is meant to represent Earth, and the red dot is meant
707360	709200	to represent an outer planet.
709200	717040	Take Mars, for example, and as Earth in its inner orbit catches up and passes by the outer
717040	725280	planet, the outer planet appears to move forward across the plane of the stars, then backward,
725280	727000	and then forward again.
727000	733120	But it does not involve any true backward motion, it's just the perspective of an inner
733120	740720	planet overtaking the outer planet because it's moving on a faster inner track.
740720	746080	The final advantage of the heliocentric model is philosophical, that it's a physical model
746080	751240	representing nature and is not meant to be just a mathematical device.
751240	757640	Although the philosophical arguments don't carry too much weight in astronomy, if all
757640	763280	things are equal, we'd like to have both truth and beauty.
763280	772480	Now everything was not wonderfully for the heliocentric model, it also had several problems.
772480	780800	If I take this globe and I orbit it, I rotate it, if the Earth is spinning once per day,
780800	787720	a point on the equator has to go all the way around and back in 24 hours.
787720	792640	To do that, it has to be moving at absolutely absurd speed, you would have to be moving
792640	797560	at a thousand kilometers per hour, that doesn't make much sense.
797560	803400	Furthermore, if we take this Earth and put it in orbit around the Sun, well then the
803400	809120	entire Earth has to be moving at even more absurd speed, it has to be moving at a hundred
809120	811840	thousand kilometers per hour.
811840	818440	Come on, that doesn't make much sense to move Earth that fast through the solar system.
818440	825520	Also, if Earth is orbiting the Sun, we should see a parallax effect on the stars.
825520	832080	That's illustrated by this diagram, that if the Earth is on the near part of its orbit,
832080	837960	the angle to stars would be larger and when it's on its far part of its orbit, the angle
838000	840520	to the stars would be smaller.
840520	846960	The stars should appear to pull away and come closer, pull away and come closer as Earth
846960	849200	moves around its orbit.
849200	854520	This is what we would call a parallax effect, and it's not observed for the stars.
854520	859760	Now there is a simple answer argument that says, oh this shouldn't happen, that's just
859760	866640	to put the stars immensely far away, but that doesn't make any sense because then you would
866640	873080	have this huge empty space beyond Saturn and before the sphere of the stars, and that
873080	875920	was considered absurd in this day.
875920	881520	Finally, the most damning argument for the heliocentric model is that the scriptures
881520	886560	state in several places that Earth does not move.
886560	890680	This doesn't sound like a huge problem to a scientist today, but it was a big problem
890680	896600	back then when the church dominated not only the daily life, but also your intellectual
896600	900000	career.
900000	905440	All of these arguments, both for the heliocentric model and against the heliocentric model,
905440	907960	are essentially philosophical.
907960	914800	Some of them have a scientific basis, but they are simply the idea of which explanation
914800	916400	do you prefer.
916400	920200	Do you prefer to have Earth moving at this incredible speed of 100,000 kilometers per
920200	924800	hour, or would you rather have the Sun orbiting around?
924800	928960	Make your choice, which is a simpler argument to you.
928960	934360	The thing in terms of science is that the predictions are equivalent.
934360	938200	So if you are an astronomer at the time, what would you think?
938200	941880	Would you take an established working model that's been providing predictions your whole
941880	946960	life, or would you go with a more aesthetic alternative?
946960	950080	How would you choose?
950080	957400	Enter into this, this man, Galileo, the first telescopic astronomer, and his observations
957400	962480	with the telescope helped disprove the Aristotelian view.
962480	968400	The Aristotelian view came under attack just shortly before Galileo.
968400	973440	The idea that the heavens are perfect and immutable could demonstrably be shown to be
973440	974440	wrong.
974440	981080	In 1572, they observed a supernova explosion, the appearance of a new star that then faded
981080	982280	away.
982280	986480	That showed that the stars do indeed change.
986480	990400	Galileo's telescope revealed that the moon had mountains, and it showed that not all
990400	993680	bodies in the heavens are perfect spheres.
994240	1000120	Furthermore, Galileo found the moons of Jupiter orbited around Jupiter, and that showed that
1000120	1003800	not everything orbited around Earth.
1003800	1010640	This break with Aristotle came about and was reflected in a new model of the solar system,
1010640	1013000	called the Tyconian model.
1013000	1019000	If this is the heliocentric model in which everything orbits the sun, the Tyconian model
1019000	1021080	would actually be a compromise.
1021080	1028320	It would take the Earth and make its stationary, and have the moon and the sun orbiting around
1028320	1035000	Earth, and then it would take all the other planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and
1035000	1038280	Saturn, and have them orbit the sun.
1038280	1042680	It seems like a rather complex idea, but it had quite a lot of support at the time of
1042680	1045000	Galileo.
1045000	1049480	So here is where I come to a point what I call Galileo's Dilemma.
1049480	1058160	Galileo found that he could prove Aristotle wrong, but given the science of the early 1600s,
1058160	1063720	could he provide proof of the heliocentric hypothesis?
1063720	1069400	This question came up in 1615 when the Catholic Church reviewed Copernicus' book.
1069400	1075360	Even though Pope Paul III had signed off on the book 60 years earlier, it came up for
1075360	1080720	review because of Galileo's work, and they decreed that the heliocentric model could
1080720	1084320	only be referred to as a hypothesis.
1084320	1090080	Galileo was particularly cautioned not to hold or defend the ideas of heliocentrism.
1090080	1093400	However, there was a loophole.
1093400	1099640	There was an implied challenge that if Galileo could provide irrefutable proof of the heliocentric
1099640	1103600	hypothesis, the matter could be reopened.
1103600	1110040	Galileo could resist, and he took up the challenge of proving the heliocentric model.
1110040	1114880	He presented his arguments in 1630 in his book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World
1114880	1116800	Systems.
1116800	1123520	For this book, he was tried by the Inquisition, forced to abjure, and placed under house arrest
1123520	1126440	for the remainder of his life.
1126440	1128000	What was his crime?
1128400	1134480	Well, his crime was providing a wrong proof of the heliocentric model.
1134480	1141080	His idea was that the Earth's motion produces the advance and recession of the tides.
1141080	1147640	As he put it, the ocean, because of its fluid nature, is the only thing that can indicate
1147640	1150120	the motion of the Earth.
1150120	1155240	If Earth were stationary, the tides could not occur.
1155240	1160560	In order to understand that argument, we first have to go through something called the Galilean
1160560	1168560	transformation, and that's simply the idea that in physics, the sum of two motions is
1168560	1169560	a vector sum.
1169560	1174280	If you have two different motions operating, you can combine them with a vector sum.
1174280	1177760	And to see this, let's take a look at the idea of a train.
1177760	1183440	So suppose you have a train conductor walking down the aisle of a train.
1183440	1187760	If you're sitting in the seat, you see him walk past you, say he's moving at about two
1187760	1189680	kilometers per hour.
1189680	1196560	However, if you are outside the train, you see the train moving down the track at, say,
1196560	1198960	30 kilometers per hour.
1198960	1203720	From your perspective, outside the train, you add together the 30 kilometers per hour
1203720	1208480	of the train motion and the two kilometers per hour of the conductor walking, and you
1208480	1212040	see his total motion as 32 kilometers per hour.
1212040	1214360	Which one's correct?
1214360	1216440	The answer is that they both are.
1216440	1220360	It just depends upon the frame of reference.
1220360	1226440	Measurements depend upon how you are moving with respect to what you are measuring.
1226440	1230520	Galileo applied this to his argument in the tides.
1230520	1237040	He argued that Earth's rotation and orbit combine to produce the tides, and the argument
1237040	1239680	looks something like this.
1239680	1247640	At the anti-solar point, the point farthest from the sun, Earth's rotational motion and
1247640	1251920	Earth's orbital motion combine to produce a faster motion.
1251920	1256560	So far on the opposite side of the sun, you're moving a faster speed.
1256560	1263240	At the sub-solar point, the rotational motion is going against the orbital motion and the
1263240	1267440	two subtract and you get a slower motion.
1267440	1273680	His argument was that that acceleration on the far side and deceleration toward the near
1273680	1280400	side created a sloshing of the ocean that created the tides.
1280400	1281400	Wonderful argument.
1281400	1285200	It's just plain wrong as a problem.
1285200	1291360	Problem with this is that the tides are in effect seen from the reference frame of Earth.
1291360	1296280	While the change in speed in his argument is only seen from the reference frame of the
1296280	1305920	sun, he is using a sun reference frame argument to explain an Earth reference frame effect.
1305920	1311560	Furthermore, the high and low tides that we see on Earth cycle in about 12 hours.
1311560	1315520	We get two high tides and two low tides every day.
1315520	1321440	In Galileo's argument, you should only get one high tide and one low tide per day.
1321440	1327680	The tides also are observed to occur relative to the sub-lunar and anti-lunar points, the
1327680	1333440	points closest and farthest to where the moon is at the time.
1333440	1338760	What's even more intriguing is that Galileo was aware of the correct argument that the
1338760	1342240	moon produces the tides.
1342240	1347640	In his book, he has the simpleton simplicio make this argument.
1347640	1353800	The moon, wandering through the sky, attracts and draws up toward itself a heap of water
1353800	1359800	which goes along following it so that the high sea is always in that part that lies under
1359800	1361880	the moon.
1361880	1364640	That's basically a correct argument.
1364640	1372600	However, the wise man, Segredo, in Galileo's dialogue dismisses it as those ridiculous
1372600	1375720	older opinions.
1375800	1383480	Galileo's proof failed because the shift from geocentric to heliocentric is just a transformation
1383480	1386160	of the heavens.
1386160	1393000	Motion is defined relative to some frame of reference and the various solar system models
1393000	1398320	are essentially equivalent because they are all just changes of reference frame.
1398320	1403640	To go from geocentric to heliocentric, you're changing from the reference frame of Earth
1403640	1406040	to the reference frame of the sun.
1406040	1411120	If you look at the Tyconian model, that's just a rotational transformation of the heliocentric
1411120	1416920	model, taking the heliocentric model and putting it in a spin about Earth.
1416920	1422040	To see that, let's take a look at this animation of the Tyconian model.
1422040	1424920	When you look at this, it looks somewhat like a heliocentric model.
1424920	1429560	It looks like the sun is at the center, but you'll note that there is a circle going through
1429560	1434440	the sun, and actually the Earth here is at the center, and the Earth is fixed.
1434440	1443840	If I put it in motion, you can see that the sun is orbiting around the Earth, but Mercury,
1443840	1449440	Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are orbiting around the sun.
1449440	1454000	This is the Tyconian sort of compromise model.
1454000	1462040	If I speed it up, you can see that you start to get sort of seasick, because it's like
1462040	1467920	a wheel that's out of balance and is wobbling around.
1467920	1472440	You see that same sort of curly Q motion that is produced by the epicycle and deferent in
1472440	1474640	the Ptolemaic model.
1474640	1481960	What we really have here is the sun working on a deferent circle, and the planets on five
1481960	1484760	epicycles around it.
1484760	1491000	This model was due to Tycho Brahe, and he was one of the greatest pre-telescopic observers.
1491000	1498000	He did his observations in a period from about 1570 to 1600.
1498000	1503360	He developed this model because he saw the beauty of the heliocentric model, and he appreciated
1503360	1507720	the explanations, the natural explanations for the bounded elongations of Mercury and
1507720	1512920	Venus, and for the retrograde motion of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
1512920	1518600	Yet, he could not accept the idea that Earth was in motion.
1518600	1525560	To him, it was still absurd that Earth should be spinning or moving around the sun.
1525560	1532520	In the end, all three of the models, the Ptolemaic model, the Tyconian model, and the Copernican
1532520	1538920	model were scientifically equivalent because they all produced the same observations.
1538920	1543560	They could not, one of them could predict the motions of the planets any better than
1543560	1545640	any other one.
1545640	1553440	And really, I think Galileo might have known this, because in his own copy of the dialogue,
1553440	1556560	he wrote this quote.
1556560	1561900	Take note, theologians, that in your desire to make matters of faith out of propositions
1561900	1567060	relating to the fixity of sun and earth, you run the risk of eventually having to condemn
1567060	1574420	as heretics those who would declare the earth to stand still and the sun to change position.
1574420	1580060	Eventually I say, at such a time as it might be physically or logically proved that the
1580060	1584780	earth moves and the sun stands still.
1584780	1591860	And in note, in his own copy, he was sort of admitting that he had not truly proved
1591860	1594620	his case.
1594620	1601860	The mistake that he felt the church had made was in calling the heliocentric model heretical.
1601860	1612300	And it wasn't until 1992 when Pope John Paul II produced a statement admitting that the
1612300	1616820	church had aired in condemning Galileo.
1616820	1622060	The philosophical arguments in favor of the heliocentric hypothesis are strong.
1622060	1626740	They are powerful in that it makes much more sense to have everything orbiting around the
1626740	1628180	sun.
1628180	1631740	But in science, they were not enough.
1631740	1640060	In science, in order to prove the heliocentric hypothesis, you would need better predictions,
1640060	1644020	better motions of the heavens.
1644020	1650020	And this would not come from better arguments as produced by Galileo, but instead would
1650020	1657780	come from better data as produced by Tico Brahe and then analyzed later by Johannes Kepler.
1657780	1661700	And we'll explore that in much more detail in our next lecture.
1661700	1663380	Until then, have a great day.
