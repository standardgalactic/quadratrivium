0	22580	Throughout history, the irregular appearances of Comet have been considered both an omen
22580	24140	and a puzzle.
24140	28720	A puzzle because Comet seemed to not follow the rules.
28720	33880	Their arrivals couldn't be predicted, and they did not follow the regular emotions.
33880	40660	They grew in brightness and faded in brightness, and sometimes they even outshone the planets.
40660	45880	They developed long tails and could dominate the night sky.
45880	52000	Their unpredictability provoked fear, hence Comets must be omens.
52000	56880	Surely, the appearance of a new celestial object must have great meaning for the affairs
56880	58700	of men.
58820	62900	These meanings were generally taken as portents of doom.
62900	69440	A Chinese text describes the meanings of the shapes of Comet tails.
69440	76260	One represented civil war, one foretold of revolt in the army, and another showed that
76260	78960	there would be a death of a king.
78960	83780	That last example was also found woven into the Bayou tapestry.
83780	88300	In this image, you can see the appearance of a comet in the upper left.
88300	91740	It turns out this was Haley's comet appearing in 1066.
91740	96220	It made a very striking appearance in Earth's skies around the time that William the Conqueror
96220	98220	invaded England.
98220	104420	As depicted here in the tapestry, it was deemed a bad omen for King Harold of England, and
104420	108100	in fact, he actually died later that year.
108100	115460	A 1665 book was even more rabble-rousing about the effect of Comets.
115460	121140	Threatening the world with famine, plague, and war, to princes' death, to kingdoms,
121140	129340	many crosses, to all estates, inevitable losses, to herdsmen wrought, to ploughmen hapless
129340	134820	seasons, to sailors' storms, to cities' civil treasons.
135820	142660	That's a quote from DiCometis by John Gadbury, published in London 1665.
142660	149900	So there has been a lot of historical hysteria about comets, and it's sort of nice to think
149900	156820	that, oh, that happened only in the past, but when Haley's comet passed by in 1910,
156820	162340	the media learned that the Earth would be passing through its tail, and that its tail
162340	166260	contained the poisonous gas cyanogen.
166260	172580	This caused quite a bit of panic, including this book here, which predicted the end of
172580	173980	the world.
173980	177540	Fortunately, that didn't happen.
177540	183300	Now more rational thought and order in the solar system can be restored by making comets
183300	184380	predictable.
184380	188260	This is what Edmund Haley did in the mid-1700s.
188260	196820	He noted that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had similar orbital elements, and he
196820	200300	postulated that they were in fact the same comet.
200300	207140	Therefore, he was able to predict the return in 1758 and 1759.
207140	212740	The comet was then named after him, and it's given the scientific designation 1P slash
212740	218500	Haley, where 1P indicates that it's the first periodic comet.
218500	223140	It's given Haley, and you'll note that the comets are one of the few things where the
223140	227100	discoverer's name is actually attached to it.
227100	232500	Using historical and Chinese observations, we are able to go back about 30 orbits to
232500	238780	see the return of Haley's comet all the way back to about 240 BCE, and that's how we know
238780	243540	that the 1066 comet was an appearance of Haley.
243540	247340	This predictability then becomes power.
247340	252220	Here is the orbit of Haley's comet, and as you can see, it comes into the inner solar
252220	256860	system and it goes all the way out past the orbit of Neptune.
256860	264220	As we mentioned in a previous lecture, it returned one day late in 1835.
264220	269060	Because this orbit samples the gravity of the outer solar system, this helped convince
269060	275500	astronomers that the problems that they saw in Uranus's orbit at the time might be due
275500	278000	to an unknown planet.
278000	283060	It turns out that comets really can serve as scientific omens.
283060	288100	Let's look in detail at the structure of a comet.
288100	294180	This is an image of comet Hyakutake, and the visible parts of the comet are shown quite
294300	300820	well in this image, the head of it, which is called the coma, and this big long tail
300820	303140	that is streaming away.
303140	307020	Now neither of these parts really are the comet itself.
307020	312100	The comet is really contained in a nucleus that's deep inside the coma, and it's rarely
312100	313620	seen.
313620	318100	Our observations and our understanding of comet nuclei are, well, I'd say they're perhaps
318100	323660	a little bit skewed, because we observe mostly the bright comets, like comet Haley, or the
323820	329260	recent comets, like comet Hale-Bopp, or the comets visited by spacecraft, like Temple
329260	332500	One and Wild Two.
332500	339140	This is the image from the Stardust satellite of comet Wild Two.
339140	343380	This is the nucleus of comet Wild Two, and you'll note that it has a very asteroid-like
343380	344500	appearance.
344500	348820	It's irregularly shaped, and it has a rather pockmarked surface.
348820	350820	It's also rather tiny.
350860	354620	It's only about five kilometers across.
354620	360980	Now the general idea in how we think of these comet nuclei is what we call the dirty snowball
360980	362540	model.
362540	366700	Their sizes are from about one to ten kilometers.
366700	370980	Although I note that Hale-Bopp was especially large, we found that that one was about forty
370980	373260	kilometers in size.
373260	376900	Now these are about the size of sort of the smallest moons that we discussed in the moon
376980	382820	lecture, and certainly some moons are in fact captured comets.
382820	387180	The surface, although it appears bright here, is actually composed of very dark material.
387180	390580	It's always described as blacker than coal.
390580	395100	It's not ice, but it's rather carbon-rich, encrusted materials.
395100	400180	Basically, it's similar to the ring particles of Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, where there
400180	406380	probably was ice on the surface, but the particle bombardment, in this case from the solar wind,
406380	413260	has gotten rid of the ice and left the carbon-rich material, which makes the surface black.
413260	418620	Now the temperature of this surface will vary depending upon where it is in its orbit.
418620	422260	Certainly when it's way out away from the sun, it's going to be very cold.
422260	427100	The temperature is in the outer solar system around 200 degrees below zero, but it can
427100	430300	also be very hot.
430300	435660	Comet Halley, when measured when it was just inside the Earth's orbit radius at 0.8 of
435660	443860	an astronomical unit, was measured to be 57 degrees Celsius, that's 135 degrees Fahrenheit,
443860	449100	and really the same as the highest temperature ever recorded in Death Valley.
449100	456100	Basically, Halley, when it was inside the orbit of the sun, was hot asphalt baking in
456100	459180	the sun's light.
459180	465140	The interior composition of these comet nuclei is thought to be mostly ices, and the gas
465140	472500	around Comet Halley, if it sort of fits what the interior is like, it was 80% water ice,
472500	480260	10% carbon monoxide, and 3.5% carbon dioxide.
480260	484100	We have, however, looked inside one comet.
484100	489700	We only example the gas around Comet Halley, but we were actually able to look at the inside
489700	495380	of Comet Temple One, and we did so with a mission called Deep Impact.
495380	500340	Here is the nucleus of Comet Temple One, as seen by Deep Impact.
500340	507300	It's about 8 kilometers by 5 kilometers across, and the Deep Impact mission flew by Temple
507300	513740	One, and as it was flying by, it released a probe, and it sent that probe to crash into
513740	519780	the comet, so that ejecta would be spewed out, and we could examine the ejecta to explore
519780	522420	the interior of the comet.
522420	528700	As I described at the time, it was basically a washing machine slamming into an iceberg
528700	531780	at 25,000 miles per hour.
531780	533980	So what happened?
533980	540140	Well, this is the image here from the impactor about 5 minutes before impact.
540180	545020	Here's the image 90 seconds to impact, and here is 60 seconds to impact.
545020	549660	You can see that they have craters here, and this crater just below center is about half
549660	551580	a kilometer across.
551580	555180	The impactor hit just above this crater.
555180	562460	If we watch from the flyby spacecraft, here you can see just as it hit, and a big bright
562460	567620	flash, you can see the impact.
567620	573060	We step forward in the imageries, you can see here that there is a large plume of material
573060	580060	that was immediately set out, poof, away from the comet nucleus.
580060	585180	This indicates that it has a crusty surface with a low density interior.
585180	592380	If it had had a much harder surface, the material wouldn't have pushed back so quickly.
592380	597620	As we follow through the impact, that material sprays off, and then material from the inside
597620	603780	starts to spray out, and here you can see the plume of material starting to come out
603780	606300	from the comet.
606300	614020	This is what we saw from the flyby spacecraft, but many telescopes watch the impact, including
614020	619940	the Hubble Space Telescope, and we have three images here from the Hubble Space Telescope.
619940	625580	The one on the left is one minute before the impact, the one on the center is nine minutes
625580	631020	after the impact, and even from Earth we can see that the impact has caused a considerable
631020	635780	brightening of the comet, and then finally one and a half hours after impact you can
635780	641420	see just how far this gigantic spray of material went out into space.
641420	646460	So we studied this material with many different telescopes to see what it was composed of
646460	650980	to try and understand the interior of the comet, and the results were that it was a
650980	656540	very porous composition, they described it as being like a snow bank, and that there
656540	660220	was no indication of solid ice.
660220	665660	The material was also finer than expected, it had the consistency of talcum powder when
665660	669220	they expected it to have the consistency of sand.
669220	674500	There was a little less water ice than expected, and water ice was still the dominant material,
674500	679140	but they also saw more dust than they had expected.
679140	686580	Overall it was rather a puzzling mix of materials, because the ices form where it's cold.
686580	691580	They saw some materials called crystalline silicates that have to form at high temperature, temperature
691580	693900	about a thousand degrees.
693900	699840	They also saw some clays and some carbonates that need liquid water in which to form.
699840	704920	So you've got cold stuff, you've got hot stuff, and you've got aqueous stuff, water,
704920	710080	needing water stuff, all within the same comet nucleus.
710080	716760	So the comet interior composition was not indicative of any one location, and it rather
716760	721680	confuses the picture of their origins.
721680	724520	Now there's another major feature of the comet nucleus.
724520	730200	Here is a picture of Comet Halley taken by the spacecraft Giotto, and what you see in
730200	735040	this image are the jets coming off the comet nucleus.
735040	741800	These are created by the sublimation of the ices, where ice goes directly from solid to
741800	744560	gaseous.
744560	748880	There's very little ice on the surface of these comets, but the comets have very porous
748880	755280	surface and a very hot surface, so the heat as it diffuses into the interior of the comet
755280	762400	causes the ice to sublimate and shoot out through the very porous surface as these jets.
762400	769640	These ices also carry away dust particles, and the gas and the dust flows away from the
769640	771920	comet nucleus.
771920	775000	This is what forms the coma.
775000	780120	Here's an image of Comet Neat, and you can see it's got a wonderful coma here, and you
780120	782280	can see the tail going past.
782280	787880	This coma, this bright coma, you can sort of think you see the nucleus in there.
787880	790640	No, it's much, much, much too small to see here.
790640	796320	This coma is created from these gas and dust spewed off by the nucleus, and this coma is
796320	799440	about one million kilometers across.
799440	803760	Now I said the nucleus was only a few kilometers across, so that's much, much, much bigger.
803760	806600	So even that bright dot there can't actually be the nucleus.
806600	809320	It's much too small to see.
809320	814960	The coma develops when the comet gets within about three astronomical units of the sun,
814960	817760	or three times the Earth's sun distance.
817760	825080	Once the sun heats at surface enough, the interior water ice will sublimate, spew out,
825080	827040	and create the coma.
827040	833600	The gases given off by the nucleus are broken down by sunlight, and so the composition of
833600	836680	the coma changes with distance from the nucleus.
836680	841560	The further you are from the nucleus, the more it is unlike the interior composition
841560	844320	of the comet.
844320	853320	We flew through the coma of a comet with a mission called stardust and collected samples.
853320	857240	Here is a picture of the return capsule.
857240	862360	What we did with, if you see in the lower right, you see the guy in the bunny suit holding
862360	866200	onto the sample grid.
866200	870040	Basically we flew past comet Wild 2 through its coma.
870040	875440	We opened up, and in this grid here there's a substance called aerogel, and the aerogel
875440	878320	caught the particles from the comet.
878320	884960	Then the mission came back to Earth, and the return capsule you see here on the left came
884960	891440	down to Earth, landed in the desert, and we were able to actually study the particles
891440	894880	from the comet here on Earth.
894880	899960	The results in the laboratory have been actually even similar to the Deep Impact mission.
899960	904920	We found ices that form in the coal region, and they are mixed with materials that should
904920	911840	only form in the hot regions, and so together from Deep Impact and stardust they sort of
911840	917920	confirm that we're a little confused about comet origins.
917920	923640	Now the outer boundary of the coma is defined by the interaction with the solar wind.
923640	928880	Now the evidence of the interaction with the solar wind can be seen in X-ray observations.
928880	935240	Here is a picture from the X-ray satellite Rosat of comet Hyakutake, and you can see
935240	942240	that there are X-rays on the sunward side of the comet, and it's not in the direction
942240	948640	of the comet motion that the particles are hitting from the sunward side, and it's very
948640	955720	surprising just how strong you get X-ray emission from a comet, because we don't think of comets
955720	960800	as being high energy objects, why would we be getting X-rays from it?
960800	967240	Well, it just says that the particles of the solar wind are really smashing into the coma
967240	970920	and creating this X-ray emission.
970920	978880	The solar wind then pushes the coma particles away, and that forms the comet's tail.
978880	986200	Here is an image of comet Ikeaseki, and it was observed in 1966.
986200	992360	So if the coma can be on order 100,000 or a million kilometers across, take a look at
992360	1000600	this very long tail, and you can see that it can stretch for tens of millions of kilometers.
1000600	1005400	Because they are pushed back by the solar wind, the tails always point away from the
1005400	1007200	sun.
1007200	1009520	Here is a movie that shows you a bit of that.
1009520	1014520	This is comet NEET passing by the sun, as observed by the SOHO spacecraft.
1014520	1019640	The comet will come in from the top and swing past it and head out in the lower right.
1019640	1026560	So you can see the tail pushing away from the sun, being pushed back by the solar wind.
1026560	1029600	Now comets don't have just one tail.
1029600	1036320	They have both gas and dust emitted by the nucleus, and gas and dust each form a separate
1036320	1038200	tail.
1038200	1042280	This is an absolutely spectacular image of comet Meknot.
1042280	1047440	As a matter of fact, it's an image taken by Meknot himself, the man who discovered the
1047440	1051160	comet about six months before this image was taken.
1051160	1057680	It shows you an incredible panoply of the dust tail, which appears yellowish because
1057680	1060080	it's colored by reflected sunlight.
1060080	1065480	It is a very curved tail, and the dust is following the orbital trajectories as it's
1065480	1069800	pushed away by the solar radiation.
1069800	1075160	This image here was taken about one week after comet Meknot passed by the sun, and you can
1075160	1080040	really see the motion of the comet in its orbit, and how the tail sweeps through the
1080040	1084480	sky, because you're seeing the tail as it was released over the course of that week
1084480	1087040	or so.
1087040	1092520	Now the other tail is called the ion tail, and you can see both tails in this image
1092520	1094520	of comet Hale-Bopp.
1094520	1100320	The dust tail is here on the top, and that's the more yellow tail stretching up.
1100320	1104840	The blue tail is the ion or plasma tail.
1104840	1110080	It appears blue because of the fluorescence of carbon monoxide molecules.
1110080	1116720	The gas particles in the coma have been ionized as they're getting hit by the solar wind,
1116720	1121480	and instead of being pushed away by the radiation, they're actually carried away by the magnetic
1121480	1124000	field lines of the solar wind.
1124000	1129800	Hence, you get a straighter tail for the magnetic field pushing these ions out away from the
1129800	1130800	sun.
1130800	1137200	Also, because the magnetic field moves a little bit faster, the ion tail can be up to 10 times
1137200	1141760	longer than the dust tail.
1141760	1147400	The ion tail is also affected by changes in the sun's magnetic field, and it can break
1147400	1150200	up in what we call a disconnection event.
1150200	1156180	This is where part of the ion tail detaches and then reforms.
1156180	1162240	In this image, you can see at the top the ion tail is intact, and then in the second
1162240	1167120	image you can start to see a break forming in it, and by the third image we have the disconnection
1167120	1172000	event that is pushing off, and slowly that disconnected part will flow away, and the
1172000	1175800	ion tail will reform and become its long self.
1175800	1181000	This occurs when the comet crosses a sector boundary of the magnetic field, basically
1181000	1185120	a change in the polarity of the solar wind's magnetic field.
1185120	1190360	Now, there's a spectacular disconnection event seen in a movie.
1190360	1196360	This movie is of comet Enki, and it was hit by a coronal mass ejection.
1196360	1201000	The comet starts as this little dot here on the left of the screen, and all this emission
1201000	1205960	on the right of the screen are the emissions from the sun.
1205960	1211360	And so if I start it up, you can see the comet approaching, and then this big coronal mass
1211360	1217360	ejection sweeps through, causes a disconnection event, and then you also see the strong interaction
1217360	1221200	of the solar wind and the comet's tail as it comes through.
1221200	1225280	Well, that's the structure of a comet.
1225280	1229760	Now let's take a look at their orbits.
1229760	1235520	We have the short period comets that take up to 200 years to orbit the sun, and here
1235520	1239640	is a diagram of most of the short period comets.
1239640	1244120	You can see the orbits are confined mostly to the interior of Jupiter's orbit, and they
1244120	1249680	can have any orbit shape, they can be really elongated or nearly circular.
1249680	1256800	If we look into the central region, you can see, just barely pick out here, there's Mercury's
1256800	1262720	orbit, Venus's orbit, and Earth's orbit, and I can hardly even see Mars' orbit, but you
1262720	1270360	can see that many of these comets pass near or cross through Earth's orbit.
1270360	1272960	These are the comets that we see on a regular basis.
1272960	1276440	Now most of them are not that bright, so they're not the spectacular comets like the
1276440	1281760	hail bops, but there are many comets that pass through the inner solar system on a regular
1281760	1282760	basis.
1282760	1289160	And if we look at this edge on to the solar system, you can see that most of the comet
1289160	1291560	orbits are in the ecliptic plane.
1291560	1295480	They're only a handful of deviations, and you can see that those are really those that
1295480	1298360	have the longer periods.
1298360	1303800	On the contrast to the short period comets, we also have the long period comets.
1303800	1308600	These are comets that have orbital periods greater than 200 years, and they can actually
1308600	1311840	be tens of thousands of years long.
1311840	1317200	Originally, it was thought that these comets were hyperbolic, that they came from interstellar
1317200	1321000	space, they swooped through the solar system, and they never returned.
1321000	1323240	Well, we know that's not true.
1323240	1327800	We now know them to be very elongated ellipses.
1327800	1333520	So here are just a few of the long period comets, and you can see that they extend
1333520	1337120	well beyond the planet's orbits.
1337120	1342440	I've included comet Halley over here in the upper left, around 10 o'clock, just for
1342440	1343440	stale.
1343440	1344880	And you can see Halley goes out to Neptune.
1344880	1348320	All of these comets go well, well beyond Neptune.
1348320	1354840	If you look at this edge on, you can see that none of them are in the plane of the ecliptic.
1354840	1356960	And they extend very far out.
1356960	1358720	This is the orbits of the planets.
1358720	1365680	They can extend much further out to hundreds of AU, and even out to thousands of astronomical
1365680	1366800	units.
1366800	1372000	But still, they are gravitationally bound to the sun.
1372000	1378260	If one looks at the full distribution of orbits, you find that most have very, very
1378260	1383640	long periods, and essentially, they have random orientations.
1383640	1387280	In the ones that I picked out here, they all seem to be below the plane.
1387280	1388920	Many of them are, in fact, above the plane.
1388920	1393800	They're actually at all orientations around the solar system.
1393800	1399200	So most long period comets are seen once, and never seen again, because they take tens
1399200	1404120	of thousands of years in their orbits, while the short period comets are seen over and
1404120	1407600	over until they are destroyed.
1407600	1412560	Because the short period comets can't last for that long, or at least compared to the
1412560	1415120	age of the solar system.
1415120	1422880	If you go past the sun, you're going to lose 0.1 to 1% of your mass, each perihelion passage.
1422880	1426680	Each time you go past the sun, you're going to lose a bit of your mass.
1426680	1432560	That limits comets to about a few hundred, or maybe a few thousand orbits that go closer
1432560	1434680	into the sun.
1434680	1440160	Now the evidence for this kind of mass loss can be seen in the night sky.
1440160	1443300	It can be seen in images like this.
1443300	1452100	This is an image of a meteor shower, and these are pieces of comets raining down on Earth.
1452100	1458820	You see the material that's ejected from the comet gets strewn out along the comet's orbit.
1458820	1465220	And as Earth passes through the orbit of a comet, that's when you get a meteor shower.
1465220	1469400	And these showers are actually associated with specific comets.
1469400	1473280	One of the brightest showers of the year is called the Perseids, and that's associated
1473280	1479300	with comet Swift-Tuttle, the Leonids with comet Temple-Tuttle, and the Ursids with just
1479300	1480300	comet Tuttle.
1480300	1484280	So you can see this guy, Tuttle, spent a lot of time finding comets.
1484280	1492500	Comet Halley is actually associated with two meteor showers, the Orionids and the Ada Aquarids.
1492500	1499160	Now these showers can have a few meteors, or they can have many meteors, and that really
1499180	1504860	depends on how recently the comet passed through the inner solar system, just how much stuff
1504860	1510660	has recently been strewn out into that part of the orbit that we're passing through.
1510660	1516620	Comets give off just a little bit of stuff in normal times, but sometimes they've been
1516620	1520500	observed to entirely break apart.
1520500	1527340	This is an image of comet 73P Schwachmann-Wachmann III.
1527340	1530880	It was observed to break into several large pieces.
1530880	1538520	The ones in this image are labeled B, G, R, and N. Now originally, they were labeled
1538520	1543520	with consecutive letters, but some of the pieces disappeared between the orbit when
1543520	1547980	it broke apart and the orbit when it's being observed here.
1547980	1555640	The pieces themselves also released many fragments, and we looked at fragments B and G with the
1555660	1561460	Hubble Space Telescope, and here you can see that there is a main part to these fragments
1561460	1566900	B and G, but there are also many, many small fragments released off of these, and this
1566900	1573100	caused the Schwachmann-Wachmann III to brighten because the many, many particles were affected
1573100	1578500	a lot more sunlight than just the one comet nucleus would have.
1578500	1583660	So the remains of Schwachmann-Wachmann III may not have many more orbits left before
1583680	1590520	it breaks apart or crashes into the sun or otherwise disappears.
1590520	1596280	We have actually seen one comet suffered a catastrophic breakup, and this is the comet
1596280	1598720	Schumacher-Levy IX.
1598720	1603600	Here is an image of the breakup of Schumacher-Levy IX after its breakup.
1603600	1606800	Matter of fact, we didn't observe it before its breakup.
1606800	1611840	It broke into many pieces and was disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.
1611860	1616940	We only observed it after it had been captured by Jupiter's gravity and had already broken
1616940	1618540	into these pieces.
1618540	1625540	Eventually, Schumacher-Levy IX crashed into Jupiter and it was a spectacular death of
1625540	1627580	a comet.
1627580	1634300	So these breakups indicate that the comet interior is not strongly held together.
1634300	1639580	One thinks of the comet interiors as are they monolithic, is it all one great big snowball,
1639580	1644560	or is it a compendium of packed together many snowballs packed together?
1644560	1649800	And these breakups indicate that it's probably the latter view.
1649800	1657520	Now like Icarus, comets can get into trouble if they pass too close to the sun.
1657520	1664240	This movie here shows two comets that swing close to the sun and they're being observed
1664240	1670060	by the SOHO satellite, but they never were observed to travel away.
1670060	1675700	They're going to appear in the lower left here and swing up towards the sun.
1675700	1682220	So here come the comets and they swoop in, and then the sun has a coronal mass ejection
1682220	1686460	as if it swallowed up those comets and it's burping afterwards.
1686460	1691260	Now the SOHO satellite has been prolific at finding comets.
1691260	1694880	It has observed over 1,000 comets.
1694880	1701560	Many of them sun grazers like this, many of them that did not swoop out the other side
1701560	1706680	and we presume were destroyed in their passage by the sun.
1706680	1713640	So comets have been observed to die and new comets have appeared in our sky.
1713640	1721240	This cycle of destruction of comets and appearance of new comets indicates that we must have
1721240	1725340	some resupply reservoir for comets.
1725340	1728460	And that's what we'll get to in our next lecture.
1728460	1733860	We will discuss the two reservoirs, one for the short period comets and one for the long
1733860	1741020	period comets, and in doing so we'll explore a brand new region of the solar system, one
1741020	1745620	that had not been observed until the last two decades.
1745620	1746620	We'll see you then.
1746620	1746780	Take care.
