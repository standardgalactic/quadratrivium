0	22000	The sun appears as a relatively constant feature in our lives.
22000	23940	It rises and sets.
23940	25540	It lights our world.
25540	28280	Its energy makes life possible.
28280	30840	It's kind of easy to take it for granted.
30840	33280	It's a stable feature of nature.
33280	39200	Indeed, the major changes in our sun will happen over billion year time scales.
39200	46480	Our sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago, and it should live for about 12 billion years.
46480	51760	Now when I say live in terms of a star, that means how long it's undergoing nuclear fusion
51760	53280	in its core.
53280	58240	You will probably see 10 billion years as a round number stated for the lifetime of
58240	64240	the sun in many places, but detailed calculations predict that it should live for about 12.4
64240	66640	billion years.
66640	71520	When the sun first formed, it was a little fainter and a little smaller.
71520	77480	But as it converts hydrogen to helium in its core, it takes four protons and turns into
77480	82040	one helium nucleus, and that gives a decrease in number density.
82040	87240	But corresponding has a little bit of decrease in pressure, so the sun contracts and heats
87240	88680	up a little.
88680	94520	Over billions of years, it becomes hotter in the core, and therefore hotter on its surface,
94520	97480	and more energy is thus given off.
97480	103360	The sun is now about 40% brighter than when it was born, and it's also expanded a little
103360	105920	to be about 6% larger.
105920	112480	The surface temperature of the sun has increased by about 300 degrees centigrade.
112480	117640	After about 11 billion years, the sun will run out of hydrogen in its core.
117640	123320	It will contract further, it will heat up, and fuse helium.
123320	128800	While the core of the sun is 15 million degrees today, when it tries to do helium fusion,
128800	132440	it will have to heat up to 100 million degrees.
132440	139080	Its incredible change in heat will cause it to swell to 100 times its current size.
139080	145520	Mercury will be engulfed and will be inside the sun, and perhaps Venus as well.
145520	152280	This period, the red giant phase of the sun, will last for a few hundred million years.
152280	159160	Toward the end, the sun will be 2,000 times brighter than it is today.
159160	163800	The icy moons of the giant planets will melt.
163800	169880	But life on Earth won't change, simply because there won't be any life on Earth.
169880	173000	Earth will already be a cinder.
173000	178280	You see, over the next 3 billion years, as the sun grows hotter, the Earth will slowly
178280	184920	lose its polar ice caps, and then its oceans will evaporate, and even its atmosphere will
184920	188240	eventually be lost to space.
188240	193920	Well before the sun dies, Earth will be inhospitable for life.
193920	200200	Fortunately, we have 3 billion years to prepare.
200200	206600	There are other changes on the sun that happen on human time scales, and they can have effects
206600	211120	on life on Earth as well, although not quite as dramatic.
211120	214400	The easiest changes on the sun to track are sunspots.
215360	219600	Here's an image of a sunspot to remind you what they look like.
219600	222440	Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic fields.
222440	227160	The field lines are concentrated in the dark core of the sunspot.
227160	231160	They appear dark because they're actually cooler than the surrounding photosphere.
231160	235740	They're about a thousand degrees below the temperature of the photosphere.
235740	240080	That still means they're about 4,000, maybe 4,500 degrees.
240080	242480	That's still really hot and really bright.
242480	246480	They just appear dark by contrast.
246480	252000	If we look at the full view of the sun, you can see it has a distribution of sunspots.
252000	255000	And the sunspots usually come in pairs.
255000	261040	These are one of North magnetic polarity and one of South magnetic polarity, and so the
261040	266000	field lines go from one sunspot to the other polarity sunspot.
266000	269520	Now in this image, I'll show you the magnetic field measures.
269560	275400	Now this image is the exact same day as that previous image with visible light.
275400	282480	So when we look in the magnetic field image, white is South polarity and black is North
282480	285920	polarity, you can see this strong grouping into pairs.
285920	292400	The magnetic field exits from one sunspot and reenters the sun at the other.
292400	299440	Now simply counting the number of sunspots will reveal a basic pattern in the sun.
299440	303400	This image is the number of sunspots over time.
303400	306960	It shows you a record of counts for over two centuries.
306960	315520	As basic pattern, strongly obvious here, is that the number rises and falls every 11 years.
315520	320480	Sometimes there are hundreds of sunspots, sometimes there are few or even no sunspots.
320480	325760	The peak height, the number whether it's, you know, can be about 50 and can be about 200.
325760	333280	It varies and there's no real long-term trend in terms of how high the peak height is over time.
333280	340000	There is a trend in looking at where the sunspots occur on the surface of the sun, their latitude.
340000	345640	This is the plot over time over about the last 100 years or so of the location on the sun,
345640	348880	the latitude versus time.
348880	354320	And you can see that with each sunspot cycle, it starts out at higher latitudes and then
354320	359120	they slowly migrate towards the equator and then they disappear altogether and then they
359120	362120	reappear at higher latitudes.
362120	367200	We call this the butterfly diagram because if you look at the pattern sideways, it looks
367200	370000	like a series of butterflies.
370000	375800	But one doesn't have to observe for an entire 11 years to see changes on the sun.
375800	382960	Here is a movie of the magnetic field on the sun over the course of about a month.
382960	387720	You can note that the sunspots constantly are changing in their structure.
387720	393880	You will also notice a tendency for the sunspot groups to align diagonally with one axis pointed
393880	396920	away from the center and the other one pointed towards the center.
396920	400320	In this final frame of the movie, you can see this white grouping here pointing towards
400320	404480	the equator and this black grouping here pointing towards the equator.
404480	410440	The natural explanation for the alignment is, well, if you watch it long enough, you find
410440	417880	that the equator is rotating faster than the poles and this produces this diagonal alignment.
417880	423600	You find that the equator is rotating in about 26 days whereas as the sun rotates in about
423600	426720	34 days at the pole.
426720	433800	This is what we call differential rotation and since the sun's surface is broken by
433800	438560	this magnetic field, imagine the magnetic field and the rotation around the center is
438560	443640	going faster, it's going slower around the poles and the magnetic field is going to become
443640	446200	all wrapped up after a while.
446200	450920	This is what carries the sunspots towards the equator over its 11 year cycle.
450920	457880	Further, if we combine this with another observation that the polarity of the sun reverses at every
457880	463600	minimum, then we get the full picture of the sun's basic cycle.
463600	465840	Basically it's a magnetic cycle.
465840	470800	It starts out in a normal magnetic field, after 11 years of differential rotation the
470800	476240	magnetic field has become all wrapped up, it disappears, it reformulates itself in a
476240	480080	reverse polarity and then the whole cycle repeats.
480080	485400	So if you consider the reversal, the full solar cycle lasts for about 22 years.
485400	488960	But the polarity isn't that important, so we usually think of the solar cycle as really
488960	494480	only lasting 11 years, but technically it is 22 years.
494480	500240	What produces the magnetic field, well it's thought to be produced by an interior dynamo.
500240	505720	Dynamo requires three things, rotation, conduction, and convection.
505720	510520	First of all we know the sun is rotating, second of all it's made of charged plasma,
510520	515880	so definitely got a lot of conduction going on, and third, the outer third of the sun
515880	517760	is undergoing convection.
517760	522240	The material in the convective zone is going from the top of the radiative zone up to the
522240	524480	surface of the sun to release heat.
524480	528600	So it has all three things necessary for dynamo.
528600	532160	Let's take a look at interior structure.
532160	537120	Here is the interior structure as deduced from Helios seismology, we can deduce the
537120	538680	interior motions.
538680	544000	Now the surface of the sphere in this diagram shows the zonal banding, this is the motions
544000	550480	on the outer part of the sun, and this is the banding that you see on the giant planets.
550480	554560	In the equator you see these yellow bands, these are like the trade winds, and these
554560	558960	are traveling faster than the bands above and below it.
558960	564800	The boundaries between these zones are where we expect sunspots to form.
564800	570520	On the right hand side of the diagram in the cutaway, these streamlines show circulation
570520	571800	in the interior.
571800	578120	It looks very much like Hadley's cell circulation in Venus's atmosphere, or in Earth's atmosphere.
578120	583840	The material is transported from the equator down to the pole near the surface and then
583840	590400	transported back from the pole to the equator deep in the interior of the sun.
590400	596760	The cutaway also shows that differential rotation extends through the convective zone.
596760	603400	You can see the red on the cutaway shows that it is rotating faster at the equator and it
603400	607680	changes to blue at the poles, it's rotating slower at the pole.
607680	611400	When you think about this, that it's got this Hadley's cell type circulation, and it's
611400	617040	got this differential rotation, that converging chevron pattern that we saw on the atmosphere
617040	622360	of Venus is happening in the interior of the sun.
622360	627760	You will note that the radiative zone is entirely red in the interior, and it's believed that
627760	631240	this undergoes uniform rotation.
631240	637400	The dynamo is believed to be generated right at the boundary between the convective zone
637400	638760	and the radiative zone.
638760	643560	So that turbulent boundary where you've got the differential rotation going on out here
643560	649760	and the uniform rotation going on in here, that is where they believe the dynamo is generated.
649760	657680	We're still studying the details of why and how it flips its polarity every 11 years.
657680	663400	The effects of this magnetic field, however, are rampant throughout the sun's atmosphere,
663400	666960	and the activity is best seen in high energy wavelength.
666960	668200	Let me give you some examples.
668200	670560	Here is the sun seen with visible light.
670560	672440	It's at 5500 degrees.
672440	676360	This is the emission from the photosphere, and there are several very large sunspot groups.
676360	681280	As a matter of fact, this one just below center is one of the largest sunspot groups ever
681280	682960	seen.
682960	689280	If instead a visible light, we look in ultraviolet light, here is the sun in the near ultraviolet.
689280	693760	This is emission from helium atoms at about 60,000 degrees.
693760	698080	Emission from the chromosphere, and you can see that the energy is clearly concentrated
698080	699280	in the sunspots.
699280	703920	The action on the sun is associated with those sunspots.
703920	709440	If we go further into the ultraviolet, this is emission from iron atoms at about 2 million
709440	710480	degrees.
710480	713640	Now we're seeing emission from the solar corona.
713640	718480	And the energy here is coming from the sun, associated with the sunspot regions again,
718480	720000	but it's from the magnetic field lines.
720000	722880	If you look closely, you can see sort of loopy structures.
722880	727800	These are the magnetic field lines emanating from the sunspots, and the energy is located
727800	730720	inside those magnetic field lines.
730720	734320	Finally, one last example is looking at the sun in X-ray.
734320	739240	And this is a wonderful image, because this is observations from the Yoko satellite from
739240	742280	1991 through 1999.
742280	747600	It goes from the peak of one solar cycle down through a minimum, and up to the rise of the
747600	749400	next cycle.
749400	754480	And it's easily apparent in this image to see that there's a lot of solar activity in
754480	755880	1991.
755880	760600	As you go through the minimum, there's almost no activity on the surface of the sun.
760600	765880	And then as you come back to 1999, you've got, again, lots of activity on the sun.
765880	771200	This is the changing face of the sun during its cycle.
771200	775120	Now let's take a look at the storms on the sun.
775120	782920	The sun's high energy features include active regions, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections.
782920	787280	The active regions are associated with sunspots.
787280	790840	Here is an image of a coronal loop.
790840	796800	This is plasma at about two million degrees, and it's traveling along the magnetic field
796800	799080	lines, as we saw in previous images.
799080	804120	But what you can see in this image is that it's intensely heated at the base of the
804120	805880	coronal loop.
805880	810640	The plasma is heated, it travels up the loop, it cools down, and then it comes crashing
810640	814040	down onto the sun on the other side.
814040	818720	The loops can be half a million kilometers high.
818720	824400	The sunspot groups are located in the photosphere, but as they provide the energy up into the
824400	828220	corona, they're called active regions.
828220	832800	At the tops of these coronal loops, this is where we see solar flares occur.
832800	836840	Now here is a misconception that we need to correct.
836840	841160	Sometimes you will see an image like this, and they will point to this feature in the
841160	844360	upper right hand corner, and call that a solar flare.
844360	846120	This is not a solar flare.
846120	848640	This is an extended prominence.
848640	851400	Now it looks like what we think of as a flare.
851400	856160	When you think of a flare by the side of the road, it's energy shooting off, right?
856160	858200	This is not what it is in the sun.
858200	864040	A flare in the sun is an intense energy burst, not an actual prominence of material shooting
864040	865520	away from the sun.
865520	870920	There are eruptive prominences, but they're relatively tame compared to solar flares.
870920	876320	As a matter of fact, this image here is a 60,000 degree plasma, not the million degree
876320	880600	plasma that we'll see in a solar flare.
880600	885320	The flares are just an intense release of magnetic energy.
885320	890480	Now within an active region, you have the magnetic field lines, and the plasma ions
890480	895400	are traversing across it, and they're creating pressure on these magnetic field lines.
895400	900720	When the pressure becomes too great on these magnetic field lines, they short circuit.
900720	907480	The field lines reorient themselves, and the pressure energy is released explosively.
907480	911720	I have a small little demo to give you the idea.
911720	918020	Now this is nothing like magnetic field lines, but this is a loop of wire that wants to resist
918020	923920	attempts to twist it, and as I twist it, it wants to come back in its normal position.
923920	930840	But if I start twisting hard enough, whoops, if I twist hard enough, I can collapse it
930840	933920	down to a new orientation.
933920	940280	The wire re-orients itself, and it goes to a smaller, lower energy state.
940280	944240	This is just an analogy to what happens in a solar flare.
944240	949320	In a solar flare, but it's the same idea in that the energy is released when the magnetic
949320	953880	field lines re-orient themselves and drop to a lower energy state, and all the pressure
953880	959620	that was built up to re-orient them is then released explosively.
959620	964200	This is an image of what a solar flare looks like.
964200	970920	It's not that impressive, because it's really just that bright spot right here on the surface
970920	972680	of the sun.
972680	978000	It's not that impressive in how it looks, but it's really quite impressive in its energy.
978000	980840	These are just gigantic explosions.
980840	985040	It's a burst of radio waves at the top of the loops, and then the ions of the plasma
985040	989240	that's in these loops gets accelerated and slams down into the chromosphere at millions
989240	991200	of kilometers per hour.
991200	993880	That releases a flood of X-rays.
993880	999480	So that's how we see solar flares, really, is the burst in radio waves and also a burst
999480	1001160	in X-rays.
1001160	1005960	The energy that is released in a solar flare just goes beyond our imagination.
1005960	1013520	It's about the equivalent of two billion nuclear bombs, and that just goes beyond what I myself
1013520	1017120	can realistically comprehend.
1017120	1022560	The other major eruption on the sun are called coronal mass ejections.
1022560	1025280	This is an image of a coronal mass ejection.
1025280	1028440	Actually, it's a composite image.
1028440	1030480	The outer portion is from a coronograph.
1030480	1034640	Now, in order to see the corona of the sun, you actually have to block out the light of
1034640	1035720	the sun.
1035720	1040320	So this circular feature in the center here is a disk blocking up the light of the sun
1040320	1042800	so that we can see the corona.
1042800	1047760	In the center of this disk, they've added the UV image of the sun just to show you the
1047760	1050240	scale of the sun.
1050240	1055440	In a coronal mass ejection, unlike a solar flare where there's just major, mostly energy
1055440	1059840	released, here you're actually spewing mass into space.
1059840	1066320	There are billions of tons of hot plasma that are sent streaming across interplanetary space.
1066320	1071080	All this material is just pushed out away from the sun.
1071080	1076800	This is the event that most people think of when they're thinking of a solar storm.
1077760	1082960	I have a wonderful movie here of a series of coronal mass ejections, some large and some
1082960	1083960	small.
1083960	1086200	This takes place over the course of about 20 days.
1086200	1091160	Now, if you watch closely, you can see several, there we go, coronal mass ejections, and there
1091160	1094000	are some small ones that come across.
1094000	1098640	Sometimes it bursts quite large, and sometimes they're just subtle bursts.
1098640	1101080	There.
1101080	1108480	The bright object passing in the background is actually the planet Jupiter.
1108480	1118480	And here's a sequence of several really big ones.
1118480	1120640	This is not a particularly active time on the sun.
1120640	1124720	This is just a normal one month period in the life of the sun.
1124720	1129960	The sun is continually emitting coronal mass ejections.
1129960	1134640	You also see in there the steady stream of emission from the sun, and that's the solar
1134640	1138320	wind that we'll talk about in just a minute.
1138320	1143200	We can make connections between these phenomena because we have a fleet of satellites monitoring
1143200	1146000	the sun at all times.
1146000	1149760	Here is an image of several different satellite observations.
1149760	1154960	In the upper left, we have an image with visible light.
1154960	1157600	And we can see the sunspot group in the photosphere.
1158440	1163600	In the upper right, we see the ultraviolet image where a solar flare was observed three
1163600	1167600	hours later after the visible image was taken.
1167600	1173320	In the lower left, 13 hours later, we can see the coronal mass ejection associated with
1173320	1175280	that solar flare.
1175280	1180880	And four hours after that, the coronal mass ejection from a wider angle view continues
1180880	1182560	to expand.
1182560	1189800	So we go from sunspot group to solar flare to coronal mass ejection, energy moving from
1189800	1194920	different scales from the photosphere to the chromosphere to the corona, and then spreading
1194920	1197320	out across interplanetary space.
1197320	1204600	In a few hours or a few days later, that coronal mass ejection will arrive at Earth's orbit.
1204600	1209880	And when that happens, we get a storm of particles.
1209880	1215560	This is a series of storms that are called the Halloween storms.
1215560	1223040	What you want to watch for is on October 28th at 11.42 a.m., a coronal mass ejection was
1223040	1225000	sent out towards Earth.
1225000	1230280	Three hours later, it starts arriving at the satellite, and it will be obvious when that
1230280	1232760	flood of particles reaches the satellite.
1232760	1236960	Again, you can see a few coronal mass ejections here.
1236960	1243840	Then you see a very strong one oriented straight towards Earth, and there you see the particles
1243840	1249800	as they arrive at the detector of the satellite, basically overwhelming the satellite and creating
1249800	1252640	this incredible noise on the satellite.
1252640	1262840	Another one thereafter, and a few more coronal mass ejections until the sun resumes its normal
1262840	1265440	phase.
1265440	1271440	So the sun-observing satellites take a lot of radiation hits, and this shows you the
1271440	1275880	danger of solar storms for astronauts.
1275880	1282560	This fleet of sun-observing satellites allows us to monitor the sun and will give us advanced
1282560	1284460	warning.
1284460	1290360	Some of the plasma can really be highly accelerated to almost the speed of light, and we can literally
1290360	1296280	have only 15 or 20 minutes warning the astronauts to get into the safe part of the space station,
1296280	1300460	for example.
1300460	1304200	The other thing that you see in the movies is the solar wind.
1304200	1309560	This is the steady streaming flow flowing away from the sun, and the explanation for
1309560	1311320	it is basically simple.
1311320	1316180	As we go from the photosphere to the chromosphere to the corona, the gas heats up to several
1316200	1321760	million degrees, and when you heat something, you increase its pressure.
1321760	1324760	What is there for that pressure to push on outside the sun?
1324760	1325760	Nothing.
1325760	1332400	So the thermal pressure causes this million-degree plasma to stream out away from the sun.
1332400	1335160	That's what creates the solar wind.
1335160	1341140	The speed of the solar wind is about 450 kilometers per second at the equator.
1341140	1347080	This is one and a half million kilometers per hour, or approximately a million miles
1347080	1348080	per hour.
1348080	1351480	Now, I know you've probably said, oh, we were going a million miles an hour.
1351480	1356440	Well, the solar wind truly is moving at a million miles per hour.
1356440	1362520	Still, Earth is 93 million miles away, so it'll take about 93 hours for it to reach
1362520	1366120	Earth, and that's about four days.
1366120	1370200	The crazy thing about the solar wind is that we've had the Ulysses satellite go over the
1370260	1377260	top of the sun, and we've found that the solar wind is faster at its poles.
1377260	1382340	The north and south poles, it's moving at 800 kilometers per second, and we're really
1382340	1387020	not sure why it's faster at the poles.
1387020	1391420	The other thing about the solar wind is that as it travels farther from the sun, its speed
1391420	1394660	is roughly constant throughout the planetary region.
1394660	1398260	There's really nothing to make it slow down, so there's no reason for it to change speed,
1398320	1402480	so it starts off at about 450 kilometers per second, and it continues that way all through
1402480	1404480	the region of the planet.
1404480	1408520	But you'll note that as it's going out, it's covering a larger and larger area, so the
1408520	1413120	density drops as the square of the distance from the sun.
1413120	1418360	It also carries the sun's magnetic field with it, and you combine that with the sun's rotation
1418360	1421120	as it's streaming away and the sun is rotating.
1421120	1428120	What you get is a spiral magnetic field threading through the ecliptic plane of the solar system.
1429040	1433920	So these are the solar outbursts, and when they reach Earth, they don't just slam into
1433920	1438480	the planet, they interact with Earth's magnetic field.
1438480	1443040	An Earth's magnetic field, we call the magnetosphere.
1443040	1447040	Now the magnetic field is generated by the dynamo in Earth's core.
1447040	1456040	Earth has a molten iron outer core, and when that rotates and has conduction in it, it
1456060	1462060	creates a dipole field with a north and south pole, just like a barn magnet.
1462060	1466860	Now currently, it's interesting to note that the north magnetic pole is actually located
1466860	1473540	near the south geographic pole, but this changes every few hundred thousand years.
1473540	1477060	We can measure this by looking at the mid-ocean ridges.
1477060	1481860	The magma from the interior of the Earth comes up at the mid-ocean ridges and spreads out
1481860	1484620	and creates new crust.
1484620	1490600	When the magma cools, the rocks that it creates retain the magnetic field from the time of
1490600	1491920	cooling.
1491920	1495840	So by examining the rocks at the mid-ocean ridges, we can see the history of the magnetic
1495840	1496880	field on Earth.
1496880	1501840	We find that the polarity has reversed every few hundred thousand years.
1501840	1508840	The magnetosphere is the region of the influence in space of Earth's magnetic field.
1509180	1515100	This is a drawing of the magnetosphere, and it's really not shaped like a sphere.
1515100	1519060	If there were no solar wind, it might be shaped like a sphere, but the solar wind presses
1519060	1524100	on it on the sunward side, and the magnetic pressure from the sun pushes off and creates
1524100	1525400	a bow shock.
1525400	1530360	This region of the bow shock is called the magnetopause, and it's located about 70,000
1530360	1533760	kilometers above Earth's surface.
1533760	1540640	On the anti-sumward side, the magnetic pressure of the sun draws out Earth's magnetic field
1540640	1541640	into a tail.
1541640	1546320	We call it the magnetotail, and it stretches out Earth's field to a very, very long.
1546320	1551280	It's many, many times larger than Earth's diameter, heading out on the anti-sumward
1551280	1552960	side.
1552960	1557460	Now it's very good that we have a magnetic field, because it acts as a shield against
1557460	1561640	all this radiation, the particles of the solar wind.
1561640	1568320	Most of it is blocked, but some plasma leaks through, and when it does, it creates beautiful
1568320	1571800	interactions called the aurora.
1571800	1577040	Here is an image of the aurora as seen from Earth, and this is where the solar wind particles
1577040	1579840	leak through the magnetic field.
1579840	1584320	They flow along the magnetic field lines to the poles, and they strike high in the atmosphere
1584320	1585320	and release their energy.
1585320	1590200	They're releasing their energy in the air of the atmosphere called the thermosphere.
1590200	1593360	In this image, you will notice that there's very streaky.
1593360	1598120	This is the charged particles streaking down through the atmosphere as they release their
1598120	1599840	energy.
1599840	1604360	The colors are due to the emission from the atoms in Earth's atmosphere, mostly excited
1604360	1605840	oxygen atoms.
1605840	1610920	The ions strike the oxygen atoms, excite them, and they give off characteristic lines like
1610920	1613520	the green shown in this image.
1613520	1617820	We can also see the aurora from space.
1617820	1622900	This is an image from the space shuttle, and here you can actually see the vertical structure
1622900	1623900	of the aurora.
1623900	1630780	It's sort of like this curtain of glowing light dancing atop the atmosphere.
1630780	1635620	Coronal mass ejections can lead to exceptional displays of the aurora, and this is created
1635620	1641500	by something called magnetic substorm, which is really caused by a reconnection event in
1641500	1644020	the magnetotail.
1644020	1651740	Here is a movie of such an event.
1651740	1655900	So the plasma from the sun's wind from a coronal mass ejection hits Earth's magnetic
1655900	1661300	field, bends it back, the ions load up the magnetic field, the magnetic field then starts
1661300	1666340	to collapse, has a reconnection event, and then the ions are free to flow back into the
1666340	1670420	poles where it creates the incredible aurora.
1670420	1674700	Notice that the aurora is generally a ring around the poles, around the North Pole and
1674700	1678700	around the South Pole.
1678700	1681860	Now not all particles strike Earth's atmosphere.
1681860	1686260	Not all the particles that leak into the magnetic field get all down and become part of these
1686260	1687260	auroral displays.
1687260	1691580	There are two major regions, called the Van Allen belts, where the particles have relatively
1691580	1692580	stable orbits.
1692580	1697460	There's an inner belt that's a few thousand kilometers above Earth's surface, and then
1697460	1702740	there's an outer belt that's tens of thousands of kilometers above Earth's surface.
1702740	1709740	All together, when you put this together, space can be a really dangerous place because
1709740	1714540	the inner Van Allen belt is sort of a limitation for low Earth orbit.
1714540	1718220	This is where the space shuttle, the space station, and the Hubble Space Telescope are
1718220	1719220	orbiting.
1719220	1724860	You can't go too high in low Earth orbit, otherwise you start running into the radiation
1724860	1727420	of the inner Van Allen belt.
1727420	1733300	On the outer part, the communication satellites are in what we call geosynchronous orbit,
1733300	1737140	so that they stay over the same place on Earth at all times.
1737140	1741220	That location is about 40,000 kilometers above the surface.
1741220	1746060	They have to deal with the outer Van Allen belt, and also when solar storms push on the
1746060	1751940	magnetopause, the magnetopause can actually come inside geosynchronous orbit, and these
1751940	1757300	communication satellites can be exposed to the full brunt of the solar wind.
1757300	1762300	This is how a solar storm can knock out your cell phone.
1762300	1765340	But it leads to an intriguing thought.
1765340	1769060	What happens when Earth's magnetic field reverses?
1769060	1774220	We see from the historical record that the polarity has changed.
1774220	1777300	Does that leave us unprotected to solar radiation?
1777300	1781900	The atmosphere would still absorb many of the particles, but the number reaching the
1781900	1785220	ground would greatly increase.
1785220	1791420	This may be perhaps the only time when one could see aurora at the equator.
1791420	1795180	Now we do see aurora on the outer planets.
1795180	1800380	Here for example, is an image of Jupiter, and overlaid on top of it is an ultraviolet
1800380	1804260	image that shows the aurora on the poles of Jupiter.
1804260	1807500	We also see aurora on the poles of Saturn.
1807500	1813260	This is a composite of three images with the visible and the ultraviolet images overlaid,
1813260	1819260	and you can see the changes in Saturn's aurora over the course of four days.
1819260	1822340	This is rather stronger changes than we expected.
1822340	1827420	We didn't expect there to be very much happening at Jupiter-Saturn Uranus and Neptune, because
1827420	1831620	the solar wind density is correspondingly lower at these outer planets.
1831620	1840620	It is 1.25th the density at Jupiter, and 1.100th the density at Saturn, what it is at Earth.
1840620	1846620	So the outer planets do interact with the solar wind, but not so much.
1846620	1849060	Where does it all end?
1849060	1853100	The outer boundary of the Sun's emissions is called the heliopause.
1853100	1857060	This is the point where the pressure of the solar wind pushing out equals the pressure
1857060	1862620	of the interstellar medium pushing in, the material between the stars.
1862620	1868660	It's estimated to be about 100 to 150 astronomical units away from the Sun, and it would be in
1868660	1875100	the direction of the Sun's motion as it orbits around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.
1875100	1879940	This image shows a diagram of the heliopause, as well as the trajectories of the Voyager
1879940	1881700	satellites.
1881700	1887140	You can see the inner part of the outer boundary is called the termination shock, and this
1887140	1888780	is where the solar wind slows down.
1888780	1895180	It goes from going supersonic to being subsonic, from 450 km per second to about 100 km per
1895180	1896180	second.
1896180	1899940	Outside of that, we have the heliopause where the pressure is balanced, and outside of that
1899940	1904460	we have the bow shock, where the interstellar medium dominates.
1904460	1908980	We also show the trajectories of the Voyager satellites, and Voyager 1 passed through the
1908980	1914100	termination shock in 2004, and Voyager 2 passed through it in 2006.
1914100	1918960	However, they passed through it at different distances from the Sun, showing the termination
1918960	1925380	shock distance varies, perhaps in accordance with the emissions of the Sun.
1925380	1929740	Both of them will pass through the heliopause in the next couple of decades.
1929740	1933940	Hopefully, their instruments will be sensitive enough to measure its passage through the
1933940	1938580	heliopause, and then they will travel beyond.
1938580	1941820	This is what they call the Voyager interstellar missions.
1941820	1947500	The Voyager satellites, which have explored throughout our solar system, now become interstellar
1947500	1952980	travelers wandering through our Milky Way.
1952980	1958100	In our next lectures, we will explore some strange worlds much closer to home, the many
1958100	1962340	moons of the solar system, as well as the rings of the giant planets.
1962340	1962940	We'll see you then.
