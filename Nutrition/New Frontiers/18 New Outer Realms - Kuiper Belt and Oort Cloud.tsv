0	21240	This is an amazing time to be studying the solar system.
21240	26760	The space age has given us incredible access to seeing the world of our planetary system,
26760	29880	seeing them up close and personal.
29880	34040	Our knowledge, as you've seen in the past lectures, has exploded.
34040	39400	There is so much new stuff, it really is hard to keep up with all the new discoveries from
39400	42040	all the satellite missions.
42040	49640	And yet, something even more monumental has been revealed by ground-based observing.
49640	55240	We have begun to explore a whole new realm of the solar system.
55240	61080	The familiar structure that we once learned has now been extended.
61080	67880	And this is a turning point in history, when our views change at a fundamental level.
67880	73240	It's similar to the discovery of Uranus, when we learned that other planets could exist.
73240	75840	We now know that there is more.
75840	79720	There is something new under the sun.
79720	84060	I'm talking about the Kuiper Belt, and it's not a totally new concept.
84060	87340	The ideas have been kicked around for decades.
87340	93100	Just after Pluto was discovered in 1930, an astronomer named Leonard discussed the possibility
93100	98140	that Pluto was just the first of many objects beyond Neptune.
98140	104620	In 1943, Edgeworth discussed the idea that large numbers of small bodies might have actually
104620	108060	formed in the outer solar system.
108060	115020	In 1951, Kuiper noted that a massive Pluto would scatter bodies outward.
115020	120620	And I note that in 1951, Pluto was thought to be as massive as Earth, so it would have
120620	122060	those scattering properties.
122060	126220	Now, several other postulations and formulations followed.
126220	131900	But it wasn't until 1980, when Fernandez got the idea correct.
131900	138900	We predicted a belt of comet nuclei beyond Neptune that would serve as the reservoir
138900	142380	for the short period comets that we observe.
142380	145820	Now many people don't like it being called the Kuiper Belt.
145820	149860	Basically, because he got it wrong.
149860	155140	Some people call it the Edgeworth Kuiper Belt, and nobody I know seems to call it the Fernandez
155140	157900	Belt, the guy who got it right.
157900	163540	To be politically correct, some folks call the discoveries Transneptunian Objects or
163540	166420	Scattered Disk Objects.
166420	171260	My preferences, I would just rather call it the Comet Belt.
171260	172260	That makes sense.
172260	173900	It's sort of like the asteroid belt.
173900	175980	Asteroid Belt, Comet Belt.
175980	179740	And really, that's what Fernandez called it in his paper.
179740	185180	Incidentally, I'd also like to call the Oort Cloud the Comet Cloud, but I'm not going to
185180	186940	tilt it windmills.
186940	190660	In this lecture, I'll call it the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, but you should be
190660	194620	aware that there are some naming biases.
194620	200580	The first object discovered in the Kuiper Belt was, of course, Pluto in 1930.
200580	206580	The second was Caren in 1978, but of course we didn't know there was a Kuiper Belt at
206580	208220	the time.
208220	212540	The third discovery in the Kuiper Belt, and the one that signaled the existence of the
212540	217940	Kuiper Belt, was 1992 QB1.
217940	221980	Here are the discovery images of 1992 QB1.
221980	225020	It was discovered by Dave Jewett and Jane Lu.
225020	231100	They took these four images in a telescope on Mauna Kea over the span of three and a
231100	232940	half hours.
232940	238860	Now you'll notice that the star over here on the left doesn't move in each image, whereas
238860	244220	the dot pointed to by the arrow here, this does move in each image.
244220	249740	The technique we're using here is essentially the digital version of the blink comparator
249740	254060	that was used by Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto.
254060	259180	Objects in the solar system will move across the sky on orders of hours, where of course
259180	263780	stars will not move on that time scale.
263780	268460	QB1 was found to have an orbit of 42 astronomical units.
268460	274700	For reference, Neptune's orbit is basically a circle at 30 astronomical units.
274700	279420	Pluto's orbit is elliptical, and it goes in as close as about 30 astronomical units
279420	282260	and out to about 50 astronomical units.
282260	289060	So you can see QB1 was smack dab right where Pluto was in the solar system.
289060	296020	But a lose discovery showed that Fernandez predictions were right, and six months later
296020	300060	they discovered a second object in the Kuiper Belt.
300060	305180	Now once astronomers know that the objects like this exist, well others are going to
305180	307220	join into the search.
307220	312100	The main requirement for seeing these Kuiper Belt objects was a big telescope so that you
312100	316940	could see these very faint objects and lots of observations.
316940	321620	You had to take observations hour after hour and night after night.
321620	327300	Furthermore, you needed a lot of patience to be able to search through all these observations
327300	331020	to be able to identify these objects.
331020	338180	Here is an example discovery sequence for an object called Orcus.
338180	346060	And as I move through this, if I blink forward and then backward through it, and then forward
346060	351660	through it, and backward through it, the moving object becomes rather obvious to your eye.
351660	355940	We are very attuned to seeing the changes in these images.
355940	361420	But these images are digital images, they're taken by CCD cameras and processed on computers.
361420	366980	So the procedure of identifying the moving objects is relatively easily automated.
366980	372660	What we do is we write a computer program that first aligns all the images, and then
372660	375900	we'll subtract one image from the other.
375900	381220	And it will look for residuals between the images that are moving.
381220	387860	Using techniques like this, within years hundreds of Kuiper Belt objects were discovered.
387860	393900	And almost all the searches were done using ground based telescopes, simply because you
393900	400940	needed a lot of telescope time and it's very hard to get that much time on a satellite mission.
400940	405980	Now the objects that they discovered, well, if I put my tongue in cheek, I might describe
405980	410260	them as massive mutant giant comets.
410260	415100	Here's an artist's depiction of one, and its name is Kwa-Wa.
415100	418620	And it's about 1300 kilometers across.
418620	422940	Its composition is mostly ice with some rock.
422940	427220	It is similar in size to the medium sized moons of the solar system.
427220	431900	And so its surface, as depicted here, is imagined to be similar as well.
431900	436940	Mostly icy, a bunch of craters on it, lots of cracks.
436940	440660	Now Kwa-Wa is one of the larger Kuiper Belt objects.
440660	444180	Most of the Kuiper Belt objects we've discovered are significantly smaller.
444180	448980	The Kuiper Belt objects cover about the same sizes as the moons cover, from kilometer sized
448980	453900	objects up to thousands of kilometers, except the Kuiper Belt objects don't cover the same
453980	460420	realm, they don't cover the size of the seven largest moons of our solar system.
460420	464260	Now I need to discuss one individual Kuiper Belt object.
464260	468180	This is the object now known as Eris.
468180	475140	Originally it was called 2003 UB313, that was its discovery name, and then it was nicknamed
475140	477700	by its discoverer Xena.
477700	483860	You'll find all three of those names referenced in articles and books.
483860	491500	Here are the discovery images for Eris from the Keck telescope, and as I go through them,
491500	496460	you can see there are just three images of a poorly resolved blob.
496460	501060	But that was enough for a remarkable discovery.
501060	506860	Because taking follow up images and doing orbit calculations, we found that Eris was
506860	510580	at a distance of 97 astronomical units.
510780	517660	Again, Neptune is at 30 astronomical units, Eris is over three times farther away, and
517660	521780	also has a very highly elliptical orbit.
521780	529700	Here is a drawing of Eris's orbit, 2003 UB313 at the time this plot was made, and here
529700	535780	is Pluto's orbit, and here are the orbits of working outward in Neptune, Uranus, Saturn,
535780	537260	and Jupiter.
537260	542660	You can see that Eris was discovered near its app Helium, near its farthest point from
542660	543660	the Sun.
543660	549180	It actually goes out just a little bit further to 97 and a half AU, and it gets in as close
549180	552180	to the Sun as 40 AU.
552180	559020	It is the most distant solar system object known, and it shows that Kuiper Belt objects
559020	563100	can be scattered out to very, very large distances.
563100	569140	Now if it's at that large distance, that means it has to be very bright to be seen,
569140	572580	and therefore very big.
572580	580500	Upon its discovery, its diameter was estimated to be up to twice the diameter of Pluto.
580500	584580	We couldn't measure it with the original discovery images, but we put Hubble to that
584580	586620	task.
586620	591180	And here we show you the Hubble image of Eris.
591180	592460	It's not that impressive.
592460	600300	It's just a few pixels, but it's enough to estimate, with a good degree of accuracy,
600300	602300	the size of Eris.
602300	607460	It turned out that it's only 10% larger than Pluto.
607460	612740	But the important thing is it's bigger nonetheless.
612740	619180	Later we found that Eris had a moon, and here is the image from Keck of Eris and its moon,
619180	621700	which is named Dysnomia.
621700	627960	And this makes it look a lot like Pluto, because here is a Kuiper Belt object, and here it
627960	634060	has a moon, so it has the same characteristics as Pluto, but bigger.
634060	638860	And the discoverer started calling it the 10th planet.
638860	640580	It isn't the 10th planet.
640580	645660	What was really happening was this was the beginning of the end of Pluto being the 9th
645660	646740	planet.
646740	648660	But I won't discuss that today.
648660	652500	We'll discuss that in the next lecture.
652500	657740	Now we want to look at the whole population of these outer solar system's small bodies.
657740	663260	There's over 1200 of them discovered so far, and we categorize them into several groups
663260	666260	on the basis of their orbits.
666260	669700	Here is the overhead view of the outer solar system.
669700	676260	Again, these blue orbits here working from in out are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
676260	683580	Almost everything else you see in this plot was discovered in the last couple decades.
683580	689180	All these objects outside of Neptune's orbit, all these red and white objects out here,
689180	691860	these are the Kuiper Belt objects.
691860	696780	We really have discovered a whole new region of the solar system.
696780	701020	You'll note that there's a pretty strong falloff in these objects, whether you're looking
701020	706420	inside of 30 AU, inside of Neptune's orbit, or outside of 50 AU.
706420	711260	Now it's not just our observational biases, we would have seen the objects if they did
711260	714020	exist outside of 50 AU.
714020	719620	So from 30 AU to 50 AU is taken as the boundaries of the Kuiper Belt, but you can see from here
719620	720780	that it's not really absolute.
720780	725460	There are some that go in, and some that goes out.
725460	730060	Inside of the orbit of Neptune, there are some that are scattered throughout.
730060	735500	And then there are some that are highly concentrated around Jupiter's orbit.
735500	738020	In this plot, there are also some blue squares.
738020	742900	These aren't Kuiper Belt objects, they are comets, and they sort of confuse the plot
742900	744060	a little bit.
744060	749340	Also, you'll note at the bottom of this plot, there's this sort of gap in the Kuiper Belt.
749340	751820	This is not objects that are missing.
751820	756900	This is due to the plane of our galaxy, and the dense star field in our galaxy makes spotting
756900	760340	the Kuiper Belt objects difficult there.
760340	765020	So let's compare this outer solar system plot to the inner solar system plot.
765020	771780	Wow, the first thing that you notice, there's a lot of asteroids, all these green objects.
771780	776540	We know of over 150,000 asteroids.
776540	781900	But once you get over that, you say, OK, well, it's still got that same sort of fuzzy appearance
781900	787100	as the Kuiper Belt, and there's stuff scattered inward and stuff scattered outward.
787100	790620	So the two belts are roughly comparable.
790620	795100	The outer circle in this diagram is the orbit of Jupiter.
795100	801660	And at the orbit of Jupiter, you see these blue objects appear in two groups.
801660	805900	One is ahead of Jupiter in its orbit, and one is behind Jupiter in its orbit.
805900	810900	These are spots where Jupiter's gravity roughly balances out that of the Sun, and they're
810900	815620	relatively stable positions for these Trojans to occupy.
815620	821500	Now we call them the Trojan asteroids, but observations and theory really indicate that
821500	823660	they're likely made of ice.
823660	828220	So perhaps we should call these the Trojan comets.
828220	833980	Now the outer solar system families can be examined in a series of three plots here,
833980	836380	and they all have the same color coding to them.
836380	839900	So let me take a little time to explain the color coding.
839900	844860	The y-axis on this plot is a quantity called color index, and you don't really need to
844860	846140	worry about it.
846140	852140	But just so you know, the larger the color index indicates a bluer color for the object,
852140	855300	and the smaller index indicates a redder color.
855300	860100	The x-axis is the one we're concerned with on this plot, and it's the semi-major axis
860100	864100	of the orbit, and this is how we discriminate the families.
864100	868820	Over here on the left, plotted in cyan, are the Trojans, and these are the ones that share
868860	870980	the orbit with Jupiter.
870980	874260	The green objects are centaurs.
874260	878100	They are distributed inside the orbit of Neptune.
878100	883460	And Triton, Neptune's largest moon, that was probably a centaur that was captured into
883460	886660	orbit by Neptune.
886660	893140	These red objects here around 40 AU, you can see they have a very, very tight distribution.
893140	896880	These share a 3 to 2 resonance with Neptune.
896880	901360	Where every 3 orbits Neptune makes around the sun, these objects make 2 orbits around
901360	905680	the sun, and that locks them in to their orbit.
905680	911360	These are called resonant Kuiper Belt objects, and Pluto is the most prominent member of
911360	914400	the resonant Kuiper Belt object family.
914400	920200	Just outside that we have the magenta objects, and these are your classical Kuiper Belt objects.
920200	924040	These are the ones that would be the corollary to the main belt, asteroids, the ones shown
924080	927000	in green for the inner solar system plot.
927000	932120	Finally, at the outermost, we have the scattered Kuiper Belt objects.
932120	939360	These extend out well beyond the classical cutoff radius of the Kuiper Belt, and Eris
939360	943560	is a scattered Kuiper Belt object.
943560	950920	If we then plot the same color index versus the orbit eccentricity, you can see other
950920	953480	correlations.
953560	958880	The semi-ah axis is just the average distance from the sun, but the eccentricity indicates
958880	962000	how close and how far away you get from the sun.
962000	967040	The difference between your perihelion and aphelion.
967040	971760	On the left hand side here, you can see the magenta and the cyan, and you can see that
971760	976880	the Trojans and the classical Kuiper Belt objects, their orbits are mostly circular.
976880	979760	They're relatively small eccentricities.
979760	984120	Going to the right, you can see the red objects, the resident Kuiper Belt objects, and their
984120	990520	orbits are somewhat elliptical, but the centaurs and the scattered Kuiper Belt objects are
990520	992400	very elliptical.
992400	998680	These have ellipticities ranging from about 0.3 on up to about 0.6.
998680	1005280	This can be understood in terms of the degree of interaction with the planet Neptune.
1005280	1009560	These resident objects, they have some interaction, so their eccentricity is pumped up a little
1009560	1010560	bit.
1010560	1016120	The centaurs have a strong interaction, and they're sent inward of Neptune's orbit and
1016120	1018840	develop these highly elliptical orbits.
1018840	1023440	The scattered objects also have a strong interaction with Neptune, and these are then scattered
1023440	1027240	outward, well beyond the orbit of Neptune.
1027240	1033320	So what we see is that Neptune plays a dominant role in determining the structure of the Kuiper
1033320	1035200	Belt.
1035200	1041480	If we look at an overplot of some Kuiper Belt object orbits, you can see how they key off
1041480	1043640	of Neptune's orbit.
1043640	1048840	Even these scattered objects that go way out for their apheleon have their perihelion
1048840	1052840	in the vicinity of Neptune's orbit.
1052840	1059000	Neptune's gravity dominates the motion of the objects in this region.
1059000	1064040	We have one other comment about the orbits, and it's really a non-comment.
1064040	1069760	Here we plot that same color index, but now we're plotting it against orbit inclinations.
1069760	1073840	And you can see that the orbit inclinations go from zero, which would be in the plane
1073840	1077920	of the ecliptic, up to about 30 degrees.
1077920	1084240	But you can also see that the orbit inclinations here do not show any trends by family.
1084240	1088120	All of the families cover essentially all of the region.
1088120	1092480	So the whole outer cellular system is not flat in the plane of the ecliptic, but it's
1092480	1099840	rather puffed up plus or minus 30 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic.
1099840	1104440	Now the Kuiper Belt is the source of the short period comets.
1104440	1108480	Objects are scattered inward by Neptune to become centars, and then they're scattered
1108480	1113480	by the giant planets to go to the inner part of the solar system and become comets.
1113480	1117600	The question then is, what about the long period comets?
1117600	1119600	Where do they come from?
1119600	1124760	To understand this, you have to look at some common statistics.
1124760	1131840	This histogram here shows the comets, and the x-axis is a quantity called the inverse
1131840	1133480	semi-major axis.
1133480	1139160	It's 1 over the semi-major axis, and we use this quantity because when you get these really
1139160	1145160	long orbits that can be 5,000 or 10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000 years, your plot stretches
1145160	1146760	out a long, long way.
1146760	1152840	But if you take the inverse, all of the really long orbits bunch together.
1152840	1156280	So you can see two peaks in this plot.
1156280	1159640	One is at an orbital period about 7 years.
1159640	1164640	This is a peak in the orbital period of short period comets.
1164640	1169400	The other one is essentially at infinite orbital period.
1169400	1175960	Most of the comets we have ever seen have these really, really long orbits.
1175960	1180240	And if they've got these long orbits, it naturally means that they're very elongated
1180240	1181480	orbits.
1181480	1188920	Here is a plot of the orbit eccentricity for comets, and you can see that there are a
1188920	1193040	few that have reasonable eccentricities.
1193040	1197560	But over here on the right hand side, you can see towards one, which is essentially
1197560	1201460	so elongated that you're almost like a line.
1201460	1206280	This is where most of the comets pile up.
1206280	1211980	We can only see comets that pass through the inner solar system, so if they have these
1211980	1218420	very large orbit sizes, they also have to have large eccentricity, otherwise they wouldn't
1218420	1221780	come into the inner solar system.
1221780	1230000	Most of the comets we have seen are so elliptical that the orbits are almost hyperbolic.
1230000	1236120	The other important piece of information is about the orbit inclinations.
1236120	1240920	As shown in this histogram, you can see that there are a significant number of low inclination
1240920	1246400	comets, those say less than about 15 or 20 degrees here.
1246400	1249200	These would be dominated by the short period comets.
1249200	1252720	These are the ones that would be orbiting in the ecliptic plane.
1252720	1258320	The rest of the comets really show no preference for inclination.
1258320	1261680	Their orbits are tilted at all directions.
1261680	1267040	Now you'll note there's a small drop in the data near 180 degrees.
1267040	1272040	Those orbits would actually be retrograde orbits in the ecliptic plane, and such orbits
1272040	1276280	would suffer increased scattering by the giant planet, so you can understandable that there
1276280	1280520	might be a few less comets in those types of orbits.
1280520	1287520	So if we put those ideas together, most comets come from way out in the solar system.
1287520	1291060	Most comets come from any direction on the sky.
1291060	1297680	This naturally suggests a reservoir that is spherical for the long period comets, and
1297680	1300320	we call it the Oort cloud.
1300320	1306120	Now this time the name is actually correct, because Jan Oort is the one who predicted
1306120	1310600	it and he did get it right.
1310600	1315840	Here is an artist's impression of the Oort cloud, and the idea is simply that it's a
1315840	1324360	huge cloud of comets, and how huge its radius is about 50,000 astronomical units.
1324360	1328680	That totally redefines the idea of an outer solar system.
1328680	1336080	Previously we were talking about 030 to 50 AU, now we're talking 50,000 AU.
1336080	1341240	That extends a thousand times farther than the Kuiper Belt.
1341240	1347520	Now I want you to note that in this diagram, the scale on this drawing is logarithmic.
1347520	1353960	So you can see the planet orbits in here, that's within about 10 AU, or up to 30 AU
1353960	1359600	for Neptune, and then out to about 100 AU for the Kuiper Belt, and then you get 1, 2,
1359600	1365080	3 more factors of 10 to get out to the scale of the Oort cloud.
1365080	1371920	We believe that the outer Oort cloud probably contains billions of comets, and that as you
1371920	1376920	can see from this drawing, that the inner parts of the Oort cloud are concentrated along
1376920	1379400	the plane of the ecliptic.
1379400	1389080	Now I say probably, and believe, because we've actually never seen a comet in the Oort cloud.
1389080	1395280	These comets would be way, way, way too far away to verify that the Oort cloud exists.
1395280	1403480	So while the Kuiper Belt has been truly discovered and well observed, the Oort cloud is a very
1403480	1411120	well motivated but still largely theoretical region of the solar system.
1411120	1419280	There is one observation that might point the way, and this is an object called Sedna.
1419280	1426320	Here is one of the discovery images of Sedna, and again, it's just a tiny speck of light.
1426320	1431120	It is so small that even Hubble couldn't really resolve it.
1431120	1434440	Here are two images of Sedna from Hubble.
1434440	1439960	On the right is the stationary image, and it's the best image we could get of Sedna,
1439960	1445480	and it's so few pixels that you really couldn't figure out the size of Sedna from it.
1445480	1450920	What we had to do is shown in the image on the left, we let Sedna drift across the field
1450920	1458920	of view, and we measured the thickness of the line it left on the image, and using statistics
1458920	1464480	we could then measure the thickness of the line and estimate the size of Sedna.
1464480	1468840	Sedna turns out to be like a large object found in the Kuiper Belt.
1468840	1476680	It's about three quarters the size of Pluto, but what makes Sedna special is it is located
1476680	1480360	beyond the range of the Kuiper Belt.
1480360	1491520	Its orbit stretches from a perihelion of 76 AU all the way out to an apheleon at 840 AU.
1491520	1495520	This is a no man's land in the solar system.
1495520	1501520	It's outside of where we expect to find Kuiper Belt objects, but yet it's inside of where
1501520	1504800	we expect to find objects in the inner Oort cloud.
1504800	1510800	And if you talk to the theorists, they don't really know why it exists there.
1510800	1514640	Now remember that when we were talking about the scattered Kuiper Belt objects, all of
1514640	1520200	their perihelions scattered off of Neptune, they were in close to the orbit of Neptune
1520200	1525640	so you can see the scattering of Neptune push them out to these large radiuses.
1525640	1535160	What is at the distances of 76 AU or 840 AU that would scatter Sedna to create this orbit?
1535160	1540880	Or maybe Sedna is like Pluto when it was discovered in 1930.
1540880	1547400	Maybe it is just the first object in a yet to be discovered population.
1547400	1553360	Here is a movie that shows Sedna's orbit and sort of recapitulates what we've covered
1553360	1557160	in a lot of this lecture.
1557160	1562600	Starts out showing the inner Solar System orbits, the rocky planets, and then the asteroid
1562600	1567600	belt around that quickly moves through the giant planets Pluto's orbit and the Kuiper
1567600	1568600	Belt.
1568600	1573800	Here is Sedna appearing outside that, and you can see Sedna's orbit well outside the
1573800	1580800	Kuiper Belt, but it's also well inside the confines where we expect the inner Oort cloud
1580800	1583240	to be.
1583240	1591600	So finally in this lecture I want you to recognize that we have reached the edge of
1591600	1594280	the Solar System.
1594280	1601120	This is an artist depiction of what it looks like at the radius of Sedna.
1601120	1608560	What the Sun, over on the right hand side, recognize that the human eye has a resolution
1608560	1611440	of about one arc minute.
1611440	1616520	The Sun as seen from Earth is 30 arc minutes.
1616520	1623200	As you move further from Earth, the Sun gets smaller on the sky, roughly linearly, so the
1623200	1632480	Sun from Neptune would be one arc minute, and to the human eye it would be unresolved.
1632480	1638600	From any object out in the Kuiper Belt, the Sun would look just like any other star in
1638600	1639600	the sky.
1639600	1645760	Now it would be overwhelmingly the brightest star, but still just another star.
1645760	1651000	And if you go all the way out to the 50,000 AU of the Oort cloud, the Sun wouldn't even
1651000	1655040	necessarily be the brightest star at all times.
1655040	1659240	Other stars in our galaxy could move close enough that they would be brighter in your
1659240	1663400	sky than our own Sun.
1663400	1673840	This is out so far it is where our Solar System merges with the Milky Way Galaxy.
1673840	1680320	Next time we will discuss the reorganization of the Solar System that is inspired by these
1680320	1683560	discoveries of the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud.
1683560	1688200	This is the 21st century view of the Solar System, and we will discuss how it changes
1688200	1694440	our view of Pluto and forces us to reconsider just what a planet is.
1694440	1695440	We'll see you then.
1695440	1695760	Take care.
