0	28400	How many of you have heard this phrase?
29400	34400	My very energetic mother just served us nine pizzas.
34400	38400	I'm sure that many of you memorized it in school.
38400	42400	It is, for those who know it, a mnemonic for the nine planets.
42400	52400	This is the mnemonic for Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.
53400	58400	But in the modern solar system, that's no longer accurate.
58400	62400	That's the viewpoint we had at the beginning of the space age.
62400	67400	As my kids tell me, Dad, that's so last millennium.
67400	77400	We now only count eight planets, and the structure of the solar system can't be viewed so simplistically as just being the sun and the planets.
77400	82400	In this course, we have progressed through various perspectives on the solar system.
82400	86400	The geocentric, the Earth-centered geometry of the solar system.
86400	90400	The heliocentric, the sun-centered philosophical shift.
90400	96400	The gravitational perspective, where the orbits of the planets were physics-based.
96400	103400	And the space age perspective, where we move from being observers to being explorers of our solar system.
104400	110400	We have now filled out our knowledge to take on the 21st century view of the solar system.
110400	115400	This view is based on the idea of families of objects.
115400	117400	We have the sun in the center.
117400	120400	It is surrounded by the rocky planets.
120400	123400	Outside of those are the asteroid belt.
123400	130400	Then come the giant planets, followed by the Kuiper belt, and out at the very edge, the Oort cloud.
131400	136400	These six families define the basic structure of the solar system.
136400	144400	And this bullseye diagram is a useful way to mentally organize the structure of our solar system.
144400	150400	Now, I've presented these ideas for about a decade, and I've had kindergartners tell me,
150400	154400	But wait, Pluto is still a planet. I read it on the internet.
154400	160400	Well, I try to be gentle with them, and I ask them to give me some scientific arguments,
160400	168400	and not just rely on authority, whether it's my authority or the questionable authority of the internet.
168400	173400	At the Space Telescope Science Institute, we developed a lesson plan,
173400	178400	where the kids sort the solar system based solely on the data.
178400	185400	And what we found is that the adults, the teachers that we give it to, they like it even more than the kids.
185400	189400	Here's what we do. We start with a table of numbers.
189400	194400	These are the characteristics of 16 solar system objects.
194400	202400	The number of moons they have, the orbit size, the orbit shape, the orbit inclination, their size, their mass, and their composition.
202400	208400	Now, what's most important about this table is that we don't identify the objects with names.
208400	214400	We just give them numbers. We want the sorting to be anonymous.
214400	220400	When you look at a table of numbers like this, those of you who have math phobia will be scared by it.
220400	223400	Many people are, oh, wow, this table of numbers just scares me.
223400	230400	I got to say, as an astronomer, I just love tables with numbers, and I start looking at them and trying to sort them in my head.
230400	235400	To make it more friendly for most people, what do you do? You graph them.
235400	243400	So here is a graph of the number of moons, and you can see very easily, right, just looking at the graph,
243400	252400	that most of the objects have very few moons or no moons, and there are four objects that have many moons.
252400	261400	If we look at orbit shape, you can see, again, a trend that the dominant number of objects have roughly circular orbits,
261400	268400	and there are some that are more elliptical, and then there's one way up here around the ellipticity of 0.45.
268400	271400	Number four has a strongly elliptical orbit.
271400	277400	Then you could look at orbit tilt, and, again, you get the same sort of characteristic
277400	282400	that there are most of them less than 10 degrees away from the ecliptic plane,
282400	289400	and then some that are more tilted, and the maximum here is also object four.
289400	296400	That suggests that the characteristics of orbit shape and orbit tilt might be correlated.
296400	304400	So what you can do then is plot orbit shape versus orbit tilt, and indeed, you do find a rough trend.
304400	311400	The objects that have more elliptical shape in their orbit tend to have more tilted orbit.
311400	318400	Conversely, those with more circular orbits, those that are lower on the plot, will tend to be more left.
318400	324400	This sort of linear correlation, it's a rough linear correlation between orbit shape and orbit tilt.
324400	332400	This is how you explore the data of the solar system, and you can make lots of plots and explore many different trends,
332400	339400	but the punchline comes when you plot the size of the object versus its distance from the sun,
339400	343400	and immediately you can see four distinct groups fall out.
343400	349400	The objects are grouped not only by their different distances away from the sun,
349400	356400	there are different regions as you go out from the sun, but they also are grouped into different sized objects,
356400	362400	and the different regions all hold different sized objects.
362400	371400	Furthermore, if you look at the compositions of these objects, you can see that each group has a distinct composition.
371400	379400	This group over here is rocky, this group are all gaseous, these are ice and some rock, these are rock and some ice.
379400	386400	Furthermore, you can see other correlations by going back to the data table, that these objects up here, the gaseous ones,
386400	392400	they all have many moons, and these rocky ones, these gaseous ones, they have mostly circular orbits,
392400	399400	and the other two groups down here and in the bottom, they have more elliptical orbits and more tilted orbits.
399400	405400	Just by examining the data, you can start to pull out the groupings in the solar system.
405400	414400	Now, these groupings are, of course, the rocky planets over here, the gas giant planets up here, or the giant planets, as they're sometimes called up here,
414400	421400	down bottom, we have the asteroid belt, and over here on the right in the bottom, we have the Kuiper belt.
421400	431400	The data selection that goes into this plot is biased only in that I chose the four largest members in each of these four groups,
431400	438400	but a full plot of all the objects in the solar system still would, well, I guess it would be a lot messier,
438400	447400	there would be stuff scattering in and out from the Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt, but the four groups would still be blatantly obvious.
447400	458400	So, this 21st century solar system, this diagram that I'm promoting here, is not some organization that is imposed upon the solar system from without,
458400	463400	but rather, it grows naturally out of the data.
463400	468400	So, if you want to memorize the new solar system, you need all this.
468400	477400	Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, asteroid belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud.
477400	482400	Well, I took this as a challenge, and I came up with this.
482400	491400	Science may view established models as basic justified standards until new knowledge bears out changes.
491400	496400	Now, that was intentionally tongue-in-cheek, using the mnemonic to comment on the situation.
496400	502400	And I know if people were actually going to try to memorize this, they wouldn't want to give up on their very energetic mother that easily.
502400	505400	So, we came up with an alternate one.
505400	514400	Sometimes, my very energetic mother also boils jumbo shrimp using nine kettles bubbling over coals.
514400	520400	That is the new solar system, and it's quite a mouthful.
520400	526400	At this point, somebody always asks, what about Pluto?
526400	530400	Well, Pluto fits neatly into the Kuiper belt.
530400	538400	It was number eight in those plots, and its characteristics, as shown in those plots, are the same as the other Kuiper belt objects.
538400	543400	By the way, number four, the outlier in those two plots, that was Eris.
543400	550400	Pluto is no longer an oddball. It now has a family.
550400	556400	But people still say that I learned Pluto was a planet. What happened here?
556400	561400	And to that, I have to respond, what is a planet?
561400	571400	Because if you look at the history, the number of planets and the definition of a planet has fluctuated strongly.
571400	573400	Let's start with the geocentric model.
573400	578400	The Earth is at the center, and then you have the Sun, Moon, and five planets.
578400	584400	Of course, the Sun and the Moon, they move across the sky. They're like planets, so perhaps you could call it seven planets.
584400	591400	And then we move to the heliocentric model. In 1543, we had the Copernican Revolution, where Earth became a planet.
591400	597400	And we determined that the Sun was at the center, and the Moon orbited around Earth, so they're definitely not planets.
597400	599400	So now we have six planets.
599400	604400	In 1610, Galileo discovered the moons of Jupiter.
604400	609400	Here are some of his notes observing the moons of Jupiter moving around Jupiter.
609400	613400	And these moons of Jupiter were called planets at the time.
613400	616400	So then we jumped to having ten planets.
616400	623400	Later, Huygens and Cassini discovered five moons of Saturn, so you could say we had fifteen planets.
623400	629400	Although I'll note in 1698, Huygens refers to them as ten secondary planets.
629400	635400	Earth has one moon, Jupiter has four moons, Saturn has five moons, that makes ten moons.
635400	641400	So these are now called by him secondary planets, so really we're back to six major planets.
642400	650400	In 1781, William Herschel used this telescope here, this measly little seven-foot telescope.
650400	653400	He used this to discover Uranus.
653400	655400	Then we had seven planets.
655400	661400	And more importantly, Herschel showed that new planets could exist.
661400	672400	It was also fashionable at that time to use the Titus Bode rule, which predicted the positions of the planet in the solar system, in their distances away from the sun.
672400	679400	Important point is that the Titus Bode rule predicted a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
679400	682400	In 1801, Piazzi discovered such a planet.
682400	684400	It was named Ceres.
684400	687400	And so the missing planet was found, and now we had eight planets.
687400	689400	But that didn't last long.
689400	696400	In 1802, Olbers discovered another object in the same area, Pallas, nine planets.
696400	700400	1804, Harding discovered Juno, ten planets.
700400	706400	And in 1807, Olbers again discovered Vesta, eleven planets.
706400	713400	These are what we now consider the four largest asteroids, and here are their orbits.
713400	718400	You can see that all four of them orbit between Mars and Jupiter.
718400	724400	Things are looking a little messy, but they sort of fit with the Titus Bode rule.
724400	730400	Except in 1845, we added a fifth asteroid, Astrea.
730400	733400	Now we have 12 planets.
733400	739400	In 1846, there was a new planet predicted by these two gentlemen.
739400	742400	On the left side is Urban Le Verrier, he was French.
742400	745400	And on the right side is John Couch Adams, he was English.
745400	754400	They both predicted a new planet outside of Uranus based upon the perturbations observed in the orbit of Uranus.
754400	760400	They couldn't get anybody to look for it in their own countries, so it actually ended up that the Germans discovered it.
760400	762400	That was Neptune.
762400	765400	Neptune, when it was discovered, was the 13th planet.
765400	771400	Shortly thereafter, in the 1850s, we reclassified the asteroid belt.
771400	776400	All of those five objects that had previously been discovered became part of the asteroid belt.
776400	785400	And that's a good thing, because hundreds of these asteroids were discovered in this region between Mars and Jupiter in the ensuing decades.
785400	790400	So after being up in the teens, the number of planets is now down to eight again.
791400	797400	In 1850s, during the 1850s, we also had a couple of mistaken discoveries of planets.
797400	802400	In 1851, there was a discovery of a planet at 137 AU.
802400	806400	That's four and a half times Neptune's distance from the Sun.
806400	808400	Nine planets.
808400	815400	In 1859, Lescarbeau sees a planet transit the Sun, and he calls it Vulcan.
815400	825400	This perhaps would have been ignored, except for six months later, the Verrier, who had predicted Neptune, also predicted a planet interior to Mercury.
825400	828400	So now we have ten planets.
828400	836400	It wasn't until 1879 that the error was found in this way, way out outer planet, and so then we go back to nine planets.
836400	844400	Vulcan, for its part, was never observed again, and in 1916, general relativity was able to explain the orbit of Mercury.
845400	848400	So it showed that there never was any need for Vulcan.
848400	851400	Again, back to eight planets.
851400	856400	At the same time, Percival Lowell was searching for planet X.
856400	865400	And in 1930, this man, Clyde Tombaugh, found Pluto, and Pluto became the ninth planet.
865400	873400	It stayed that way until 2006, when the International Astronomical Union demoted Pluto
873400	875400	to become a dwarf planet.
875400	881400	And once again, we're back at eight planets.
881400	890400	Note that the 2006 IAU definition was actually the first official definition of a planet.
890400	894400	There were a lot of unofficial definitions previous in history.
894400	900400	You see, the word planet comes from a Greek word that means wanderer.
900400	903400	These are the wanderers in the night sky.
903400	909400	While the sun and moon and stars showed regular motions, the planets wandered back and forth.
909400	912400	They showed retrograde motion.
912400	920400	In the heliocentric view, the planets were the objects that orbit the sun, and then moons would orbit around planets.
920400	927400	Later, as we got into the gravitational perspective of the solar system, Kepler's laws defined how planets should behave.
927400	931400	An object was a planet if it followed Kepler's laws.
931400	934400	Although, for some reason, comets didn't count.
934400	936400	We knew of a lot of comets then.
936400	940400	They obeyed Kepler's laws, but they didn't count as planets.
940400	947400	A bit later, when the Titus Bode rule was in fashion, planets were those objects that were specified by that rule.
947400	956400	When Uranus was discovered, it was consistent with the rule, and the first asteroids, they were consistent, but Neptune didn't fit.
956400	961400	So then we fell back to what I would call a non-specific definition of a planet.
961400	964400	And really, that was the definition I grew up with.
964400	967400	Planets are the major objects orbiting the sun.
967400	972400	We just don't specify how we define major.
972400	975400	Now we come to Pluto.
975400	980400	Pluto was originally estimated at seven Earth masses.
980400	982400	Seven Earth masses.
982400	985400	That qualifies it as a major planet.
985400	989400	However, soon it became the incredible shrinking planet.
989400	992400	It was quickly seen to be smaller than predicted.
992400	998400	As early as the 1940s, the estimates of its size had gone down to about one Earth mass.
998400	1005400	And as observations got better and better, the estimates of Pluto's size got smaller and smaller.
1005400	1010400	In 1978, its moon, Caren, was discovered.
1010400	1015400	And this helped reinforce the idea that Pluto was a planet because planets have moons around them.
1015400	1018400	Pluto as a moon reinforces the idea that it's a planet.
1018400	1025400	Still, the 1980 estimates of its mass was one tenth of Earth's mass.
1025400	1033400	I actually have seen a very humorous plot made by a scientist that plots Pluto's size versus time, showing it how it decreases.
1033400	1039400	And if you extrapolated that plot, it should entirely disappear before the year 2000.
1039400	1048400	Well, in 1985, we had Caren transit in front of Pluto and were able to get a real size and mass estimate.
1048400	1051400	And it was tiny.
1051400	1057400	Pluto's mass is only two thousandths of an Earth mass.
1057400	1063400	Our moon is six times more massive than Pluto.
1063400	1069400	Here is a comparison of the seven large moons of the solar system with Pluto.
1069400	1072400	All of them are larger than Pluto.
1072400	1078400	And you can see Pluto's kind of fuzzy here, but unfortunately that's the best image we have of Pluto.
1078400	1085400	So it sort of makes you question, why do we call it a planet?
1085400	1092400	Furthermore, starting in 1992, we discovered all these objects in the Kuiper Belt.
1092400	1099400	These are all in the same region of space as Pluto, and they all have similar characteristics.
1099400	1105400	So when we were building the Hayden Planetarium in 2000, this is the Rose Center for Earth and Space,
1105400	1111400	and the Hayden Planetarium is located in the top of that sphere, when we were doing the exhibits there,
1111400	1115400	we decided not to call Pluto a planet.
1115400	1124400	The reason, and my fellow curators and I discussed this at length, was that first we wanted to adopt a 21st century view of the solar system.
1124400	1132400	And more importantly, we expected that Kuiper Belt objects larger than Pluto would be found,
1132400	1137400	and we were creating exhibits that had to last decades.
1137400	1141400	Well, it happened faster than we actually thought it would happen.
1141400	1147400	In 2003, Eris was discovered, and it's 10% larger than Pluto.
1147400	1159400	And this is the discovery that forces the issue, because you can't continue to call Pluto a planet without also calling Eris a planet.
1159400	1166400	As it turns out, the International Astronomical Union had already been trying to define a planet.
1166400	1172400	For several years, they'd had a committee of experts meeting, but the experts could not reach consensus.
1172400	1177400	Some of them demanded that Pluto remain a planet, and some of them demanded that Pluto not be considered a planet,
1177400	1180400	and they just couldn't come to an agreement.
1180400	1186400	So in 2006, they formed an alternative committee, and they created a proposal.
1186400	1193400	Now to understand the proposal, first you must understand the definition of a star, which is something I think everybody agrees on.
1193400	1200400	Stars are powered by nuclear fusion in their core, and normal stars use hydrogen fusion.
1200400	1205400	They fuse four atoms of hydrogen and make one nucleus of helium.
1205400	1213400	For lower masses, you can also have fusion that occurs for deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen.
1213400	1221400	And deuterium fusion can occur for objects that are about 15 times the mass of Jupiter to about 70 times the mass of Jupiter.
1221400	1225400	We call these objects brown dwarfs.
1225400	1233400	So, the initial proposal at the IAU of how to define a planet was this.
1233400	1236400	First, it has to orbit a star.
1236400	1244400	Second, it has to be small enough that it avoids any type of fusion, deuterium fusion, or hydrogen fusion.
1244400	1249400	Third, it has to be large enough for gravity to make it spherical.
1249400	1265400	In that proposal, they defined 12 planets, taking the usual 9, adding in Karen as a planet, adding in Eris as a planet, and also reinstating Ceres as a planet.
1265400	1275400	Now when this proposal was examined, some folks said it implied that there were actually 40 planets in the solar system, not the 12 in the proposal.
1275400	1283400	The big problem with this whole proposal was that the committee fully expected rubber stamping of it.
1283400	1290400	Basically, they had a full press package ready to go and released it when they released the proposal.
1290400	1297400	This was before any astronomers had even seen the proposal, they released the ideas to the media.
1297400	1302400	This is a phenomenally stupid way to try to do science.
1302400	1305400	Of course, the proposal would be revised.
1305400	1312400	And one week later, proposal number two was put to a vote in the IAU.
1312400	1319400	This one added the requirement that to be considered a planet, you must dominate your orbit.
1319400	1323400	It also added the idea of a dwarf planet.
1323400	1332400	So Pluto, Eris, and Ceres became dwarf planets, and Pluto lost its planetary status.
1332400	1335400	We moved down to eight planets.
1335400	1340400	This resolution was passed in a vote of perhaps 500 folks.
1340400	1344400	The whole thing was really needlessly rushed.
1344400	1349400	It didn't satisfy anyone, except of course the media.
1349400	1353400	Because the reaction to adding planets to the solar system was huge.
1353400	1356400	It was all over front page news of the papers.
1356400	1361400	And then a week later, the reaction to then demoting Pluto was even bigger.
1361400	1365400	The astronomers who were not at the IAU meeting voiced dissent.
1365400	1369400	And no one I know wholeheartedly supported either proposal.
1369400	1377400	Some openly ridiculed the resolution, some openly ridiculed the resolution, and the press aided up.
1377400	1384400	I think this is a bad time for our community, because we look like a bunch of squabbling third graders.
1384400	1392400	The major mistake made at the time, and for a long time afterwards, was it's really not about Pluto,
1392400	1398400	it's not about the status of one object, it's about the whole solar system.
1398400	1403400	And science really can't be done in a one week meeting.
1403400	1407400	So you're going to try and do a nice definition, present it to the community,
1407400	1412400	give them six months to comment before you take the vote.
1412400	1415400	But this is the way things stand.
1415400	1424400	We can, however, make an attempt to do a scientific view of a planet definition, and see if one can be found.
1424400	1429400	Now everyone seems to agree that no fusion is a good start.
1429400	1435400	If you're small enough to avoid any fusion, so you're not a star, that's a good start on what makes a planet.
1435400	1443400	And most agree that size alone is not really good enough, because Mercury is smaller than Ganymede or Titan.
1443400	1450400	And so the size and mass cutoffs you might use would essentially be arbitrary.
1450400	1458400	Now the shape of an object is a little bit fuzzy, because whether it's spherical depends upon its composition.
1458400	1464400	If you are rock, you need a larger body, in order to become spherical, than if you are ice.
1464400	1473400	And you could have a potato shaped rock be more massive than a spherical snowball, and which do you call a planet?
1473400	1480400	The more massive object, should that be the planet? Or the spherical one, should that be the planet?
1480400	1486400	So shape isn't entirely clear whether it should be a major criteria.
1486400	1492400	Now when we consider orbit, there are some folks who question whether that's reasonable to consider.
1492400	1498400	Because the orbit of the object is not necessarily, is not an intrinsic property of the body itself.
1498400	1504400	It's just the dynamical property. And what orbit it's in, is not really the object's fault,
1504400	1507400	it could have been scattered out and moved around the solar system.
1507400	1516400	So is it fair to call an object not a planet, or a planet based upon a property that isn't really intrinsic to the body?
1516400	1522400	Now I guess I would say that yes and no, that argument works.
1522400	1526400	Because orbit is part of a moon definition.
1526400	1533400	Because Ganymede and Titan, as I said before, they're larger than Mercury, they would be called planets,
1533400	1537400	if they weren't orbiting Jupiter and Saturn respectively.
1537400	1546400	Now the one point of the definition that really gets the most discussion is the idea about dominating its orbit.
1546400	1552400	And this is what you use to distinguish between whether it's a major planet or a minor planet.
1552400	1562400	And I think, in my opinion, it's effectively the same criteria that we used when we excluded the objects in the asteroid belt.
1562400	1574400	So here is a plot that plots the object mass on the y-axis, and on the x-axis, it plots the amount of mass in the zone.
1574400	1581400	So if you take an object's orbit, it's perihelion to its aphelion, and you say how much mass is in that zone.
1581400	1583400	That's what's plotted on the x-axis.
1583400	1593400	And you can see for the eight planets in the upper region of this plot, versus the two asteroids and two kind of belt objects in the lower part of this plot,
1593400	1596400	there's a very clean separation.
1596400	1603400	These diagonal lines represent constant ratios of mass of the object to mass in the zone.
1603400	1609400	And you can see that Mars is the lowest of the planets, it's got a ratio of about 1,000.
1610400	1618400	Whereas Ceres is the largest of the small solar system bodies, and it's about value of one.
1618400	1627400	So this dash line in the middle is the author's proposal for how you distinguish between a planet and a small solar system body,
1627400	1630400	a minor planet, major versus minor.
1630400	1636400	And he suggests that if the mass of the object is 100 times the mass in the zone, then you're a planet.
1636400	1639400	Anything less, you're not a planet.
1639400	1641400	That seems to work reasonably well.
1641400	1647400	However, no matter what definition you come up with, there are a number of what ifs to consider.
1647400	1649400	Orbits can be unstable.
1649400	1660400	So can an object change from being a planet to a non-planet if its orbit gets perturbed, if it gets sent into a different orbit, does it suddenly become not a planet?
1661400	1668400	And what about a mercury-sized object found in the Kuiper Belt, or found out in the Oort Cloud?
1668400	1673400	Because mercury wouldn't dominate the mass out in the Kuiper Belt.
1673400	1679400	But we would consider it a planet interior when it's in the interior part of the solar system,
1679400	1683400	and it's no longer a planet in the exterior part of the solar system, does that make logical sense?
1683400	1686400	And what about planets that are ejected?
1686400	1693400	Jupiter's mass has surely ejected a lot of comets. It may have ejected some planets from the solar system.
1693400	1698400	These planets would then be traveling in interstellar space. They wouldn't be orbiting a star.
1698400	1703400	So is actually orbiting a star a true requirement for a planet?
1703400	1713400	And finally, what happens if other solar systems don't follow the rules that we create here for our solar system?
1713400	1719400	Other proposals for definitions of a planet have been floated to try and address these ideas.
1719400	1723400	And here's one that focuses on the formation of the object.
1723400	1728400	It defines primary accreted objects as stars, round dwarfs,
1728400	1738400	and if you happen to form a planetary mass object as the central region of a collapsing disk, then that would be like a sub-star.
1738400	1743400	Then, around that primary accreted object, you would form planets.
1743400	1748400	And any ones that formed around those planets would be called moons.
1748400	1752400	These would be your secondary accreted objects and your tertiary accreted objects.
1752400	1757400	Everything else, the proposal calls them debris.
1757400	1764400	Now, that's kind of a harsh term, especially because Pluto would then go from being a planet to being debris.
1764400	1768400	And, wow, a lot of people would have problems with that.
1768400	1778400	And furthermore, in this proposal, they say if it's not orbiting a star, you call it a rogue planet, a planet out in interstellar space.
1778400	1783400	Some of these ideas are useful, some of these are not.
1783400	1791400	The only thing we can really guarantee about the definition of planet is that it will be revisited as we discover more things.
1792400	1799400	But, in the end, I really have to question whether a definition is actually necessary.
1799400	1805400	Two prominent Kuiper Belt experts have stated for the record they think no definition is needed.
1805400	1808400	One of them points out this.
1808400	1814400	There is no strict definition of what makes a continent on Earth.
1814400	1818400	Is Australia a continent, or is it an island?
1818400	1823400	And if Australia is a continent, then how large an island qualifies?
1823400	1826400	Does Greenland qualify as a continent, or is it an island?
1826400	1831400	What about Madagascar, and why is India a subcontinent?
1831400	1835400	The point is not actually to figure out what a continent really is,
1835400	1842400	but the idea that terms do not need to be strictly defined in order to be useful.
1842400	1848400	For me, well, I fall back onto the families of the Solar System.
1848400	1851400	We know what the four rocky planets are.
1851400	1854400	We know what the four giant planets are.
1854400	1857400	We know about the failures of asteroids and comets.
1857400	1864400	And if you want to argue about this concept of planethood, it really just confuses the issue.
1864400	1872400	Looking at the Solar System in this way increases the understanding of the Solar System and advances science.
1872400	1877400	And ultimately, that's what we're trying to accomplish.
1877400	1884400	In our next lecture, we're going to look at how this Solar System organization came to be.
1884400	1893400	What are the forces and processes that formed and shaped our Solar System to make it look the way it is today?
1893400	1896400	Until then, see ya.
