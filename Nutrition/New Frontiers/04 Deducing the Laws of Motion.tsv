0	22640	Have you ever played a game when you didn't know what the rules were?
22640	26800	Before you can try to win that game, your first effort is to figure out what the rules
26800	28320	are.
28320	32720	You would try various actions and see what happens.
32720	37840	Hopefully you would find patterns in the responses, and then you would develop a working model
37840	40640	of what the rules of the game were.
40640	45880	But you would never know if the rules were exactly right, or if you had a complete set
45880	46880	of the rules.
46880	52480	You would only know those rules for the situations you had encountered.
52480	58560	Reducing the laws of nature is exactly like playing a game, but in this game, figuring
58560	62520	out the rules is the whole point of the game.
62520	69080	We make observations, we look for patterns, and we discover what we think are the rules.
69080	75880	Our rulebook is called science, but we never get to peek at nature's rulebook, so we don't
75880	82200	know if we've got the correct rules, or even if we've got a complete set of rules.
82200	87880	For the solar system, we observe the motions of the sun, moon, and the planets.
87880	94380	We deduce the patterns that they follow, and we create a model to fit those patterns.
94380	98680	As we've shown in previous lectures, both the Earth-centered model and the Sun-centered
98680	101720	model can fit the data.
101720	106440	Different sets of rules can be found to fit the observations.
106440	110360	However, both models share a common problem.
110360	115480	They assume motion based on circles.
115480	121360	This can be traced back to Aristotle's notion of a perfect heavens, and circles and spheres
121360	123920	as the perfect figures.
123920	130360	When we look at nature, we should actually not assume things in the model, but rather
130360	136140	the nature should be pulled out of the model, it should be derived from the model.
136140	140640	So we need to look for a more general set of rules.
140640	146580	The man who would discover these rules is this man, Johannes Kepler.
146580	151660	He found more general rules than the ones we have so far assumed.
151660	156060	In 1600, he was hired as an assistant to Tico Brahe.
156060	162220	Tico Brahe was at the time the imperial mathematician to the emperor Rudolph II in Prague, and he
162220	164940	was the greatest pre-telescopic observer.
164940	168980	However, Brahe died one year later.
168980	174340	That was very fortunate for Kepler because he succeeded him in the position and he gained
174340	177380	access to Brahe's observations.
177380	183300	He used those observations to search for new patterns in the solar system.
183300	187700	You see, Kepler was a very strong advocate of the heliocentric model.
187700	193460	In 1596, four years before he started working with Tico, he published a book called Mysterium
193460	200820	Cosmographicum, and in it he proposed a different model, a heliocentric model that looks something
200820	202740	like this.
202740	207780	It was based upon the regular solids and spheres.
207780	212820	The spheres represented the orbits of the planets, and the regular solids were the spaces
212820	214100	between them.
214100	220100	And since there were five regular solids, he justified there being six planetary spheres.
220100	224540	In a heliocentric model, Earth, of course, be one of the planets, so we have six planets.
224540	230620	But Kepler came up with a real serious problem when he looked at the heliocentric model.
230620	234860	He found that he could not fit Mars' orbit.
234860	240420	He described it as a war with Mars, and it lasted for about a decade.
240420	247860	As he looked for these patterns in Tico Brahe's data, he just couldn't fit the orbit of Mars.
247860	253660	And Brahe's data was invaluable, because most observers would look at Mars only near its
253660	257820	opposition when it was on the opposite side from the Sun, and when it was going through
257820	259820	retrograde motion.
259820	264340	But Brahe was different than most observers, and he observed Mars and other planets throughout
264340	270500	their entire orbit, and that gave Kepler a much deeper range of results from which to
270500	272860	compare his ideas.
273740	278860	Today, most of what Kepler looked for, and most of what Kepler found, we would consider
278860	280420	numerology.
280420	286740	He had, I guess I would describe it as an overzealous quest for order, but he did find
286740	288860	generalized patterns.
288860	295660	And these are the three empirical laws, Kepler's three laws, of planetary orbits.
295660	300740	Kepler's first law is that the orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one
300740	301740	focus.
302620	306340	Now an ellipse is just a generalization of a circle.
306340	308780	We all know what a circle looks like.
308780	310020	It's round, right?
310020	313260	Well, it has axes that are the same length.
313260	318740	The length of the x-axis in this diagram is the same as the length of the y-axis, and
318740	321260	it's labeled in this diagram R.
321260	326780	The equation for a circle would be x squared plus y squared equals R squared.
326780	331540	An ellipse is just a generalization of that that allows you to have different lengths for
331540	333700	the x and y-axis.
333700	340100	So this is a diagram of an ellipse, and here A, which is half of the x-axis, called the
340100	347460	semi-major axis, and B is half of the y-axis, called the semi-minor axis, and they are different.
347460	352340	They're allowed to be different, and that leads to the equation of an ellipse being
352340	357980	x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared equals one.
357980	362860	If A and B were both equal to R, i.e., if we had a circle, you could multiply through
362860	369020	by R squared, and you get the same equation as that for a circle.
369020	376100	A circle has only one special point, the center, and every point on a circle is equidistant
376100	377980	from the center.
377980	381620	For the ellipse, it has two special points.
381620	387960	These are called the focus points, or foci, and you can find them by creating a right
387960	394560	triangle with the y-axis and putting the hypotenuse of length of the semi-major axis,
394560	398680	and you get your focus point one over here on the right and focus point two over here
398680	401160	on the left.
401160	406440	The reason these focus points are special is that the sum of the distances from any point
406440	411240	on the ellipse to both of the foci is constant.
411240	416140	I find that a little hard to imagine in my head, but it's relatively easy to see if we
416140	420380	do a small demonstration.
420380	426580	I have here two push pins and a string tied between them so that the distance along the
426580	433340	string, if I stretch it taut between from one focus along the string to the other focus,
433340	435980	is going to be constant.
435980	453060	If I stretch out the string and draw the figure, I get an ellipse.
453060	457620	That's an easy way to draw an ellipse, and you get a much nicer ellipse than it could
457620	463460	draw a freehand, but you can also see that the sum of the distances is always the same
463460	469340	in this shape.
469340	474460	The last thing about an ellipse is the measure of the elongation of the ellipse.
474460	480660	We call this the eccentricity, and mathematically it's just the ratio of the axes, and if it
480660	486980	is zero, that means that you have a circle, that the two axes are equal.
486980	493420	And if you have one, if A over B stretches to infinity, then you have an infinitely stretched
493420	496180	ellipse, and that's a line.
496180	500580	So an ellipse is basically just a generalization of circle that starts from one extreme being
500580	504420	a circle, going out to the other extreme being a line.
504420	511260	For the planet orbits, the planet has an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus point.
511260	512620	Here it is in this diagram.
512620	515760	You can see the planet going around on an elliptical orbit.
515760	520540	One focus is not occupied, the sun occupies the other focus.
520540	526860	This means that the average distance to the sun is equal to the semi-major axis.
526860	533420	Now the eccentricities we generally draw when we draw ellipses are much, much, much too large
533420	535180	for the planetary orbits.
535180	540780	I have here a diagram of the interplanetary orbits, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and
540780	544260	you can see that Venus and Earth look pretty much like circles.
544260	549700	Their orbits look pretty much like circles, and in fact, they have very small eccentricities.
549700	554180	For Mercury, you can see that the sun is definitely not at the center of Mercury's orbit.
554180	559900	It actually has the largest eccentricity, an eccentricity of about 0.2.
559900	563780	But if you look at Mercury, it still just sort of looks like it's a circle, but just
563780	566060	with the sun off center.
566060	570340	You can compare Mars' orbit to Earth's orbit, and you can definitely see that there are
570340	575500	a lot closer on one side and a lot further away on the other side.
575500	579940	Mars has an eccentricity in between that of Earth and that of Mercury, an eccentricity
579940	581940	of about 0.1.
581940	586820	It actually looks like it has a stronger eccentricity in this diagram than Mercury, but trust me
586820	591180	when I tell you that Mercury has a significantly stronger, simply because it's larger and you
591180	594220	have something to compare it against.
594220	598540	So that's Kepler's first law, that the planets travel on ellipses.
598540	604380	The second law is that the orbits of the planet around the sun sweep out equal areas in equal
604380	606300	time.
606300	613100	In previous models, we had gone from circular motion, which looks like this, where you move
613100	618740	through equal areas in equal time, but everything is centered, so you're moving around the same
618740	621700	amount in the same size area.
621700	623740	Everything is all symmetric.
623740	630860	We then moved in a ptolemaic model to equant motion, which changed this relationship, and
630860	637020	the planet had to move slower along one region of its orbit and faster along another region
637020	638100	of the orbit.
638100	644460	But you can see that the segments that it swept out in the same amount of time had varying
644460	646660	different shapes.
646660	652060	For Kepler's second law, the idea is the same that you're going to have the planet move
652060	656900	faster when it's closer and slower when it's further away.
656900	659900	Kepler's second law looks something like this.
659900	665260	When the planet is closer to the sun, it's moving faster and therefore sweeps out a longer
665260	670580	arc, but since it's closer to the sun, it only has a certain amount of area.
670580	674140	As it is farther away from the sun, it moves much slower.
674140	678980	It goes through a much smaller amount of arc, but because it's much, much further away,
678980	682260	it still sweeps out the same amount of area.
682260	686340	It's very similar to the idea of the equant motion.
686340	692260	Matter of fact, if I look at an animation, I can show you that the equant motion and
692260	696780	the Keplerian motion are relatively identical.
696780	704140	So in this animation, let's set the eccentricity for the orbit to 0.6, which is much, much
704140	706380	larger than the planet orbit.
706380	714060	But you can see that the shape of the orbit is distinctly different, and the blue line,
714060	719220	which represents the Keplerian motion, and the green line, which represents equant motion,
719220	725180	go at very different speeds, especially as they get away from the poles.
725180	732060	And you can see how they change and get away and are very strongly different.
732060	737700	If I pause it and set the eccentricity down to something small, which is what the planets
737700	744820	have, let's put it around 0.2, and then I put it into motion.
744820	752380	You can see two things, that the orbit shape is very close between the ellipse and the circle,
752380	756740	and the equant motion is very close to elliptical motion.
756740	761180	This is one reason why the geocentric model worked so well.
761180	767900	The equant motion closely approximated what Kepler would find before the elliptical motion.
767900	774340	As a matter of fact, when I look at this, I wonder, how did Kepler find discrepancies?
774340	779100	I mean, they look so much alike, how could he possibly have found these discrepancies?
779100	784740	It just shows you the detail to which he was calculating and the detail to which Tikobrah
784740	787180	he had observed.
787180	791700	So that's Kepler's second law, equal areas in equals time.
791700	796620	Kepler's third law is that the square of the period of a planet's orbit is equal to
796620	800140	the cube of its semi-major axis.
800140	805580	Let's take a look at the periods of the planet orbits.
805580	812100	In this table, in the first column, the period is measured in years, and it goes from Mercury
812100	818140	at about three months, on up to Saturn at about 30 years.
818140	822940	In the second column, we have the semi-major axis, and that's measured in astronomical
822940	824740	units.
824740	829260	One astronomical unit is the average distance from Earth to the Sun.
829260	833660	It's about 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles.
833660	841580	And you know now, from having looked at ellipses, that that is equal to Earth's semi-major axis.
841620	848220	If we plot these two columns of figures, period versus semi-major axis, we get a graph that
848220	849820	looks like this.
849820	855140	You can see that as the period gets larger, the semi-major axis gets larger.
855140	860620	And if you look over here on the left, it looks almost linear at start, but then, then
860620	862660	now it doesn't stay linear.
862660	866420	There is a relationship between these two, but it doesn't show up when we plot it in
866420	869180	a simple linear plot.
869180	875460	If instead, we plot it on a logarithmic graph, one can see the power-law relationship.
875460	882740	A logarithmic graph, such as this one here, is one where the distances along the graph
882740	885780	are multiplicative, not additive.
885780	891820	In a linear graph, the same distance represents the same amount all the way across the graph.
891820	898100	In a logarithmic graph, the same distance represents a multiplication by the same amount.
898100	904460	So for example, if you look at the plot, you go from 0.1 to 1, which is a factor of 10,
904460	909780	in a certain distance, and in that same distance, you also then go from 1 to 10.
909780	912220	That is also true for any other factor.
912220	916460	Going from 1 to 2 is the same distance as going from 2 to 4.
916460	923220	The point is that in a logarithmic plot, you can see power-law relationships.
923220	929260	If there's a linear relationship in a logarithmic plot, it means it's a power-law, and you can
929260	933260	see there is definitely a line through these points in this plot, and I'll draw it here
933260	934980	for you.
934980	940620	The slope of this line gives the relationship between period and semi-major axis, and the
940620	943460	slope of the line is two-thirds.
943460	950100	So the mathematical version of Kepler's third law is that it's p squared versus a cube.
950100	954220	P squared is equal to semi-major axis cubed.
954220	958900	If we put that into a table, you can see the values of p squared in the first column and
958900	964980	compare them to values of a cubed in the second column, and that the figures match very nicely.
964980	973180	You will note that I did not hide the round-off error, that if you look at Mars, 3.53 versus
973180	977700	3.51, that's just small errors in the numbers that I used.
977700	982820	If I had used fully accurate numbers, that round-off error would go away.
982820	992060	The law also shows that the farther out planets also travel slower than the closer in planets.
992060	996780	Now, you might think that, oh, well, what this really expresses is that the farther
996780	1001460	out planets have longer orbits, and so they could be moving at the same speed, but of
1001460	1005580	course they're going to take longer to traverse their longer orbits.
1005620	1011780	If the speed were constant, then the period would be proportional to the circumference,
1011780	1016660	and the circumference is just proportional to the radius of the orbit.
1016660	1023780	Then you would get p is proportional to A. Instead, you get p is proportional to A to
1023780	1029620	the 3 1⁄2 power, so that means not only do the outer planets have longer orbits, but
1029620	1033100	they also have slower speeds.
1033140	1038820	There's three laws help pave the way for the heliocentric solar system, and not in just
1038820	1044060	expressing the three laws as some empirical relationships about the planets, but because
1044060	1051660	the table of planet positions that he created based upon these three laws were better in
1051660	1055580	their accuracy than the geocentric model.
1055580	1060340	The planet positions based upon the geocentric model would lose their accuracy over the course
1060380	1064700	of decades or centuries, and needed to be recalculated.
1064700	1070860	In 1627, Kepler produced the Rudolphine tables, and they were significantly more accurate
1070860	1074260	than any previous planetary tables.
1074260	1077980	To an astronomer, you're saying, ah, at last!
1077980	1082820	Finally, there's a practical advantage to the heliocentric model.
1082820	1084740	This is what you're looking for.
1084740	1089820	While the philosophical arguments are nice, they aren't compelling.
1089820	1096700	The better predictions are enough to turn the tide in science.
1096700	1102180	Kepler embraced and improved the heliocentric model, and he actually wrote a three-volume
1102180	1107300	work called the Epitome of Copernican Astronomy.
1107300	1112700	He was a strong Copernican at a time when we know from Galileo's efforts it was not
1112700	1115300	a good time to be a Copernican.
1115300	1121700	He died in 1630, the same year that Galileo published his dialogues concerning the two
1121700	1124100	chief world systems.
1124100	1130060	But he did not incur the ire of the church, probably because Galileo was in Italy and
1130060	1134140	Kepler was in Northern Europe.
1134140	1140700	Kepler developed the observational basis for the heliocentric model, but Isaac Newton would
1140700	1144340	then develop the mathematical basis.
1144340	1149260	The big insight inside Newton's universal law of gravity is to connect gravity on Earth's
1149260	1154980	surface to the motion of the moon, the sun, and the planets.
1154980	1159020	Now there's a myth out there that says that Newton was sitting underneath an apple tree
1159020	1163940	and an apple falls and bonks him on the head, and he thinks, ah, hey, gravity!
1163940	1166900	No, that's not really quite how it happened.
1166900	1174060	Instead, the idea of an apple falling from a tree inspired him to imagine if the moon
1174060	1176740	were governed by the same force as that apple.
1176740	1183220	And I have a nice quote here from John Conduit, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint.
1183220	1190980	In the year 1666, he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire.
1190980	1196220	Whilst he was pensively meandering on a garden, it came into his thought that the power of
1196220	1201820	gravity, which brought an apple from a tree to the ground, was not limited to a certain
1201820	1209580	distance from Earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought.
1209580	1213300	Why not as high as the moon, said he to himself?
1213300	1221100	And if so, that must influence her motion and perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon
1221100	1228220	he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.
1228220	1234460	So the role of the apple was to inspire him to think about gravity in a much more general
1234460	1235660	way.
1235660	1241460	Could gravity apply to the heavens as well as applying to Earth?
1241460	1246540	How do you then go from gravity on Earth to orbits?
1246540	1248780	Well Newton came up with a thought experiment.
1248780	1252340	A thought experiment is a kind of experiment that you can do only in your mind.
1252340	1255900	You can think it through and think through all the ramifications, but you don't actually
1255900	1257300	have to perform it.
1257300	1259660	So they're very nice experiments.
1259660	1265580	So this is an illustration that shows the idea behind Newton's thought experiment.
1265580	1272580	What if you had a cannon that was really, really powerful on an airless world?
1272580	1278260	Eventually cannon would shoot the cannonball and it falls to the ground.
1278260	1284380	But on an airless world and with a really, really strong cannon, it could fall further
1284380	1291820	and further away and eventually it might fall and miss the Earth.
1291820	1293900	What would that be then?
1293900	1303340	Newton reasoned that if it fell and kept missing the Earth, it would go into orbit.
1303340	1311860	So the idea of an orbit is simply continually falling under gravity, but never hitting ground.
1311860	1317900	The idea behind this is that gravity is a centripetal force, that you create an orbit
1317900	1322420	by continually pulling the path toward the center.
1322420	1325980	Now here is an illustration of this.
1325980	1331500	Suppose you have a mass, we'll call this blue spot here, the Earth, and then you have an
1331500	1336900	orange spot here, which we'll consider something like the moon, and it's moving perpendicular
1336900	1342660	to the radius vector of Earth, and it moves along its orbit, but at the same time, it's
1342660	1347060	being pulled by gravity towards the Earth.
1347060	1353180	So while it moves up here, it's pulled in this direction, and then its new position
1353180	1356620	would be the sum of those two vectors, or here.
1356620	1363220	It would then be traveling on a new perpendicular path, and it would be traveling in this direction,
1363220	1368920	but again pulled toward the center of Earth and moved to this direction.
1368920	1374580	That process would continually repeat, moving along its tangential path, but yet being pulled
1374580	1377560	back toward the center of the planet.
1377560	1384500	And that repeats around the orbit, and you can see in this rather rough diagram that
1384500	1388620	you end up working all the way around creating an orbit.
1388620	1393140	Now this is a rough diagram because I've used a very long vector here, but gravity acts
1393140	1402220	in a continuous manner, and so instead of having these 8 or 10 separate points, you
1402220	1406940	would actually have a continuous orbit, and here we have a circle.
1406940	1411220	Now we get a circle simply because I didn't want to go through the extra effort to try
1411220	1413420	and make it into an ellipse.
1413420	1418980	Circle's easiest thing for me to create, but instead, if you took a more general diagram
1418980	1424420	and more general motion, you would get an ellipse of this.
1424420	1430940	So finally, this is what leads to Newton's law of gravity, and the law of gravity is
1430940	1432860	stated thus.
1432860	1438820	The force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the masses of the objects
1438820	1443460	and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
1443460	1449840	I know that saying it in words doesn't quite get it out, so we use mathematics.
1449840	1455540	And this is the equation, F standing for the force of gravity, G for Newton's gravitational
1455540	1463300	constant, capital M for the mass of one body, lowercase M for the mass of another body,
1463300	1465780	and R for the distance between them.
1465780	1472060	And so the force on the left hand side is proportional to the mass of both objects,
1472060	1476900	which are in the numerator on the right hand side, and inversely proportional to the square
1476900	1479100	of the distance between them.
1479100	1483420	So as you have larger bodies, the force goes up.
1483420	1488580	As you place them further away, the force goes down.
1488580	1494700	Newton's gravity work led him to discover his three laws of motion that he published
1494700	1497420	in his book, The Principia.
1497420	1504460	And those three laws of motion describe general forces, not just gravity.
1504460	1510900	The important thing for the solar system is that Kepler's empirical laws can be derived
1510900	1513420	from Newton's law of gravity.
1513420	1515980	They are a direct result.
1515980	1521780	Gravity is an inverse square law, and if you do the mathematics to find out what is the
1521780	1527140	general orbit shape for any inverse square force, you get an ellipse.
1527140	1532540	The force is stronger when you are closer to the sun and weaker when your father is
1532540	1534140	from the sun.
1534140	1538260	That leads to the observed variations in motion of the planets in their orbits around the
1538260	1539820	sun.
1539820	1547460	Furthermore, larger orbits in an inverse square law have longer lengths, and they also have
1547460	1554220	slower speeds, and that leads to the relationship between period and semirate major axis.
1554220	1560140	Newton's great achievement is that he created a physics foundation for the astronomical
1560140	1563260	motions.
1563260	1569260	As illustrated in this lecture, science is a search for order in the universe, and it's
1569260	1572420	often a three-step process.
1572420	1576020	First you have to collect some data, then you're going to search for patterns in the
1576020	1582020	data, and then you need to explain why such patterns occur.
1582020	1588300	In the heliocentric model, Kepler is the one who found the patterns, and Newton is the
1588300	1591740	one who explained why they occur.
1591740	1598740	The combination of these two efforts by these two great men confirmed the heliocentric model,
1598740	1603660	and only with their work could we say this heliocentric model is the true model of the
1603660	1605620	solar system.
1605620	1611820	And actually, it goes a little bit beyond that, because you're moving from the heliocentric
1611820	1616500	solar system to what I sort of think of as the gravitational solar system.
1616500	1619700	You're going beyond just modeling things going on.
1619700	1626780	You're creating a mathematical theory that describes the motions, and in it you are moving
1626780	1630220	to a new way of thinking about the solar system.
1630220	1637960	Mathematics underline the physics that underlies astronomy, and here for the first time astronomy
1637960	1643420	combines with physics, and we end up with a new science of astrophysics.
1643420	1647860	Well, that's it for today, and we'll see you next time.
1647860	1648180	Take care.
1649700	1651700	Thank you.
