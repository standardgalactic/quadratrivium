0	17560	The
17560	23320	grandest question in astronomy is that of life in the universe.
23320	29540	Are there intelligent beings like us somewhere in this vast cosmos?
29540	35140	This is the one question that is guaranteed to get the public's attention.
35140	41140	It is also a question to which we have few answers and little hard data.
41140	48320	Hence, much of the discussion in the public sphere is dominated by exaggeration, speculation,
48320	50080	and wishful thinking.
50080	55420	And I can't really blame folks, it's a powerful and expansive idea.
55420	60000	Life in the universe is nearly the entire underpinning of the whole genre of science
60000	61000	fiction.
61000	65460	Personally, I would love it if there were alien civilizations that we could learn about,
65460	68940	communicate with, and even visit.
68940	73440	But in my job as an astronomer, I have to take a less romantic view.
73440	79140	It wasn't too long ago that research on extraterrestrial life was a dead-end career move.
79140	83980	Lately, it has gained respectability as the field of astrobiology.
84180	90500	Yet it is still a line of research with more questions than answers.
90500	95180	In this lecture, I'd like to review what we do know about life on Earth.
95180	101220	I'd like to explore where in the solar system we might find life and speculate about the
101220	105180	abundance of life across our galaxy.
105180	108580	Let's begin with a short history of life on Earth.
108580	112500	Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago.
112500	118060	The oldest rocks we find on Earth's surface are about 4 billion years old, while the oldest
118060	123620	rock deposits date from about 3.7 billion years ago.
123620	128500	The first appearance of life came shortly thereafter.
128500	134660	This image shows a stromatolite fossil from the Pilbara region of Australia.
134660	140780	These sedimentary structures are created as a result of microbial growth and their indirect
140780	142940	evidence of microbial life.
142940	148380	The fossils here date from about 3.5 billion years ago and are generally considered to be
148380	152180	the earliest evidence of life on Earth.
152180	157220	The microbes that created these fossils were single-celled and didn't have chromosomes
157220	159300	or a cell nucleus.
159300	163220	The development of those cellular structures does not appear in the fossil record for another
163220	167100	800 million years.
167100	173260	About 2.2 billion years ago, abundant oxygen developed in Earth's atmosphere.
173260	180740	Some early life forms released oxygen, especially cyanobacteria, what we call blue-green algae.
180740	186220	The oxygen, combined with iron in the oceans, to produce the banded iron formations like
186220	188400	the ones seen here.
188400	195580	The red stripes in this deposit are called tiger iron, and you can see why from the stripes.
195580	201820	These iron deposits were one method of removing oxygen from the atmosphere.
201820	207220	And around 2.2 billion years ago, these oxygen sinks, the places that the oxygen would be
207220	212820	removed from the atmosphere, became saturated, and at that time oxygen could build up in
212820	215780	the atmosphere.
215780	222140	Around 1.2 billion years ago, the first multicellular life appears on Earth.
222140	224740	And this is an important point.
224740	231800	For two-thirds of the history of life on Earth, it was only single-celled life.
231800	237780	Over 2 billion years, we're just spent developing and improving the structures of the cell.
237780	245220	And now, when multicellular organisms arrive, arise, life really gets going.
245220	250300	Here is a trilobite fossil from 500 million years ago.
250300	254380	It serves as a representative of the life forms that developed during the Cambrian
254380	256580	explosion.
256580	265540	540 million years ago begins the greatest appearance and diversification of life in Earth's history.
265540	272580	In just tens of millions of years, most of the modern phyla appeared in the fossil record.
272580	276260	And then, life quickly grows large.
276260	282380	Around 230 million years ago was the beginning of the age of the dinosaurs.
282380	287020	This is the Barrasaurus skeleton at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
287020	289420	And I used to walk past it every day.
289420	297460	It was a huge reminder that even a species that dominates the planet for over 100 million
297460	300780	years is vulnerable.
300780	306740	About 65 million years ago, almost all the dinosaurs died in a mass extinction.
306740	311900	I say almost all the dinosaurs, because if you visit the dinosaur halls at AMNH, you'll
311900	317540	find that the avian dinosaurs come down to us today as birds.
317540	323820	Now, human ancestors don't appear in the fossil record until a few million years ago.
323820	327960	A prime example is the Lucy skeleton.
327960	331400	This dates from 3.3 million years ago.
331400	337360	It represents a hominid species that has been thought to be an ancestor of modern humans.
337360	345520	However, modern humans don't appear in the fossil record until about 130,000 years ago.
345520	349960	So, what does this brief history teach us?
349960	355080	Well, first, that life takes a long time to develop.
355080	361520	After the first life forms arise, it takes another two and a half billion years for multicellular
361520	363480	life to appear.
363480	370520	And then, once life gets going, it seems to evolve on shorter and shorter time scales.
370520	375320	But the basic life develops on billion year time scales.
375320	381440	Now, second, we learn that life can alter the planet.
381440	384360	Oxygen would have been toxic to early life.
384760	392560	Somehow, the blue-green algae and others adapted and created a major change in the atmosphere,
392560	398600	creating the oxygen part of the atmosphere that we have today.
398600	405120	And the third thing we learn is that life on earth is intimately connected to our solar
405120	406760	system.
406760	411240	There are two direct points in this category, both related to impacts.
411640	419800	One, it takes about a billion years after the earth forms before the first life develops.
419800	426240	This is directly related to the bombardment of the planets after formation.
426240	431240	The impact record that we see recorded on the surface of the moon shows us that the
431240	438400	late heavy bombardment era slowed down between about 3.9 billion years ago and 3.3 billion
438400	440440	years ago.
440440	446320	Life on earth's surface could not have developed earlier in the record because it was too volatile
446320	447320	in the environment.
447320	451800	There are too many impacts smashing into the surface for life to develop.
451800	459480	Hence, by seeing life at 3.5 billion years ago, it seems that it arises quickly once
459480	462760	the conditions are right.
462760	468520	The second relationship to the solar system is that impacts continue to play a role in
468520	470360	the development of life.
470360	476560	This is evidenced by the mass extinction at the end of the age of the dinosaurs.
476560	482600	As discussed in an earlier lecture, the huge Chicksalub impact likely created a change
482600	488480	in the atmosphere and in the environment that led to a mass extinction.
488480	494140	There is even some evidence that an impact 200 million years ago enabled the dinosaurs
494140	496080	to flourish.
496080	502760	If so, there is sort of a weird brand of poetic justice in the solar system.
502760	506480	Now there are other important contributions from the solar system to the development of
506480	508120	life.
508120	511040	Life arises in earth's oceans.
511040	514120	But where did earth's oceans come from?
514120	520000	This is a topic of much research, including some suggestions that comets could have delivered
520000	523600	enough water to create the oceans.
523600	529080	And while comets likely played some role, computer simulations show that the impacts
529080	532600	of large icy bodies would play a greater role.
532600	537280	When I say large icy bodies, you might want to think of the medium sized moons or objects
537280	539360	from the Kuiper Belt.
539360	544960	Now these would deliver a lot of water in a few impacts, and since only a few impacts
544960	550600	would be required, the development of oceans or not might have just been a role of the
550600	553260	dice.
553260	556960	Another chance occurrence was the formation of the moon.
556960	563940	The moon formed from the impact of a Mars sized asteroid just after the earth had formed.
563940	570920	As shown in this illustration, the early moon was a lot closer to earth.
570920	575860	It would have raised much higher tides, and those tides would have sent water hundreds
575860	580940	of kilometers inland and created vast tide pools.
580940	588900	Those tide pools are a prime candidate for where life originated and developed.
588900	595700	Another hypothesis credits these giant tides with helping DNA molecules replicate by regularly
595700	599220	changing the salinity in the coastal areas.
599220	607660	Also, as the moon receded from earth, earth's rotation slowed, and that changed the rhythms
607660	609500	of life on earth.
610420	614940	Finally, the moon also helps stabilize earth's rotation axis.
614940	618820	Remember that earth's rotation axis does a little bit of a wobble, but by having the
618820	624580	moon there, it does less of a wobble than it would otherwise do.
624580	630140	That helps us maintain consistent and temperate seasons here on earth, which is of course
630140	632380	beneficial to life.
632380	640820	So without the moon, life on earth would be strikingly different, and perhaps non-existent.
640820	649660	Now, let's turn from life on earth to looking for life elsewhere in the solar system.
649660	653380	What environments could support life?
653380	656940	Life as we know it requires three things.
656940	666300	It requires a source of energy, carbon chemistry, and water as a mediating fluid for that chemistry.
666300	668940	Many places in the solar system have the first two.
668940	673180	You can find energy and carbon all across the solar system.
673180	677740	But the number of places with liquid water is limited.
677740	684620	So the search for life is primarily a search for liquid water.
684700	692100	One thing that we found here on earth is that life can adapt to a wide range of environments.
692100	696220	We used to think that life required the light of the sun.
696220	700060	Then we discovered these black smokers.
700060	706540	These are ecosystems on the ocean floor that are powered by the energy from hydrothermal
706540	707540	vents.
707540	712180	There is no light from the sun that makes it down to this ocean floor, but yet you have
712180	719180	a whole rich ecosystem of animals gathered around these hydrothermal vents.
719180	727860	We've also discovered bacteria, these are called halophilic bacteria, that thrive in
727860	735180	salt concentrations, salt concentrations two and a half times that of seawater.
735180	740020	And finally, what's very important for the icy world to the solar system is we have found
740020	744620	bacteria that can survive at the South Pole.
744620	753900	The groups of these bacteria are called extremophiles, and they show that life seems to take root
753900	757060	anywhere it can.
757060	764020	So the place in the solar system where we have searched most for life is Mars.
764020	769980	Mars has held a special fascination in our culture ever since the days of Percival Lowell.
769980	777020	Starting in 1895, he published three books with the mistaken assumption that the markings
777020	781380	he saw on Mars were a giant canal system.
781380	787300	He presented an image of a full Martian civilization that was channeling water from its polar ice
787300	791180	caps to its cities at lower latitudes.
791180	795740	We have been searching for the Martians ever since.
795740	802260	Now we never found Lowell's canals, but we have found abundant evidence that water once
802260	805180	flowed on Mars.
805180	810820	Mars Global Surveyor has provided this amazing shot.
810820	814420	This is a fossilized delta.
814420	817860	It is striking evidence of ancient water.
817860	823860	You can see the markings of water flows all across this region, and you can see it's about
823940	827300	10 or 15 kilometers across.
827300	835220	There are telltale markings of flowing water in ancient times on Mars.
835220	842700	Mars Global Surveyor has also seen gullies, and these are gullies along the rims of craters,
842700	847180	and they seem to indicate that there have been more recent water flows than the ancient
847180	850420	ones shown by the delta.
850420	855740	Six years later, we took a picture of this same region, and we saw not only the gullies,
855740	858540	we saw a brand new deposit.
858540	867700	This surprising new deposit is best explained by a brief release of frozen groundwater.
867700	874420	It appears that very brief water flows can occur on Mars even today.
875300	883300	Further, our robotic explorers on Mars have examined Martian rocks in microscopic detail.
883300	891540	They found definitive evidence of water, such as sediments laid down in flowing water.
891540	897060	So we have found abundant evidence of liquid water at some point in the past on Mars, and
897060	903740	even a little bit today, but what we haven't found on Mars are any definitive signs that
903740	906820	life arose in that water.
906820	909860	There was this one thing.
909860	915260	This is the meteorite ALH84001.
915260	919900	It is shown that this meteorite, due to the isotopes in its chemical composition, comes
919900	929420	from Mars, and it was suggested that this shows possible signs of life.
929420	936660	Here is a scanning electron microscope detailed of that meteorite, and these microscopic structures,
936660	942060	the things that sort of look like worms in this image, they're less than a micron across.
942060	945820	They're about 500 or 800 nanometers across.
945820	952060	They were suggested in 1996 to be fossilized nanobacteria.
952060	959700	Now similar bacteria existed on the ancient earth about three or billion years ago, but
959700	965900	that bacteria on the ancient earth were about 100 times larger.
965900	972420	So people questioned this result, and other researchers offered non-biological explanations,
972420	976260	and the question was really hotly debated for a while.
976260	983860	It is still discussed, and as yet, there is no proof of biological activity in the rock,
983860	990020	but it has sparked much research into the way life can develop.
990020	998780	An intriguing point is that this meteorite was found not on Mars, but in Antarctica.
998780	1005220	It is believed to have been cast off of Mars about 15 million years ago.
1005220	1012380	It spent 15 million years traversing the inner solar system until it finally crash-landed
1012380	1016980	on earth about 13,000 years ago.
1016980	1021060	And that suggests a very speculative idea.
1021060	1030380	What if life originally arose on Mars, and such rocks containing life were broken off,
1030380	1034460	and carried life to earth?
1034460	1037580	In that case, our search is over.
1037580	1042100	We have met the Martians, and they are us.
1042100	1047420	Now that's rather speculative, but we can then look elsewhere in the solar system to
1047420	1052480	see if we find other places where liquid water can exist.
1052480	1056900	This is the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
1056900	1059060	It shows ice rafts.
1059060	1063380	These suggest the existence of a subsurface ocean.
1063380	1068140	They very much resemble the ice structures that we see floating above the Arctic Ocean
1068140	1071860	near Earth's North Pole.
1071860	1077860	Europa may be heated enough by tidal interactions with Jupiter to maintain a shallow ocean below
1077860	1080060	its icy crust.
1080060	1085380	Remember that the tidal interactions with Jupiter are what flex the inner moon Io, and
1085380	1088940	it has all of its volcanic eruptions.
1088940	1095660	So if the same process is operating on Europa, and there is a subsurface ocean, there could
1095660	1099780	be microbial life on Europa.
1099780	1105060	Now remember in previous lectures, we have talked about subsurface oceans not just on
1105060	1110100	Europa, but also on two other of the Galilean moons.
1110100	1111100	Here are the cutaways.
1111100	1117420	The upper left is Io, then the upper right is Europa, the bottom left is Ganymede, and
1117420	1119700	the bottom right is Callisto.
1119700	1127580	Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are all believed due to other properties to have subsurface
1127580	1128980	oceans.
1128980	1135300	And folks tend to talk only about life possibilities on Europa, but you've got to remember wherever
1135300	1140540	there is liquid water, there is a chance of life.
1140540	1147220	Our recent addition to our list of the possible places where life could exist is Saturn's
1147220	1149140	moon Enceladus.
1149140	1156860	Now Enceladus has been observed to be spewing ice particles out of its southern polar regions.
1156860	1163740	And some models of these jets have liquid water as their source, while others need only
1163740	1164740	ice.
1164740	1170980	It is yet another site for further investigation.
1170980	1177060	Now you may have noticed that in all our discussions of the solar system, the best we're
1177060	1183700	hoping for to find on elsewhere and on solar system is microbial life.
1183700	1188420	And that's not the alien life that we're really interested in.
1188420	1192980	What about advanced intelligent beings like us?
1192980	1200740	Well, the search for intelligent life really boils down to a series of questions, and the
1200740	1205620	problem is that most of these questions have rather inexact answers.
1206620	1212020	The first question, how many stars are out there?
1212020	1216420	And that's an easy first question, because we have about a hundred billion in our Milky
1216420	1221020	Way galaxy, maybe two hundred billion, you know, maybe even four hundred billion.
1221020	1224780	But eh, what's a hundred billion amongst astronomers?
1224780	1228700	Rough estimate, a hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
1228700	1232700	But not all of those would be suitable for advanced life.
1232780	1238220	However, that advanced life appears to take billions of years to develop.
1238220	1242780	We only should count stars that live for billions of years.
1242780	1248580	However, it is only the high mass stars that are the shortest live stars, and most stars
1248580	1251180	are low mass, long live stars.
1251180	1255060	That only cuts out maybe ten percent of the stars.
1255060	1258540	Next, how many planets are out there?
1258540	1262940	A decade ago, any answer I gave you would be totally speculation.
1262940	1266300	But now, we have some initial numbers.
1266300	1271180	In the planet searches we've done so far, about six and a half percent of the stars
1271180	1275620	we've surveyed have planets, and that's a lower boundary.
1275620	1280100	And when you correct for the incompleteness of the surveys, that number grows to around
1280100	1281600	fifteen percent.
1281600	1287660	So we say, based on observations, about fifteen percent of planets of stars have planets.
1287660	1293180	But most of those planets that we've discovered are Jupiter mass planets, and not the ones
1293180	1297040	that we would expect to support advanced life.
1297040	1300540	Perhaps maybe the moons around those planets could be suitable for life.
1300540	1305860	If you have a Jupiter orbiting in a nice orbit, then a moon around that could be some place
1305860	1308260	that you might find advanced life.
1308260	1312460	But Earth mass planets are not yet detectable.
1312460	1314620	They should be there.
1315020	1317980	However, there's another consideration.
1317980	1324160	If you've got these giant planets on elliptical orbits swooping through the region where
1324160	1329060	Earth would be found in our solar system, it makes the formation and stability of Earth
1329060	1332100	mass planets highly questionable.
1332100	1335940	There are many solar systems where I can't imagine Earth forming just because there's
1335940	1341100	a Jupiter swinging through its region that would change its orbit.
1341780	1347420	Further, the planets that we find have to be at the right distance from their star in
1347420	1349980	order to have liquid water.
1349980	1355100	Now, we don't know so much about this, we have to make guesses.
1355100	1359580	And to be optimistic, we could sort of extrapolate from our solar system and say that for every
1359580	1363860	giant planet formed, one suitable Earth mass planet forms.
1363860	1366740	Now, that's what we see in our solar system.
1366740	1369820	And perhaps that's just wishful thinking.
1369860	1375420	But I really like to believe that there are plenty of suitable planets and moons out there
1375420	1377540	to be found.
1377540	1379340	But there's still a long way to go.
1379340	1381220	We now have some planets.
1381220	1384380	But how does basic life develop?
1384380	1387500	Is it an easy process or is it hard?
1387500	1390740	We look on Earth and it arose rather quickly.
1390740	1396540	Once the heavy bombardment starts to slow down, a few hundred million years, we get life.
1396540	1401460	And the biologists I've talked to seem to think that that should be the norm elsewhere
1401460	1403300	in the universe.
1403300	1408340	One of them said to me that he thinks the universe is absolutely brimming with light.
1408340	1412340	But nearly all of it is green slime.
1412340	1417220	Algae could be the dominant life form in the universe.
1417220	1422980	And that's because no one knows the probability of developing complex life.
1422980	1431700	It took billions of years on Earth and there were a number of outside influences that changed
1431700	1434220	the process along the way.
1434220	1438220	Is the story of what happened on Earth a common one?
1438220	1443060	And when we consider complex life, I'm going to just jump from multicellular organisms
1443060	1446220	all the way to advanced technological civilizations.
1446220	1451460	Yeah, you can question if complex species will develop.
1451460	1455980	If intelligence will develop in those species and if technology will be developed.
1455980	1460940	But I'm really willing to grant those things because the history seems to tell me that
1460940	1466660	if you can just get two cells to cooperate, that's the linchpin.
1466660	1472500	That's the simple power of cooperation then takes over and the rest of that stuff, that's
1472500	1474660	probably inevitable.
1474660	1481140	Of course, I got to admit, we don't really know what precipitated the Cambrian explosion.
1481140	1485340	So perhaps I'm being too optimistic again.
1485340	1493300	But the really unknown question is how long does advanced life last?
1493300	1497740	We have had the technological capability to communicate with other civilizations across
1497740	1503140	our galaxy for at most a hundred years.
1503140	1508700	Will we get ourselves into trouble in the next few hundred years with global warming?
1508700	1512100	Or will there be another global mass extinction?
1512100	1517220	The fossil record shows that every hundred million years or so, much of the biological
1517220	1520660	slate is just white clean.
1520660	1527260	The point is that stars evolve on billion year timescales.
1527260	1532980	Perhaps life is developing around a nearby star, but it won't reach a technological state
1532980	1536660	for another two billion years.
1536660	1540660	Will we be around then to communicate with them?
1540660	1548100	Or put it a different way, it's pretty hard to have a conversation with green slime.
1548100	1557580	So as I look up at the stars of our galaxy, I really want to believe that there are myriad
1557580	1564860	of planetary systems, planets like Earth, and advanced life forms living on them.
1564860	1570340	But there's one final question that tempers that optimism.
1570340	1577700	If the galaxy is truly teaming with life, then where are these aliens?
1577700	1582700	If they've been around for billions of years, they should have developed the technology
1582700	1584980	and found us.
1584980	1590420	Even just robotic explorers with billions of years to explore the galaxy should be able
1590420	1593780	to search out all the nooks and crannies.
1593780	1598060	And how come we see no evidence of their existence?
1598060	1605380	To put it bluntly, where are the gamma ray signatures of their hyperdrive spaceships?
1605380	1614300	So there is some logical limit to just how filled with life the galaxy can be.
1614300	1618660	It would be awfully lonely if we were the only civilization.
1619100	1624980	I really don't buy the arguments that say we're somehow special.
1624980	1628580	Our history does show a series of random chance events.
1628580	1636500	But given 100 billion stars in the galaxy, those odds should pay off many times over.
1636500	1642580	And so, really, when it comes to thinking about life in the universe, the best we can
1642580	1649260	do is to look at the stars and wonder.
1649260	1654660	And that, my friends, brings us full circle in this course.
1654660	1661260	At the end of the first lecture, I spoke of the essential motivation for astronomy.
1661260	1666940	Simply just staring up at the night sky and wondering.
1666940	1673140	And now we've finished this course, and we've learned so much about what's up there.
1673140	1681380	We've seen the fiery eruptions from our sun and the icy frozen worlds of the Kuiper Belt,
1681380	1689700	the sterile tranquility of the moon, and the constant volcanic eruptions on Io, the intricate
1689700	1696860	ring system of Saturn, and the complex history of continental drift.
1696860	1704580	We've seen the demotion of one planet and the discovery of hundreds of others, robotic
1704580	1712460	vehicles that explore the surface of Mars and the Voyager spacecraft that are now exiting
1712460	1714940	our solar system.
1714940	1721820	They're Jupiter-sized planets orbiting close to their stars, and they're long period comets
1721820	1726060	that are stretching all the way out towards interstellar space.
1726060	1732260	We've seen ammonia clouds, methane lakes, and sulfuric acid rain.
1732260	1740340	We've seen impacts that have scarred Jupiter, created the moon, and caused global extinctions.
1740340	1746860	There are planet-wide dust storms on Mars and Earth-sized hurricanes on Jupiter.
1746860	1753220	We can see the hellish conditions on Venus and the perfect conditions for life here on
1753220	1755580	Earth.
1755580	1766900	And yet, in the end, after all that, we are still looking up, wondering what else is
1766900	1773900	out there, imagining the new discoveries that will be made, and how they will change our
1773900	1780060	view of the solar system, of our planet, and of ourselves.
1780180	1785700	I'd like to leave you with one final movie.
1785700	1793780	This is the view of Earth from the messenger satellite, as it goes off to explore our solar
1793780	1796980	system.
1796980	1806620	Our planet, rotating on its axis, hanging in the empty blackness and receding into space.
1806620	1818100	It's a fitting visual metaphor to our continuing journey of exploring the solar system.
1818100	1823460	Good luck in your journeys, and may they always be filled with wonder.
1823460	1823860	So long.
