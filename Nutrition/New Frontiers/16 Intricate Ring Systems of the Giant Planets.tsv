0	22640	If there's any one shape that can be used to evoke astronomy, I would think it would
22640	25280	be the silhouette of Saturn.
25280	32520	Just a simple circle, cross cut by a ring plane, and the audience knows the subject.
32520	37600	There are other shapes easily associated with astronomy, like stars and galaxies, but stars
37600	43840	have other associations, especially like Hollywood, and spirals occur many places in nature.
43840	49440	It is the rings of Saturn that are uniquely iconic of the heavens.
49440	55360	Now I gave a talk at a star party once, and a star party is when astronomers get together
55360	59680	and they gather and set up several telescopes for community observing.
59680	63840	And my wife has an engineering degree, and she took astronomy courses in college, and
63840	66520	she's heard me speak many times.
66520	73720	However, I've never seen her more genuinely excited than when she saw the rings of Saturn
73720	76120	through a good sized telescope.
76120	80160	We looked at Jupiter, we looked at Venus, we looked at a bunch of star clusters, they
80160	82200	didn't do it for her.
82200	86320	Saturn's rings were what moved her the most.
86320	92560	And yet, for all the symbolic stature, the details of the ring systems are not really
92560	94720	well known by the public.
94720	99760	And scientifically, we have a few outstanding problems as well.
99760	105680	This lecture will explore Saturn's rings, as well as the rings of the other giant planets,
105680	110000	and how they relate to the moons that we discussed in a previous lecture.
110000	114340	It will feature some brand new knowledge that we have gotten from the Cassini mission to
114340	115840	Saturn.
115840	120080	This Cassini mission has revealed the rings in unprecedented detail, and I think it's
120080	124920	safe to say that we'll be learning from that data for many years and even decades.
124920	129760	So in addition to the material in this lecture, you ought to check your newspaper or the internet
129760	132520	for late breaking updates.
132520	133920	Let's start with Saturn.
133920	138040	It has the most extensive ring system and supplies most of our knowledge about rings
138040	140120	in the solar system.
140120	145320	Here is an image of Saturn as seen from Earth, and the easily visible rings extend to about
145320	148920	1.5 Saturn radii.
148920	153160	If we look at these rings a little more close up, I can give you the basic structure that
153160	154720	we define for them.
154720	159760	And they are basically three rings, A, B, and C. The outer ring is called A, and in
159760	164120	between the A and B rings we have the Cassini division, and then B is the bright middle
164120	170160	ring, and then the faint ring on the inside closest to Saturn is C. Now you'll note that
170160	174120	the Cassini division is relatively transparent, because if you look here in the upper right,
174120	178920	you can actually see the limb of Saturn through the Cassini division.
178920	182000	The other thing I would like you to note is in the outer part of the A ring, there's
182000	188760	another gap, and this we call the Anki gap, and we'll come back to that later.
188760	194280	If instead we look at these rings close up, this is an image from the Cassini satellite,
194280	198280	you can see that the rings are definitely not solid.
198280	201880	Seeing them from Earth, you can't really tell what are they composed of.
201880	205800	Here you can see that they're composed of thousands of individual ringlets.
205800	210360	These are like grooves on a phonograph record, although that's for those of us who remember
210360	211360	phonograph records.
211360	218200	For those of you who grew up with CDs, well, ask your parents what a phonograph record
218200	220000	looks like.
220000	225200	These ringlets themselves are composed of bright, icy particles, and they're too small
225200	226800	to see individually.
226800	231680	They go from dust size to boulder size, a few tens of meters.
231680	237880	The scale here is if you look at this Cassini division, that's about 5,000 kilometers across.
237880	242440	That's the same as the diameter of Mercury, so basically the whole planet Mercury could
242440	246760	fit into the Cassini division, so you can see we definitely could not see boulder sized
246760	250120	objects on the scale of this image.
250120	253000	There are two other things that are apparent in this image.
253000	257040	First of all, is that there's an extra ring that we couldn't see from Earth.
257040	263040	This is the very thin F ring out here on the edge just outside the A ring.
263040	267800	The other thing is that you can see the Cassini division is not really empty.
267800	272160	There are many faint ringlets circling within the Cassini division.
272160	277400	The reason you can see them here is that this image was taken at a large reflecting angle.
277400	280840	Most of the times when you see Saturn's rings, the light is coming from the Sun, hitting
280840	283600	the rings, and bouncing back to Earth.
283600	286080	That's at a very shallow reflecting angle.
286080	290280	But Cassini is at Saturn, so the light comes from the Sun, bounces off the rings, and is
290280	295200	seen by Cassini, and it can be at a very much larger reflecting angle.
295200	299960	And due to the scattering properties of small particles, it's much easier to see these small
299960	302660	particles at large reflecting angles.
302660	308440	So we wouldn't be able to see these small particles unless we're actually at Saturn
308440	311040	to get these large reflecting angles.
311040	316200	You can see even more if the rings are totally backlit.
316200	320840	Now this is an absolutely amazing image of Saturn.
320840	321840	It's not a drawing.
321840	327800	This is a real image from Cassini, where Cassini, the spacecraft, is in the eclipse
327800	330080	shadow of Saturn.
330080	337980	The Sun is eclipsed by Saturn, and in that case you're able to see the incredible range
337980	340120	of the Saturnian ring system.
340120	344540	You can see the outer part of Saturn's atmosphere is illuminated, and you can see that the night
344540	350320	side of Saturn is lit by light scattered from the rings.
350320	355160	And like the total solar eclipse shows the solar corona, here we can start to see the
355160	356760	faint outer ring.
356760	361800	This is the E-ring wrapping around the outer parts of the ring system.
361800	367360	These are micron sized particles that they're seen well only when they are backlit.
367360	373200	So the full extent of Saturn's ring system goes out to about 5 Saturn radii.
373200	377160	Now if we come in a little bit closer on this image, you can see the E-ring that I just
377160	378520	talked about.
378520	383440	Then also just outside the main rings, you can see a thinner G-ring.
383440	388640	This is also micron sized particles, so that's only seen well in backlit.
388640	395760	And then very faint right in close to the planet inside of the C-ring there is the D-ring.
395760	399420	And again, these are seen only in backlit situations.
399420	405900	So a significant point is that the appearance of the rings of Saturn is different depending
405900	407680	upon the angle with the Sun.
407680	412220	There's a great example of this called the opposition surge.
412220	418340	Now in this image the Sun is almost directly behind the satellite and over time the Sun's
418340	422340	reflecting point will move up through these rings and you'll see how the appearance of
422340	430940	the rings changes depending upon the angle with the Sun.
430940	437980	The Cassini division appears either more filled or less filled depending upon the angle of
437980	440860	the Sun.
440860	448260	It also shows that you truly need a spacecraft in order to fully explore the rings of Saturn.
448260	453960	Now one really cool fact about Saturn's rings is that they are remarkably thin.
453960	458340	This image here shows Saturn's rings almost edge on.
458340	463540	The dark line across the planet is not the rings, but rather the shadow of the rings
463540	469320	because the rings here are edge on to Earth, not edge on to the Sun, so they still make
469320	470320	a bit of a shadow.
470320	473800	But you can see how very very thin they are.
473800	481480	The main rings are about 280,000 kilometers across, yet only 100 meters thick, less than
481480	484720	a kilometer thick.
484720	488000	This is flatter than a piece of paper.
488000	490320	What do I mean by that?
490320	497740	Well, this is a ream of paper, okay, 500 sheets, and it's about 2 inches thick.
497740	503700	So if it's 500 sheets and 2 inches, that makes an individual sheet about one 250th of an
503700	505460	inch thick.
505460	512700	Now the width of the paper is around 11 inches, so the ratio of its width to its thickness
512700	515300	is about 3,000.
515300	523420	For the rings, we're talking 300,000 to 0.1, and so the ratio of the width to the thickness
523420	528340	is about 3 million for Saturn's rings.
528340	534860	This piece of paper would have to be a thousand times thinner in order to accurately represent
534860	541740	the thickness of Saturn's rings.
541740	543140	Why would this be so?
543140	547940	Well, the reason is due to collisions within the rings.
547940	551100	The non-uniform motions would be damped.
551100	556020	If you scatter out of the ring plane, eventually as you cross the ring plane, you're going
556020	560260	to have collisions and you're going to be forced to go with the flow.
560260	564300	It's similar to a dense crowd leading a stadium.
564300	567500	Everyone's headed towards the exit, and if you say, oh, I have to go to the bathroom,
567500	571020	and you try to cross cut that crowd, it's really difficult because you keep slamming
571020	574340	into people and they start pushing you towards the exit.
574340	577220	It's very hard to move in other directions.
577220	581380	This is the same thing that happens within Saturn's rings.
581380	586780	Eventually particles that go onto non-uniform orbits will collide and be steered back onto
586780	594940	uniform orbits, and this is what produces the exceedingly thin ring structure.
594940	596900	So that's the basics for Saturn.
596900	600140	Now let's look at the other giant planets.
600140	603340	Here is an image of Jupiter's rings.
603340	609420	This is an equivalent eclipse image from the Galileo satellite, and it's not quite
609420	613020	as dramatic as what we see for Saturn.
613020	619780	You can see that Jupiter does have a main ring and that it's very thin, both in its
619780	624740	annular width, but also in its thickness, it's also a very thin ring like Saturn's.
624740	627420	Jupiter also has two other components.
627420	633380	They have a much larger, what they call the Gossamer ring, and that extends about twice
633380	638860	the size of the main ring, and then interior to the main ring, they have the halo ring,
638860	643460	which is some particles that appear to be lifted up, electrostatically lifted up from
643460	644940	the ring plane.
644940	649180	Now you can see that when you look in backlit images.
649180	655460	The top image here from New Horizons is as New Horizons was approaching Jupiter and the
655460	660740	ring of Jupiter was front lit, and the bottom image is as it was receding from Jupiter,
660740	662180	and it is backlit.
662180	664580	And in that you can see the halo particles.
664580	671460	Again, this indicates that we have dust size particle in the halo ring of Jupiter.
671460	675980	This image shows what Voyager saw at Uranus.
675980	681980	These are Uranus's rings, and they, like the ring of, the main ring of Jupiter, are very
681980	684420	small and thin rings.
684580	687100	Here we have several distinct rings.
687100	693060	They are quite narrow, only about 10 kilometers wide, and if you count them you can count
693060	696060	oh, maybe 10 rings.
696060	701500	However, let's use that backlighting trick again and see what we see.
701500	706700	Well, the top of this image shows the front lit view of Uranus's rings, and the bottom
706700	711580	shows the backlit view, and again you see much more structure when you're looking in
711580	712580	backlit.
712580	716180	There are many, many ringlets, and many dust bands.
716180	722100	You'll also note that on the left hand side here, this is called the Epsilon ring.
722100	724100	It doesn't seem to match up.
724100	728300	This is because the Epsilon ring is actually mildly eccentric.
728300	734140	It has a ellipticity to it, alright, so it is actually further away from Uranus in the
734140	738540	top image and closer on the bottom image, but it's still the same ring.
738540	741900	It's not an alignment problem of the images.
741900	746940	This next image shows us Neptune's rings, and again this is sort of like the eclipse
746940	751300	image for Saturn and Jupiter, but here we've actually just blocked out Neptune.
751300	755620	There are actually two images, one from either side, because you have to expose so much in
755620	761900	order to see these rings that any exposure of Neptune would blow out the image.
761900	768020	There are about five ring structures in Neptune's rings, and they are named after the men involved
768020	769860	in Neptune's discovery.
769860	773660	The brightest one here in the center is called Laverier.
773660	779980	The outer one is called Adams, and the inner one is called Gall.
779980	785100	Outside of Laverier, there are two faint ring structures named Lassel and Aragot.
785100	790220	Again, these are thin, faint, and very dark rings.
790220	794940	We have to expose a really long time in order to be able to see them.
794940	799700	So in contrast to Saturn, it has many bright rings.
799700	805780	The rings of the other giant planets are very few, very thin, and very dark.
805780	811100	The particles in these rings are as dark as charcoal, and that may be produced by particle
811100	812500	bombardment.
812500	819180	If the atomic particles smash into the ring particles, it can remove the bright ices and
819180	824460	leave dark organic residue that can be basically as black as coal.
824460	830100	So that sort of begs the question, why are Saturn's rings so bright?
830100	833100	Aren't they also being hit?
833100	839020	And why does Saturn have so many rings and the other giant planets don't?
839020	842660	Unfortunately, I don't really have the answers for you.
842660	847500	These are two topics of ongoing research.
847500	853180	Our next topic in this lecture is how the rings interact with moons.
853180	856620	Now the intellectual answer is, of course, that they interact through gravity.
856620	858340	That's how they're naturally going to happen.
858340	862020	But the visual answer can be really fascinating.
862020	867420	The first thing I want to do is establish that the rings and the moons share an orbit
867420	871740	plane, and we have a very beautiful way to do so.
871740	876540	This is a movie of Saturn when the rings were edge on to the sun.
876540	878580	So they're not quite edge on to the earth.
878580	882820	You can see a little bit of the ring plane, and there are three moons that are going
882860	885900	to move across the face of Saturn during this movie.
885900	888980	At the start, you can see the small moon here in the center.
888980	895020	This is Enceladus, and its shadow is stretched across the ring.
895020	896900	The moon to its left is Mimus.
896900	900180	It actually has a bit of an inclined orbit, so it's not going to cast a shadow on the
900180	901180	rings.
901180	906300	And then the real feature is going to be Dione down here that is going to swing across,
906300	907900	and you're going to see its shadow.
907900	912660	You'll also catch a little glimpse of Tethys in the upper right as it moves behind Saturn.
913660	918660	So here you can see Dione's shadow going across the left side of the rings.
920660	926660	While Mimus and Enceladus, there goes Tethys, have shadows on the surface of Saturn, and
926660	937660	Dione's shadow across Saturn, and then Dione's shadow swings across the rings of Saturn again.
938660	944660	These are moon shadows going across Saturn's rings, and it's something that happens only
944660	947660	once every 15 years.
947660	952660	It also shows us that the moons are in the same plane as the rings.
952660	960660	This is a diagram of Saturn's moons and rings, and it shows you the ABCDEF and G-rings, as
960660	965660	well as the various moons that orbit within that same region.
965660	971660	There are several small moons that orbit within the rings, and a bunch of more tiny moons
971660	974660	that are actually even not shown on this diagram.
974660	981660	This sort of begs a question when you look at this, is how small a particle can you consider
981660	982660	a moon?
982660	990660	And we have Mimus here, and Janus, and Epimetheus, and the other moons notated on this diagram,
990660	997660	but all of the particles in the rings also could be considered moons.
997660	1000660	We often refer to them as moonlets.
1000660	1006660	Where is the dividing line between what constitutes a ring particle and what constitutes a moon
1006660	1009660	in the Saturn system?
1009660	1015660	The other thing you can see in this diagram is that the Cassini division is about halfway
1015660	1019660	out to Mimus, working from Saturn's surface.
1019660	1024660	The Cassini division's inner boundary is actually located at a 2 to 1 gravitational
1024660	1027660	resonance with Mimus's orbit.
1027660	1032660	That means that in a time Mimus makes one orbit, a particle at the inner boundary of the
1032660	1035660	Cassini division would make two orbits.
1035660	1042660	And these periodic gravitational tugs from Mimus may create waves that help clear out
1042660	1044660	the Cassini division.
1044660	1050660	However, we're not quite sure because we see other resonances in the Saturnian system
1050660	1055660	that are not cleared, and we even see some resonances where particles tend to accumulate
1055660	1057660	at those resonances.
1057660	1062660	The other strong resonance that we're sure of is the outer boundary of the A-ring, and
1062660	1066660	that's a 7 to 6 gravitational resonance with the moon Janus.
1066660	1072660	And Mimus and Janus are the two largest objects in this region, and it sort of makes sense
1072660	1078660	that resonances with them would help define some of the boundaries of the Saturnian rings.
1078660	1082660	Not all of the boundaries can be easily defined in this manner.
1082660	1087660	You can actually see that some moons are actually located within the ring system.
1087660	1092660	Here's an image of that enky gap that I mentioned before, and if you look inside it,
1092660	1095660	you can see the small moon Pan.
1095660	1101660	Pan orbits within the enky gap, and matter of fact, its gravity is what clears the gap.
1102660	1108660	Now, if you look down bottom, you can see that there's yet another gap in the outer part of the A-ring.
1108660	1112660	This is called the Keeler gap, and we'll get to that in just a second.
1112660	1116660	Let's explore the enky gap at a little bit closer look.
1116660	1123660	On the left-hand side of this image, you can see scalloping on the edges on the inner part of the enky gap.
1123660	1127660	You can also see sort of a spiral wave pattern.
1127660	1132660	These are created by Pan's orbit through the enky gap,
1132660	1137660	that it creates these spiral wave patterns that clump and move the ring particles,
1137660	1141660	and then create this scalloped pattern on the inside of it.
1141660	1143660	Now, let's go back to that Keeler gap.
1143660	1147660	The Keeler gap is also inhabited by a tiny moon.
1147660	1153660	This one is called Daphnis, and Daphnis is only seven kilometers across.
1153660	1158660	Really, the size of a standard asteroid type object.
1158660	1164660	But, you can see that its gravity is strong enough to produce ripples in the edge of the gap,
1164660	1168660	and Daphnis may even be pulling material off of the rings.
1168660	1173660	If we look really, really closely at this image, there's a faint spot next to Daphnis,
1173660	1179660	where it may be a creating material pulled from the rings onto Daphnis.
1180660	1183660	Let's move on to the Uranian system.
1183660	1188660	Here is a same diagram for Uranus' rings and moons,
1188660	1193660	and here you can see that most of the moons are outside the ring system.
1193660	1198660	The moons are named for the characters in a Midsummer Night's Dream,
1198660	1201660	while the rings, well, they have a sort of mixed up naming convention.
1201660	1205660	Some of them are named Greek letters, alpha, beta, gamma, delta.
1205660	1212660	Some of our numbers, four, five, and six, and one of them is designated as 1986 U2R.
1212660	1216660	Not a really coherent taxonomy for these rings,
1216660	1222660	but what I really want to point out is the two moons orbiting right next to the epsilon rings.
1222660	1225660	Here is a Voyager image of those two moons.
1225660	1228660	They are named Ophelia and Cordelia,
1228660	1232660	and the Voyager 2 discovered these moons in 1986.
1232660	1235660	They're tiny, only about 15 kilometers each,
1235660	1240660	and what they do is they act as shepherd satellites for the epsilon ring.
1240660	1243660	They are on opposite sides of the ring,
1243660	1248660	and their gravitational tugs keep the ring very thin.
1248660	1251660	These shepherd moons are not only on Uranus,
1251660	1256660	we actually see shepherd moons on Saturn maintaining Saturn's F ring,
1256660	1259660	and there's a wonderful movie of the interaction.
1259660	1265660	This will be Prometheus and Pandora moons going past Saturn's F ring.
1265660	1269660	Prometheus is on the inside of the ring, and Pandora is on the outside of the ring.
1269660	1272660	Now, these moons are larger than Ophelia and Cordelia.
1272660	1277660	They're on order 50 kilometers in size, and they produce larger effects.
1277660	1282660	You can see, as Prometheus swings along the inside,
1282660	1285660	the ripples that are created in the F ring.
1290660	1295660	These ripples are rather long-lasting,
1295660	1299660	and if we look at other structures in the F ring,
1299660	1304660	these are four images that Cassini has taken on the number of pictures
1304660	1309660	that show these strange structures in the F ring due to Prometheus and Pandora.
1309660	1313660	These four images here were actually taken within hours of each other,
1313660	1316660	but at different points around the F ring.
1316660	1321660	So these same structures were occurring almost simultaneously on the ring,
1321660	1323660	but they seemed totally different.
1323660	1328660	So I guess shepherding ring particles would appear to be a bit of a messy job,
1328660	1334660	because after you move them, it takes some time for them to settle into a line.
1334660	1339660	Another type of moon interaction can be seen at Neptune.
1339660	1343660	This is an image of Neptune's outermost bright two rings,
1343660	1348660	atoms and laverier, and the brightest and densest regions of the atoms ring
1348660	1351660	are really just partial arcs.
1351660	1355660	These ring arcs have been dubbed libertae, fraternité, and egalité,
1355660	1359660	which I think is rather strange because it was laverier who was French,
1359660	1361660	and atoms was English.
1361660	1366660	But, you know, who am I to tell people about their taxonomy?
1366660	1371660	The interactions that produce these rings are with Neptune's moon Galatia,
1371660	1378660	and in this diagram, you can see that Galatia orbits just inside of the atoms ring,
1378660	1384660	and these arcs are produced by the gravitational interaction with this 150 kilometer sized moon.
1384660	1391660	Now they tell me that the resonance is a 42 to 43 orbital resonance,
1391660	1394660	which really kind of blows my mind,
1394660	1399660	and that this resonance confines particles to these very short segments
1399660	1402660	that end up making up these arcs.
1402660	1406660	I just find it amazing that such a high order resonance, you know,
1406660	1411660	Mimus was a 2 to 1 resonance with a Cassini division, this is a 42 to 43 resonance.
1411660	1417660	It just seems strange that such a high order resonance would have such a striking effect.
1417660	1421660	Our last topic, and sort of the most direct influence of the moons,
1421660	1426660	is that some moons may be the source of the rings.
1426660	1430660	Here is the same diagram for Jupiter,
1430660	1435660	and what you can see in this diagram is that there are gaps in the ring system in the Gossamer ring
1435660	1438660	at the orbit of Thiebe and at Amalthea,
1438660	1443660	and that Metis and Adrastea are within the main ring.
1443660	1448660	Now, these are not clearing out the gaps, or they're not shepherding the ring.
1448660	1453660	Rather, the particle bombardment smashing onto the moon
1453660	1456660	are producing sources of dust-sized particles.
1456660	1459660	Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field,
1459660	1462660	so the particles will be traveling along the magnetic field lines,
1462660	1465660	they'll be moving up and down, smash into the moons,
1465660	1468660	the small particles will be sent into orbit,
1468660	1471660	and these form the faint dusty rings.
1471660	1474660	We have an even better example of this,
1474660	1477660	seen in some brand new rings we just discovered at Saturn.
1477660	1481660	These are the Saturn rings, again backlit, so we can see the dusty particles.
1481660	1484660	You can see the G-ring here, outside the main ring,
1484660	1487660	and then beyond that we have the E-ring.
1487660	1491660	Now, inside of the G-ring is a new ring.
1491660	1497660	This is associated with the moons Janus and Epimetheus.
1497660	1501660	This is the same distance as the orbit of Janus and Epimetheus,
1501660	1506660	and it appears that the particles coming off of those two moons have formed this new ring.
1506660	1511660	Further, there's an even fader, smaller ring way out here
1511660	1515660	that's associated with a brand new moon discovered by Cassini called Palin.
1515660	1519660	The Palin is only four kilometers across.
1519660	1523660	Now, I note that this bright dot here happens to be in the Palin ring,
1523660	1527660	but it's not Palin, it's actually just a background star.
1527660	1535660	The most striking example of a ring-creating moon is with Saturn's moon Enceladus.
1535660	1542660	Here is a mosaic of Enceladus, and what I want you to notice are these tiger stripes down bottom.
1542660	1550660	These are fractures in Enceladus, big ridges and troughs in the southern region of Enceladus.
1550660	1558660	Now, when we take a backlit view of Enceladus, we can see that they are geologically active.
1558660	1562660	These are like ice geysers, and we discussed this in a previous lecture.
1562660	1567660	This icy particles are spewing out the bottom of Enceladus,
1567660	1572660	and the connection to the rings is that these create the E-ring.
1572660	1579660	The entire outer E-ring comes from these icy emissions from the moon Enceladus.
1579660	1586660	So the moon's orbit within and around the rings, they not only gravitationally influence the rings,
1586660	1591660	they actively produce some of the rings.
1592660	1598660	So where did the rings come from, and how long will they last?
1598660	1605660	We sort of answered the second question a little bit, because many of the small particles in the rings won't last long.
1605660	1609660	They should be cleared in as little as a thousand years.
1609660	1615660	Some of these small particles will then just fall onto the planets, collapse on, their orbits will decay,
1615660	1618660	and they'll fall onto their planets in as little as a thousand years.
1618660	1623660	They needed a replenishing source, and those would be the moons themselves.
1623660	1627660	For the large particles, there are two main ideas.
1627660	1630660	One is that the rings may have formed with the planet,
1630660	1636660	and the idea is that as the planet forms, and it's orbiting, and you've got the moons forming around it,
1636660	1639660	there might be some moons that never really formed,
1639660	1647660	and the large particles would be with the remnants of a moon that didn't form as the planet was forming.
1647660	1652660	The main problem with this is how do you get these rings to hang around for billions of years?
1652660	1658660	Because if we do the math, the gravity and collisions and the decay of orbits,
1658660	1660660	well, that should collapse the rings.
1660660	1667660	I've seen an estimate that Saturn's A ring should collapse onto the B ring in timescales as little as 100 million years.
1667660	1672660	Well, for a solar system that's four and a half billion years old, that's kind of a problem.
1672660	1675660	The rings shouldn't hang around for that long.
1675660	1681660	So the alternative is that the rings come from the breakup of moons and comets.
1681660	1682660	Now, there are two ways.
1682660	1684660	One would be a collision breakup.
1684660	1687660	You take two things, smash them together, the pieces come off,
1687660	1691660	and the pieces then become the large particles in the rings.
1691660	1694660	The other way would be through tidal breakup.
1694660	1697660	If a moon is orbiting too close to its planet,
1697660	1701660	then the tidal stresses on that moon can actually break the moon apart,
1701660	1706660	and then the pieces would then become the rings that orbit around the planet.
1706660	1713660	The problem here is again that you need a resupply of moons and comets to break apart.
1713660	1716660	Where do these moons and comets come from?
1716660	1720660	And when the supply runs out, no more rings.
1720660	1727660	So theoretically, Saturn's rings should only be a few hundred million years old,
1727660	1731660	so that the objects that broke apart to form these rings
1731660	1737660	would have to keep coming over and over in order for the rings to last 4.6 billion years.
1737660	1741660	So we don't know how long the rings really last.
1741660	1747660	We do know that due to the forces on them, they're inherently a transient phenomenon.
1747660	1752660	There's one more really cool idea.
1752660	1757660	Mars has a moon Phobos, and its orbit is decaying.
1757660	1764660	It's estimated that it will decay and end up hitting Mars in about 50 million years.
1764660	1769660	But before it does, it will likely break apart.
1769660	1776660	And when it does, Mars will have a ring for a short while.
1776660	1781660	In our next lecture, we'll look at one resupply source for the rings.
1781660	1786660	These would be the icy vagabonds of the outer solar system, the comets.
1786660	1791660	Until then, have a great day.
