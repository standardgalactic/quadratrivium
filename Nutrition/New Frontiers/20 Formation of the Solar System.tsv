0	22640	Because I'm a professional astronomer today, some folks assumed that I always wanted to
22640	27680	be an astronomer, that I grew up with telescopes and studying the sky as a hobby.
28000	32240	Well, the truth is, I didn't think about being an astronomer when I was young.
33120	39440	My favorite thing was, and still is, solving puzzles. I was always good at math,
39440	46000	and I really enjoyed the word problems. In high school calculus, the best word problems came from
46000	52320	physics, so I majored in physics at college. As I progressed in physics, the most interesting
52720	57760	physics problems were in astronomy, and I did my graduate work in astronomy.
58640	66080	So it was a sideways route, from mathematics to physics to astronomy, and always with an
66080	72320	analytical bent. Those who grow up with telescopes tend to be what we call amateur astronomers.
72880	76640	Now, I don't want to use the term amateur to imply a lack of expertise,
77280	80560	it more implies that they don't get paid to do astronomy.
81600	86560	These folks tend to focus more on observing techniques and the qualitative aspects of astronomy.
87360	93040	To get your PhD in astronomy, you really have to delve deep into the mathematics behind
93040	98560	celestial objects. This is sort of the fundamental dichotomy between descriptive
98560	105040	and quantitative astronomy. Astrophysics research is concerned both with what is out there,
106000	111760	and with how it came to be that way. Today's lecture explores the latter half,
112400	119760	the formation of the solar system. The basic idea is called the nebular hypothesis,
120480	124800	and it's originally due not to an astronomer, but the philosopher Emmanuel Kant.
126080	132480	In 1755, he came up with this idea. In this drawing, you can see it starts with an immense
132480	140480	cloud of low density gas. Gravity causes this cloud to collapse, and as it collapses, rotation
141520	148080	naturally forms a disk. The planets form in circular orbits within this disk.
148960	152000	Eventually, you end up with a solar system as it appears today.
153120	159200	This is a nice descriptive story, and it sufficiently explains all the qualitative
159200	166240	aspects of our solar system. However, when you look in detail, you find that some parts
166240	174560	are not yet fully explained. Let's begin on a much larger scale. Let's look at the scale of galaxies.
175520	183120	This is a spiral galaxy, Messier 51, also called the Whirlpool Galaxy, and galaxies are composed
183120	189760	of stars, gas, and dust. And this image, which was taken with visible light, the stars are the
189760	196320	most prominent things you see. However, if you use the Spitzer Space Telescope and look in infrared
196320	204800	light, the infrared light reveals the warm dust. This is the dust inside the spiral disk of this
204800	210400	galaxy. And you can see how it's threaded throughout the galaxy. It's not just concentrated in the
210480	218000	spiral arms, it's all over, threaded in throughout the galaxy. These spiral galaxies have these flat
218000	224960	disks that are basically shaped like a pancake, and if you look at them edge on, here is a galaxy
224960	235840	named NGC 5861. Looking at it edge on, you can see dark dust lanes. These dark dust lanes show the
235840	245040	cold clouds in the galaxies, and these cold clouds are where stars form. Now, how big of a
245040	250800	cloud would you need to form a star? You can make a simple estimate by taking the mass of the sun
251360	259040	and divide it by the average density of the interstellar material. So, doing that calculation,
259040	265440	you find that you need about one light year cubed as the minimum size cloud necessary.
266080	273280	So, take one light year, one cubic light year of interstellar material, that will collapse down to
273280	279520	about one solar mass. But generally, you're not going to have a full efficiency. Not all of that
279520	285680	mass is going to go into the star, so you need about 10 times the mass of the star in a protosteller,
286320	295600	protosteller nebula. This image here is an image of an object called a bak globule. It's the big
295600	301040	dark splotch in the middle of the image. It's dark not because there are no stars there,
301040	307440	but because it's a dense dark cloud that's blocking out all the light of the stars behind it.
308400	315200	It's roughly one light year in size, and this is really not a full interstellar cloud,
315200	320720	it's just a small core of interstellar cloud within much, much larger interstellar clouds
320720	327200	that we call giant molecular cloud. These giant molecular clouds can contain as much as a million
327200	333680	solar masses, and so they're much, much bigger than these few solar mass bak globules. But still,
333680	339200	even these giant molecular clouds are small compared to the trillion solar masses. That's the
339200	348640	total mass within a galaxy like our own. To form a star, such a cloud undergoes gravitational collapse,
349360	355760	and gravity is a rich gets richer scenario. If you have just a little more mass here,
356560	363520	you also have a little more gravity, and that attracts more mass. Having that more mass
363520	368640	provides more gravity, which attracts more mass, which gives you more gravity, and so on.
369840	375760	Regions that are over dense that have a little bit more mass tend to grow and grow and grow.
377040	383680	This collapse, however, can be slowed or stopped by thermal pressure. Now, thermal pressure is the
383680	390480	idea that gas collides and heats up, and when you heat something up, an increase in temperature
391200	397200	also creates an increase in pressure. We call this thermal pressure, and this thermal pressure
397200	405600	can provide a force that pushes out that resists the collapse force of gravity. So in order to
405600	411440	remove this thermal pressure, you need to be able to radiate away this heat, radiate away that heat
411440	417440	energy, remove the thermal pressure, and the collapse can continue. Here are some inter-star
417440	425040	clouds seen using both infrared light and radio light. The warm clouds are seen in infrared,
425040	432160	and they're shown here in green. The cold clouds are seen in radio light, and they're shown here
432160	439600	in red. Now, if you look at a couple of these clouds closely, you can see that the cold regions,
439600	447200	the red regions, are shielded inside of green regions, the warm regions. These dark clouds,
447200	454960	the dark cold clouds, are inside the warmer clouds, and stars form in these dark clouds,
454960	461520	because that is where the gas can cool. They're shielded, they're inside, this is where you can
461520	469280	cool, and energy can be radiated away. If you want to put it another way, if you see a bright cloud,
469280	474400	that cloud has been heated up, and those are hot clouds, and that's not where you're going to get
474400	482640	a star forming. Now, once the cloud starts collapsing, the question is, will it have enough
482640	490880	rotation to form a disk? The concept involved here is one called angular momentum, and before we get
490880	497840	to angular momentum, let's first discuss normal momentum. Momentum is defined as being mass times
497840	504160	velocity, and to understand it, I tend to think of car crashes. If you take a Hummer,
504160	508640	big old heavy Hummer, and a small little Volkswagen, and you crash them together,
508640	515440	which one's going to win? Well, the Hummer does, because it's more massive, so mass is important.
516080	521840	But what if you take a Hummer moving at, say, 10 miles an hour, and another Hummer moving at 70
521840	528320	miles an hour? In a crash like that, the high speed Hummer is going to win, and that shows you
528320	535600	that velocity is also important. So mass and velocity are both important when considering motion.
536480	542160	Momentum is the combination of mass times velocity, and this is a conserved quantity
542160	548480	in elastic collisions. I will, of course, note that car crashes are definitely not elastic collisions.
548800	556160	Angular momentum is simply momentum, but for a circular motion. Its mass times velocity
556160	562400	also times the distance to a pivot point. You can think of this as sort of spinning
562400	570000	or orbiting momentum, and angular momentum is also conserved in a system. So we can check the spin
570000	577280	of a collapsing nebula and see how much rotation it would have when it gets small. It starts
577520	585520	out at about, oh, one light year, right? And when it finishes, it will be down around 100 AU.
586240	594480	Now, one light year is about 65,000 AU. So just to make things approximate, let's say the radius
594480	599920	goes down by about a factor of 1,000. That means, since angular momentum is conserved,
599920	606080	that the velocity will go up by a factor of 1,000. The period depends on both radius and
606640	614560	velocity, and the period will go down by a factor of 1,000. So if the cloud is initially
614560	620240	rotating very, very slowly, say that this one light year cloud is rotating once every million
620240	627280	years, by the time it gets down to the size of a solar system, it will be rotating once per year.
628080	635440	That's plenty of spin to form a disk. The next stage, once you've formed a disk,
636080	641840	is to form the star at the center. How do you form the sun? And here's where the spin actually
641840	648240	becomes a problem, because there's really too much spin. The star is, again, much, much smaller
648240	653520	than the disk we just talked about. And if you continue that collapse scenario, then rotational
653520	661200	support will prevent collapse. The centripetal force will push out and stop that disk from
661200	668960	collapsing down to form a star. So in order to form a star, you actually need dual formation pass.
670160	675760	Starting with this giant cloud, only the inner parts can really collapse down and form
676400	682240	a core of a star, not a full star, but the core of the star. The outer parts will collapse down
682240	689760	and form a disk, and somehow you've got to get that material in the disk to feed onto the protostar.
689920	696000	Now, the way this is done is kind of complicated. The interactions in a disk, you know, can be
696000	703360	quite difficult to analyze with mathematics. But there is one simple overall principle.
704560	711680	Mass flows inward and angular momentum flows outward. That was about a month of graduate school,
712240	716720	going through the equations, figuring out that that really is true. Okay, so I've just saved you
716720	723200	a month of graduate school there. Mass flows inward and angular momentum flows outward. So some
723200	730160	material feeds onto the protostar as the mass flows inward, and some material is then flung
730160	737440	outward to large radius to take the angular momentum outward. We call this stage the teetori
737440	744160	stage, and here is an artist's depiction of it. You can see the disk around the protostar in the center.
744720	750560	There is accretion coming from the disk, and the protostar is growing, contracting,
750560	757840	and heating up. Often during this stage, there will be outflows of winds from the star,
758400	763600	and a pair of oppositely directed jets that go above and below the disk here.
765040	772960	Of real importance, later on in this lecture, is that this protostar is putting out a lot of
772960	780160	ultraviolet radiation. This heats and effectively evaporates the gas in the disk.
781360	787840	The system will eventually be swept clear of all the low density material in the disk.
787840	792400	As this protostar develops, as it produces more and more of this ultraviolet radiation,
792400	798160	more and more of the low density material in this disk will become evaporated,
798160	802800	and you will leave only a debris disk. All of the gaseous stuff will be gone,
802800	806960	and only the stuff that is collapsed to become high density material will be left behind.
808640	815680	Eventually, the protostar becomes a star. The core reaches an extremely high density,
816240	822400	and millions of temperatures at millions of degrees, and this is when hydrogen fusion starts.
823360	830560	That is when a star is born. A star turns on when hydrogen fusion starts in its core.
831840	836000	This T-Tauri phase lasts for tens of millions of years.
837760	842800	Now, let's move on to the formation of the planets. The first question when you're
842800	849280	going to form planets in this disk is, what are the ingredients? What was the composition
849280	855840	of the protostellar nebula? We used to think that we could look at comets as frozen remnants
855840	861440	of the original protostellar nebula. The idea was that the comets formed in the outer parts of
861440	866960	this protostellar nebula. They've been out there in this deep freeze for billions of years. If we
866960	873040	just chop one open, we could see what the protostellar nebula was composed of. Unfortunately,
873040	877840	as we've gotten to know comets, we see that their outsides have been processed heavily.
877840	883760	They are covered with this carbon-rich gook. They're black as coal. They aren't really the
883760	888400	original snowballs we thought they were, and their insides are rather puzzling,
889280	893680	and that they have materials coming that we believe form in the outer part of the solar system
893680	899520	and in the inner part of the solar system. They do, however, provide some clues. We also find
899520	905520	some clues among the meteorites, and among those, the carbonaceous chondrites are the
905520	909920	least altered meteorites that we can find, and they provide a few more ideas.
910880	916240	The rough ingredient list that we've defined from these sources is that you start with some dust
916240	924400	grains. These are objects. These are about 0.1 micron in size, and a micron is a millionth
924400	929760	of a meter. This is the scale of thousands of atoms. You have these dust grains that are very,
929760	939360	very small. They are composed basically of silicon, iron, and magnesium. Then you have gases, hydrogen,
939360	945440	carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and ammonia. And in the outer parts, you'll have ices,
946000	952400	and you'll find the ices in forms of snowflake type objects and ice coatings on these small dust
952400	959360	grains. The conditions in the disk when the planets form is that there is a temperature gradient.
959360	963600	Remember, you've got this hot protostar in the center, so it's going to be hotter in the interior
963600	970800	of the disk, and the farther you go out in the disk, the cooler it will get. This creates
970800	978640	a volatility gradient. The ices, of course, can't exist right next to the protostar. They can only
978640	984080	occur out in the outer regions. And the stuff that needs high temperature to form, that should
984080	992320	only occur in the interior of this disk. You also have a density gradient. The disk material
992320	997600	is flowing inward, which creates a logarithmic density profile, which basically just means that
997600	1003280	there's a lot more material per cubic meter at small radii than there is at large radii.
1004320	1010800	And that means that the formation times should be shorter, because at higher density, you've already
1010880	1017840	started a higher density, so building up larger objects is going to be faster than if you start
1017840	1022400	in the outer parts of the region of the disk, if you actually have to build up the density
1022400	1026400	to reach that high density before you can then start building up the objects.
1027920	1031360	The last thing to consider about the disk is that there's a time factor,
1031360	1035840	is that the low density material will be blown away in tens of millions of years.
1036560	1041440	The rocky planet formation is dominated by accretion. This is the building up of large bodies
1041440	1049280	from a myriad of small bodies. We start, a rocky planet starts as a millimeter-sized
1049280	1057680	chondrules. This is an image of some chondrules in a chondritic meteorite. This is the cross
1057680	1064000	section of the meteorite, and all of these small circular things here, these are the chondrules.
1064400	1072400	They are about a millimeter in size. They formed at very high temperatures, about 1500 degrees Kelvin,
1072400	1078400	and they cooled very quickly. We can tell because of their characteristic shape. We're not really
1078400	1084960	sure how these chondrules formed. You need something like lightning in the early disk in order to
1084960	1091360	create these chondrules. But once you have them, the chondrules and the dust grains stick together.
1091600	1098560	Using via gravity and a little bit by electrostatic forces. When they build up and reach a few centimeters,
1098560	1105120	then as they're orbiting, they start to have some gas drag on them. And that gas drag causes them to
1105120	1112320	slowly spiral inward. As they're spiraling inward, that helps them sweep up more material.
1112320	1118080	And eventually, they can reach sizes of one kilometer. And when you've reached a size of one
1118240	1123840	kilometer, the gas drag through the solar nebula becomes negligible, and you have what we call
1123840	1130880	a planetesimal. So it's a buildup from these chondrules all the way up to about one kilometer size
1130880	1137600	bodies at the beginning. Then the planetesimal collisions take over. The planetesimals, when
1137600	1143120	they collide at slow velocity, will join together and stick together and become larger planetesimals.
1144000	1149600	But if they come smashing together at high velocity, they'll actually break apart, and then
1149600	1154000	they'll have all these small objects that can, of course, get swept up by other planetesimals.
1155040	1161840	This planetesimal accretion process is yet again a rich get richer scenario. And we quickly develop
1161840	1169440	into a few hundred moon-sized bodies in the inner part of this protostellar disk. This
1169520	1177520	only takes about 20,000 years. Then things slow down a bit. It takes millions of years
1177520	1186640	for these to accrete together to form planets. Here is a computer simulation of planetesimal
1186640	1195680	accretion. So it starts out with a few hundred moon-sized bodies in the top plot of this diagram.
1196400	1202320	And as it moves down, the different plots in this diagram moving down the page show
1202320	1210080	different times going through the simulation in accretion of these bodies. Note that this
1210080	1214640	takes a few hundred million years in the simulation, but that the time doesn't really
1214640	1220080	matter here because the low density material that is swept away in tens of millions of years
1220800	1228800	doesn't participate in these accretions. So this and this simulation ends up producing
1228800	1235040	four planets, and it looks somewhat like our solar system. But it doesn't always have to
1235040	1240240	produce four planets. You can run this simulation a hundred times, and I don't know how many times
1240240	1245840	you would get four, but you certainly wouldn't get four every single time. As you go further
1245840	1250000	out in the solar system, this takes care of the inner solar system. As you go further out in the
1250000	1255360	solar system, the presence of Jupiter and its large mass is presumed to disrupt accretion
1255360	1262560	out in the asteroid belt, and even to affect the accretion of Mars a bit. Its large mass
1262560	1268000	will scatter things all across the solar system, and it'll create resonances within the asteroid
1268000	1273520	belt region that will disrupt its accretion. The total mass of all the planets in the solar
1273520	1279920	accretion, the total mass of all the asteroids in the asteroid belt, if you add it all together,
1279920	1286400	is less than the mass of our moon. After you form these large bodies, you then get the
1286400	1291200	heavy bombardment era, and this lasts for hundreds of millions of years. This cleans
1291200	1296160	out the flotsam and jetsam in the solar system. There are a significant number of very big
1296160	1302480	impacts, and we can see that evidence on the surface of Mars. Here this very large impact
1302480	1307200	structure is helispacin, and there's another very large impact structure here, and you can see
1307200	1314560	several other very large impacts on Mars. On Mercury, you see the giant Chlorospacin impact.
1315360	1321760	On Venus, we see retrograde rotation, and we believe that somehow a giant impact was involved
1321760	1326800	in slowing down and actually reversing Venus' rotation, because all the other planets rotate
1326800	1332160	in a prograde orbit. They rotate along with the same direction as the orbit around the sun.
1333200	1340000	And on Earth, well, we believe a Mars-sized impactor smashed into Earth to form the moon.
1340720	1345680	So all of the rocky planets show evidence of not just the heavy bombardment era,
1345680	1352800	but very big impacts during the heavy bombardment era. Eventually, that bombardment calms down,
1352800	1359280	the planets cool, and solidify. Now we turn to the giant planet formation,
1360080	1364000	and in this, a model called the core accretion model is favored.
1364800	1370320	It starts with this planetesimal accretion to form a core, and basically it's the same
1370320	1378320	process as form the rocky planets, these plantesimals accrete, and then you pull in gas and ice
1378320	1385360	from the nebula around that core. For the giant planets, note that more mass is available in the
1385360	1391680	outer solar system because the area of an annulus, a disc around the sun, the area of that annulus
1391680	1397760	will be increased, and there will be more matter in that, more space to pull matter from,
1398320	1404320	but that's also countered by the density decrease so that there is less mass per area available.
1405760	1410080	Also note that ices are available to be incorporated into these planets
1410080	1415680	because they form beyond the frost lines. First there will be the water ice frost line
1415680	1422720	at a temperature of zero degrees, then ammonia at minus 80 degrees celsius, and eventually methane
1422720	1431520	at minus 180 degrees celsius. So you establish first a rocky core of about 10 earth masses,
1431520	1435760	and this is enough to attract and hold the gas from the surrounding nebula.
1436720	1441440	What happens is these giant planets become sub condensations in the nebula,
1441440	1446480	they become their own little orbiting little systems, and stuff starts swirling and rotating
1446480	1453200	around them. The rotation around them forms these sub discs, and within these sub discs
1453200	1458000	you accrete the regular moons and create the ring systems of these giant planets.
1460000	1463920	Note that there are significant composition differences between the giant planets.
1464720	1470640	Jupiter and Saturn are mostly hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and Neptune are mostly ices.
1471840	1478240	The reasons for this are probably two fold. First is the density gradient. As you go out
1478240	1484400	from Jupiter, Saturn to Uranus and Neptune there's not as much gas available, so perhaps Uranus and
1484400	1490720	Neptune just couldn't pull in the gas because it just wasn't there. Also we expect a slower
1490720	1498000	formation time scale further out, so the nebula may have dissipated before Uranus and Neptune
1498000	1503360	could attract gases. If Uranus and Neptune didn't form within the few tens of millions of years
1503360	1509840	before the low density material was blown away, the gas wouldn't be there for them to attract.
1511280	1516560	The giant planets also experience a bombardment era, and if you look on the moons of these
1516560	1523520	giant planets, the craters show abundant evidence of very large impacts. So the bombardment era was
1523520	1529280	just as heavy in the outer solar system, and in fact the giant planets are a major cause of
1529280	1535280	the gravitational stirring that produces this bombardment era. This would also be the time
1535280	1540000	when the giant planets captured their irregular moons, all those moons at the outer parts that
1540000	1544240	are on all these crazy orbits and not on a nice regular plane or orbit around the planets.
1545200	1554720	Finally, Uranus is rotating on its side. Somehow we believe Uranus got tipped over on its side,
1555280	1559600	and we attribute that to a giant impact during this heavy bombardment era.
1561360	1570000	After that, well the planets calm down. They cool and contract just like the proto sun. However,
1570080	1575440	they are still cooling and contracting today. This is a very extended period of this cooling
1575440	1583280	and contraction. Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune all give off more energy than they receive from the sun.
1584160	1588240	For some reason, Uranus doesn't do this, and we really don't know why.
1589600	1593280	Now, I want to note here something that you might read some places that's wrong.
1594000	1599040	Some places you might see, oh Jupiter is a failed star. This cooling and contraction didn't
1599440	1603840	occur enough for fusion to ignite. It almost happened. Well, that isn't true.
1604880	1611760	The simplest fusion, deuterium fusion, only occurs for objects about 15 times Jupiter's mass,
1611760	1614800	so Jupiter never even came close to being a star.
1616960	1621920	So that's the basic story of the formation of the solar system. But several very important
1621920	1628800	questions still remain. Of importance is that the nebula dissipation sets the formation timescale.
1629200	1634960	You only have a few tens of millions of years to form the planets. And we're not really sure
1634960	1641680	if the rocky cores can build up fast enough so that you have the core for the giant planets
1641680	1649760	to accrete all the gas and create the giant planet. There are also several alternate formation ideas
1649760	1655280	for Uranus and Neptune. How do you get these guys? If it's hard enough to create a core for Jupiter,
1655280	1659920	it's going to be even slower for Uranus and Neptune. And in this lecture, I've really only
1659920	1666160	discussed the standard ideas. When you try and model the giant planet formation,
1666720	1672880	the formation simulations show many possible outcomes. Here is a plot of several different
1672880	1681120	simulations and their results. In panel A is our solar system as it exists. And if you look
1681120	1684800	in the other ones, represent different runs of the simulation to see what they got.
1686240	1692960	If you look at panel E, E looks remarkably like our solar system. But if you look at F,
1693840	1701760	F has seven Neptune mass planets. Panel B here, well, that's got one Jupiter. That's about the
1701760	1707600	same size as Jupiter in our system. But if you look at panel G, it's got three Jupiters,
1707600	1713520	and they're all several times larger than our Jupiter. This raises an intriguing point.
1714800	1720800	Random chance seems to play an important role in how our solar system looks today.
1723040	1726720	The last formation scenario we need to look at is for comets.
1727360	1732160	Comets form in the outer solar system, basically from these snowflakes and ice-coated grains that
1732160	1737440	I talked about earlier. The density is too low for them to form very large bodies.
1738560	1745120	Now, as I talked about earlier, the composition of comets indicates mixing of the solar nebula and
1745120	1749200	that they are composed of stuff that must have formed in the inner regions and stuff that must
1749200	1755280	have formed in the outer regions. This gravitational scattering by the giant planets seems to have been
1755280	1761600	very efficient in scattering things all across the solar system. For the formation of the
1761600	1768400	Kuiper Belt, well, the idea is that the classical Kuiper Belt forms in situ. This nice organized
1771200	1777200	relatively circular feature of the outer solar system forms where it is sort of like the way the
1777200	1784480	asteroid belt forms. There would be approximately 100 million bodies of about a kilometer or larger
1784480	1790160	that formed in the Kuiper Belt. Then the evolution of the Kuiper Belt is that Neptune
1790160	1794320	creates the resonant Kuiper Belt objects and also creates the scattered objects,
1794320	1801920	both outward and inward, the objects that become centaurs. For the Oort Cloud, the comets could
1801920	1810000	not have formed where they are, way out of 50,000 AU. Rather, the idea is that the comets form near
1810000	1816720	the giant planets and are gravitationally ejected to these very large radii. So they form in the
1816720	1822960	regions of the giant planets and then the planets, especially Jupiter, shot them way out of the solar
1822960	1830560	system or even shot them out of the solar system altogether. There should be comets wandering
1830560	1838720	through interstellar space. For the Oort Cloud, the gravitational tugs of nearby stars further
1838720	1846400	randomize their orbits. You've got to recognize that 50,000 AU is about 20 percent of the distance
1846400	1852480	to the nearest star. So the gravitational perturbations due to, for example, Alpha Centauri
1853120	1857600	would be significant. It would be a few percent of the gravity due to our sun.
1858960	1862960	This defines the gravitational boundary of our solar system.
1863520	1869840	So that's the formation story for our solar system in detail. We can see that there are still a number of
1869840	1876880	uncertainties, and there's really more randomness to this than a scientist would like, but the end result,
1876880	1883680	at least for our solar system, turns out to be well ordered. If we refer back to this schematic,
1883680	1888480	we can see that the collapse in rotation proves a nice circular disc and has a
1889280	1893920	nice explanation for the gradient of materials, that we've got the rocky planets on the interior,
1894480	1901680	the gas in the middle, and the icy stuff on the outside. This produces a stable system for the
1901680	1907040	larger bodies. Now you sometimes hear that the solar system is unstable, and that's not really true.
1907040	1912240	Yes, there are perturbation timescales for the orbits of planets that are in the order of millions
1912240	1917360	of years, but these perturbations become randomized and it sort of becomes a random one.
1918320	1923280	And so the true instability timescale is actually billions of years.
1925120	1931680	The main problem in looking at our solar system is that we only have one solar system to study.
1932880	1938080	We do not know if the rest of the universe, if the other planetary systems out there behave
1938080	1943840	similarly, and that is the next great change in our perspective, both in the solar system
1944640	1951360	and in this course. Extra solar planetary systems. We'll begin the exploration,
1951360	1959760	the exploration of those systems in our next lecture. See you then.
