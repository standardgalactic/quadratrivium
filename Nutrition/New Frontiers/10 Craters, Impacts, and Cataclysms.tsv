0	21360	The process of science is a relatively calm endeavor.
21360	24640	It involves much quiet thinking and contemplation.
25200	29280	Personally, I do some of my best work in the early morning,
29280	34400	when the world around is still, and I can focus intently on the ideas at hand.
35280	38320	Sometimes, by the time my wife and kids get up,
38320	40880	the most productive part of my day is already over.
42000	45360	I know one astronomer who will not get cable TV.
46080	51200	It's not because he doesn't like television, it's actually because he thinks he will like it,
51200	54080	and he doesn't want to have it there as a distraction.
54640	57120	So that he can focus on doing his science.
59520	64640	It's also true that the results of science rarely have immediate consequences.
65360	70880	Most astronomical objects we observe will change very little on timescales of millions
70880	74880	or even billions of years, much less on human timescales.
75760	78000	It's not very likely that you'll hear somebody say,
78480	81600	we have an emergency, quick, call an astrophysicist.
83200	86480	That's not something I really expect to hear in my lifetime.
87520	93200	But there is one topic where Hollywood has latched onto science,
93840	98480	where discoveries can be of immediate and wide importance,
99200	103360	and where astronomy is considered exciting enough for an action movie.
104640	107360	That is the topic of asteroid impact on Earth.
108160	112880	Nothing like the threat of death, destruction, and devastation to garner a little attention.
113920	117520	Hollywood, as usual, gets the science details mostly wrong,
118080	121920	or they enhance them to make a good story.
121920	126160	And I can't really blame them because their job is to sell you entertainment.
127120	130720	But as a scientist, I would like to sort of correct
131920	134880	the misperceptions that Hollywood has propagated.
135440	138320	And in this lecture, I'd like to review the real story.
138880	142080	I'd like to show you the effects of impacts across the solar system
142640	147520	and discuss the scientific view of the threat posed by asteroids and comets.
149760	153520	Impact craters are the most abundant surface feature across the solar system.
154160	156960	On Earth, we've identified hundreds of impact craters.
158000	158640	Here is one.
159600	163760	It is Barringer Crater in Northwest Arizona.
163840	168400	It's about 1.2 kilometers across and 170 meters deep.
169280	173120	If we look from the rim of the crater, what do you see?
174160	176240	It's a great big hole in the ground.
177280	182000	However, this was the first structure shown to be of impact origin,
182560	185760	and it's also the best preserved impact structure in the world.
186720	191760	It was caused by the impact of a nickel-iron meteorite about 50,000 years ago.
192560	195760	The impactor is estimated to be about 50 meters across.
196480	200240	Now, we have no real evidence of the actual size of the impactor.
200240	202320	That just comes from a rule of thumb.
202320	206000	The crater is about 20 times larger than the impacting object.
206800	209840	We can't tell you what the impacting object looked like
209840	211200	because not much remains of it.
211760	214720	Most of it was vaporized upon impact.
216000	219280	When they first discovered Barringer Crater,
219280	224560	there were about 30 tons of scattered remains on the planes around it.
224560	229680	Sounds like a lot, but it's really tiny compared to the 300,000 tons
230400	232640	that were originally contained in the impactor.
234080	237440	The crater was originally thought to be a volcanic origin,
238000	241440	and its impact origin was not suggested until 1906.
242240	246400	It took another five decades for the impact origin to be proven,
246960	250960	and that was proven not because of the crater itself,
251520	254480	but because they found shocked quartz crystals.
254480	258480	These are quartz crystals that heated up to a really high temperature
258480	260640	and indicated a very high energy event,
261280	263440	and you can't get those from volcanoes.
263440	265520	You can only get them from impacts.
267680	271600	The impact process creates the standard bowl shape of a crater,
272320	275600	and here is a diagram of this impact process.
276800	279600	The speed of the impact is going to be comparable
279600	282720	to the speed of Earth's orbit around the Sun,
282720	285600	and the Earth is moving at about 30 kilometers per second
285600	287040	in its orbit around the Sun,
287040	288880	so another object that we strike
288880	292080	is going to be moving at approximately that same relative speed.
292720	295840	This is about 100,000 kilometers per hour.
296880	299520	The energy released when it strikes the surface
300160	303120	is going to be several megatons.
303120	306080	That's equivalent to the explosion of a nuclear bomb.
307200	311920	The shock wave will press down and out through the surface,
311920	314320	and will carve out the bowl shape.
315120	319200	The material that is then pushed will spray out the sides
319200	322800	and become ejecta that will land on the region around it.
323680	327360	The rebound from the shock wave can come back,
327360	328800	and for the larger impacts,
328800	332160	it can actually form a central peak in the center of the crater.
332800	336960	The steep sides of the bowl will often collapse over time.
338960	342960	If we look at Beringer Crater from satellite photos,
342960	344560	it looks like this,
344560	348160	and you can definitely see the nice circular feature.
348960	353360	But only the recent impacts can be easily recognizable.
353360	356960	These are impacts within the last 100,000 years.
356960	360160	The erosion due to wind, rain,
361040	365200	snow, other forces makes the older ones hard to spot.
366640	370720	Here is one in the outback of Australia.
371360	373920	Now, the outback is old terrain,
373920	376320	so it's a good place to search for very old things.
377200	379920	This is the Gosses Bluff Impact Crater,
379920	382960	and it's dated about 142 million years ago.
383920	386880	The crater itself is about 20 kilometers across,
386880	389200	and that central ring is easily visible.
390160	391680	But you can see that over time,
391680	394080	the outer circular features are more subtle.
394080	394880	If you look carefully,
394880	396640	you can see that there are circular features
396640	399280	around those central circular features.
400320	402480	And even older impact structures
402480	404240	can really become part of the landscape.
405200	410320	Here is a impact crater called Manukawaagin Lake in Canada,
410880	414080	and it is this lake feature here, the circular lake.
415280	418240	This was formed about 214 million years ago,
418800	421760	and the original crater was probably about 100 kilometers across.
422480	425520	It has since collapsed to be about 70 kilometers across.
426800	428160	Within the central island,
428160	430720	there is a peak called Mount Babel,
431360	435040	and we believe this to be the central peak of the impact crater.
436640	439600	Now, the lake makes this crater much easier to recognize.
439600	442080	It may not have been so easily recognized
442080	443920	before the crater was flooded
443920	446800	in order to create a hydroelectric project.
448320	451840	Some other craters are impossible to recognize from the ground.
452960	457120	This image here is one of a crater called Kibira.
457920	463680	Now, there was this mystery of what they called Libyan Desert Glass,
463680	466720	where these wonderful, beautiful glass beads,
466720	468240	but they were of unknown origin.
469280	472160	Now, somebody who knew something about impacts
472160	474000	saw them and suggested to a geologist
474000	475200	who was working in the area that,
475840	478240	oh, is there an impact structure around here?
479120	482160	And the geologist said, no, no, no, there's no impact structure.
482720	484240	But that thought didn't leave him,
484800	487200	and he went searching through satellite photographs
487920	489200	until he found this crater.
490160	491840	It is 31 kilometers across,
492720	494880	and he believes that it was impossible
494880	497680	to recognize from the ground because it was just so large.
497680	501280	So he named it Kibira, which means large in Arabic.
502160	504560	It is the largest crater in the Sahara,
504960	507600	and it's estimated to be tens of millions of years old.
508400	511280	You can see that where the impactor hits
512320	515440	makes whether or not it's more easily or less easily recognizable.
516000	518480	You can also note that since Earth's surface
518480	519920	is covered two-thirds with water,
520800	524480	most of the impact structures on Earth are not going to be visible.
525840	528960	Now, beyond the erosional processes,
528960	532400	the impacts on Earth are also limited by its atmosphere.
533280	535760	Only objects larger than a few tens of meters
535760	538640	can actually survive passage through the atmosphere,
539280	543600	and those that do can lose half or more of their mass.
544480	548240	The 50-meter impactor that hit a Beringer crater
548240	552800	was probably a significantly larger asteroid when in space.
555600	557920	Now, craters are a significant feature
557920	560720	on all solid surfaces across the solar system.
561680	564640	On Venus, they're especially well-preserved.
565440	568640	Here is a picture of three impact craters on Venus,
569600	573280	and Venus has similar numbers of craters as Earth,
573280	575520	but as I said, they are better preserved
575520	577200	because there is very little erosion.
577760	580000	Venus has a very thick atmosphere,
580640	584960	but at its surface, the winds actually blow very gently.
584960	588080	There's not much to erode away these craters.
588160	591520	Matter of fact, the most important erosion process on Venus
591520	594720	is lava flows, and those seem to happen infrequently.
596400	598560	We also see impact craters on Mars,
599120	601680	and here is a very beautiful one on Mars.
601680	604160	It's the standard impact structure.
604160	608640	It's called Victoria Crater, and it's about 800 meters across,
609360	612640	but this one shows a very unusual feature.
613680	616240	If we zoom in to the northern rim,
617120	619680	we see these strange markings along it.
621280	623600	Very linear features.
624320	625840	Are these evidence of Martians?
627040	631040	No, unless the Martians happen to be made in the United States.
631760	635600	These are the tracks of the Opportunity Rover exploring
635600	639040	the rim of Victoria Crater as seen
639920	643120	by the orbiting satellite around Mars.
644080	648240	Here is a view of Victoria Crater from the ground
648240	649600	from the Opportunity Rover.
651920	654640	Mars also features some very large craters.
655280	658560	This one is called Hellas Basin,
658560	661200	and it's one of the largest impact structures known.
661200	664720	It's about 2,300 kilometers across,
665680	668480	and it's sort of a little hard to see in a visible light image.
668480	671840	You can see, oh yes, there's this sort of roundish feature here,
672400	674560	but if I show you a Mars topographic map,
675200	680560	it stands out very strongly as this giant blue region down here.
682080	684400	It is about nine kilometers deep,
684400	686720	and at 2,300 kilometers across,
686720	692320	the volume of this crater is about 200 million times larger
693120	694720	than the volume of Berenger Crater.
696240	698960	You can see other large impact craters on Mars.
698960	701760	There's one here just to the left of center.
702240	705840	And there is a region up here just above the Hellas Basin
705840	708640	that looks like that could also have been caused by a large impact crater.
709280	713280	But what's most striking when you look at this topographic map of Mars
713280	716240	is how the top of it is incredibly smooth.
717280	719600	These are smooth lowland volcanic plains,
720480	723200	and the bottom of it is incredibly cratered,
723200	724560	the heavily cratered highlands.
725360	726880	This is a little bit of a puzzle to me,
726880	729360	and it sort of has bothered me every time I see it.
730240	732720	If you want lots and lots of cratering,
732720	735520	you go take a look at Mercury and the Moon.
736560	740240	On Mercury, there's a very famous large impact structure
740240	741520	called Chloris Basin.
742160	743840	It's kind of hard to see in this image
743840	745360	because it straddles the terminator,
745360	748480	and you can see, if you can sort of see a circular feature,
749040	752160	let me draw a circle over it to guide your eye.
753040	756400	This is about 1,300 kilometers across,
757040	761040	and it's about one-quarter the size of the entire planet.
761040	762800	The giant impact structure,
762800	765840	one-quarter the size of Mercury's diameter.
766960	769680	Mercury is heavily cratered across its entire surface.
770480	772960	Here is an image of a crater field,
773920	777440	and you can see just craters upon craters upon craters.
778240	780400	And most people, when they see Mercury,
780400	782000	actually think it's the Moon,
782000	785040	because the Moon's surface looks very similar.
785040	788400	So, for comparison, here is a crater field on the Moon.
788400	792240	And, again, you see craters upon craters upon craters.
792240	794480	The interesting thing that you see on the Moon
794480	798960	is that the interiors of some of the craters seem smoother
798960	800640	than they seem on Mercury.
800640	803280	There have been more lava flows on the surface of the Moon
803280	805760	than there have been on the surface of Mercury.
806640	810240	What this tells you is that there's a long history
810240	813440	of impacts recorded on the surface of the Moon.
813440	815440	And we'll get back to that in a few minutes.
816800	820800	Looking at the Moon globally, we can look at its near side,
820800	823200	and we can see many large impacts.
823200	827680	These large, smooth gray areas are very large impacts
827680	830240	that have filled in with lava.
830240	833840	These are the lunar seas that they call maria.
833840	835440	They, of course, aren't seas.
835440	838160	They're just lava flows that have filled in.
838160	841840	In contrast, when we look at the far side of the Moon,
841840	844240	we see only a couple large impacts
844240	846240	that have lava flows filled in.
846240	849440	So there is a dichotomy between the side of the Moon
849440	852240	we always see and the side of the Moon
852240	854640	that we didn't get to see until the Apollo era,
854640	859040	until the space age, we had never seen the backside of the Moon.
859840	861840	So why is this true?
861840	863840	Well, there are two reasons.
863840	866640	One is that the near side of the Moon,
866640	868640	the crust is a little bit thinner.
868640	870640	If you actually measure the thickness of the crust,
870640	872240	near side versus far side,
872240	874240	the crust is a little bit thinner,
874240	877040	so large impacts can punch through
877040	879040	the crust easier on the near side.
879040	881440	The other reason has to do with the fact
881440	883840	that the Moon is tidally locked to Earth.
883840	887040	The Moon always shows the same faced Earth.
887040	892240	And objects passing by Earth can be gravitationally focused
892240	894240	toward the near side of the Moon.
894640	898640	So we would send more impactors towards the near side of the Moon
898640	900640	and because they swing past Earth,
900640	902640	they would get a gravitational boost
902640	905640	and they would arrive at faster speeds.
905640	908640	Both of these would lead to more large impacts
908640	910640	on the near side of the Moon.
911640	913640	Now, the Moon has one other interesting feature
913640	915640	that I'd like to point out to you.
915640	917640	It's called Mare Oriental
917640	920640	and it's one of the classic large impactors
921640	924640	but it's very hard for us to see here from Earth
924640	928640	because it's basically on the eastern edge of the Moon.
928640	931640	Here it is in the Clementine data
931640	935640	and you can see it's a large ringed impact structure
935640	938640	about 900 kilometers across.
938640	942640	The impact sent ripples across the lunar surface
942640	945640	and created these several rings here.
945640	948640	This reminds me of another large impactor
948640	951640	on Jupiter's Moon, Callisto.
951640	954640	Here is probably the most impressive ringed impact structure
954640	956640	in the Solar System.
956640	959640	It's called Valhalla on Callisto.
959640	963640	Callisto is Jupiter's outermost of the four Galilean moons.
963640	966640	It has a very icy surface.
966640	968640	Now, the bright spot in the center
968640	970640	is about 600 kilometers across
970640	972640	but you can see ring fractures
972640	975640	that have spread out to about 1500 kilometers
975640	977640	in radius.
977640	980640	That's about 3,000 kilometers across
980640	983640	for the effects of this impact structure
983640	985640	on this small Moon.
985640	989640	Even small bodies of the Solar System show craters.
989640	993640	This is an asteroid named Gasbra.
993640	997640	The asteroid itself is only 20 kilometers across,
997640	1000640	much smaller than some of the impact structures I've shown you.
1000640	1003640	However, it itself is still poignant
1003640	1005640	by even smaller craters.
1005640	1009640	So even the impactors have suffered impacts
1009640	1013640	before they do their job of creating a crater.
1015640	1018640	Now, let's take a look at that historical record
1018640	1020640	of cratering in the Solar System.
1020640	1023640	The place to go, the place to look is at the Moon.
1023640	1026640	The Moon provides a rich history of cratering
1026640	1028640	where we can age date the craters
1028640	1030640	simply because the younger craters
1030640	1032640	will be on top of the older craters.
1032640	1034640	And so you can then piece that together
1034640	1037640	to assemble the number of craters over time.
1037640	1040640	The results show that there has been
1040640	1042640	a steady component to the cratering rate
1042640	1044640	as you go back in time.
1044640	1047640	Back to about 3.5 billion years ago,
1047640	1049640	there has been a continual cratering
1049640	1052640	not really much change in the rate.
1052640	1055640	Before that time, there's an exponential increase
1055640	1058640	in the number of craters we see in the Moon.
1058640	1062640	This indicates the period of the late heavy bombardment.
1062640	1065640	This was about 3.5 billion years ago
1065640	1067640	that there was an intense cratering period
1067640	1069640	in our Solar System.
1069640	1073640	The Moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
1073640	1076640	So for about a billion years,
1076640	1079640	the Solar System was sweeping up its debris
1079640	1082640	and there was incredible amounts of impacts
1082640	1085640	slamming all the bodies of the Solar System.
1085640	1088640	Basically Earth, Moon, Venus,
1088640	1091640	all the major bodies should have been continuously pounded
1091640	1095640	until the late heavy bombardment came to an end.
1095640	1098640	Now the steady cratering shows another thing.
1098640	1102640	It shows that there must be population renewal.
1102640	1104640	The objects that are hitting us today
1104640	1107640	have to be renewed, otherwise they would die out.
1107640	1109640	If there was only a small population hitting
1109640	1111640	after a while, they'd be gone.
1111640	1113640	So we have to renew that population.
1113640	1115640	That's an important thing that we'll come to
1115640	1117640	in a later lecture.
1119640	1121640	Well, that's the long-term history.
1121640	1124640	What about recent history in terms of cratering?
1124640	1129640	Well, in 1908, on June 30th,
1129640	1131640	there was a massive explosion
1131640	1134640	over the skies of the remote part of Siberia.
1134640	1136640	Booms were heard by many.
1136640	1138640	A shock came from the sky.
1138640	1140640	Booms were heard by many.
1140640	1142640	A shock wave knocked people down.
1142640	1147640	And earthquakes were registered at many seismic stations.
1147640	1152640	In 1927, they made a scientific expedition to the area
1152640	1154640	and found this.
1154640	1157640	That 19 years later,
1157640	1162640	there were still felled trees from that explosion.
1162640	1166640	From the pattern of trees and from other evidence,
1166640	1171640	they deduced that a roughly 50-meter-sized impactor
1171640	1176640	exploded about 8 kilometers above Earth's surface.
1176640	1178640	There is no obvious impact crater,
1178640	1181640	although some scientists recently have suggested
1181640	1185640	a certain lake nearby the epicenter of the explosion
1185640	1189640	to be where what was left of the impactor landed.
1189640	1191640	It hasn't been proven yet.
1191640	1195640	But this is the largest recent impact event on Earth.
1195640	1198640	And it was about a thousand times more powerful
1198640	1203640	than the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.
1203640	1207640	Such a small impactor would be very difficult to find and track,
1207640	1210640	so it could come without warning,
1210640	1213640	and it could destroy a city.
1213640	1218640	This is the kind of event that inspires Hollywood.
1218640	1220640	There, of course, have been other events.
1220640	1224640	And in 1994, we were lucky enough to witness an impact event
1224640	1226640	on Jupiter.
1226640	1228640	This is a montage.
1228640	1230640	It's not a single image.
1230640	1232640	It's a montage of an image of Jupiter
1232640	1236640	and an image of Schumacher-Levy-9.
1236640	1239640	Schumacher-Levy-9 was captured by Jupiter's gravity
1239640	1241640	and broke up while in orbit.
1241640	1246640	Now, we did not discover SL-9 until after it had broken up.
1246640	1249640	And once we discovered it,
1249640	1251640	we were able to predict that it would collide with Jupiter
1251640	1253640	16 months later.
1253640	1256640	Now, think about this. What's going to happen?
1256640	1259640	We've got two kilometer-sized fragments of a comet,
1259640	1263640	and then we've got Jupiter's massive atmosphere.
1263640	1265640	Is there something that's going to be exciting?
1265640	1267640	Is it going to be a huge impact?
1267640	1271640	Well, honestly, at the time, we were looking at this,
1271640	1274640	and we weren't really sure whether it was going to be an event
1274640	1276640	or a non-event.
1276640	1278640	That didn't stop us.
1278640	1281640	We turned every telescope possible to watch it.
1281640	1284640	And with the Hubble Space Telescope,
1284640	1286640	we were able to see this.
1286640	1289640	The center, you can see the disc of Jupiter,
1289640	1292640	and along the lower portion of Jupiter,
1292640	1294640	you see some brown spots.
1294640	1297640	These brown spots are the impact sites
1297640	1300640	where SL-9's fragments slammed into Jupiter.
1300640	1303640	It's much more visible on the right-hand side
1303640	1306640	where you see Jupiter in the ultraviolet.
1306640	1310640	And here you can see the giant holes in Jupiter's cloud tops
1310640	1314640	that were created by the impacts.
1314640	1319640	For scale, here is Earth to the correct size.
1319640	1323640	These impact events scarred Jupiter,
1323640	1326640	but they dissipated over the course of a few months.
1326640	1330640	It was really the same thing as happened in Tunguska.
1330640	1334640	They had giant explosions in Jupiter's atmosphere
1334640	1336640	that caused these big scars.
1336640	1340640	Eventually, the clouds reformed and Jupiter went on,
1340640	1342640	as if nothing had happened.
1342640	1344640	It was really exciting at the time.
1344640	1346640	I've got to tell you, one of the few times in astronomy
1346640	1350640	it was like, ah, events happening in real time.
1350640	1353640	The final historical event I'd like to discuss
1353640	1357640	is one where sometimes where you have evidence of an impact,
1357640	1360640	but you don't know where the crater is.
1360640	1364640	Now, tectites are a strong clue of an impact.
1364640	1368640	There are beads of mineral glass that were once molten
1368640	1371640	and had to solidify in mid-air.
1371640	1374640	The glass was hot enough as it was flying through the air,
1374640	1376640	it then solidified.
1376640	1381640	For example, there's a tectite field across North America,
1381640	1385640	and it was recently traced to a crater in the Chesapeake Bay.
1385640	1388640	Tectites had also been found on the island of Haiti,
1388640	1392640	and we assumed that the crater was somewhere underwater.
1392640	1394640	We were half right.
1394640	1398640	Here is a relief map of the Yucatan Peninsula,
1398640	1401640	and if you look closely, you can see somewhat of a circular feature.
1401640	1403640	Let me, again, guide your eye,
1403640	1406640	and you can see that there's a circle here.
1406640	1410640	Half of the crater is underwater.
1410640	1417640	It becomes much easier to see if instead we look at a gravity map.
1417640	1420640	This is how we first discovered this crater.
1420640	1422640	This was not done by research scientists.
1422640	1426640	It was actually done by folks working for petroleum companies.
1426640	1430640	They were looking for oil off the Yucatan Peninsula,
1430640	1432640	and they found this impact structure.
1432640	1435640	And nowadays, with computer processing,
1435640	1437640	we can actually create a 3D map.
1437640	1441640	Here is a 3D map of what we call the Chicksalub impact crater,
1441640	1444640	and you get a multi-ringed impact structure
1444640	1447640	about 200 kilometers across.
1447640	1452640	This is nearly three times the diameter of Lake Manicouagan.
1452640	1456640	This is a truly huge impact event,
1456640	1460640	and it has been age-dated to 65 million years ago,
1460640	1463640	the time of the Cretaceous tertiary extinction.
1463640	1468640	This was the time of the end of the age of the dinosaurs.
1468640	1475640	The question was, could this impact have been the downfall of the dinosaurs?
1476640	1479640	The key piece of evidence in that argument
1479640	1483640	is a layer of iridium found in the KT boundary layer.
1483640	1486640	Basically, as the sediments are deposited,
1486640	1489640	when you look through the sediments at the KT boundary layer,
1489640	1492640	from the Cretaceous to the tertiary,
1492640	1495640	they find a thin layer of iridium.
1495640	1498640	This has been found at over 80 sites worldwide.
1498640	1501640	Now, iridium is extremely rare on Earth,
1501640	1506640	but it is common in iron meteorites.
1506640	1512640	The excess was calculated to be what would correspond to about a 10 kilometer asteroid,
1512640	1518640	and a 10 kilometer asteroid would make a 200 kilometer crater.
1518640	1524640	So it appears that while the dinosaurs ruled the planet for 165 million years,
1524640	1530640	their doom may have come sudden and swift with an impact event.
1530640	1535640	I must note, however, that the volcanologists out there will disagree.
1535640	1542640	They point to the Deccan Traps lava fields near Mumbai in India as the source of the extinction.
1542640	1546640	These lava fields cover hundreds of kilometers,
1546640	1551640	and they are also age-dated to the time of the KT extinction.
1551640	1557640	They would argue that the carbon dioxide and the sulfur dioxide released in these volcanic eruptions
1557640	1561640	changed the climate and caused the extinction.
1561640	1564640	Now, I'm not going to get involved in this,
1564640	1569640	because I'm not expert enough to evaluate the details of one argument versus another.
1569640	1574640	I will say that as an astronomer, I'm naturally biased toward impacts.
1574640	1582640	I can certainly see that perhaps there were multiple factors contributing to this worldwide mass extinction.
1582640	1589640	Furthermore, my astronomer friends have told me that impacts appear associated with other extinctions.
1589640	1597640	They find metal enrichments that occur in the strata associated with extinctions at 11, 35, 65, of course,
1597640	1602640	and 91 million years ago of importance,
1602640	1609640	that there are three layers of impact melt associated with a 35 million year ago extinction.
1609640	1613640	So, based on that combination of evidence,
1613640	1621640	it does appear that the effects of asteroid and comet impacts on Earth can be global.
1621640	1627640	But wait, you shouldn't just accept that. You've got to think about that.
1627640	1631640	We have a 10 kilometer-sized impactor.
1631640	1635640	We have a 13,000 kilometer-sized planet.
1635640	1640640	I mean, how is that going to create a global effect?
1640640	1643640	I mean, it's like a pinprick.
1643640	1647640	How? Well, here's how.
1647640	1654640	The energy released in such a large impact is equivalent to 100 million nuclear bombs.
1654640	1658640	The crater is about 20 times the size of the impacting object.
1658640	1664640	Now, this spreads stuff out over hundreds of kilometers and maybe a relatively localized effect.
1664640	1670640	But the ejecta thrown out from within that crater will rain down over wide regions.
1670640	1675640	That'll cover thousands of kilometers with hundreds of millions of tons of material.
1675640	1680640	The blast wave created will incinerate the nearby landscape.
1680640	1686640	Plus, the fireball as it's streaking through the atmosphere will interact with the nitrogen in the air
1686640	1691640	and the sulfur in the ground and create widespread acid rain.
1691640	1695640	As the impact hits the ground, you create an earthquake.
1695640	1701640	To estimate at the KT impact, the earthquake could have been as large as magnitude 11 or 12.
1701640	1709640	The largest earthquake ever recorded is nine and a half, and the earthquake scale is logarithmic.
1709640	1716640	So the earthquake could have been at 100 times more powerful than the largest ever recorded.
1716640	1723640	Furthermore, if it's struck in a shallow sea, as we believe it might have, it would kick up a tsunami.
1723640	1732640	Tsunamis kicked up by impact of this magnitude would be kilometer in height and would be able to sweep across continents.
1732640	1738640	Furthermore, when you hit in the ocean, you kick up a huge amount of water into the atmosphere.
1738640	1741640	That water is an incredible greenhouse effect.
1741640	1746640	We don't talk about carbon dioxide, but water is an even better greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide,
1746640	1753640	and that can provide a temporary greenhouse warming of 10 degrees Celsius or 18 degrees Fahrenheit.
1753640	1757640	Furthermore, there would be fires. The blast wave would ignite some fires,
1757640	1762640	but also the ejecta would be streaking through the atmosphere, would be heated to incredible temperatures,
1762640	1768640	and it would become red hot. When it lands, it would instantly ignite the vegetation around it.
1768640	1774640	Then there would be dust clouds. First of all, kicked up by the impact and the smoke from the fires.
1774640	1780640	Through the global circulation, that would spread all around the globe and block out the sun.
1780640	1786640	So what really happened at the KT impact was that you disrupted the food chain
1786640	1792640	because there's evidence that the flowering plants disappeared for thousands of years.
1792640	1799640	If the plants die, then the plant eaters die. If the herbivores die, then the carnivores die,
1799640	1806640	and that leads to mass extinctions. So these are the horsemen of the Asteroidal Apocalypse.
1806640	1813640	Craters, ejecta, blast waves, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, dust clouds,
1813640	1826640	and their combined effect is how a 10-kilometer-sized body can have global consequences on a 13,000-kilometer-sized planet.
1826640	1831640	Now, naturally, your next question is going to be, when will this happen again?
1831640	1837640	And future impacts are really only a matter of time. We have impacts every day.
1837640	1841640	They're called meteors, and they streak through the atmosphere and burn up.
1841640	1846640	A Tunguska-level event should occur every few hundred years.
1846640	1852640	An impact large enough to wipe out a whole city should occur every 10,000 years.
1852640	1858640	If we want to think even bigger, the country-wide or a regional destruction event,
1858640	1862640	that would happen roughly every million years.
1862640	1867640	But the impacts with global consequences are not so common.
1867640	1871640	They should occur once every 100 million years.
1871640	1878640	The last one was about 65 million years ago, but the occurrence of the next one is probabilistic.
1878640	1883640	It could be 50 years from now, or it could be 50 million years from now.
1883640	1889640	We do know that currently there are no large asteroids coming close to our planet.
1889640	1894640	And given funding, we can monitor the large objects easily.
1894640	1899640	I was surprised when I checked the Near Earth Asteroid website,
1899640	1903640	and the technology has developed faster than I expected,
1903640	1908640	and some of the objects we're tracking are as small as a few meters across.
1908640	1914640	Now, of course, these require continuous monitoring, as the asteroid's orbits tend to shift a bit.
1914640	1921640	But we may be able to see the next Tunguska-level event before it hits us.
1921640	1928640	And with advanced warning, we might be able to send a spaceship up and sort of nudge it out of its orbit,
1928640	1931640	and so that it would move into a harmless orbit.
1931640	1936640	We might be able to prevent the next major asteroid hit.
1936640	1943640	So I guess the moral from this is that the astronomers and NASA need your support.
1943640	1950640	After all, the dinosaurs seem to have died out because they didn't have a space program to prevent it.
1950640	1959640	Alright, next time we'll take a look at the planetary interiors, and we'll see you then. Take care.
