In the last two lectures, we learned about modular arithmetic, the mathematics of remainders,
and saw some applications.
Prior to that, we investigated prime numbers along with some of their properties.
In this lecture, we apply modular arithmetic to discover more peculiar properties of primes
leading to a practical way to test if a number is prime without trying to factor it.
This material will also be the foundation for our major application of number theory,
public key cryptography, which will be the topic of our subsequent lecture.
Also in this lecture, we will meet two of the most important people in the history of
number theory, Fermat from the 17th century and Euler from the 18th century.
Although Pierre de Fermat was one of the most important mathematicians of his time,
he was not a professional mathematician, but a lawyer.
Fermat was brilliant at discovering beautiful mathematical patterns.
He usually did not prove his discoveries, but would share them with other mathematicians
for them to prove, or he'd simply leave them as open questions for future mathematicians
to ponder.
His most famous unsolved problem became known as Fermat's last theorem, which goes as follows.
For n greater than or equal to 3, it is impossible to find three positive integers, a, b, and
c, such that a to the n plus b to the n equals c to the n.
While Fermat proved the special case when n is 4, and Euler proved the special case
when n is 3.
Fermat wrote his last theorem in the margins of his copy of the book Arithmetica by Diophantus,
along with the immortal words, I have a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this
margin is too narrow to contain.
Nobody ever found his proof, and it took over 350 years before a correct proof was given
by Andrew Wiles in 1995.
His proof, by the way, used very advanced math, including complex analysis and differential
geometry well beyond the scope of discrete mathematics.
In this lecture, our focus will be on another theorem.
I'd say a more important theorem by Fermat, which he discovered while investigating perfect
numbers.
Now, a perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 6
is equal to 1 plus 2 plus 3.
28 is the next perfect number, its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and when you add
those numbers together, you get 28.
As you could imagine, perfect numbers are pretty rare.
The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8,128.
Now do we see a pattern with those numbers?
Well, if you look at their prime factorization, always a good thing to do, you'll notice that
6 is 2 times 3.
28 is 4 times 7.
496 is 16 times 31.
8128 is 64 times 127.
In all of these cases, we have a power of 2 times a number that is almost twice as big.
In fact, it's one less than twice as big.
Euclid proved that if a number had that form, that is, if x was of the form 2 to the n minus
1 times 2 to the n minus 1, I have to pause after the minus 1 that time, where 2 to the
n minus 1 is prime, like 3, 7, 31, 127, those are all prime numbers, then x is perfect.
Now, 2,000 years later, Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have that form.
We still don't know if there are any odd perfect numbers, but if such numbers exist, it's
been proved that they must have at least 300 digits.
So, this led Fermat to ask the question, when is the number 2 to the n minus 1 prime, because
if he could answer that, then he could discover and understand better the perfect numbers.
It can be shown that if n is composite, that 2 to the n minus 1 is also going to be composite,
but prime exponents can also produce composite numbers.
For example, 11 is prime, but 2 to the 11 minus 1 is 2047, and that's composite.
It's 23 times 89.
Fermat asked, for a given prime p, when does p divide the number 2 to the n minus 1?
In other words, he fixed the number p, and he was looking for exponents n, which satisfied
2 to the n is congruent to 1 mod p.
So when is 2 to the n congruent to 1 mod p?
Well, looking at lots of examples, Fermat discovered that this congruence was always
satisfied when n was equal to the number p minus 1.
It was true for other values of n, too, but it was always true when n was p minus 1.
So in other words, for any odd prime p, he found out that 2 to the p minus 1 is congruent
to 1 mod p.
Multiplying both sides by the number 2, you get 2 to the p is congruent to 2 mod p.
For any prime p, 2 to the p was congruent to 2 mod p.
Fermat then noticed that there was nothing special about the number 2 either.
He went on to claim, for any integer a and any prime number p, a to the p must be congruent
to a mod p.
This became known as Fermat's little theorem, but Fermat's little theorem is a very positive
result.
Fermat's last theorem is somewhat of a negative result.
That's why I think the little theorem is more important than the last theorem.
So let's do an example.
Fermat's little theorem says that take the prime 11, then Fermat will predict that 2
to the 11th will be congruent to 2 mod 11.
Now 2 to the 11th is 2048.
We know how to reduce numbers mod 11 and that happens to give us 2, just like Fermat predicts.
How about 3 to the 11th mod 11?
Fermat predicts the answer of 3 and if you take 3 to the 11th power and reduce it, mod
11, like we know how to do, we get 3.
Fermat didn't have the notation of modular arithmetic in his day.
That was invented by Gauss much later.
He stated in a letter that he wrote in 1640, if p is prime, then p divides the difference.
p divides a to the p minus a.
This was eventually proved by Leibniz in 1683 and independently by Euler in 1736.
Now, before we prove Fermat's theorem, we should say a few words about logic.
Let's take the statement, if p, then q.
Now logically, that is equivalent to the statement, if not q, then not p.
This is called the contrapositive statement and you get it for free.
For example, let's suppose you accept the statement, if it's Monday, then we're tired.
That's equivalent to the statement, if we're not tired, then it's not Monday.
Those statements have the same content.
Let's give a mathematical example.
The statement, if n is a multiple of 16, then n is even, is equivalent to the contrapositive statement.
If n is odd, then n is not a multiple of 16.
On the other hand, the statement, if p, then q is not the same as the statement, if q, then p.
That's called the converse statement and that needs a separate proof while it's own.
If it's even true at all.
For example, the statement, if it's Monday, then we're tired, is not the same as the statement, if we're tired, then it's Monday.
Let's recall from our first lecture on modular arithmetic, the cancellation theorem.
We're going to use this in our proof of Fermat's little theorem.
The cancellation theorem says this, given any two relatively prime numbers, a and m, if ax is congruent to ay mod m,
then we can cancel the a's from both sides to get x is congruent to y mod m.
Now, since we have a true statement, a true theorem, let's look at what we get for free.
The contrapositive statement says, for any relatively prime numbers, a and m, if x is not congruent to y mod m,
then ax is not congruent to ay mod m.
That's the contrapositive of the last theorem.
We'll use this version, the contrapositive version of the cancellation theorem, in our proof of Fermat's little theorem.
By the way, before I prove Fermat's little theorem, it's okay if you don't completely follow this proof.
It's more important to remember what the theorem says.
If I lose you, that's okay this time.
Here's Fermat's theorem.
It says, let a be any number.
If p is prime, then a to the p is congruent to a mod p.
Here's the proof.
Since p is prime, it has two positive divisors, p and 1.
Therefore, if I ask for the greatest common divisor of a and p,
the only possible answers we could get are p or 1.
If the greatest common divisor is p, then life is very easy.
That means that p divides a, and therefore a is congruent to 0 mod p.
So by the power theorem, I can raise both sides to the p-th power to get a to the p is congruent to 0 to the p,
which of course equals 0, and 0 is congruent to a mod p.
Therefore, a to the p is congruent to a mod p.
So we're done with the proof in the case where a and p have a greatest common divisor of p.
Now suppose that a and p have a greatest common divisor of 1.
That is, assume that a and p are relatively prime.
And now consider all the numbers 1 through p minus 1.
Now what do we know about those numbers?
First of all, we know that they're all relatively prime to p because p is prime.
And we also know that they're all different mod p.
None of them differ by a multiple of p.
They're just as in room.
So if we multiply each of these numbers by a, remember a is relatively prime to p,
then our new version of the cancellation theorem, the contrapositive,
says that since the numbers 1 through p minus 1 are all different mod p,
then the numbers 1a, 2a, 3a, up through p minus 1a are all different mod p.
Now, when I put on my mod p glasses and I look at those numbers,
everything looks like a number between 0 and p minus 1.
But can any of those numbers be 0 mod p?
That is, can any of them be multiples of p?
No, since p is prime and a is relatively prime to p.
Therefore, these p minus 1 numbers, 1a, 2a, 3a, up through p minus 1a,
must all be congruent to the numbers 1 through p minus 1 in some order.
And we know that because we know that all those numbers are different mod p
and none of them are 0 mod p.
So they have to be the numbers 1 through p minus 1 when you look at them mod p.
So now I'm going to multiply all those numbers together mod p.
1a, 2a, 3a, all the way up through p minus 1a.
I'm just going to collapse them together.
And what do we get?
Well, 1a times 2a times 3a up to p minus 1a, when I put on my mod p glasses,
that's equal to 1 times 2 times 3 up through p minus 1 mod p.
And now the right-hand side, that's p minus 1 factorial mod p.
The left side is also p minus 1 factorial, but every one of those terms has an a in it,
so I can pull that a out and get an a to the p minus 1 term.
Now, can I cancel that p minus 1 factorial from both sides?
Yes, because p minus 1 factorial is relatively prime to p.
Again, I'm using the fact that p is a prime number here.
So all the numbers 1 through p minus 1 are relatively prime to it.
So when I cancel that p minus 1 factorial from both sides,
we get a to the p minus 1 is congruent to 1 mod p.
And finally, I take that congruence, multiply both sides by a,
and that tells me that a to the p is congruent to a mod p, which is what we wanted.
We'll have more to say about Fermat's theorem later in this lecture,
but now let's bring Euler into the picture.
Leonard Euler is certainly one of the greatest mathematicians of all time,
up there with Euclid, Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss,
who made profound contributions to all areas of mathematics,
including combinatorics, number theory, and graph theory,
the discrete mathematical topics of this lecture series.
Now, Fermat's theorem says if p is prime,
then a to the p is congruent to a mod p.
When a and p are relatively prime,
then we can use the cancellation theorem to divide both sides by a
to get the congruence a to the p minus 1 is congruent to 1 mod p.
Euler wondered what you can say when the modulus is composite,
because Fermat's theorem requires the modulus to be prime.
He wondered, what can we say when the modulus is composite?
To do this, he invented the phi function, which has nothing to do with phi binacci numbers.
Here's what Euler's phi function is.
For m greater than or equal to 1,
phi of m is defined to be the number of numbers in the set 1 through m
that are relatively prime to m.
So, for example, when m is 10, I look at all the numbers in the set 1 through 10,
and I count how many of those are relatively prime to 10.
So, here the relatively prime numbers are 1, 3, 7, and 9.
Therefore, phi of 10 is equal to 4.
Here's another example.
If m is equal to p, a prime number, then I'm looking at the set of numbers 1 through p.
How many of those numbers are relatively prime to p?
Almost all of them.
p is not relatively prime to p, but all the other numbers,
because p is prime, 1 through p minus 1 are relatively prime to p.
Therefore, phi of p would be p minus 1.
So, Fermat's theorem says if p is prime, and if a is relatively prime to p,
that a to the p minus 1 is congruent to 1 mod p.
Euler generalized this as follows.
Euler said, let m be any number.
Let it be composite.
That's fine.
Composite or prime, I don't care.
Just let a and m be relatively prime.
Then a to the phi of m will be congruent to 1 mod m.
Notice that when m is equal to p, a prime number,
then since phi of p is p minus 1, this gives us Fermat's little theorem, right?
It would just say that a to the p minus 1, which is a to the phi of p,
would be congruent to 1 mod p.
Let's do a numerical example of Euler's theorem.
Suppose a is 7 and m is 10.
Then we know that phi of 10 is equal to 4.
So, a to the phi of m would be 7 to the 4.
That equals 2,401.
And when you look at that mod 10, you get 1, just as Euler predicts.
Now, this may not seem like a very profound theorem,
but when I teach this class at Harvey Mudd College,
I try to convince them of its importance by making an analogy with physics.
Now, they've all had physics in high school,
and I ask them, what was the most important formula in high school physics?
And almost in unison, they say, f equals ma, 4 equals mass times acceleration.
Well, look at Euler's theorem.
You've got the m, you've got the a, you even have the Greek letter for f,
so you know it has to be important.
Anyway, the proof of Euler's theorem is practically the same as the proof of Fermat's theorem,
and I won't present it here, although it is in the course guidebook.
The main difference is, while Fermat's theorem deals with modulo a prime,
Euler's theorem works modulo m, where m could be prime or composite.
Let's find a formula for phi of m.
There's a simple formula based on the prime factorization of m.
Here's what it says.
If m has prime factors, p1, p2 up through pk,
then phi of m is equal to m times the quantity 1 minus 1 over p1
times 1 minus 1 over p2, all the way up to 1 minus 1 over pk.
For example, if m is 504, now 504 has a prime factorization of 2 to the third
times 3 to the second times 7 to the first,
but the only prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.
So phi of 504 is 504 times 1 minus 1 half times 1 minus 1 third times 1 minus 1 seventh.
Now, that makes a certain intuitive amount of sense,
because if you think about it, with phi of 504,
we look at all the numbers from 1 to 504,
and we want to get rid of those that have a common factor with 504.
In other words, we want to get rid of everything that's a multiple of 2,
a multiple of 3, or a multiple of 7.
And so that 1 minus 1 half, what it does is it gets rid of all the odd numbers,
because half of the numbers are odd, half of the numbers are even.
Then when you multiply it by 1 minus 1 third,
it's getting rid of those remaining numbers that are multiples of 3,
and then the 1 minus 1 seventh is getting rid of those numbers that are multiples of 7.
So that's the intuition behind it.
A rigorous proof would use the principle of inclusion-exclusion like we did in lecture 6.
Here's a quick proof by the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
Starting with the numbers from 1 to 504,
we first get rid of the multiples of 2, the multiples of 3, and the multiples of 7.
Literally, we've subtracted 504 over 2 numbers,
minus 504 over 3 numbers, minus 504 over 7 numbers,
but we've subtracted too much.
We have to add back those numbers that are multiples of 2 and 3,
that's the next term, plus multiples of 2 and 7, plus multiples of 3 and 7.
But we've added back too much.
We have to subtract off those numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, and 7,
and since 2, 3, and 7 are relatively prime,
there are 504 over 2 times 3 times 7 of them.
And now the rest is just algebra,
giving you a proof of why Phi of 504 should have its form.
The same proof strategy will work for any number, regardless of how many prime factors it has.
When we do public key cryptography, we need this special case.
Suppose P and Q are different prime numbers,
and let M be equal to the product P times Q.
Then, Phi of PQ, by the formula we just learned,
is PQ times 1 minus 1 over P times 1 minus 1 over Q,
and P times 1 minus 1 over P is P minus 1,
and Q times 1 minus 1 over Q is Q minus 1.
Therefore, Phi of PQ equals P minus 1 times Q minus 1.
But look here, since P and Q are prime,
P minus 1 is the same as Phi of P,
and Q minus 1 is the same as Phi of Q.
Therefore, we've shown that when P and Q are prime,
Phi of PQ equals Phi of P times Phi of Q.
Is that relationship true for any two numbers?
Unfortunately not.
Let's take a simple example.
4 is 2 times 2,
but Phi of 4 is not equal to Phi of 2 times Phi of 2.
However, it is true when X and Y are relatively prime.
I won't give the proof, but it's a corollary worth knowing.
If X and Y are relatively prime,
then Phi of X, Y is equal to Phi of X times Phi of Y.
Let's turn our attention now to some applications of Euler's theorem.
In our lecture on the pigeonhole principle,
we proved that there was some power of 3 that ends in 001.
In other words, there's some integer n,
such that 3 to the nth power is congruent to 1 mod 1000.
Because when you take a number mod 1000,
you get the last three digits of the number.
But the pigeonhole principle doesn't tell us what the exponent n is.
It just proves that n exists somewhere.
But Euler's theorem can actually tell us what n is.
Let's apply Euler's theorem with the numbers a equals 3 and m equal 1000.
Those are legal values because 3 and 1000 are relatively prime.
Now, what's Phi of 1000?
By the formula we developed for Phi of 1000,
would be 1000 times 1 minus a half times 1 minus a fifth, which equals 400.
Therefore, Euler's theorem promises that 3 to the 400 is congruent to 1 mod 1000.
Just plugging right into Euler's theorem.
Therefore, 3 to the 400 ends in 001.
And there's nothing special about the number 3 in this proof anywhere.
Any number that's not divisible by 2 or 5,
that is, any number that's relatively prime to 1000, is going to have this property.
In lecture one, we proved that 2009 divides a number consisting of all nines.
Although we didn't know how many nines were in it.
Euler's theorem shows that this is true for any number that's not divisible by 2 or 5.
And it tells you how many nines are in the answer.
Here's what Euler's theorem gives us.
Let m be any number that does not divide by 2 or 5.
Any number that does not divide by 2 or 5.
In other words, let m be relatively prime to 10.
So by Euler's theorem, if I let a equal 10 and I let m equal m,
then Euler's theorem says that 10 to the Phi of m is congruent to 1 mod m.
In other words, by the definition of modular arithmetic,
m divides 10 to the Phi of m minus 1.
Now if you take 10 to a power and then subtract 1, what do you get?
You've got a number consisting of all nines, right?
Like 10 to the 3 minus 1 is 999.
And in general, 10 to the Phi of m minus 1 is going to have how many nines in it?
Whatever the exponent was, Phi of m.
So since 2009 is 7 times 7 times 41, we can find Phi of 2009.
Phi of 2009 will be 1,680.
Therefore, 2009 divides a number consisting of all nines,
in fact, exactly 1,680 of those nines.
Euler's theorem can sometimes help us raise numbers to enormous powers.
For example, let's say I want to calculate 6 to the 83rd power mod 79.
Now 6 and 79 are relatively prime, so I can use Euler's theorem here.
And Phi of 79, what's Phi of 79?
79 is prime and Phi of a prime number is that prime minus 1.
So Phi of 79 is 78.
So Euler's theorem, letting a equals 6 and m equals 79,
tells us that 6 to the 78 is congruent to 1 mod 79.
But of course, the problem I asked you was 6 to the 83.
Well, 6 to the 83 is 6 to the 78 times 6 to the 5th.
But the 6 to the 78th, that's equal to 1 mod 79.
It disappears mod 79.
So we're left with 6 to the 5th, which is 7,776,
which as we've seen before is congruent to 34 mod 79.
Here's another question.
What's 6 to the 78,005 mod 79?
Again, 6 to the 78,000 is 6 to the 78 to the 1,000.
But 6 to the 78 disappears mod 79, giving us 6 to the 5th,
the same answer as before, 34 mod 79.
We'll turn to more serious applications of Euler's theorem
when we do public key cryptography in our next lecture.
Meanwhile, let's explore some more applications of Fermat's theorem.
Fermat's theorem says if p is prime, then a to the p is congruent to a mod p.
Or in other words, if n is prime, then a to the n is congruent to a mod n.
So for example, when a is 2 and n is 5, 2 to the 5th is 32, is congruent to 2 mod 5.
When n is 7, it predicts that 2 to the 7 will be congruent to 2 mod 7, and it is.
As we've seen before, 2 to the 11 is congruent to 2 mod 11.
But when n is 9, 2 to the 9 is 512, which we know is congruent to 8 mod 9,
and that is not congruent to 2.
What conclusion do we make from that?
We conclude from that that 9 is not prime, because if 9 were prime,
2 to the 9 would be congruent to 2 mod 9.
And it's this idea that forms the cornerstone of prime testing.
It's basically the contrapositive of Fermat's theorem.
Fermat's theorem says if n is prime, then a to the n is congruent to a mod n.
Contrapositively, this is equivalent to saying if a to the n is not congruent to a mod n,
then n is not prime.
In other words, the contrapositive gives us compositeness.
This test is known as the Fermat primality test.
If a to the n is not congruent to a mod n, then n is composite.
This gives us an unusual way to check that a number is composite without having to factor it.
Let's say we're given a big number, let's say a 100-digit number n,
and we compute 2 to the n mod n, and we know how to do that from our last lecture.
If 2 to the n mod n is not equal to 2, then n is not prime.
If 2 to the n mod n is equal to 2, then n is probably prime, but we can't be sure.
This is sometimes called an industrial grade prime.
The more standard name is a base 2 pseudo-prime.
Alas, some composite numbers are base 2 pseudo-primes.
The first one is 341, which we can use seed planting or the lucky method to show satisfies 2 to the 341 is congruent to 2 mod 341.
So even though it isn't prime, it's acting like a prime.
So 341 would be a base 2 pseudo-prime that was composite.
The next one is 561.
Now, to be safe, we could see if 3 to the n mod n is equal to 3, and that would weed out 341.
341 doesn't satisfy it.
It is not a base 3 pseudo-prime, but it doesn't weed out 561.
As a matter of fact, a to the 561 is congruent to a mod 561 for all values of a,
even though 561 is not prime, it really wants to be prime, but it's not.
It's 3 times 11 times 17.
These kinds of numbers are called annoying, frankly, but the mathematical name for them are Carmichael numbers.
Now, good news, Carmichael numbers are rare.
The 561 is the only one under 1,000.
The next two are 1,105 and a very interesting number, 1729.
The bad news is there are infinitely many of them.
That was proved only recently in 1994 by Alfred Granville and Promerance.
But the good news is Fermat's test can be modified to avoid them.
In our next lecture, we'll apply what we've learned about prime testing and Euler's theorem
to provide a way for doing public key cryptography,
an extremely relevant application based on very elegant mathematics.
