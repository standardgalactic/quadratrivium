Lie ﬁelds revisited

Peter Morgan∗
Physics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.†
(Dated: November 18, 2018)

A class of interacting classical random ﬁelds is constructed using deformed ⋆-algebras of creation
and annihilation operators. The ﬁelds constructed are classical random ﬁeld versions of “Lie ﬁelds”.
A vacuum vector is used to construct linear forms over the algebras, which are conjectured to be
states over the algebras. Assuming this conjecture is true, the ﬁelds constructed are “quantum ran-
dom ﬁelds” in the sense that they have Poincar´e invariant vacua with a ﬂuctuation scale determined
by ~. A nonlocal particle interpretation of the formalism is shown to be the same as a particle
interpretation of a quantum ﬁeld theory.

INTRODUCTION

Instead of the interacting Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
methods that require regularization and renormalization,
we will here pursue a purely algebraic approach, which
will lead to a deformation of the commutation relations
of an algebraic presentation of the generalized free clas-
sical random ﬁeld. The classical random ﬁeld models
constructed here are based on the structure of the quan-
tum ﬁelds known as “Lie ﬁelds”[1, 2, 3, 4]. Lowenstein[2,
p. 57] points out that the examples he constructs do not
lead to scattering, which Greenberg[3] proves for quan-
tum Lie ﬁelds in general. Baumann[4] proves that Lie
ﬁelds are incompatible with the spectrum condition, but
classicality of a ⋆-algebra of observables is a diﬀerent con-
straint than microcausality and the spectrum condition,
so that we will be able to construct “classical random Lie
ﬁelds with quantum ﬂuctuations”.

A previous paper presented the classical Klein-Gordon
random ﬁeld using a creation and annihilation opera-
tor formalism, and showed that in these terms quan-
tum ﬂuctuations and thermal ﬂuctuations can be pre-
sented as Poincar´e invariant and non-Poincar´e invariant
ﬂuctuations respectively[5].
It was also shown that we
can construct a Poincar´e invariant state of the classical
Klein-Gordon random ﬁeld, with a ﬂuctuation scale de-
termined by ~, that produces measurement results iden-
tical to measurement results produced by the vacuum
state of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, whenever mea-
surements are made at space-like separation. When in-
compatible measurements are made at time-like separa-
tion, so that measurements aﬀect the results of subse-
quent measurements, careful attention to the diﬀerences
between quantum and classical models of measurement
is needed[6]. Classical models must explicitly model the
eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations on measurement by in-
cluding the measurement apparatus in the model when-
ever the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations are empirically

signiﬁcant. Appendix A discusses the relationship be-
tween the measurement theories of quantum ﬁelds and
of classical random ﬁelds.

Section II of this paper discusses the free Klein-Gordon
quantum ﬁeld and the free Klein-Gordon classical ran-
dom ﬁeld using a creation and annihilation operator for-
malism, then section III constructs scalar classical ran-
dom Lie ﬁelds. A vacuum vector, deﬁned as a zero eigen-
vector of all annihilation operators, is used to construct
a linear form over the algebra of creation and annihila-
tion operators. A partial proof that this linear form is a
state over the algebra is given in Appendix B, but part
of the proof remains a conjecture.
In corroboration of
the conjecture, Appendix B shows that the linear form is
positive semi-deﬁnite for operators that are constructed
as sums of products of up to ﬁve annihilation operators
and ﬁve creation operators.

Section IV discusses measurement and scattering the-
ory for these Lie ﬁelds, which gives a sense in which a
particle interpretation of the formalism is the same as
a particle interpretation of a quantum ﬁeld theory, even
though as a local operator model the Lie ﬁelds we have
constructed are certainly not local quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries. Section V constructs Lie ﬁelds based on vector or
electromagnetic ﬁelds.

Statistics of observables and correlations between them
are a principle empirical foundation of modern physics.
This paper constructs a continuous range of deformations
of generalized free ﬁelds as algebraic models for those
statistics and correlations that goes beyond the range of
application of free ﬁelds.

helpful referee.

II. THE FREE KLEIN-GORDON FIELD AND
THE GENERALIZED FREE FIELD

Measurement for a classical Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld can be modelled by an operator ˆφf that satisﬁes
[ ˆφf , ˆφg] = 0 for all f and g in a test function space
S
on Minkowski space, which we will take to be a Schwartz
II.1.2], so that f (x)
space of complex-valued functions[7,

f ∗[5]. The construction ˆφf = af + a†

is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable and decreases as well as its
derivatives faster than any power as x moves to inﬁnity in
any direction. Although ˆφf can be presented in terms of
an operator-valued distribution ˆφ(x) as
d4xf (x) ˆφ(x),
we will work here mostly with operators indexed by test
functions, which gives an eﬀective and compact nota-
tion. We may construct the classical Klein-Gordon ran-
dom ﬁeld as a sum of creation and annihilation operators,
ˆφf = af + a†
f ∗ makes
ˆφf complex linear in f , supposing that we deﬁne af to be
complex linear in f — this is essential for a Wightman
ﬁeld and mathematically very convenient, but ˆφf is an
observable only when f = f ∗ is real, so that ˆφ†
f = ˆφf .
An equilibrium state of the classical Klein-Gordon ran-
dom ﬁeld at temperature T can be presented in terms
of a Euclidean invariant “vacuum” state
, for which

which explicitly restricts to the forward light-cone as well
as being Lorentz invariant because of the removal of the
k0 from the denominator, resulting in the Poincar´e invari-
ant vacuum state of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld.
Given the vacuum state over the ⋆-algebra generated by
the creation and annihilation operators, we can use the
GNS construction to construct a Hilbert space

In a creation and annihilation operator formalism, it
is the restriction to the forward light-cone, the spectrum
condition, that results in nontrivial commutation rela-
tions [ ˆφf , ˆφg] when the supports of f and g are not at
space-like separation. We can also construct a Poincar´e
invariant state of the classical Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld, in which k0 is removed from the denominator, but
no restriction to the forward light-cone is imposed,

This produces measurement results that are identical to

quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, whenever measurements
are made at space-like separation. Measurements can be
made at time-like separation in this classical random ﬁeld
model, but are incompatible in a quantum ﬁeld model,
so a direct comparison of time-like separated measure-
ments is not possible. This Poincar´e invariant state does

not maximize the entropy of the Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld, so we can either introduce a classical dynamics with
2 + m2 ˜Φ(k),
the nonlocal Hamiltonian
which has this Poincar´e invariant state as its Gibbs equi-
R
librium state, or else we can introduce a “Poincar´e invari-
ant entropy”, which we might call “quantum entropy”,
as the thermodynamic dual to ~ (this is in addition to en-
tropy, which is the thermodynamic dual to temperature
— in [5] I preferred the introduction of a nonlocal dynam-
ics, but the idea of quantum, Poincar´e invariant entropy
has interesting consequences, to be developed elsewhere).
Note that on a view of the quantized Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld that is suggested by comparison with a classical ran-
dom ﬁeld, the spectrum condition has nothing to do with
“stability”, which is the reason generally given for insist-
ing on the restriction to the forward light-cone. For the
classical model presented by equation (1), it is the max-
imization of the entropy, and hence the minimization of
the classical free energy, that makes the Gibbs state sta-
ble — the classical energy of the Gibbs state is inﬁnite,
but lower temperature states are thermodynamically in-
accessible.

INTERACTING CREATION AND

ANNIHILATION OPERATORS FOR A SCALAR
FIELD

We will consider here deformations of the commuta-
tion relations for creation and annihilation relations that
satisfy linearity, λaf + µag = aλf +µg. Using creation and
annihilation operators makes possible the construction of
a classical ⋆-algebra that parallels the construction of a
quantum Lie ﬁeld[2]. Linearity is a very tight constraint,
insofar as the only choice for a deformed commutation
relation is

[af , a†

g] = (g; f ) + aξ(g;f ) + a†

ξ(f ;g),

(5)

·

;

where ξ(g; f ) is test function valued and anti-linear and
linear in the test functions g and f respectively. We will
suppose that the inner product (
) is Lorentz invariant,
·
but may be either quantum or classical in the sense of
the previous section, restricting the energy-momentum
spectrum either to the forward light-cone or to the for-
ward and backward light-cones. The only other possi-
ble linear deformation, q-deformation of the commuta-
tion relation, is ruled out because it does not allow ei-
ther microcausality or classicality to be satisﬁed, and we
will not consider here the possibility of deformed anti-
commutation relations. Non-scalar ﬁelds are constructed

in section V. The literature on quantum Lie ﬁelds re-
quires that [ ˆφf , ˆφg] = iω(f, g) + ˆφξ(f,g), which requires
a commutation relation of the form (5) for creation and
annihilation operators. For a classical random ﬁeld, the
commutation relation [ ˆφf , ˆφg] = 0 is trivial, so we will
deﬁne the algebraic structure of a “classical random Lie
ﬁeld” by equation (5).

We can always apply the commutation relations
(5) to convert any product of creation and annihila-
tion operators to a sum of normal-ordered products
g1 ...a†
a†
gm af1...afn , so that we can construct a ⋆-algebra
that is generated by a ﬁnite but arbitrarily large set of
test functions, presuming that associativity can be en-
sured for some choice of (
). To ensure as-
;
·
·
sociativity of the ⋆-algebra generated by these creation
and annihilation operators, we must ensure that the Ja-
cobi identity is satisﬁed for all elements in the algebra;
as a ﬁrst step, we must ensure that single creation and
annihilation operators satisfy the Jacobi identity,

If we can ﬁnd functions that satisfy equations (7), (8),
and (9), then, because of the symmetries of (
) and
·
ξ(
), we can deﬁne two more general objects, which take
·
two lists of functions as arguments, symmetric in their
anti-linear and linear arguments separately,

·

;

;

·

ξ(ξ(f1, ..., fm; g1, ..., gn); f ) = ξ(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm, f )
ξ(g; ξ(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm)) = ξ(g1, ..., gn, g; f1, ..., fm)
(ξ(f1, ..., fm; g1, ..., gn); f ) = (g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm, f )
(g; ξ(g1, ..., gn; f1, ..., fm)) = (g1, ..., gn, g; f1, ..., fm).

For example,

(ξ(f1; g1); f2) = (g1; f1, f2),

ξ(ξ(f1; g1); ξ(g2, f2)) = ξ(g1, g2; f1, f2),

(ξ(f1; ξ(f3; g1)); ξ(ξ(f4; g2); f2)) = (g1, g2; f1, f2, f3, f4).

The position of each function in the ﬂattened expres-
sion depends only on whether it is linear or antilinear
in the original expression. This can be extended by lin-
earity to a sesquilinear form on the symmetrized tensor
⊗n) over the test function space, for
product spaces S(
n > 1. With this deﬁnition, we can write the product

This product of one annihilation operator with n creation
2 terms, in contrast
operators (which generates 3
to the n + 1 terms that are generated by the same prod-
uct of undeformed annihilation and creation operators)
is symmetric in f1, ..., fn. The Jacobi identity is satisﬁed
for general basis elements of this ⋆-algebra because of the
symmetry of equation (10) in f1, ..., fn, and similar sym-
metries of higher products, so that we obtain the same
ﬁnal expression in terms of normal-ordered expressions
in the annihilation and creation operators independently
of the order in which we apply the commutation relation
(5) to move creation operators to the left and annihila-
tion operators to the right.

The restriction that M (u)
= 0 almost everywhere is not
empirically signiﬁcant, insofar as M (u) may be arbitrar-
ily close to zero, but also note that (...; ...) does not re-
quire the inverse of the mass function at all. ξ(...; ...) does
not appear in the ﬁnal expressions for expected values of
observables, except implicitly as part of the construction
of (...; ...), so for all observables we can comfortably take
the limit in which M (u)
0 outside the light-cone. For
the classical random ﬁeld we will construct, we can mod-
ify the algebra so that we may take M (u) = 0 on any
Lorentz-invariant set, in particular so that M (u) = 0 for
every space-like u, without having to take limits (see Eq.
(32)). For the deformed commutation algebra to exist,
2 = M (u), so M (u) cannot be restricted
note that
to a single mass shell as a distribution, we must take as a
starting point a generalized free ﬁeld that has a K¨all´en-
Lehmann weight function of which we can legitimately
take a square root.

classicality for the observables ˆφf = af +a†

for all test functions f and g. The symmetry condition

A candidate form of causality for classical Lie ﬁelds is to
require that states such as the above use only functions

that have positive spectrum in their construction. If we

could also apply this spectrum restriction to measure-
ment operators, we would eﬀectively recover the spec-
trum condition of Wightman ﬁelds, since G(u) always
occurs together with test functions in (...; ...). Local ﬁeld
operators cannot be required to satisfy this restriction,
however, because it is incompatible with reality, ˆφ†
f = ˆφf ,
which requires f = f ∗.

Eigenvectors of space-time translations of the above
⋆-algebra can be constructed in a similar way to those of
free quantum ﬁelds. We translate a state by translating
the creation operators that were used to construct the
state, so we introduce a derivation on the ⋆-algebra,

∂g

∂α

(34)

−

where gy(x) = g(x
y) is a space-time translation of the
test function g. We abbreviate this notation by assuming
that all test functions are indexed by a space-time trans-
lation vector yα, which we then omit. The ⋆-algebra of
observables deﬁned by equation (5) and extended by ∂α
satisﬁes the Jacobi identity. As in the free quantum ﬁeld
case, the (improper, inﬁnite norm) 1-particle eigenvec-
tors of ∂α are a†
. We can also

form of causality suggested above also ensures that the
Hilbert space generated by positive spectrum test func-
tions satisﬁes the spectrum condition.

We are now in a position to consider analogues of scat-
tering theory in this formalism. Scattering theory in the
usual sense of “in” and “out” ﬁelds is not possible, be-
cause this paper has adopted, in philosophers’ terms, a
block world formalism for models, in which a state that
models (or, if we prefer, approximately describes) the
world is given for all time (which is why we used active
translation instead of state evolution to construct the
operator ∂α in the previous paragraph). The 1-particle
eigenvector a†
is problematic to deal with because it
g∗
k |
does not have ﬁnite norm, so we will use a function gS
that has bounded support in a region S of momentum
space, instead of gk, together with an improper measure-
ment operator ˆφfk , where ˜fk(u) = 1

(35)

When k is a time-like 4-vector such that there is a u for
which u and u + k are both contained in the bounded
momentum-space region S, there is in general a non-zero
expectation for the observable ˆφfk . As we tune S to be
smaller and smaller, so that a†

momentum state, there is non-zero expectation for ˆφfk
only for very small k.

A diﬀerent approach, which introduces nonlocal “parti-
cle” measurements, is to consider probabilities expressed
as inner products such as

a product of test functions in real space, which is not in
the Schwartz space for an inﬁnite product of test func-

however, so it seems easier to discount this mathematical

V. LIE FIELDS BASED ON VECTOR AND
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

The dynamics of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld
in terms of a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product on test
functions is given by Menikoﬀ and Sharp[10, equation
(3.27)] (except for a missing factor of (2π)−3 that is
present in their equation (3.25)):

(41)

Note that E and F are not electromagnetic ﬁeld ten-
sors, they are bivectors of classical test functions that
contribute to a description of measurement and/or state
preparation of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld.
If
the fourier transform ˜Fµν (u) of a test function F
has electric and magnetic ﬁeld components (˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3)
and (˜b1, ˜b2, ˜b3), the integrand for the inner product
(F ; F )EM at (u0, 0, 0, u0) is the positive semi-deﬁnite
form u2
, which suppresses all
0
except two degrees of freedom of the quantum electro-
magnetic ﬁeld at each wave number. For a general free
classical vector or bivector random ﬁeld with nontrivial
quantum ﬂuctuations, in which we remove the restriction
to the forward light-cone found in equation (41), we have

For the construction of interacting creation and annihi-

of a free classical vector or bivector random ﬁeld, we have
to be able to construct generalized linear forms (...; ...)

satisfy equations (7)–(9) and (27), which preclude any
simple construction of ξ(...; ...) using contraction directly.

APPENDIX A: MEASUREMENT THEORY FOR
QUANTUM FIELDS AND FOR CLASSICAL
RANDOM FIELDS

Conventionally, quantum mechanics models a set of
measurements in an idealized way as an incompatible set
of operators acting on a single state in a Hilbert space,
which represents a measured system, but for more de-
tailed models the measurement apparatus must be in-
in Feynman and Hibbs, “The
cluded. For example,
usual separation of observer and observed which is now
needed in analyzing measurements in quantum mechan-
ics should not really be necessary, or at least should
be even more thoroughly analyzed. What seems to be
needed is the statistical mechanics of amplifying appa-
ratus”[11, pp. 22-23]. More forcefully, Bell urges us
to describe experiments instead of speaking of measure-
ments of systems[12]. Once preparation and measure-
ment apparatuses are included in a detailed model of an
experiment, the diﬀerence between quantum ﬁeld mod-
els and classical random ﬁeld models for experiments be-
comes nominal and empirically irrelevant. What must
be particularly ensured, however, is that the statistical
mechanics of amplifying apparatus includes the eﬀects
of quantum ﬂuctuations, either implicitly in a quantum
measurement model or explicitly in a classical measure-
ment model, whenever considering the eﬀects of quantum
ﬂuctuations is necessary to ensure empirical adequacy of
a model.

It should be noted that classical random ﬁelds are suﬃ-
ciently similar to quantum ﬁelds and suﬃciently diﬀerent
from classical particle property models that the assump-
tions that are needed to derive Bell inequalities are gen-

erally not satisﬁed if there are any thermal or quantum
ﬂuctuations[13].

It is a curiosity of the measurement theory of quantum
ﬁelds that modelling experiments using measurement op-
erators places measurement apparatuses and the Physi-
cist outside of space and time, and supposes that the use
of diﬀerent measurement apparatuses in principle does
not change the physical state of any preparation appa-
ratus (that is included in the model) or of the measured
system whatsoever. In contrast, if we include the mea-
surement apparatus in a quantum ﬁeld model, the pres-
ence of the measurement apparatus certainly changes the
measured system – the past of the measurement appara-
tus is in the past light-cone of the measured system. In-
compatibility of measurement operators can be thought
of loosely as describing the non-trivial eﬀects of measure-
ments on each other, while curiously requiring the mea-
sured state in principle not to be diﬀerent when we make
the diﬀerent measurements. To determine a quantum
state, however, we have to make incompatible measure-
ments of the same prepared state. This is perfectly ac-
ceptable as a pragmatic approach to measurement, but,
as a result, moving the Heisenberg cut changes the rela-
tionship between measurement apparatus and measured
system, so that the measured system either is or is not
changed by the presence of the measurement apparatus.
If we consider classical random ﬁelds in terms of mea-
surement, then they have their own, equally pragmatic
assumption about measurement: that we can make mea-
surements that eﬀectively do not change the measured
system. This assumption is violated quite strongly when
we attempt,
for example, to describe electromagnetic
ﬁelds in the quantum mechanical regime as classical sys-
tems, insofar as from a classical point of view the mea-
surement apparatus does change the measured system.
Instead of considering classical random ﬁelds in terms of
measurement, however, it is conceptually more straight-
forward to think of classical random ﬁelds as allowing us
to construct models, or descriptions, of experiments. The
models we construct are idealized to a greater or lesser
extent, depending on how much care is needed to achieve
suﬃcient empirical accuracy. If quantum ﬂuctuations are
empirically signiﬁcant, which they are when we describe
experiments that are in the quantum mechanical regime
using classical random ﬁelds, we have to include in the
model the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations of all interact-
ing parts of the experiment. In practice, this presumably
never includes the person who is watching a computer
display of experimental results, but it often will require
us to take account of the eﬀect of quantum ﬂuctuations
on interactions between measurement apparatus and the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, “the statistical mechanics of am-

plifying apparatus”.

In reverting to a classical random ﬁeld model that ex-
plicitly includes experimental apparatuses and the eﬀects
of quantum ﬂuctuations as well as the eﬀects of ther-
mal ﬂuctuations in models, we treat thermal and quan-
tum ﬂuctuations in a more even-handed way. If we un-
derstand the Unruh eﬀect to describe transformations
between quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations under non-
inertial changes of coordinates, the principle of equiva-
lence and a preference for covariant presentation of phys-
ical models suggest that we ought to prefer classical ran-
dom ﬁeld models to quantum ﬁeld models. Making the
expressions given in this paper for (...; ...) and ξ(...; ...)
generally covariant and independent of or determining
the underlying geometry, however, is a nontrivial prob-
lem.

One situation in which quantum ﬂuctuations are phys-
ically signiﬁcant but not necessarily a signiﬁcant part of
measurement, so that classical random ﬁeld models might
be as eﬀective as quantum ﬁeld models, is in solid state
physics, insofar as quantum ﬂuctuations are important
to the internal structure of a material but measurement
apparatuses measure thermodynamical properties with-
out quantum ﬂuctuations of the measurement apparatus
signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the microstructure of the material.
It also seems that with the addition of detailed consid-
eration of the quantum ﬂuctuations of light sources, de-
tectors, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we might reason-
ably expect to expand the scope of semi-classical optics,
which is already empirically adequate for a wide range of
experiments. It is always a contingent question whether

11

a detailed model of sources and detectors is necessary
to model a whole experiment with suﬃcient empirical
adequacy, whether we model experiments in terms of
a quantum mechanical or a classical model of measure-
ment. The advantage of a quantum mechanical model of
measurement is of course that it is often not necessary to
model measurement apparatuses explicitly, where a clas-
sical model of measurement for the same experiments
may require detailed explicit models of quantum ﬂuctu-
ations.

not currently provide, however the very straightforward
algebraic and combinatorial structure strongly suggests
that it is a correct conjecture for all m, n. Including mul-

is also clearly an inner product. In equation (B5), the
ﬁrst six terms are the free ﬁeld inner product, and the
