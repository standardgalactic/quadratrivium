Summary: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an intermediate form of nonlocality which inter-
polates between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It has been shown that EPR steerable states are
fundamental resources for one-sided device-independent quantum information tasks. Nevertheless, dis-
tinguishing quantum steerable states from the unsteerable ones in general cases remains a big challenge
under active studies. The generalized Bloch representation of density matrices in terms of the Heisenberg
observables is a useful tool for analyzing characteristics of quantum systems and plays an important role
in quantum information. In this work, the role of this representation in detection of EPR steering is
studied. More speciﬁcally, based on the correlation matrices of the Heisenberg-Weyl observables, a family
of steerability criteria for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems are proposed. A large class of Hermitian
operators, which can conveniently witness steering in some scenarios, are further provided. Finally, these
criteria are illustrated through several examples, are compared with some existing ones, and their power
and advantages are exhibited in certain cases.
