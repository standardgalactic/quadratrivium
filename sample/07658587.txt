Summary: Brownian particles that are replicated and annihilated at equal rate have strongly correlated
positions, forming a few compact clusters separated by large gaps. We characterize the distribution of
the particles at a given time, using a deﬁnition of clusters in terms of a coarse-graining length recently
introduced by some of us. We show that, in a non-extinct realization, the average number of clusters
grows as ∼ tDf /2 where Df ≈ 0.22 is the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the boundary of the super-Brownian
motion (SBM), found by Mueller, Mytnik, and Perkins. We also compute the distribution of gaps between
consecutive particles. We ﬁnd two regimes separated by the characteristic length scale ℓ =
D/β where
D is the diﬀusion constant and β the branching rate. The average number of gaps greater than g decays
as ∼ gDf −2 for g ≪ ℓ and ∼ g−Df for g ≫ ℓ. Finally, conditioned on the number of particles n, the above
distributions are valid for g ≪
n is much less than
n)−2, in agreement with the universal gap distribution predicted by Ramola,
one, and decays as ≃ 4(g/
Majumdar, and Schehr. Our results interpolate between a dense SBM regime and a large-gap regime,
unifying two previously independent approaches.
