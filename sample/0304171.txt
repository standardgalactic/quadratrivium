A relativistic variant of the Wigner function

Peter Morgan

30, Shelley Road, Oxford, OX4 3EB, UK.

Abstract

The conventional Wigner function is inappropriate in a quantum ﬁeld theory setting
because, as a quasiprobability density over phase space, it is not manifestly Lorentz
covariant. A manifestly relativistic variant is constructed as a quasiprobability den-
sity over trajectories instead of over phase space.

Introduction

The Wigner function is a quasi probability density over phase space (for re-
views, see Lee[1], Cohen[2], or Hillery et al.[3]; a quasi probability is generally
not positive semi-deﬁnite), so in a quantum ﬁeld theory setting it is not mani-
festly Lorentz covariant. Quasiprobabilities are conceptually interesting partly
because Arthurs-Kelly type interpretations of positive deﬁnite Husimi func-
tions derived by smoothing from Wigner functions are available[4,5,6], but the
lack of manifest Lorentz covariance in the quantum ﬁeld theory setting makes
Wigner functions, in this respect, a poor relation to Feynman path integrals.

A relativistic variant of the Wigner function that is manifestly Lorentz co-
variant in a quantum ﬁeld theory setting is introduced in section 2, as a
quasiprobability density over trajectories instead of over phase space. As a
formalism, the relativistic variant Wigner function is conceptually similar to
the Feynman integral in its use of trajectories, but is conceptually diﬀerent in
its use of quasiprobabilities instead of phase integrals. A helpful alternative
name for the “relativistic variant Wigner function” is the “trajectory Wigner

function”, just because it is a quasiprobability density over trajectories instead
of over phase space. The emphasis on trajectories here can be compared with
the phase space approach to quantum ﬁeld theory of Zachos and Curtright[7].

The relativistic variant Wigner function is discussed for the speciﬁc case of
the quantized real Klein-Gordon ﬁeld (called here QKG) in section 3. It turns
out that the relativistic variant Wigner function does not exist for QKG,
prompting the introduction of a modiﬁed quantized real Klein-Gordon ﬁeld
(mQKG). QKG is a singular limit of mQKG. The emphasis on QKG as a ﬁeld
theory (instead of as a second quantized particle theory, for example as in [3,
2.5] and references therein) allows a nonlocality that is present in QKG to
§
be characterized clearly in terms of the concepts of classical statistical ﬁeld
theory, and also allows a clear characterization of both the similarity and the
group theoretic diﬀerence between quantum ﬂuctuations and classical thermal
ﬂuctuations. The extension of the relativistic variant Wigner function to other
non-interacting ﬁelds is discussed in section 4.

2 The relativistic variant Wigner function in general

The conventional Wigner function can be presented in non-relativistic quan-
tum mechanics as the inverse fourier transform of

the Wigner function is the inverse fourier transform of

are smeared ﬁeld operators on a hypersurface S and ˆφ(x) and ˆπ(x) are operator-
valued distributions. The emphasis on phase space is inappropriate for rela-
tivistic quantum ﬁeld theory because a phase space approach is not manifestly
covariant, so we will instead consider the inverse fourier transform of the c-
number functional

(the fourier transform functional measure ˇ
f includes a factor (2π)−1 for each

deﬁnition is equally applicable for interacting and for non-interacting ﬁelds.

When χψ[w] exists, a set of marginal density functionals can be constructed
from it by averaging over degrees of freedom, which includes probability den-
sity functionals that can be constructed from mutually commuting sets of ﬁeld
observables ˆφf . A paradigm case of a set of mutually commuting ﬁeld observ-
ables is obtained when we restrict functions f ′ to be deﬁned on a space-like

relation [ag, a†
f and af are smeared creation and annihi-
lation components of the QKG ﬁeld, ˆφf = a†

classical statistical ﬁeld theory, this probability density functional character-
izes a nonlocality that is present in QKG. The dynamical nonlocality is man-
ifest in the appearance of the fourier mode operator ˜f (k)
√k2 + m2 ˜f (k),
the nonlocality of which is described by Segal and Goodman[8]. This non-
locality is qualitatively the same as the nonlocality of the heat equation in
classical physics, in that it has exponentially reducing eﬀects at increasing
space-like separation, so it should be understood to be similar to Hegerfeldt-
type nonlocality[10], rather than similar to Bell-type nonlocality, which can
be a signiﬁcant eﬀect at arbitrary space-like separation. Faster-than-light sig-
nals cannot be sent using this nonlocality, as always in quantum ﬁeld theory,

as long as we insist that measurement operators commute at space-like sep-
aration, which can be understood to be because the initial states that would
allow signals to be sent would require inﬁnite energy to set up[9]. The quan-
tum ﬂuctuations of the QKG ﬁeld vacuum state described by equation (11)
are compared with the thermal ﬂuctuations of a classical Klein-Gordon ﬁeld
at equilibrium in Appendix A.

Unfortunately, a 4-dimensional inverse functional fourier transform for the
QKG vacuum is not obviously well-deﬁned, because of the appearance of a
delta function in a denominator,

QKG is in this approach a singular, and not obviously well-deﬁned, limit of
mQKG, in which the function F (kµkµ) approaches δ(kµkµ
m2). If we regard
QKG as only an eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we can equally eﬀectively describe a
system using mQKG, provided F (
) is as small oﬀ mass-shell as is necessary
to reproduce results of experiments. In general, quantum ﬁeld theories that are

1 mQKG still satisﬁes the Wightman axioms. In addition, it conforms to the re-
quirements of the cluster decomposition theorem[11,
4.4], since the algebraic and

Lorentzian structure and the Hamiltonian of the theory are all unchanged, so that
the S-matrix satisﬁes the cluster decomposition principle.

delta-function concentrated to on mass-shell will be singular limits of quantum
ﬁeld theories like mQKG, as far as the relativistic variant Wigner function
discussed in this paper is concerned. Taking trajectories to be sharply conﬁned
to a smooth classical dynamics is not consistent with a measure-theoretic
approach to ﬁelds deﬁned on space-time (in contrast, for phase space methods
trajectories have to be conﬁned to a single classical dynamics).

We can construct χψ[w] straightforwardly for arbitrary mQKG states in a

This presentation of a thermal quantum ﬁeld state clariﬁes its relationship to
the vacuum quantum ﬁeld state in relatively elementary, albeit also relatively
intractable, terms. A Hilbert space norm is mathematically eﬀective largely
because it is a tight constraint on theory, but the constraint is tight enough
that the vacuum state and a thermal state cannot be presented in the same
Hilbert space. If we instead use a function space that does not have a separable
Hilbert space structure, the vacuum state and a thermal state can be presented
in a uniform way. It should also be possible to present the vacuum of an
interacting quantum ﬁeld in the same function space formalism, by evaluating
equation (6).

There are no particles as such in this ﬁeld approach, but there is a countable
basis for the Fock space, which can lead to the conventional particle interpre-
tation. A particle interpretation for quantum ﬁeld theory is not possible in
general, however, when not only Fock space representations are considered.

4 Other quantum ﬁelds

For real interaction-free spin-1 quantum ﬁelds, relativistic variant Wigner
functions over real classical spin-1 ﬁelds are identical to the results in section
3 — the only change is in the inner product, between real classical spin-1 test
functions, representing the commutation bracket between smeared operator
valued distributions as a c-number. We can introduce, for example,

It will be interesting to see whether the development given for spin-0 quantum
ﬁelds can also be extended to spin- 1
2 quantum
ﬁelds we are of course faced with the additional diﬃculty of anticommutation
relations, but we have several choices in considering them:

2 quantum ﬁelds. For spin- 1

·

·
·

we can consider fermion ﬁelds to be an essentially formal way to describe
a perturbation of boson ﬁelds;
we can try to develop a bosonization approach in 1+3 dimensions;
we can take fermion ﬁelds to satisfy commutation relations instead of
anticommutation relations, but modify interactions with the gauge ﬁelds
to make the spin- 1
2 quantum ﬁelds stable nonetheless.

Once we represent quantum ﬁeld theory in terms of quasiprobability densities
over trajectories, we can use diﬀerent ﬁelds as coordinates in our classical de-
scription of trajectories — so we are free to eliminate some variables in favour
of others — where the more formal structure of other representations discour-
ages such freedom. There may of course be other ways of approaching the
question of fermion ﬁelds. If we adopt the last choice above, of commutation
relations for spin- 1
2 quantum ﬁelds, there is an obvious vacuum probability
density functional over trajectories of a classical Dirac ﬁeld ζ(x),

The requirement for anticommutation relations for spin- 1
2 quantum ﬁelds can
be understood to be relative to a requirement for positive energy, which is only
needed for stability when interactions are introduced. We can ensure stability
even if we adopt commutation relations for spin- 1
2 quantum ﬁelds, provided
we introduce interactions in such a way that the Feynman diagrams in the
new description are as they would have been if we had made the usual choice
of anticommutation relations for spin- 1

2 ﬁelds.

It will also be interesting to see whether relativistic variant Wigner function
representations of vacuum states of interacting relativistic quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries can be constructed as relativistically invariant modiﬁcations of relativistic
variant Wigner functions for the vacuum states of non-interacting quantum
ﬁelds. If we can construct a vacuum state I[w, ζ] of an interacting theory
as a positive semi-deﬁnite relativistically invariant modiﬁcation of a product
χ0[w]P0[ζ] of non-interacting QKG and spin- 1
2 vacuums, for example, then
other coherent-like states can immediately be written as P (w, ζ)I[w, ζ], where
P (w, ζ) is an arbitrary positive semi-deﬁnite multinomial in components of
the ﬁelds w and ζ.

5 Conclusion

We have constructed a relativistic variant of the Wigner function for quantum
ﬁeld states, which is conceptually preferable to the conventional Wigner func-
tion. In particular, as a Lorentz covariant formalism, the relativistic variant
Wigner function is an alternative to the Feynman path integral formalism. We
have seen some of the properties of the relativistic variant Wigner function
for the quantized real Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, or at least we have for the slightly
modiﬁed theory, mQKG, and also for other quantum ﬁelds. The distinction
between QKG and mQKG is not very great, but the fact that QKG is singular
in terms of the relativistic variant Wigner function is interesting in itself.

The striking similarity between quantum ﬂuctuations and thermal ﬂuctua-
tions in a Wigner function formulation of quantum ﬁeld theory in terms of
ﬁelds (whether in the conventional phase space formulation or in the rela-
tivistic variant formulation), and the clarity with which the diﬀerence can be
identiﬁed, suggests a description of quantum measurement in which quantum
ﬂuctuations are described explicitly. Equally striking is the nonlocal kernel
that in classical statistical ﬁeld theory terms is necessary to reproduce the
QKG vacuum state.

where the fourier-mode kernel (k2 + m2) is local. Both quantum and classical
probability densities restrict non-zero probability to solutions of the classical
Klein-Gordon equation, but with diﬀerent densities. The probability density
for the QKG vacuum state is Poincar´e invariant, in contrast to the Galilean
invariance of the probability density for the classical Klein-Gordon equilibrium
state.

Despite the diﬀerence in units and associated functional forms, Planck’s con-
stant of action plays a very similar role in χ0[w] to the role played by the
Boltzmann energy kT in a Gibbs probability density exp [
H[v]/kT ]. Both
determine the amplitude of ﬂuctuations. We have to be careful to remember
the diﬀerence between the 3-dimensional Galilean symmetry of an equilibrium
state and the (3+1)-dimensional Poincar´e symmetry of the quantum ﬁeld the-
ory vacuum, but the Boltzmann energy and Planck’s constant are nonetheless
closely analogous in their eﬀect.

The diﬀerence between the functional forms of quantum ﬂuctuations and ther-
mal ﬂuctuations is critical for understanding quantum measurement. Although
quantum ﬂuctuations and thermal ﬂuctuations are both just ﬂuctuations, we
are apparently unable to reduce the “q-temperature” of a measurement device
below ¯h to reduce the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations on measurement, whereas
we routinely reduce the temperature of measurement devices to reduce the ef-
fects of thermal ﬂuctuations. That we cannot reduce the q-temperature of a
measurement device at all is an empirical principle at the heart of quantum
theory, without which the distinction that quantum theory makes in principle
between quantum ﬂuctuations and thermal ﬂuctuations becomes tendentious:
if we could in practice reduce quantum ﬂuctuations even a little, we would
have to admit the possibility that quantum ﬂuctuations can be reduced arbi-
trariliy close to zero, just as we admit for thermal ﬂuctuations. Even without
a present possibility of actually reducing quantum ﬂuctuations, however, we
can nonetheless formulate a description of quantum measurement in which

10

quantum ﬂuctuations of a measurement device are explicitly described, just
as we explicitly describe thermal ﬂuctuations of a measurement device. Note
that it is only because quantum ﬂuctuations cannot be eliminated that mea-
surements using diﬀerent devices have to be represented by noncommuting
operators in quantum theory.

B Inverse functional fourier transform of a positive semi-deﬁnite

Gaussian

In a ﬁnite dimensional case, it is well-deﬁned to take the inverse fourier trans-
form of a Gaussian e−q(x), where q(x) is a positive semi-deﬁnite quadratic form,
since q(x) splits the space X
x into orthogonal subspaces X0, q(x0) = 0, and
X1, q(x1) > 0. For the inverse fourier transform we have

∋

e−iy.xe−q(x) =

e−iy0.x0

e−iy1.x1e−q(x1) N= δ(y0)e−q−1(y1),

(B.1)

where the inverse quadratic form q−1 exists on X1. This simple method extends
to mQKG, but, given only a deﬁnition of δ(x) as a distribution, it does not
extend to QKG. If we deﬁne δ(x) as a Colombeau generalized function[12],
this simple method may possibly extend to QKG.

where D(k) determines the dynamics of a classical statistical ﬁeld theory, the
wρD[w] only exists in general if we restrict the range
functional integral
of the functional integration to functions that are smooth below a chosen
scale (for a straightforward discussion, see [13,
8.1 and Appendix L]). This
§
integral must be ﬁnite for us to regard ρD[w] as a probability density functional
(implicitly assuming normalization), as must the moments of the distribution.
< Λ,
A simple way to ensure ﬁniteness is to introduce a wave number cutoﬀ,
for some Euclidean metric on k.

[2πF (kµkµ)θ(k0)]−1, where F (kµkµ) has support, say, only for m2 < kµkµ <
m2 + δ, near the hyperboloid kµkµ = m2, so the functional integrals of mQKG
are already constrained to functions ˜w(k) having support only where kµ is in
the support of F (kµkµ)θ(k0). mQKG can be treated in the same way as the
wρD[w] and
well-understood Gaussian model, and the functional integral
< Λ (but not for
the moments of the probability density are all ﬁnite for
Λ
). One diﬃculty is that this regularization breaks Lorentz invariance,
but this is always a diﬃculty for simple regularizations of relativistic quantum
ﬁeld theory.
