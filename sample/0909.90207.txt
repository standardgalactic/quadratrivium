Summary: Economic growth is frequently considered to be in conﬂict with sustainable development and
environmental quality. Therefore, a decision maker needs to know how to deal with the environmental
issues that come around. This article aims to inform operational researchers of the possibilities of in-
corporating environmental issues when analyzing industrial supply chains and to inform environmental
scientists more generally of the value of using OR models and techniques in environmental research.
