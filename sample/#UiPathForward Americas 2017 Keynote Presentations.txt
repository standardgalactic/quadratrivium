RPA Definitions 

› Attended RPA is defined as:

“Automation that interacts in real time with humans who initiate and control robot tasks, often 
embedding functions within apps., generally associated with front-office, agent-led activities.” 

› Unattended RPA is defined as:

“Automation that replaces a complete human function in a ‘lights-out’ “batch-oriented” 
manner, creating a virtual workforce, generally associated with back-office activities.”

› Hybrid RPA is defined as:

“Automation that combines attended and unattended  tasks that work together, generally 
associated with processes that span front and back-office activities.”

Investments are 
expected to improve 
customer self-
service (52%) and 
help employees 
serve customers 
better (48%) in order 
to get better 
answers quickly.

Q11. Where do you see the most ‘newer’ term investment? 

Chatbots directed at customer to
improve self-service

Chatbots directed at employees to
help them service / serve customers
better

48%

52%

Q12. [IF CHATBOTS DIRECTED AT EMPLOYEES] You said newer term investment of 
chatbots is directed at employees to better serve / service customers. Why is this?

It will enable employees to get better answer customer queries
quickly

Technology for understanding a conversation is still developing /
immature

Chatbots enable smarter, quicker decisions to better serve
customers in a personalized way

We have an immediate ROI due to internal help desk elimination

Lower compliance risk

Lower customer experience risk than chatbots directed at
customers

Enterprise-grade 
RPA Background/context 
of the research

Much talk of enterprise-grade RPA, but what 
is it and why does it matter?

Everest Group is conducting survey-based research on:
• What is enterprise-grade RPA?
• Which features users believe to be the most important?
• What benefits can be realized from having these?
• What features are most valued by different industries and why?

This presentation highlights our interim findings. Everest Group will publish the full 
results in a report very soon.

Why enterprise-grade RPA matters? 

It can contribute to the success of automation projects in many different ways:

Speed of 
implementation

Implementing 
RPA across 
multiple 
geographies

Increasing 
process 
automation 
rates

Implementing 
RPA across 
multiple 
business units

Speed to scale

Helping 
regulatory 
compliance

Achieving 
faster ROI

Reducing 
error rates & 
exceptions in 
automation

speeds up that journey

Interim findings:

• Users consider ease of software and robot maintenance, security and scalability to be the most important features of 

enterprise RPA

• These reduce the effort that is needed to develop, run and maintain robots

• More than 75% of enterprises are satisfied with their RPA ROI

•

Integrated cognitive and ML for processing unstructured data is important as is the availability of robot operational analytics

What you can learn from this research:

• What features to look for in RPA software

• What your peers or your industry believe to be the most important features of this type of technology

• Get insights on how different your take is on these and work out why that is

• What commercial models are available and preferred by different types of enterprises

•

If you are achieving ROI in-line with other RPA users
