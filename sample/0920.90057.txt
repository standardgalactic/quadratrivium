Summary: This article surveys the recently emerged ﬁeld of reverse logistics. The management of return
ﬂows induced by the various forms of reuse of products and materials in industrial production processes
has received growing attention throughout this decade. Many authors have proposed quantitative models
taking those changes in the logistics environment into account. However, no general framework has been
suggested yet. Therefore the time seems right for a systematic overview of the issues arising in the context
of reverse logistics. In this paper, we subdivide the ﬁeld into three main areas, namely distribution
planning, inventory control, and production planning. For each of these we discuss the implications of
the emerging reuse eﬀorts, review the mathematical models proposed in the literature, and point out the
areas in need of further research. Special attention is paid to diﬀerences and/or similarities with classical
‘forward’ logistics methods.
