Abstract

The derivation of Bell inequalities for beables is well-known to require a “no-conspiracy” assump-

tion. This assumption is widely accepted, the alternative being correlations between instrument

settings and hidden beables. Two further assumptions are identiﬁed here: (1) a “no-contextuality”

assumption, similar to the prohibition of contextuality that is required to derive the Kochen-Specker

theorem, which is closely related to the “no-conspiracy” assumption; (2) a “no-correlation” assump-

tion, which prohibits correlations between hidden beables. The three assumptions together are less

acceptable than the “no-conspiracy” assumption alone.

INTRODUCTION

I take it that the violation of Bell inequalities by experiment rules out any simple local

beables model for the violation of Bell inequalities that is constructed using the resources of

classical particle mechanics (although conceptually extravagant notions of backward causal

propagation, for example, are not ruled out, and detector eﬃciency remains an issue), but I

consider here the violation of Bell inequalities in local beables models that are constructed

using the resources of classical statistical ﬁeld theory. Nonlocal correlations are always

present in the context of classical statistical ﬁeld theory, whereas they are generally not

present in the classical mechanics of a small number of particles.

There are other reasons for thinking that beables models must be nonlocal, particularly

Hegerfeldt nonlocality[1, 2], but Bell inequalities for beables do not provide a strong con-

straint on classical statistical ﬁelds as a basis for a beables model for the violation of Bell

inequalities.

Bell[3, Chap. 7, originally 1976] shows from a deﬁnition of local causality alone that a

beables model predicts two Bell inequalities for observable classical statistics associated with

two space-like separated regions

A and

R

B, and that quantum theory does not satisfy the

R

same inequalities. Shimony, Horne, and Clauser[4, originally 1976] show, however, that if

Clauser’s comments are brought together in a review article by d’Espagnat[5], and Brans[6]

gives an alternative, quite helpful discussion. The literature on Bell inequalities for beables is

quite sparse (very sparse indeed by comparison with the literature on Bell inequalities more

generally), and has not changed the general perception that Bell[3, Chap. 12] more-or-less

closes the discussion.

The beables (a, λ), (b, µ), and (c, ν) are associated with the disjoint regions Past(

and possibly controlled by the experimenter, while λ, µ, and ν are hidden beables, neither

observed nor controlled by the experimenter. As far as classical physics is concerned, the

separation of beables into (a, λ), (b, µ), and (c, ν) is arbitrary, because anything that is

hidden today may be revealed tomorrow and whether we observe or record beables makes

no diﬀerence, so any derivation of Bell inequalities must be robust under diﬀerent choices of

the separation. There is nothing about the mathematics of section II that will determine a

separation of beables into (a, λ), (b, µ), and (c, ν). The only diﬀerence between non-hidden

beables and hidden beables will be that we will integrate over all values of hidden beables

and never integrate over non-hidden beables. It will be useful to consider three choices in

this paper: (1) all of a, b, c, λ, µ, and ν non-null; (2) ν maximal, so that c is null; and (3) c

maximal, so that ν is null.

The fundamental deﬁnition in Bell’s derivation of inequalities for beables is that for a

locally causal theory, for X any beables associated with

A, X∩ all of the beables associated

with Past(

(In an alternative terminology, usual in philosophy, correlation between X and Y is “screened

oﬀ” by X∩ and Xp.) This deﬁnition is applied a number of times in Bell’s derivation of

3

inequalities for beables. Shimony, Horne, and Clauser[4], in contrast, weaken the deﬁnition of

a locally causal theory, so that for X and Y as above, but for XP all of the beables associated

with Past(

(Correlation between X and Y is “screened oﬀ” by XP .) The two deﬁnitions are the same

if Xp happens to be a speciﬁcation of all the beables in Past(

A)

R

−

Past(

B). Equation (1)

R

combines equation (2), which is a more natural deﬁnition of local causality, with a principle

that correlations only arise because of common causes. Equation (2), however, is not strong

enough to allow Bell inequalities to be derived. Some of the applications of equation (1) can

be replaced by applications of equation (2), but most cannot. One of the latter applications

is the “no-conspiracy” assumption, which prohibits correlations between instrument settings

and hidden beables, and section II further identiﬁes a “no-correlation” assumption (discussed

in section IV), which prohibits correlations between hidden beables.

The derivation of Bell inequalities for beables also requires a previously unidentiﬁed as-

sumption that a beables theory is noncontextual. Section II identiﬁes a “no-contextuality”

assumption (discussed in section III), similar to the prohibition of contextuality that is

required of a beables model to derive the Kochen-Specker theorem[7], and shows the “no-

contextuality” assumption to be closely related to the “no-conspiracy” assumption. The

three assumptions taken together are much less acceptable than the “no-conspiracy” as-

sumption alone.

Finally, section V shows that the violation of Bell inequalities alone does not justify

preferring an empiricist interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory over an equally empiricist

interpretation of classical statistical ﬁeld theory by considering the similarities between a

quantum ﬁeld theoretic Wigner quasi-probability description and a classical probability de-

scription of an experiment that violates a Bell inequality.

II. DERIVATION OF BELL INEQUALITIES FOR BEABLES

Bell’s mathematical argument is reproduced here in the form given by d’Espagnat[5].

[[Notes in brackets]] will indicate where there are assumptions that will be addressed in the

next two sections. Suppose that A and B are observed in regions

A and

R

B. Applying

R

equation (1) or equation (2), the conditional probability density p(A
|

a, b, c, λ, µ, ν, B) is

statistically independent of b, µ, and B in a locally causal theory, and similarly for the

conditional probability density p(B

a, b, c, λ, µ, ν, A),

p(A

p(B

a, b, c, λ, µ, ν, B) = p(A

a, c, λ, ν),

b, c, µ, ν).

The mean of the product AB, given the non-hidden beables (a, b, c), is:

M(a, b, c) =

(5)

where the conditional probability density p(λ, µ, ν

a, b, c) for the hidden beables can be

|

rewritten, applying no more than the deﬁnition of conditional probability, as

p(λ, µ, ν

a, b, c) = p(λ

a, b, c).

|

|

(6)

Applying equation (1), or, through a putative argument provided by Shimony, Horne, and

Clauser[4] and discussed in section IV, applying equation (2), we can derive

p(λ

µ, ν, a, b, c) = p(λ

are further assumptions, which might be called “no-nonlocal-conspiracy” assumptions, but

will not be directly addressed here]], so the mean of the product AB, given non-hidden

beables (a, b, c), is

M(a, b, c) =

Z

(10)

where A(a, c, ν) is the mean of A averaged over the hidden beables λ, given the non-hidden

beables a and c and the hidden beables ν, and similarly for B(b, c, ν).

Suppose that A and B satisfy

Classically, non-relativistic quantum mechanics is half-way between the conditions for de-

riving Bell inequalities and the maximum violation, when equation (16) is satisﬁed as an

equality. There must, therefore, be principled constraints on initial conditions in a beables

model to ensure the maximum violation is never observed, as well as to allow some violation.

III. THE NO-CONSPIRACY AND NO-CONTEXTUALITY ASSUMPTIONS

The prohibition of correlations of a with c, and of b with c, the “no-contextuality” as-

sumption, is closely related to the “no-conspiracy” assumption.

If we suppose that ν is

6

6
6
6

complete information, so that c is null, we can derive in place of equation (10), supposing

that equations (7), (8), and (9) are satisﬁed,

which requires that

M(a, b) =

Z

A(a, ν) B(b, ν)p(ν

a, b)dν,

|

a, b) = p(ν)

p(ν

|

(17)

(18)

for us to be able to derive Bell inequalities. If we take a and b to be only instrument set-

tings at the time of the measurement, with c null, the “no-conspiracy” assumption is little

diﬀerent than to say that instrument settings at the time of the measurement must be com-

pletely uncorrelated with the experimental apparatus (which is, after all, almost entirely in

Past(

A)

R

∩

Past(

B)). Ensuring that instrument settings are completely uncorrelated with

R

the experimental apparatus would seem a remarkable achievement in a classical statistical

ﬁeld theory setting.

Bell argues[3, Chap. 12] that the dynamics of a mechanism to choose the instrument

settings can be made chaotic enough that, even if there are correlations between (c, ν) and

(a, b), the instrument settings may nonetheless be taken to be “at least eﬀectively free for

the purposes at hand”. From a classical point of view, this is a remarkable claim. Either

there are correlations in a model for an experiment or there are not. Correlations that

are easy to measure at one time are generally not as easy to measure at other times, but

the practicality of measuring correlations has no bearing on whether there are correlations,

which is in principle unaﬀected by whether the evolution is chaotic or not.

In any case, a and b being “free for the purposes at hand” does not imply p(ν

a, b) = p(ν).

|

A correlation p(ν

|

a, b)

= p(ν) does not “determine” a and b (or ν), but only describes a

statistical relationship between a, b, and ν.

Bell also argues[3, Chap. 12] “that the disagreement between locality and quantum me-

chanics is large — up to a factor of √2 in a certain sense”. The standard assumptions

discussed here are given as analytic equalities, which are unable to elaborate the “certain

sense”. Beables are so general, however, that it is unclear how no-correlation, no-nonlocal-

conspiracy, no-conspiracy, and no-contextuality could be given as physically justiﬁable limits

on inequality (note that the standard assumptions are problematic just as analytic equalities

between probability distributions, since such a relationship cannot be supported by exper-

imental statistics, nor, it seems, by analytic argument). Bell’s argument is also weakened

7

6
by the classical limit being either 2 or 4 (Bell omits to mention the latter), depending on

whether we accept all the standard assumptions, with 2√2 as the intermediate quantum

mechanical limit.

Suppose that instead of taking ν to be complete information, we take c to be complete

information, so that ν is null. Then we can derive, in place of equation (10), again supposing

that equations (7), (8), and (9) are satisﬁed,

M(a, b, c) = A(a, c) B(b, c).

(19)

Now to derive equation (14), we have to be able to change a

a′ without changing c (or b)
b′ without changing c (or a), with the “no-conspiracy” assump-

→

and be able to change b

→

tion playing no rˆole. Nonlocality aside, requiring this is the “no-contextuality” assumption.

Note that it has been argued before that Bell inequalities have little or nothing to do with

nonlocality[8], but are instead a consequence only of an assumption that quadrivariate prob-

ability distributions can be introduced for incompatible observables, which can be avoided

only by introducing contextual classical models.

In quantum ﬁeld theory, the Reeh-Schlieder theorem[9] is typically thought very awkward,

yet the contextuality it implies is not taken to rule out quantum ﬁeld theory. Recall that

as a consequence of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem we cannot change a quantum ﬁeld state so

that the expected value of a quantum ﬁeld observable associated with Past(

A)

R

−

Past(

changes without changing the expected value of at least some quantum ﬁeld observables

Past(

R

It is unreasonable to expect noncontextuality of a beables model when we do not expect

it of quantum ﬁeld theory — to do so is to construct a straw man of a theory. If we insist

on a parallel of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem in classical statistical ﬁeld theory, we cannot

derive Bell inequalities for beables.

8

IV. THE NO-CORRELATION ASSUMPTION

Recall that the “no-correlation” assumption, equation (7), requires that there are no

correlations between the hidden beable λ and the hidden beables µ (that are not screened

oﬀ by ν, a, b, and c). There is no empirical way to justify this assumption, simply because it

is a condition imposed on observables that are by deﬁnition not measured. The preference

against correlations between instrument settings and hidden beables is only tendentiously

extensible to justify a prohibition against correlations between hidden beables.

Shimony, Horne, and Clauser[4] argue that

“even though the space-time region in which λ is located extends to negative

inﬁnity in time, ν, a, c are all the beables other than λ itself in the backward light

cone of this region, and µ and b do refer to beables with space-like separation

from the λ region”

to justify deriving equations (7), (8), and (9) from equation (2). This argument is precisely

to revert to Bell’s deﬁnition of local causality, equation (1) [with X∩ = c, ν; Xp = a;

XP = c, ν, a, λ]. To try to justify equation (7), using equation (2), we could write

p(λ

|

c, ν, a, λ, b, µ) = p(λ

c, ν, a, λ, b),

|

but it would be rather remarkable to depend on this equation, since p(λ

(20)

λ, Z) is trivially

|

equal to p(λ

|

λ) whatever Z represents, independently of any idea of local causality. From

the trivial equality (20) we cannot derive

p(λ

|

c, ν, a,

b, µ) = p(λ

c, ν, a,

b),

|

(21)

which is a consequence of equation (1) but not of equation (2). If we take the trouble to

distinguish between equation (1) and equation (2) as deﬁnitions of local causality, we can

hardly argue for equations (7), (8), and (9) like this.

Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s argument depends weakly on λ being associated with the

Past(

B), so that λ, ν, a, and c are all the beables in the backward

whole of Past(

A)

R

light-cone of Past(

−
A)

R
Past(

R

−

B). Let us consider, therefore, the slightly less general class

R

of beables models that satisfy equation (2) and for which also a probability distribution

p(at, bt, ct, λt, µt, νt) over non-hidden and hidden beables associated with a cross-section of

9

Past(

A) and Past(

R

B) at a time t determines the equivalent probability distribution at

R

later times. Such a beables model includes both deterministic and indeterministic models,

and both reversible and irreversible dynamics, but does not generally satisfy equation (1). If

we suppose that the cross-section is a space-time region of ﬁnite duration ∆t, we can allow

slightly more dynamical generality than would be allowed if we supposed the cross-section

to be a hyperplane. Such a class of beables models includes almost every model we would

usually think of as classical. Bell’s construction of models in which (a, λ) is a complete set

of beables associated with all of Past(

A) is something of a novelty.

At the time tM of the measurements in

B, and for a time τ∩ before the measure-

ment, there are no non-hidden beables ct or hidden beables νt. Suppose that actually ob-

served experimental statistics over (A, sA, B, sB) that violate Bell inequalities are adequately

modelled by a joint probability distribution p(A, sA, B, sB), where sA and sB are instrument

settings at time tM . Any probability distribution that has p(A, sA, B, sB) as a marginal

distribution is an adequate contextual beables model at time tM . A probability distribution

p(A, sA, B, sB) is not a quadrivariate probability distribution over incompatible observables,

as a probability distribution over (A1, A2, B1, B2) would be if it were constructed by post-

selecting values of A corresponding to diﬀerent values of sA and values of B corresponding

to diﬀerent values of sB, which would lead directly to Bell-type inequalities[8] without any

locality assumptions being necessary. A, sA, B, and sB are four mutually compatible ob-

servables that have to take speciﬁc values in an experiment (or in a number of experiments)
for us to be able to construct statistics corresponding to M(a, b, c), M(a, b′, c), M(a′, b, c),
and M(a′, b′, c) and hence to verify that Bell inequalities are violated by experiment.

by just measuring additional observables that are compatible with A,sA,B, and sB, in an

experiment for which Bell inequalities are not satisﬁed. For example, we could measure de-

tails of the thermodynamical states of whatever detectors we are using, replacing A by other

classical information, from which A can be derived, or we could replace sA by measurements

of geometrical details of the apparatus that is used to achieve varied polarizations, from

which sA can be derived. Since such a hidden beables model is derived from measurements

of an apparatus in which Bell inequalities are not satisﬁed, at least some of the assumptions

required to derive Bell inequalities for beables must not be satisﬁed for such a model.

At times before tM

−

τ∩, the set of non-hidden beables ct and hidden beables νt is nonempty

and increases as t refers to earlier times, and presumably the assumptions come closer to

being satisﬁed. At earlier times, however, there is no requirement that the assumptions be

violated by much, only that the totality of correlations be such that the dynamical evolution

will result in the violation of Bell inequalities at the time of measurement, so the constraint

on a beables model is insigniﬁcant.

V. A QUANTUM FIELD THEORY APPROACH

We have become used to describing the outcome of Bell violating experiments using a

state in a complex 4-dimensional Hilbert space, in which many detailed degrees of freedom

are integrated out.

If we agree, however, that non-relativistic quantum mechanics is a

reduction of quantum ﬁeld theory, as we almost always do, such a state is a reduction of

a quantum ﬁeld state in an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, which gives the values of

quantum ﬁeld observables associated with the regions

A and

R

B. If Bell inequalities are

R

violated by observables of a quantum ﬁeld state, we would certainly attribute the violation

to the experimenters’ ingenuity in ensuring an appropriate initial quantum ﬁeld state and

11

making appropriate measurements. For a quantum ﬁeld state describing an experiment that

violates Bell inequalities, the existence of nontrivial correlations between observables at large

space-like separations is precisely what singles out such states as special. A quantum ﬁeld

state that describes experimental correlations that violate Bell inequalities at the time of

measurement describes correlations in the remote past diﬀerent from those of the vacuum

state, but, as for a beables model, diﬀerences from the vacuum state may be diﬃcult to

detect in the remote past. In quasi-probability terms, we have to set up a Wigner quasi-

distribution over phase space in the past that evolves to a Wigner quasi-distribution over

phase space at time tM that violates a Bell inequality in the regions

A and

R

B.

R

For an equilibrium state of a classical statistical ﬁeld theory, correlations that violate

the assumption of statistical independence at space-like separation decrease more-or-less

exponentially fast with increasing distance, but non-trivial correlations at arbitrarily large

distances are possible for non-equilibrium states.

Indeed, absolutely any correlations are

allowed in a non-equilibrium initial condition — initial conditions of low probability of course

require greater free energy to set up, but we should not forget how diﬃcult it is to construct

an experiment that violates Bell inequalities. In a classical statistical ﬁeld theory, we have

to set up a probability distribution over phase space in the past that evolves to a probability

distribution over phase space at time tM that violates a Bell inequality in the regions

A

R

and

B, but this is no greater “conspiracy” than is apparent in the full quantum ﬁeld state

R

for the experiment. Hence the violation of Bell inequalities does not provide a justiﬁcation

for preferring quantum theoretical description over classical theoretical description.

Since the measurements required to violate Bell inequalities experimentally require only

that we measure compatible observables (A, sA, B, sB) in a single experimental context,

the quantum ﬁeld state is not ﬁxed uniquely by observation.

In particular, for a single

experimental context there is a non-empty set of quantum ﬁeld states that have a positive

semi-deﬁnite Wigner distribution and are empirically adequate, and we can adopt any of

these quantum ﬁeld states, or rather any of the associated positive semi-deﬁnite Wigner

distributions, as a classical model for the experiment.

The correlations we have discussed here commit us to very little. If we take an equally

empiricist approach to classical statistical ﬁeld theory as we take to quantum ﬁeld theory,

there just are correlations, which we don’t have to assume are caused by common (or any

12

other kind of) causes. Some correlations just are. This does not preclude asking whether

we can construct a model that explains the correlations, but this can reasonably be a future

enterprise. Classical physics has always taken initial conditions to be more-or-less explained

by earlier initial conditions, with no ﬁnal explanation being essential. Although of course

an explanation of why initial conditions are the way they are may well be more helpful, a

description of what the initial conditions are is a helpful enough beginning.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have ﬁrst described the previously identiﬁed diﬀerence between Bell’s deﬁnition of

a locally causal theory, which insists that correlations have to be the result of common

causes, and Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s deﬁnition, which does not. Secondly, in a signif-

icant change from both Bell’s account and Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s account, we have

identiﬁed the “no-contextuality” assumption, which eﬀectively extends the “no-conspiracy”

assumption far enough to make it unacceptable. Thirdly, in another signiﬁcant change from

both Bell’s account and Shimony, Horne, and Clauser’s account, we have identiﬁed the

“no-correlation” assumption, which changes the type of correlations that are prohibited to

include correlations between hidden beables.

Bell accepts[3, Chapter 12, last paragraph] that “A theory may appear in which such

conspiracies inevitably occur, and these conspiracies may then seem more digestible than

the non-localities of other theories”, but concludes “But I will not myself try to make such

a theory”. For those who would construct hidden-variable models, a theory of such models

must include one or all of conspiracies, correlations, and contextuality in a principled way.

With the extra ﬂexibility oﬀered by denying the several assumptions identiﬁed here, it

seems more reasonable to try, at least if we allow ourselves to use the resources of classical

statistical ﬁeld theory (in contrast to using only the classical mechanics of a small number

of particles, where the correlations needed are not very natural). Quantum ﬁeld theory

gives us a simple and eﬀective way to proceed, by looking for all quantum ﬁeld states that

describe our knowledge of a complete experiment, and accepting only those quantum ﬁeld

states that have a representation as a positive semi-deﬁnite Wigner distribution.

To temper the localism of this article, repeating the caution given in the introduction,

13

there are reasons for thinking that beables models must be nonlocal, particularly Hegerfeldt

nonlocality[1, 2], but the violation of Bell inequalities can be modelled adequately by local

beables.
