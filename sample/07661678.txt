Summary: By using the Onsager principle as an approximation tool, we give a novel derivation for the
moving ﬁnite element method for gradient ﬂow equations. We show that the discretized problem has the
same energy dissipation structure as the continuous one. This enables us to do numerical analysis for the
stationary solution of a nonlinear reaction diﬀusion equation using the approximation theory of free-knot
piecewise polynomials. We show that under certain conditions the solution obtained by the moving ﬁnite
element method converges to a local minimizer of the total energy when time goes to inﬁnity. The global
minimizer, once it is detected by the discrete scheme, approximates the continuous stationary solution in
optimal order. Numerical examples for a linear diﬀusion equation and a nonlinear Allen-Cahn equation
are given to verify the analytical results.
