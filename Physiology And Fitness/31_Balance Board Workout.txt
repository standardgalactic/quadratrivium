Hi, and in our homework series today, we're working with a balance board.
Now this could be a balance board like we have here, simple one could be a core board
or maybe a bosu.
The idea is we're working with an unstable surface.
Now the beauty of that is that it really forces you to engage the core muscles to control
your balance.
Now remember that core strength we talked about before, the idea of that is if we develop
the strength here that will allow us to be more effective with our limbs and you'll really
see that in this kind of workout today.
It's a great total body workout, it's also working on what we call proprioception.
Now within the joints, you have joint receptors, we have the golgi tendon organ, we have the
stretch reflex, we touched on those before when we talked about muscles and joints.
Now what they'll do is detect the movement, maybe the speed or the angle that the joint
is moving through and cause contractions to control that movement.
Now the beauty of that is if we train for that, then what we'll do is actually reduce
our risk of injury as well as at the same time getting a cardio effect, getting a toni
effect which sounds pretty good to me.
And the theory is that working on balance boards, we actually end up recruiting 20% more muscle
fibre so we're going to get an even better workout than you would do on a flat surface.
However, if you're not used to this, then take your time at first.
The way we're going to work today, a whole range of exercises, fumbling around in my
pocket for a stopwatch because we're going to do this in circuit style today.
So the guys and I are going to work on one minute of each exercise and then we're going
to have a rest of about 15, 20 seconds, 15, 20, we're still negotiating that depending
on how hard you work.
But the idea is for that minute, try and kind of get started, feel your way into the exercise
and then certainly for the next 30 seconds, really try and pump it out a bit, okay?
Important before you do any workouts, you've got to have a warm up, I'm sure you know that
now.
So anything that involves clean shoulders, the wrist, something like the guys are doing
now, a little bit of marching on the spot, just to get the temperature up slightly before
we start.
Okay, so are we ready with our first exercise?
So let's put one foot on the front of the board, careful how you get onto the board
and one foot towards the back, okay?
Now our exercise, just get a little practice, is forwards and backwards, yeah?
Let's just get a little feel for that, yeah?
So you're running on the spot, but you're tilting forwards and backwards on that board.
Are we set?
Are we ready guys?
Can I get a minute?
Go.
Can I get a witness?
And away we go.
Get into the rhythm, keep it going, pump the arms, forwards and backwards, try and control
that movement.
If you lose your balance, that's okay if you have to reset yourself, but be aware now
of pulling in the abdominals tight, there's a little bit of tension in the glutes, you're
really trying to control what's going on in the trunk, pulling through the waist, keep
going, keep going, you'll be pleased to know we're nearly halfway there, come on, come
on, come on.
You'll hear me panting in a minute, that's not special effects, that will be me panting,
keep going, keep going, keep going, we're halfway there, yeah?
Keep it going, keep it going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
If you lose your balance, that's okay, you can reset yourself, we've got another 15 seconds
keeping and you weren't stopping them where you keep going and you see this tilt, forwards
and backwards.
You can see we're working through the legs, we're clearly getting a cardio effect last
10 seconds, but what we're also doing here is really challenging the smaller muscles,
these joint receptors in the ankles to control that movement and take a quick rest there,
well done, well done, quick rest, get a deep breath, get off the board, get back on the
terra firma for a second, get ready for your second exercise, which, guess what, is just
the opposite of what you've just done.
Okay, I'm resetting, other foot on the front, are we ready?
Now be aware, you may have a difference from one side to the other, so start off slowly,
let's go, we're running forwards and backwards, he says, struggling to get started, I think
mine's just stored, and away we go, forwards and back, yeah, pumping one arm and the other,
up we go, forwards and back, get into that little running motion, running on the spot,
forwards and back, you've got your left leg forwards this time, or if you had the left
leg forwards, get the right one this time, make sure it's opposite, and away we go, get
pumping, get pumping, get pumping, fabulous, keep going, you're halfway there already,
take some deep breath, how you're running, keep your abdominals in tight, try and keep
the straights doing here, fabulous form, chest lifted, here's one I prepared earlier, fabulous
form, well done, keep those arms moving, we're getting the heart rate going, but we're working
into the legs, and also now we're challenging the small joint receptors here, training them
to get used to responding to those different angles, we've got five more seconds, let's
keep going guys, keep going, keep going, keep going at home there, and take a quick rest
there, well done, well done, step off your board, we're moving on to a little bit more
of a toning exercise now, not so much cardio, get your breath back on this exercise, we're
going to squat, so be careful how you do this, one foot on the side, one foot on the other
side, now ideally for the squat, we're going to stay balanced, yeah, we're going to stay
balanced in the middle, but you might find that you'll drift from one side to the other,
if you can try and set yourself in the centre, let's reset the clock, can I get a minute,
let's go, now what you might find when you're doing this is as you squat down, lifting
the arms forwards, will help with the balance, you see that little shake going on there,
what's going on is, the muscles are trying to respond to this extra challenge of balancing,
remember I said about a 20% extra muscle recruitment, get into a good rhythm, and keep going with
it, if you lose your balance and it goes to one side or the other, that's okay, just
reset yourself, try and stay in the centre of where you go, so fabulous exercise, because
clearly we're working into the front of the thigh, into the back of the thigh, the hamstrings,
into the glutes, sprinting on the spot, I think you've got a faulty one, keep going, and reset
yourself, it starts to shake, don't worry, but also what's happening here, really pulling
in tight through the abdominals, if you don't keep the trunk strong, you are going to fall
all over the place, it's only 10 seconds, you'll be pleased to hear, keep going, keep
going, and down you go, working into the front and back of thighs, into the glutes, it's
a whole body workout, and step off and take a rest there, well done, well done, how you're
doing at home, remember easy to get a hold of these little balance boards, so keep a
look out for them at the sports shop, you've got another few seconds, we're going to change
to another exercise now, lunging off the board, so you're going to put your right foot in
the center of the board, and we're going to try and keep it balanced this time, left foot
is up close, all you're going to do is take it behind, put it on the ball of the foot
lunge down, and bring it back up, it's a rear lunge, yeah, nice and deep, are we set, let's
go, step back, squat down and up, now try and keep this front foot, if you can, balance,
don't let it tilt to one side or the other, the arms are working as well into this lunge,
keep it going, keep it going, beautiful, take it right back, bring it right up to the
front, down and then up to the front, good, and down, good, further back, good, and up,
down, good, keep it going, keep it going, seeing how we're having to work now on this
balance here, try not to let this tilt, we're halfway there guys, does that foot go further
back, apparently not, and back, good, put it on the ball of the foot at the back, bend
the knee down to the floor, good, come on, we've got 15 seconds, I'm going to join and
get my money to work, and up, and up, come on, come on, only 10, you can do this at home,
let's go, up, up, this is killing me, only joined in halfway through, and take a little
rest there, well done, well done, give the legs a shake, get off the board, just in case
you don't guess what's happening next, get a breather, and swap legs, left leg on the
board, it's in the centre because we're going to try and keep it balanced this time, start
with the foot by the side, what your right foot's going to do, just get a little practice,
just go back, onto the ball of the foot so you can drop down, keep your hips square,
don't let this knee twist, and then step up, okay, let's go, start nice and easy for the
first few, get used to the movement, keep your chest lifted, remember it's all about
your core strength, keep your abdominals in tight, down we go, good, keep it going, good,
does it go further back, reach that foot further back, chest lifted, good, reach the foot right
back, good, keeping that foot balanced on the front, the board trying not to let it tilt,
come on we're halfway there, let's do some work, come on, it's easy for me to do anything,
come on, lunge, and up, lunge, and up, take the pace up, come on, let's burn some calories,
and down, and down, let's tone the hips, and the thighs, good, come on, I want to say buns
of steel but that's because I'm a child of the 80's, I don't know if that means anything
nowadays, and down, can I get just a couple more please, come on we can do this thing,
you can do this at home, and take a little rest there, well done, well done, you know
what else is legs burning, good work, good work, good work, so remember the beauty this
is, not only are we getting that toning, we're getting a cardio effect, trust me, so we're
burning some calories, but also we're working this proprioception, this agility skill that's
really useful in developing, if you're a sports performer, but particularly for reducing risk
of injury, so we're going to lunge off the side now, so same setup, get your right foot
on the board, get it in the centre, get ready, start close, and now you're going to go for
a side lunge, so you're going to step the foot out, but point the toe and the knee slightly
outwards when you go down, this kind of movement's not too good for us, and this certainly isn't,
so it's pointing slightly outwards, and the knee will go down that way as we lunge, step
back in, yeah, out, and back in, tall, okay, are we good to go, save yourselves, we're
off, come on let's go team, and down, good, get into the rhythm, try and keep this foot
balanced, don't let the board tilt to one side or the other, try and keep it in the
centre, that's the challenge, good, out, and out, how we doing, lunge it out, use the arms
in opposition, let's go, out, and back, good, beautiful, nearly halfway there, and good,
perhaps not so wide, just go a little lower, and down, a little bit quicker, come on let's
pick up the pace now, how you doing at home, pick up the pace, good, out, out, come on,
you weren't slowing while I was over there were you, I know that happens, out, we've
only got 20 seconds to go, come on team, give me that lunge, bend the knee, abs in tight,
pull in here, pull in here, chest lifted, we've only got 10 seconds, come on let's pick
up the pace, out, and out, how you doing at home, hope you're still with us, last couple
of seconds, last one, and take a rest there, well done, well done, get a deep breath, keep
the feet moving, anybody feeling anything yet, I do hope so, and just in case you hadn't
guessed, we're going to swap over to the other leg, so you're going to put your left foot
on the board, you're going to make sure it's in the center, yeah, try and find that balance
point right away, just get used to that balance point, what we don't want on this is we don't
want it tilted one way, or the other, we're trying to control it, keep it in the middle,
start close, just get a little practice first of all, the left foot's on, so your right
foot's going to step out, remember the knee and the toe points slightly outwards for this,
so that we can get that lunge and then back in, yeah, we're trying to avoid this, we're
trying to avoid going over on the ankle, so point it slightly out, out it goes and down,
step up, chest lifted, all the time, abs are in tight, waist is pulled in, are we set,
good to go, I think I'm more than 20 seconds there, but I'll let you off though, you can
owe me some, okay, are we set, you ready at home, let's go, lunge and up, right leg out
and back, come on, keep that balance in the center, on your balance board, on your bosu,
core board, whatever it is, keep that foot in the center, don't let it tilt to the side,
that's the challenge, should feel some work going on in the lower leg here, should also
feel some work going on here, here, in the glutes, but more than that, pull in here,
abdominals tight, keep going, good, fabulous, keep the head up, can we sink a little lower
into that lunge, down, we're over halfway there you'll be pleased to know, oh let's
pick up the pace, good, come on, come on, good, nice and deep, yeah, the more bend we're
going to get through this knee, the more work we're going to do through the quads, through
the hamstrings and through the glutes, that's what it's all about, come on, come on, perfect
pins, yes, come on, only five seconds, five seconds, stick with us at home, you can do
this, good, come on, come on, smile and take a quick rest there, well done, well done,
brilliant, how did you do on that, so I'm changing slightly, let's go for a slightly
easier exercise this time, give you a chance to get your breath back, so what we're going
to do this time is step either side of the board, be careful how you get on and all we're
going to do here is run on the spot from side to side and literally let it touch down, yeah,
so we're working through that range of movement in the ankle, yeah, okay, are we good to go,
let's get running, side to side now, so remember at the top we ran forwards and back, I'm running
side to side now, yeah, use your arms in opposition, now the challenge here is to keep your abdominals
in tight and to keep it fluid, can we keep going side to side, can you prevent it from
tilting you forwards and backwards, yeah, I did that deliberately by the way, come on,
let's go, can we pick up the pace, we are supposed to be running, come on, come on, pick up the
pace, let's go, let's go, we're halfway there, good, side to side, let's get some movement
through that ankle, see this work going on here, forcing those little joint receptors
to detect what's going on and then cause the muscles to contract to control it, yeah, it's
speeding up those nerve messages that are going through what's called a neural arc, actually
it doesn't go right up to the brain, it just goes from here, it picks up that angle through
the nerve fibres, it goes to the lower spine, to the spinal cord which effectively obviously
is to the brain and then that message comes back down, quickly contract to get me out
of that position, keep going, keep going, a few more seconds and if we can increase
the speed of those neural messages, we're going to reduce our risk of injury and take
a rest there, well done, well done, good work, okay, now this one you will be able to get
your breath back because this is not so cardio, a little bit more about toning on this one
but if you can pick up the pace that would be great, we're going to work for some twists,
we're going to really get into the obliques now and this will help you to understand how
core strength is important for translating the power, the strength from your upper and
lower body, it forms this integration and the key to that is something we talked about
in the lower spine lecture, we talked about the thoracolumbar fascia, the sheath at the
lower back there because so many different muscles attach to that, in particular the
transversus abdominis and the internal obliques, they're our key core muscles but also what
happens is from below the hamstrings, the glutes indirectly will attach to it and then also
the lats from above, so actually this link between your upper and lower body comes through
here which is controlled by here, so what we're going to do here is try and use the
upper body and the lower body to help us twist side to side, yeah, we're trying to get that
twist from side to side, you're going to have to use your arms, you're going to have
to use your legs but to try and integrate that what you've got to do is keep the abdominals
in really tight, you will lose your balance on this one, just keep resetting yourself
and do as best you can, that was definitely more than 20 seconds, let's go, twist, try
and get into a rhythm if you can, twist, twist, side to side, good and twist, you know what
I was just thinking, if you've got this core board on a shag-pull carpet, you're going
to have a real job twisting, I perhaps should have mentioned that, twist, come on, twist
side to side, how we doing, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, both feet
on, you weren't cheating them were you, beautiful, how is it every time I look they've stopped,
I hope you're still going at home, keep going but don't worry that will happen, particularly
with this kind of training, balance training, remember we talked about the principles of
fitness, keep going, you only begin to progress when you get near to your limits, so if you're
at that boundary where you're starting to lose your balance, that's good because that's
where it begins to develop, yeah, keep going, you've only got another 14 minutes, I don't
know what happened now, I must have counted that wrong, I'm just kidding, you've got about
5 more seconds, keep going, keep going, you're doing what, look, just as we get to the end
you've perfected it, I'll let you run a few more seconds because that looks good, fabulous,
take a quick rest there, well done, well done, well done, okay you'll be pleased to know
this gets, that's a tough exercise but really good at getting that kind of integration from
your upper to your lower body and hopefully you can really feel like you're doing some
work around your middle there, particularly the obliques at the side, so okay we're going
to change it slightly now, you're going to put your right foot on the board again for
me please and we're just going to do a wood chop, so we're going to take the left foot
out to the side, not too wide, but this one, now the key here is to get this twist and
control the movement, obviously we've got to control the tilt forwards, backwards, side
to side but also now we're going to get some rotation here, so be careful of the knee,
we don't want it to drop in, it's not designed to do that, so all we're going to do here
is to lift the hands up and turn and as we go down here, twist, come onto the ball of
the foot on the left, drop down and back up and down, so the idea is we're chop, chop
and up and chop, so see how we're getting the twist and the twist there, but what we're
trying to do here is balance, okay let's get into a good rhythm, begin nice and easy and
then we'll take it from there, okay and let's go, twist and lift, twist and lift, abs are
in tight and again this is one of those exercises, now that you've just done that twist, where
you're linking the upper body working with the lower body and to do that effectively,
like any tennis or golf player will tell you, you need to keep your core engaged, pulling
the tummy button towards the lower spine, drawing in through the waist, keep it going
and down, beautiful and twist and again this is a whole body workout, did you slide like
mine, be careful with that and twist, beautiful, see this whole body working, upper body, through
the middle through that twist, down to the legs, fabulous, see how we're working on
that balance, try and keep that board balanced, try not to let it touch down at the side,
that's excellent and down, good and also we're getting that little tummy work through the
legs as we're squatting and lifting and hold it there, well done, well done, the rest,
if you want me surprised to know the next exercises, we'll flip it across to the other
side, okay, so don't forget if at any time you need to grab some water you can always
do that in these little breaks in between, okay, left foot's on now, right foot out to
the side, okay, let's set ourselves up for the chop, get ready, hands are up and let's
go, down and lift, twist, so you're getting this twist on the board, you're also trying
to balance it, don't let it top out, boom, good, make sure you're getting that twist
on your right foot, what we don't want is this knee to bend inwards, about the first
20 seconds, get used to the movement, then can we start to take up the pace, let's go,
down, now if you remember a golfer or a tennis player will be using this movement quite dynamically,
so we can pick up the pace a little bit, that's me trying to hint that you two should go fast
and you're at home, okay, let's go, of course that's easy for me to say well I'm just watching,
but come on, you can do this, bend the knee, good, good, beautiful, look at that twist
through the, and you can see how this relates to playing golf, yeah, maybe to playing tennis,
you can see this movement, five more seconds, you can't do either of those sports without
a strong core, and take a quick rest there, well done, well done, good work, tricky exercise,
but great because it's employing lots of muscle groups, which gives us a good calorie burn,
okay, we're going on to a squat and a knee lift, right foot on the board first, okay,
there we go, again we're trying to keep the balance in the center, you may find that it
bottoms out on one side or the other, but try and keep that balance if we can, foot to the side,
quite close, now remember for your squat, we decided we're going to bring the hands forward
slightly, lift the knee, squat, lift the knee, can we keep that balanced when we lift the knee,
try not to let it touch down on one side or the other, so go a little slowly for the first
20 seconds and then see how you do, let's reset, 20 seconds, squat and lift the left knee,
let's go, squat, lift, squat, lift, abdominals tight, let's get a good squat, if you're sitting
down on a chair, push the backside out behind, keep the abdominals in tight, keep going,
there's that little hinge of the hip, see how my upper body comes forward, but it's not a rounding
of the spine, it's a hinge from the hip forwards, forwards, down, lift, down, let's go, down and lift,
all that's 30 seconds, I think it's time to pick up the pace and down and lift, you did hear me say
pick up the pace then didn't you, and lift, down, good, beautiful, beautiful, keep the upper body
chest lifted, tight here, pull in, pull in, fabulous, really working through those abdominals,
but also now really working into that lower limb here, really working on the balance,
on that proprioception remember, last few seconds and take a rest there, well done, well done,
well done, you're not going to be surprised to know what comes next, if you need water,
now's a good time, but make it quick, you're still only a few seconds from that long rest,
okay, we've got the left foot on, remember try and find the center, make sure it's balanced,
get a couple of practice goes first, squat, lift, try and keep balance, don't let this bottom out,
squat, abs in tight, beautiful, so I don't know about you, I think we're ready to go,
squat and lift, squat, up, squat, beautiful, squat, up, fabulous, abs in tight,
squat, keep this balanced in the center, try not to let it bottom out, up,
arms can work in opposition to the legs if you wish, if you're feeling super comfortable,
which I'm not, I don't know why I'm doing this, you can take your hands out of it
and lift, keep going, we're halfway there, down, good, give me a good squat, good,
out to the side on that squat, beautiful, good, how you doing at home, keep going,
slightly different kind of workout, but you can see where we're going here, come on,
I can hear some puffing and panting, that's a good sign, how you doing at home, make sure you're
keeping that balance in the center, make sure you're getting nice and low on the squats,
the more bend you get through that knee, the more work we're doing through the legs, through the
buttocks, that's what it's all about and take a quick rest there, well done, well done, well done,
that's your squats, take a quick breath, okay, so we're going to move on now and take that exercise
slightly, we're getting close towards the end, so we're sort of getting into the home straight,
so it's going to get a little tougher now, but we need our sprint for home, so we're going to
go for a kick and a touch on the board here, so this is quite a toughie, you are again going to
try and keep the board balanced, but you might find you get a tilt one way or the other, but this
is what's going to happen, you're going to take a kick, touch the board, kick, touch the board, kick,
and if we can get to a rhythm, kick in, touch in, and ideally if we can keep that elevated
rather than bottomed out, get a few practice ones first, where's the key to the balance,
it's all just here, are we ready, and away you go, your right foot's on, kick with your left,
touch with your left, left, left, try if you can to keep the board in the center, not bottomed out,
don't let it tilt one way or the other, fabulous, let's go and kick, chest up when you kick,
and down, good, touch the board, good, abs in tight, and remember that touch on the board,
can we pick up the pace, when you touch the board, don't round the spine, bend the knees, hinge from
the hip, from the hip, we're over halfway, come on let's pick up the pace guys, come on, it's not
really a question, how you doing at home, you should be feeling this now, come on, last 15,
touch, try and keep that board balanced, and remember it's tough, you will bottom out on one
side or the other, you've just got to try and keep it in the center, it will get better, good, last
few seconds, last couple, and well done, well done, take a quick rest there, give your legs a shake,
get back on terra firma, we're on to the other side, not far to go now, not far to go now,
actually I'm lying, we're not even halfway yet, no no no, come on, let's switch over to the other
side, okay so remember what we're doing here, left foot on, you're going to take a little kick
forwards with the right, touch down with the right, kick with the right, down with the right,
kick and touch, yeah okay, I think we're good to go, up, kick, touch, kick and touch, remember
it's a challenge here, you've just got to try your hardest to keep that balance if you can,
kick and down, kick and down, kick and down, now some of you may have done this exercise,
keep going, on terra firma, but once you start doing it on this unstable surface,
suddenly becomes a whole different exercise, kick and down, good, bend those knees a little bit
to get down to the board, kick and down, give me a little kick and down, that's it, fight that
balance and that's good, remember if you start to lose your balance, you're on the edge, you've
got to your boundaries and that's where you'll improve, so stick with it, we've only got 20
seconds to go, are you looking at the clock then, desperately, I'm keeping it hidden, come on, come
on, you can do this at home, keep going, keep going, it's only a minute, what's a minute, come on,
in a New York minute, come on let's go, beautiful, kick, give me that kick and down, kick like you
mean it, give me a martial arts kick, there's only one second to go, quick going in, brilliant and
take a quick rest there, well done, well done, well done, okay good work, you'll be pleased to know
we're going to get down on the floor now for a little press-up work, so if you want to take a
moment to get a quick sip of water that's okay, I'll show you the next exercise, so for the
press-up exercise and we're going to go on our knees for this one to be sure, to make sure that we
can get the full movement in on this exercise, I'll show you at first the ball from the front
so you can see what I'm doing, so what I'm going to do is take the hands wide on the board, I'm on
the knees for the press-up, but as we go down I'm going to twist the press-up and back up and then
guess what, the other side and then back up, so you get that little twist as you go down and again
here the difference, your normal press-up it's not going to move, so you're just working the chest,
you're working through the front of the shoulder, working through the triceps, but now because
it's moving you've got all this extra work going on around the shoulder girdle, those rotator cuff
muscles we talked about in the earlier lectures, I've got to really control that movement on the
shoulder, okay, let me just show you sideways on, what we need to be aware of even in this kneeling
position is your abdominals are pulled in tight, yeah, we don't want the backside sticking up,
we don't want the hips dropping down, keep that natural normal curve in your lower spine and as
we go down we twist and then on the next one we twist the other way, so start nice and slow
and then we'll get the pace going, so are we ready, abdominals in tight all the time
and away we go, start a nice easy pace and up you go, beautiful, alternating side to side,
you're on your knees for these press-ups because you've got a minute to go and believe it or not
you've already done 10 seconds that one quickly didn't it, didn't that go quickly, come on keep
going, this is real sweat you know, this is not makeup, good work and down, keep it going, good,
20 seconds, come on, now you're breathing as long as you're breathing that's fine, truth is it
often works better to breathe in on the way down and breathe out on the way up so and then
blow it out and it makes it dynamic as you press up, so we've got value added training here, we've
got a little bit of work for your chest, shoulders and triceps because we're doing press-ups but
what we've also got here is this work for your core muscles and also the muscles around the
shoulder girdle, the rotator cuff, those four muscles that are vital, how are we doing, keep it
going guys, don't lock out your arms at the top of the press-up, there's only five seconds to go,
come on, come on you can do it, I'd love to join you and take a quick rest there, well done, well
done, well done, were you looking at me for help then, I can't help you, that was fabulous, okay so
press-ups, wow we've only got really one more exercise to do, so we're going to do a little dip
here and you may have seen tricep dips, beauty of this it really gets into a problem area backs of
the arms, you may have done this before on a chair on a step platform but actually once you do it on
here it's a much greater challenge, so if you take yours behind you so that your feet are this way
towards me and I'll show you sideways on where we're going with this one, so we're going to sit
in front of the board, hands on at the back, find your balance point, which is not easy, you're
going to bend the elbows to lower your backside down to the floor and then press back up, it's only
a small movement, careful not to lock the arms out, keep the abdominals in tight, don't push the hips
forwards, just drop down and press up, so it's only a small movement, so we can get a pretty good
pace going for that minute, yeah, all of this is bending the elbows and pressing back up but we've
got that extra challenge now, so as well as working the triceps, we're working again around the
shoulder girdle, are we good to go, so one minute it's your last minute, let's go, okay, dip and
press, beautiful, keeping that balance, don't let it bottom out one side or the other, excellent
stuff and keep it going, keep it going a little bit quicker, so working into the triceps but also
here what we've got to do is keep the abdominals pulled in tight, good and we've got that work
going on around the shoulder girdle to stop it from wobbling and let's go, like yours was there,
did you do that just to show them, that was good, that was good timing, just as I said
wobbling we got a wobble, perfect, we're halfway there, come on, come on, just think how good
your triceps are going to look, you'll be wearing t-shirts all through the winter as well as the
summer to show off your fabulous arms, keep going, we've only got, seems to be 45 seconds, I must
have got that wrong, I know it's something wrong with this clock, keep going, we've only got 10
seconds, come on you can do this, last few seconds, keep going guys and take a quick rest there,
sit yourselves down, well done or just fall down, okay, we're going to have a little cool down now,
I'd advise you to do some mobilizing exercises just like you did at the warm-up, some little kind
of mobilizing, some circles, little tilts, little rotations, nice and easy and then we're going to
move on to some stretches, some static stretches because now you're warm, this is the best time
to do that work, so we're going to look for holding those stretches for about 30 seconds,
if you can't remember those basic stretches, take a quick look at the flexibility section in this
series, that was a great balance board workout, I hope you enjoyed it.
