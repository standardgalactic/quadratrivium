4 related injuries affect a third of people over 65 each year, resulting in around 450,000
admissions to hospital and more than 19,000 fatalities, adding up to an estimated annual
bill of an incredible $28.2 billion in the United States alone. Among older adults, by
that I mean 65 or older, falls are the leading cause of death from injury and also the most
common cause of non-fatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. The New York Times
in 2010 reported that most of these falls are caused by a decline in balance. The good
news is that according to Dr Thurman, who was quoted in the article, the preponderance
of evidence shows fairly convincingly that strength and balance training can reduce the
rate of falls by up to 50%. As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services revised
its National Physical Activity Guidelines to include a recommendation for the elderly
to include balance exercises as part of their overall physical activity regime.
There can be many causes of falls but fortunately there are a number of simple preventive exercise
measures you can take that can significantly reduce your risk of becoming another one of
those statistics. In addition to carrying the potential to preserve life, balance training
is an essential component in rehab after many lower limb, pelvis and lumbar spine injuries
and is vital for elite sports performers across a wide range of disciplines.
So the purpose of this lecture is to investigate what do we mean by balance and to investigate
the exercises that will help to maintain our independence and improve our quality of life
from today and for the rest of our lives. Now this is a very interactive lecture so
if you're not dressed for activity you might want to press pause and go change now. If
you have a fitness ball or a medicine ball and a mat then get those as well. If not we'll
be able to make do with a chair, a stool, a towel and you'll be good to go. You'll see
why later. Now balance is required in nearly every daily activity although it's one of
those things we often take for granted. Rising up from your chair, picking up your bag, taking
your first step as you set off walking, they're all impossible without stabilizing your body
beforehand. Now we're all familiar with balance in terms of standing on one leg from playground
games when we were children but balance is what corrects you if you stumble on uneven
ground or if someone bumps into you. So clearly then it can be viewed as either a static or
a dynamic equilibrium. You may remember that's something we talked about in the skill related
fitness components right back in our first lecture. It can also be conscious as in bracing
yourself against a stiff wind or in preparation for contact in a sporting activity. It's dependent
upon three key processes within the body namely the visual, the vestibular and the somatosensory
systems. Now the visual system provides information to your brain regarding where the body is
in space also how fast it's moving and the immediate environment particularly feeling
back detail of possible obstacles by using depth perception and peripheral sight skills.
The vestibular system refers to the senses in the inner ear that respond to the position
of your head causing your brain to send a message to your body to write itself when
you're off center for example when you stumble. And then finally there's somatosensory system
that relies upon the senses in the skin and the muscles to relay information to the brain
regarding pressure, touch and the position of your limbs. As an example this would be
key in stimulating you to engage your core muscles that will be absolutely necessary
when stepping out into that strong wind we mentioned earlier. Now the combined efforts
of these three systems is what's referred to as proprioception, the ability to detect
your position in space and to correct it as necessary. Now sadly falls do occur as we
mentioned earlier particularly in the elderly and can often lead to a downward spiral so
let's begin by looking at a number of factors that cause falls. Clearly the first one is
poor balance. It's the most important and it can be caused by a slowing of the reflexes
due to aging process. This happens within the brain but also weaker muscles and possibly
certain conditions for example arthritis that lead to reduced mobility and slower movement.
Restricted vision that again is an age-related issue. This can compound the previous point
resulting in a diminished appreciation of potential trip hazards. History is involved.
People who have fallen previously are actually at greater risk of a repeat. Usually as a
result of the fall introducing a fear factor that leads to being less active and so vital
movement skills are lost and due to the use it or lose it principle that we're familiar
with in fitness it's important to stay active. Medical conditions in addition to balance issues
related to certain conditions for example Parkinson's disease, low blood pressure, low glucose
levels as a result of perhaps as a byproducts of other conditions may lead to dizziness and again
that leads to an increased risk of falling. There are environmental factors from curbs to
fire hydrants to changes of road surface, power leads, rugs, pets in the home. We face a huge
number of potential hazards every day. Now some prescription drugs for a number of conditions
are also known to carry side effects that include dizziness so again that's a risk factor.
What's important to remember though is that falls might not just result in the obvious
such as injury, pain, possibly even disability but could also have a psychological impact through
loss of confidence, fear, maybe even guilt. Worse still can be the social consequences of
possibly having to be moved into residential care and the financial implications of that.
The depression perhaps with losing contact with friends perhaps for all or any of these reasons
one out of three adults age 65 and older falls each year but fewer than half talk to their
healthcare providers about it. Now exercise however can resist or at least soften the influence of
the list of fall factors. We mentioned practicing movement skills will enable the body and mind
to maintain the complex level of integration required to function optimally. Regular exercise
affords an opportunity to repeatedly work on challenging and therefore improving your balance
confirming non-use rather than age is the biggest culprit. Before we investigate the type of exercise
that is beneficial in this domain it seems prudent to spend a short while thinking about how we
measure our balance capabilities since the better our static and particularly dynamic balance then
surely the less likely we are to run into problems. It would be good to have a benchmark then so that
we can see you know how much work we need to do. So here are a few tests that you can try at home
in fact you can try them right now so why don't you join me if you stand up we can try this one
together. To measure your static balance we have what's called the tightrope stance so what I'm
going to ask you to do is to simply put one foot directly in front of the other that's all we're
going to do we're going to stand in that position here we go some of you may already beginning
to feel so we're looking to hold that position without any swaying of the trunk or shuffling of
the feet yeah now if we can't hold that position for at least 10 seconds that could be indicative
of full risk yeah now I would try that both ways around as well
you may find that on one side as opposed to the other you have a little better balance
now similarly something I mentioned earlier standing on one leg again we'll try it off both
sides and our target here is for five seconds if we can't hold this for five seconds again
that's a little bit of a risk factor we need to be aware of yeah so there's static but what about
dynamic well actually what if we take that tightrope and take it on the walk the tightrope walk
hopefully none of you have been dragged out of your car by a policeman and made to do this
but you may be familiar with this tightrope walk test and another test as simple as it sounds is
to do a 360 standing yourself and just turning yourself around because believe it or not some
people will find that a little difficult to get themselves around in as few steps as possible and
to to fix themselves at the center and the time there we're looking for is three seconds if it takes
much longer than three seconds again that could be a risk of fall so how did you do with those
tests now remember don't feel disheartened if you found them a little challenging they'll improve
with practice and I'll show you how to do that later instead right now I'd like to flag up a
really useful tip in predicting balance problems before they arise so alerting you to an impending
issue for yourself or someone close to you and hopefully stimulating you to take preventive action
I'm talking simply about walking as your gait your walking pattern can reveal signs of potential
balance issues before they arise so here's what to look out for a shortened stride length if you
notice short strides that's something to look out for a slower pace a wider walking stance because
clearly opening the stance is to try to correct that balance an uneven rhythm a lowered foot lift
if we're beginning to drag the feet again that's a sign of we're losing that bit of contact with the
floor now the many different reasons that act individually or in combination to cause falls
lead to the fairly obvious hypothesis that improving balance is going to take a mix of training
techniques in order for an exercise program to be successful an effective regime needs to incorporate
exercises that focus on posture coordination reaction speed strength and flexibility now
additionally cardiovascular sessions will have an indirect positive effect by adding weight
management and so walking cycling swimming are particularly encouraged to highlight the importance
of balance training the american college of sports medicine in a 2007 report by a panel
of leading medical experts established balance training is essential in the prevention of a
range of injuries and we all know that prevention is better than cure our target outcomes from an
exercise regime to reduce the risk of falls are as follows we want to increase mobility in the lower
back the hip the knee and the ankle we want to enhance strength in the deep postural muscles
also the calves the quadriceps the hamstrings the gluteals the hip abductors lifting the leg out
and the adductors lifting the leg in as all of these directly affect balance we want to improve
the ability to change speed and direction but smoothly fluidly we want to develop a smooth
transference of body weight in functional activities functional activities are everyday
type movements now be aware before setting out on this exercise journey you'll find that you're
excellent at certain exercises average at some and downright dreadful at others but this is primarily
due to your previous activity experience but it could also be influenced by old injuries and
maybe even your confidence levels so begin by performing exercises at your own pace and within
a comfortable range of movement both of these parameters can be incrementally increased as and
when you're ready to do so so some of the exercises in this workout will be new to you allowing yourself
time to get used to them and if possible try to use a mirror to check your technique when performing
each exercise this way you'll be able to view your posture ensuring it's correct and so you can be
confident that you'll soon be seeing the benefits so I'll now show you a number of exercises to
help you to achieve the goals we spoke of earlier giving you three levels of each so you can pick
your appropriate starting point it'll also give you an opportunity to progress as I hope you'll
look to do as you start to find the exercises easy ideally you need to be warm before attempting
these exercises so if you wish to press pause I'll wait a second while you take a brisk walk on the
spot for about three or five minutes or maybe walk up and down the stairs a few times you know
alternatively you could try the most basic version of each exercise with me but then replay the
progressed version once you've warmed up we're aiming for 12 repetitions of each exercise but if
that's difficult do as many as you can do and commit to building up that score once you can do
12 repetitions with ease it's time to move on to the next level now for these balance exercises
I'm going to use my little fitness toys here although don't worry although I suspect some of
you've got these kind of toys sitting around in the garage getting dusty you can improvise
a chair I'm going to take it you've got a chair the menacing ball could actually be any kind of
ball okay any kind of ball dumbbells if you've not got dumbbells have you got a couple of tins of
beans a couple of bags of sugar something that's got a little bit of resistance you can use really
the fitness balls fairly essential although easily accessible can get them in most decent stores and
pretty cheap and the mats could be a mat could be a towel so if you've got these pieces of kit
brilliant if not don't worry too much so the exercises I'm going to take you through a range
of exercises that are going to work the whole body particularly the core muscles the deeper
abdominal muscles these are vital to control the movement of the trunk so what I'm going to do is
walk you through remember three levels we talked about for each exercise your job is to try and
pick which levels suit you but also you then have the opportunity to progress now what I'm going to
do is just show you a couple of repetitions of each exercise get you started and then your job
is to press pause and do 12 repetitions of each exercise now I'm going to trust you to do that
so let's start first of all with our power hop so the aim here is to control our movement side to
side so I'm going to start very simply with a step touch so hope you're going to join me with this
we're going to take a step to the side and back that's all we're doing I did tell you it was going
to start nice and easy didn't I but just in case you didn't get a thorough warm-up this will help
you continue that warm-up so first of all all I'm looking to do is to control this lateral movement
yeah now this will involve certain elements of deceleration as I go into this position
and you'll notice I'm taking a little bit of a sink on each side okay that's important we now move
it on to the next level the next level being a hop and touch so now I've got to work a little bit
harder to control that lateral movement to stop me toppling over so the abdominals are in tight
and you'll see there's a little sink here now I'm not looking to jump too high I'm looking to move
side to side okay our third level to make that a little bit more difficult and now I want more of
a sink it's from side to side and again I'm looking to control that momentum with a little sink as
soon as you land I want you to bend the knee soften the ankle to lower yourself down into that
little hot position before we move on so pick your level you're looking for 12 repetitions press the
pause and away you go okay so I'm moving on next exercise the lunge so you'll have seen this exercise
fairly common exercise first of all to help us with our balance I'm going to ask you to take
your feet hip width apart yeah I'm going to take one foot back rested on the ball of the foot my
lunge position now is simply lowering down okay so let me show you that from the side what I'm
looking to do here is to keep your abdominals in tight keep your head up keep your chest lifted
we're sinking down this knee towards the floor and back up yeah be careful not to twist this back
leg I want to make sure this is straight if it's this way around I'm afraid we start to bend into
a position that the knees not designed to do it's a hinge so what I'm asking you to do here
is straight down and back up okay so that's our first level that's the easier level we can progress
that by lifting the rear foot now there's an important point here I'm going to bring in my chair
make sure it's a sturdy chair an important point here is the degree of flexion through the knee
so a basic the most basic lunge squat will always be designed to make sure the knee doesn't bend
too much okay however the truth is that our knees do bend all the way down okay and raising yourself
from a chair or particularly from a sofa if it's an old battered sofa it's probably lower than this
you'll find that the knee is actually bent a little bit further than that 90 degree angle and the truth
is if you don't ever exercise down here you'll never have any strength down there so it's important
and this is the golden rule to work to your comfortable range of motion okay so that means
you go as far as is comfortable for you and that's a little bit of trial and error to find that
position so this exercise make sure we step quite a way away from the chair resting the foot at the
back now still the same rules apply make sure on the ball of the foot make sure the hips chest
shoulders are all square in the same direction and the exercise now becomes a little bit harder
you can see there's a little bit more balance work here on this front leg but also now you'll see
I'm getting much more bend through here now the great thing about that is it's making my quads
hamstrings at the back of the thigh and the glutes work a little bit harder
okay so that's your second level can we take that a step further yes we can let's move this out of
the way and bring in the ball so our third level now on the lunge is to put the rear foot on the
ball so now we're going to have to work a lot harder particularly around the hip to control this
movement so again I'm setting myself up for my lunge and I'm resting the ball of the foot at the
back so now I've got all of this to handle so you might want to take the hands out to the side
as you go down for your lunge position okay there we go so that's a little bit more difficult
so have a go find your level 12 repetitions on each leg and the important thing now is
is you swap from one side to the other be aware if one side's stronger than the other one side's
got better balance you'll find that we often have that disparity once you've found your weakness
and it's important to work on that side so press pause 12 repetitions I'll be here when you get back
so we're moving on now to a squat and press now the squat since you're on both feet doesn't seem
that difficult and exercise in terms of balance but we can work with this so careful how you pick
up your weights um remember dumbbells if you've got them if not tins of beans bags of sugar feet
are about hip width apart so first of all I'm asking you to squat so this exercise all I'm
asking you to do is bend the knees imagine you're sitting down so a couple of tips first of all
make sure that you keep your abdominals in tight and I'll show you what that looks like from the
side what we've got to be careful of here is not letting the abdominals drop down keep them pulled
in tight so that we've got a nice natural curve through the lower spine also be aware that the
dumbbells might start to fall forward so we keep the shoulders back and down we keep the abdominals
in tight as we sit down into our squat and bearing in mind what we just said you can go as low as is
comfortable for you okay golden rule is if it hurts don't do it so we go as low as is comfortable
make sure we're balanced in terms of pressing through the right and the left foot and also
what I'm going to ask you to do is to just lift up your big toe as you go down that helps you to
press the weight through the heels which makes sure we engage as the primary mover in this exercise
the glutes okay pressing down and lift beautiful so that's the first level nice and easy okay so
we can take that a step further taking the dumbbells up all I'm going to ask you to do this time is at
the same time simultaneously we squat and press okay we squat and press be careful not to lock
out the elbows at the top yeah but also you'll find this puts a greater challenge on the abdominals
the deeper abdominals that are controlling the position of the lower spine yeah so you'll really
need to pull in tight here as we sit down into that squat a great exercise okay so that's our
second level progressing that one step further let's lose one of the dumbbells be careful how you
put it down don't let it go too far away what I'm going to ask you to do now is to take one leg
opposite hand like so and what we're going to do now is as we squat down let's see I've taken
this one out for balance we press up now you'll find with this that you won't be able to squat
quite as low as before yeah but this is a really great exercise for the quads for the hamstrings
for the glutes and in fact there's some research at San Diego University that showed that the best
exercise you can do for the glutes is the single leg squat so if the buns of steel you're after
this is the exercise okay abdominals are in tight pressing up at the same time so you need to pick
your level decide which level you're doing 12 repetitions remember with that last exercise
that's 12 on each leg away you go and we're moving on dumbbells again both dumbbells this time
I'm going to ask you to put one foot forward one behind resting on the ball of the foot keeping
the weight on your front foot so three levels to this exercise all I'm going to ask you to do there
is to keep the elbows slightly bent okay to raise lateral raise working into the shoulders
beautiful elbows are slightly bent lifting to just slightly higher than shoulder level
about head height okay that's our easiest level okay we can change that slightly by at the same time
lifting the rear leg as we lift now important point here we need to be careful of the alignment
in the lower spine what may happen here is we start to get an exaggerated curve so I'm going
to ask you to take a slight forward body lean on this as you lift the leg behind so now we're
working into the shoulders but we're also now working into the glutes working into the hamstring
at the back and really working into those abdominals keeping them pulled in tight so like so and lift
so that's our second level taking that one step further we're now going to take a full forward
hinge the hinge is from the hip so be careful we're not rounding the spine so that natural
position with the abs in tight head lifted you drop the top of the head forwards so now
we're working into the back and shoulders with that lift working into the glutes as we lift the leg
really working into the abdominals now that is challenge to stop the hips from dropping down
yeah drop the top of your head forwards as we lift slow as better on these balance exercises
pick your level and I'll take 12 repetitions from you please
so we're moving on let's lose the dumbbells let's get a hold of the ball now just a little tip here
when you're using this foot fitness ball and sometimes particularly on a hard floor like this
it can slide around a little so this is where your mat or towel will come in really useful
okay so the ball first exercise here the challenge is we're working on an unstable surface yeah
so you'll notice straight away I've got all of this going on so that makes us work a little bit
harder around the lumbopelvic region to keep ourselves fixed first exercise is quite simply
and if you're not too sure about this keep the hands on the ball as well
it's just to walk yourself down until the shoulders are on keep the hips lifted and then walk yourself
back yeah that's all we're looking to do now we're trying to work against this wobble that's
bound to happen so try to keep yourself balanced you can and then back up that's our easiest level
yeah let's take that one step further and start to introduce the abs into the exercise
taking the elbows back all I'm going to ask you to do now is add a little sit-up just that little
crunch movement from there sitting up keep the elbows back don't throw the elbows forwards yeah
and remember that the abdominals here bring the ribs closer to the hips so a tip while you're
doing this exercise is try to imagine taking a spring and squeezing it together that's what
we're trying to do here sit up squeeze the ribs towards the hips and you'll really feel that working
there and also we've got this challenge of balancing ourselves because we're now on this
unstable surface now just to take that one step further and I'm warning you this one is quite a
difficult exercise we do exactly the same thing we're down on the ball we're doing the crunch
but we're going to lift one foot off the floor at the same time so wish me luck I might need it
so all I'm asking you to do here is as you crunch lift one foot off the floor at the same time
trust me I'm making this look easier than it is
as we sit up lift one foot at the same time that's enough I'll quit while I'm ahead however
you're going to do 12 repetitions pick your level it's better to make sure you've got the
exercise correct rather than move on to the next level the time to move up as we said earlier
is when you can do 12 repetitions of that exercise easily that's when we move on to the next level
now still with the ball we're going to flip over and do a little bit of press-up work now first of
all what I'm going to ask you to do is to just hold the position so what we're looking for here is a
static contraction through the deeper abdominal muscles but also we start to move now into the
shoulder girdle so we're working the smaller muscles around the shoulder blade so rather than
the actual shoulder muscle the deltoid that we worked earlier we're working the rotator cuff
muscles there are four small muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade so this is what we're going to
do the first exercise holding the ball on the knees make sure the weight is forwards and all
I'm asking you to do here is hold that position yeah what we're trying to do is work against gravity
which is pushing your hips down now that's not a good position to be in because that's going to
put a lot of strain on the lower back so what we're looking to do is build up the time we can hold
this position if your fear of stuff starts to sag in the middle that's the time to walk back out of
it take a rest yeah our next level if you find that easy is to just go from there down into our
press-up and back up the hands are slightly to the side of the ball but you can see now we're
working again to this be aware on the press-ups but when you come up to the top we don't lock out
the elbow okay puts a little bit of strain on the tendons around the elbow so I'm going to ask you
to keep them slightly soft when you come up to the top if there's a little bit of this shaking
going on that's good that's what we're working against yeah and just in case you haven't guessed
what's coming next we move on to the full press-up onto your feet keep the abdominals in tight
chest onto the ball and back up so you can see now as well as working through the normal
press-up position for the chest we're now working around the shoulder girdle to stabilize that position
okay so pick your level give me 12 repetitions please
okay so these last two exercises on the mat are slightly different in that rather than looking
for our 12 repetitions we're looking to build up the time we can hold the position I'm going to put
you in now what we're doing here is challenging mainly gravity challenging your core muscles to
maintain good alignment through the spine so the first exercise is what we call a t-stand
I'm going to ask you to place this hand down this knee this foot all I'm looking for here
is to get a nice long position from the top of your head down through your tailbone down through
your heel yeah now what gravity is trying to do is drop us down here or worse still make us twist
our challenge here is to make sure we stay sideways on so what should happen is your hips
chest shoulders should stay square to me okay I'm going to lift this arm now we've got a little bit
of balance work going on here through the shoulder girdle to hold that position now most of you will
find that fairly easy so I'm going to move on to the next level which is take that foot off you can
see what the challenge is here the hips are going to want to drop down we're going to work through
particularly through the obliques through the waist to hold that position okay remember we're
looking to build up the time and if you're finding that easy the next challenge is can we hold that
position but drop the top arm down and lift it up and the challenge there is that you'll want to
rotate so you've got to try and keep that fixed through the middle abdominals in tight pulling
through the waist keep the hips lifted until we lower the arm and we lift it up okay so do you
want to have a quick go at that the aim is just hopefully we can get for about five seconds and
then gradually begin to increase that as we go through time but pick your level first of all
so the final exercise this is really getting into the abdominals
the challenge again as we said is can we maintain that position nice long spine so
we're going to sit up tall first of all you can use the knees pull yourself up nice and tall
abdominals are in tight shoulders are backing down can we keep that position as we lower backwards
yeah what we're trying to avoid is that rounded position there okay sit up tall lower backwards
take the arms out but pull the shoulder blades back and down yeah and we're looking again to just
hold that position when it starts to get a little uncomfortable or you start to shake
we'll come up and you can ram down just to release out of it okay so that's our basic level can we
move that up a level sit up tall first of all at the top of your head drop backwards the chin's in
what I'm going to ask you to do now is to raise one leg and again we're looking to hold that position
when it begins to shake if you begin to round bring yourself back up okay and just in case you've
not guessed where this is going our final level can we go back lift the arms is there any chance
we can lift both legs if you're breathing nice and constant are they shaking hand back down
and take a little rest there okay so there's a range of balance exercises and remember just like
any other exercises they're going to take some practice the key here is to pick your level you
have three different levels for each exercise start with the easier one when you get to the
point where you can do 12 repetitions quite comfortably that's the time to move on to the
next level takes a little bit of practice be aware you may have difference from right to left
but you'll find over time that your balance will begin to improve and you're getting a good workout
for the whole body at the same time as we established right at the start of this presentation
balance training is not just for the elderly to reduce the risk of falls but also an important
component of the recovery from injury process interestingly some pioneering work in this area
involves using the we as games include challenges to both static and dynamic balance so can actually
help with rehabilitation in fact one article in usa today called this we have hospitals in
minneapolis and edmonton have integrated into physical therapy programs and even injured american
soldiers in germany are trying this technique in addition to practicing the exercises i showed
you earlier i strongly recommend trying tai chi as a 2004 study published in medicine and science
in sports and exercise suggested this will result in enhanced balance capabilities and
functional ability in older persons the research showed a clear reduction in the number of falls
recorded by the subjects in the six months following the introduction of tai chi training
when compared to a group who performed just stretching exercises now whilst the research
is we're not sure of the precise reasons for the benefits achieved if you refer back to the list
of the desired outcomes from this sort of activity we discussed earlier it becomes obvious why tai chi
satisfies all of these and so it's no surprise that it brings results
to conclude our workout balance training i was just stress the danger of associating it with only
the injured the elderly and elite sports people repeating my comments on the high value of it
as a preventive tool to keep you healthy whatever your current age and activity level
so remember balance training will not just help you to ski better or to roll a blade better but
it'll also improve basic functions such as walking down the streets and standing up ensuring
that the amazing machine that is your body keeps working as it should for life
