Processing Overview for Wolfgang Gross
============================
Checking Wolfgang Gross/Most research in AI is a waste of timeï¼Ÿ.txt
1. **Bitter Lesson in AI**: Rich Sutton's blog post from 2019 emphasizes that methods in AI which leverage computation effectively are far more impactful than those that do not. This is particularly evident after 70 years of AI research, where computational scaling has proven to be a defining factor in progress.

2. **Computation and Scaling**: The success of transformers in NLP and AlexNet in computer vision showcases the importance of leveraging computation for breakthroughs. Moore's Law and the potential of quantum computing, neural computing, and distributed systems are often discussed when considering the future of computation.

3. **Evaluating Research Methods**: Lex Friedman suggests that AI papers should include a section on how their methods would scale with a 10x to 100x increase in computation over the next 5-10 years. This is a good way to ensure research is not only relevant today but also in the future.

4. **The Role of Conjectures**: Alan Turing's conjectures are valuable as they guide researchers towards meaningful lines of inquiry. A similar overarching conjecture, as proposed by Rich Sutton, can help navigate what constitutes meaningful research in AI.

5. **Historical Patterns**: Looking at the history of AI reveals patterns that can inform current and future research. It's important to recognize which approaches have been consistently successful and why.

6. **Courage in Research**: Pursuing noble ideas requires courage, especially when it means challenging established norms or popular opinions. Ryan Holiday emphasizes that courage is about committing to ideas with integrity.

7. **ML Reproducibility Challenge**: Initiatives like the ML Reproducibility Challenge encourage researchers to investigate the reproducibility of papers published at top conferences, particularly for students in AI. Such challenges can have a meaningful impact on the scientific community by promoting rigorous and reproducible research practices.
