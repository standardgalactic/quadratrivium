00:02.480 --> 00:04.560
Do you know who this man is?

00:04.560 --> 00:06.000
You probably don't.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.800
But he was once considered one of the most influential Americans in history.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.720
One journalist called him, quote,

00:12.720 --> 00:16.880
the most famous American economic writer and, quote,

00:16.880 --> 00:24.160
author of a book which probably had a larger worldwide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.840
Well, more on this man in the book he wrote in a few seconds.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.560
But first, let's go to a random field.

00:30.560 --> 00:36.160
Oh, hey, I'm Mr. Beat and I'm just sitting here in a random field touching grass.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.000
The man you saw in that picture, his name was Henry George

00:40.000 --> 00:45.840
and the book, which ended up selling millions, is called, make sure I get this right,

00:45.840 --> 00:51.600
Progress and Poverty, an inquiry into the cause of industrial depression's end

00:51.600 --> 00:55.280
of increase of wants with increase of wealth, the remedy.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.320
Goodness, what a title that is.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.760
A title so long that I lost my train of thought.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.800
Where am I?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.720
Why am I sitting in a random field?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.680
Oh, I remember.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.880
So I previously released a video about every major type of tax.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.760
Oh, there's that video now.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.360
You better hurry up and catch it before it's gone.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.560
Uh, it's gone.

01:22.640 --> 01:29.120
Anyway, in that video, I said there is a tax called the single tax

01:29.120 --> 01:31.920
by the legendary Henry George.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.840
I'm going to make a future video about this,

01:33.840 --> 01:39.760
but I think the single tax on land is something worth reconsidering again.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.840
The more I learn about it, the more I like it.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.400
Well, this is that future video, okay?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.720
And actually, I should have been more specific.

01:47.280 --> 01:53.600
Henry George's single tax, the only tax that he believed should exist,

01:53.600 --> 01:56.720
was a land value tax.

01:56.720 --> 02:02.960
To help me explain it, let's bring in an economist and fellow YouTuber Jacob Clifford.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.920
Thanks, Mr. Beat.

02:03.920 --> 02:04.640
I appreciate it.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.080
Thank you all very much.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.440
A land value tax is a tax on unimproved land.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.880
So just the land, not any buildings or improvements.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.400
And that's one of the reasons that makes it-

02:14.400 --> 02:17.520
But before he goes into more details about a land value tax,

02:17.520 --> 02:21.440
let me tell you who this Henry George fellow was.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.560
After all, if you're watching this, you probably don't know anything about Henry George,

02:26.560 --> 02:30.320
even though he used to be kind of a big deal.

02:34.400 --> 02:41.520
Henry George was born in Philadelphia on September 2, 1839, the second of 10 children.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.760
His dad, Richard George, published religious books and was a devout Episcopalian.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.480
Henry was, uh, not so much.

02:50.480 --> 02:56.640
His dad forced him to go to the Episcopal Academy, but he hated it there, eventually dropping out.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.120
That didn't mean he didn't enjoy learning, though.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.760
He convinced his dad to hire him a tutor, and he still read a bunch,

03:03.760 --> 03:07.680
and even attended lectures at the Franklin Institute.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.960
For fun, he was particularly into economics.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.600
He read Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

03:13.600 --> 03:20.400
By the time he was 15, Henry had realized his parents were barely scraping by to feed the family,

03:20.400 --> 03:24.320
and he knew if he wanted to make some money, he must go out on his own.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.160
So he traveled the world as a cabin boy on a ship,

03:28.160 --> 03:31.120
which means he basically took care of the captain's needs.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.520
He got paid $6 a month.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.120
Instead of returning to Philadelphia after he got done working at sea,

03:37.120 --> 03:40.960
he went to San Francisco to first potentially seek gold,

03:40.960 --> 03:42.320
but after that was a bust.

03:42.320 --> 03:47.520
He worked as a typesetter, a wear and a rice mill, and a farm laborer.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.880
The job he kept coming back to was typesetter, though.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.560
Unfortunately, Henry rarely made much money.

03:55.280 --> 04:06.880
When he was 21, he met Annie Fox, an orphaned immigrant from Australia,

04:06.880 --> 04:08.800
and the two fell in love.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.320
Annie's uncle, who had been her guardian after her grandma died,

04:12.320 --> 04:17.760
didn't appreciate how poor Henry was, though, and didn't approve of the relationship,

04:17.760 --> 04:19.920
but they secretly got married anyway.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.840
Despite a happy marriage, the couple did struggle financially,

04:23.840 --> 04:27.680
even though they couldn't afford to feed them, they had four kids together.

04:27.680 --> 04:31.920
Henry George Jr., who later became a United States representative

04:31.920 --> 04:37.440
and wrote a biography about his father, Richard, Jenny, and Anna.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.840
Following the birth of Richard, times were so tough for the Georges

04:41.840 --> 04:44.880
that Henry often had a beg for food.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.520
He later recalled one story, quote,

04:47.520 --> 04:51.440
I walked along the street and made up my mind to get money from the first man

04:51.440 --> 04:54.320
whose appearance might indicate that he had it to give.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.960
I stopped a man, a stranger, and told him I wanted $5.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.640
He asked what I wanted it for.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.440
I told him that my wife was confined and that I had nothing to give her to eat.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.800
He gave me the money.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.880
If he had not, I think I was desperate enough to have killed him.

05:10.880 --> 05:17.600
Things began to turn for the better when Henry realized he wanted to be a writer in 1865.

05:17.680 --> 05:23.120
By that time, he had steady printing work for the newly created San Francisco Times

05:23.120 --> 05:26.720
and began writing political editorials for local newspapers.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.160
Even though Henry never went to college and had no formal training,

05:30.160 --> 05:32.960
his editorials became quite popular.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.240
And due to this, he got promotions at the Times.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.840
By the summer of 1867, he was the managing editor.

05:39.840 --> 05:46.800
In 1868, he left the Times to become managing editor of the bigger San Francisco Chronicle.

05:46.800 --> 05:51.600
Soon after that, he wrote his most influential article up to that point called

05:51.600 --> 05:53.840
What the Railroad Will Bring Us.

05:53.840 --> 05:58.640
It was a response to the first transcontinental railroad being completed,

05:58.640 --> 06:02.800
and while most everybody was excited about it, Henry was a bit more cynical,

06:02.800 --> 06:06.000
writing that the railroad would only benefit some people.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.080
He argued the railroad would kill small towns and small businesses while propping up already

06:12.080 --> 06:15.200
great cities and already huge corporations.

06:15.200 --> 06:22.640
Keep in mind that this was in 1868, decades before the populist movement.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.080
Henry's popularity as a writer only grew after that.

06:26.080 --> 06:30.480
While he passionately called for future populist reforms like the secret ballots,

06:30.480 --> 06:34.400
public ownership of certain natural monopolies, and the right to vote for women,

06:34.400 --> 06:38.720
he also thought free trade was way better than protectionism.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.080
Very nice.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.880
And he dabbled in politics, running for the California State Assembly.

06:44.880 --> 06:50.480
But was handily defeated by the, you guessed it, railroad industry.

06:50.480 --> 06:56.160
As Henry's editorials grew more popular, his family finally got out of poverty.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.200
But Henry wouldn't constantly stop thinking about poverty for the rest of his life.

07:07.600 --> 07:13.360
He had two aha moments that are literally the reason why I am making a video about him

07:13.360 --> 07:15.360
and his ideas today.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.600
The first happened in 1868 when he traveled to New York City.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.720
He was struck by the fact that those in poverty, in such a great city with great wealth,

07:24.720 --> 07:29.840
were apparently a lot worse off than those in poverty back home in California,

07:29.840 --> 07:32.320
a place with much less development.

07:32.320 --> 07:39.920
The second aha moment happened one day in 1870 when Henry sat on his horse overlooking San Francisco Bay

07:39.920 --> 07:48.160
after a dude told him that an seemingly unimportant acre of farmland nearby would sell for $1,000.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.120
Quote, like a flash it came over me, that there was the reason of advancing poverty

07:53.120 --> 07:57.360
with advancing wealth, with the growth of population, land grows in value,

07:57.360 --> 08:01.520
and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.

08:01.520 --> 08:06.240
Soon Henry wrote his first analysis of what he called the land question.

08:06.240 --> 08:13.440
In 1871, Henry helped found the San Francisco Daily Evening Post and he became its editor.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.760
This is when many first became exposed to his land value tax idea.

08:19.760 --> 08:27.360
However, he accumulated lots of debt with the Evening Post and his family ended up in dire poverty again.

08:27.360 --> 08:34.160
Fortunately for Henry, by 1876 he was now a minor celebrity and began giving speeches.

08:34.160 --> 08:37.760
He also still made some money as a freelancer of sorts.

08:37.760 --> 08:43.520
On September 18, 1877, he began to write his masterpiece book.

08:43.520 --> 08:48.480
The one I told you about earlier, you know, with the long title, yeah, that's the one.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.400
We'll just call it Progress and Poverty from here on out.

08:52.400 --> 09:00.000
He finished the book in March 1879 and supposedly dropped to the floor and wept like a baby after completing it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.040
Late one night.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.960
That sounds a bit dramatic, but maybe it happened.

09:04.960 --> 09:14.000
Anyway, by this time he and his family were living in New York City and that is where Progress and Poverty got published in 1880.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.440
And keep in mind at this time, he was 40 years old.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.560
That's my age.

09:18.560 --> 09:28.720
Well, the book didn't sell that well at first, but slowly but surely, thanks to word of mouth, it began to catch on, as did Henry George's reputation.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.720
He promoted the book in Europe.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.160
Spreading his solution for eradicating poverty and reducing extreme wealth inequality.

09:36.160 --> 09:45.120
Yep, the world was learning about his single tax on the value of land to completely replace the taxes the workers paid on their income

09:45.120 --> 09:47.760
and the taxes the owners paid on their capital.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.720
Little did he know.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.000
I've written papers on Little Did He Know.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.000
I used to teach a class based on Little Did He Know.

09:56.720 --> 10:01.600
I mean, I once gave an entire seminar on Little Did He Know.

10:01.600 --> 10:12.640
That he would literally ignite a gigantic social movement that was a major catalyst of not just the populist movement, but the entire Progress-O-Vera.

10:12.640 --> 10:19.520
Progress and Poverty sold millions of copies and eventually made Henry George a household name.

10:19.520 --> 10:24.880
And apparently at the peak of the book's popularity, and I read this from many sources,

10:24.880 --> 10:28.960
Henry George was the third most famous man in the United States.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.320
Right behind Thomas Edison and Mark Twain, of course.

10:32.320 --> 10:37.440
George's idea of a single land value tax became ridiculously popular.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.960
Actually, can I jump in here?

10:38.960 --> 10:40.320
Well, of course, Mr. Clifford.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.600
Okay, great.

10:41.600 --> 10:46.080
A land value tax is more efficient than other types of taxes.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.840
Taxes influence decisions.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.360
If we tax cigarettes, that's going to decrease smoking, which is good.

10:51.360 --> 10:56.960
But if you tax things that society actually wants, that's going to decrease their consumption and production.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.240
And that leads to something that economists call deadweight loss.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.320
Inefficient markets that are not produced in the quantity that society actually wants or needs.

11:04.320 --> 11:09.200
But since the supply of land is fixed, a land tax doesn't decrease its production.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.360
It doesn't cause deadweight loss.

11:11.360 --> 11:18.800
So sales taxes and excise taxes and even income taxes and corporate taxes can slow down the economy by discouraging production.

11:18.800 --> 11:24.080
But George argued that a single land tax would actually encourage and promote economic activity

11:24.080 --> 11:28.080
by discouraging people from hoarding land or just holding it for speculation.

11:28.080 --> 11:34.640
If you own huge tracts of unimproved, valuable land, a land tax will encourage you to either improve the land

11:34.640 --> 11:39.520
or sell it to somebody else that's going to improve the land by building houses or farms or factories

11:39.520 --> 11:42.880
or something else that'll generate enough money to pay for the tax.

11:42.880 --> 11:47.040
So in the end, all that land is used extremely efficiently

11:47.120 --> 11:51.600
and the land tax means there's tax revenue for the government to provide public goods and services.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.520
And George argued that that might be enough to provide universal basic income.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.960
Well thanks Mr. Clifford.

11:56.960 --> 12:00.320
Oh hey everyone, be sure to check out his YouTube channel.

12:00.320 --> 12:06.560
His videos were the main videos I had my students watch when I taught Econ in the classroom.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.280
Wait, you really forced your students to watch me?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.320
It's true.

12:10.320 --> 12:16.160
Anyway, in progress and poverty, George argued that a single land value tax was needed

12:16.160 --> 12:23.920
because most of the wealth created by social and technological advances in an industrial free market economy

12:23.920 --> 12:26.720
was actually owned by landowners.

12:26.720 --> 12:33.760
And many of those landowners had monopolies over markets through something called economic rent.

12:33.760 --> 12:39.040
Economic rent is basically income gained from controlling a limited resource.

12:39.040 --> 12:45.520
So even though these landowners did nothing to improve the land value, they still got the profit.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.600
And remember, this was land, a natural resource.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.040
It was there already.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.120
These landowners didn't create it.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.960
They were just benefiting from something they did nothing to help create, nor improve.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.040
In progress and poverty, George argued the game was rigged.

13:03.040 --> 13:08.480
And the only way to fix the game was not to tax the worker on what they earn

13:08.480 --> 13:11.600
because that would disincentivize them from working

13:11.600 --> 13:17.040
and not to tax the owner of capital through taxes on what they own or buy

13:17.040 --> 13:21.520
because that would disincentivize them from investing.

13:21.520 --> 13:27.280
To George, land was common property and everyone was entitled to it.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.160
But that doesn't mean he was a Marxist, though.

13:30.160 --> 13:30.720
Oh, no.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.840
George was a Georgist.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.240
George was fine with capitalism.

13:36.240 --> 13:42.800
He just wasn't a fan of rigged capitalism in which the landowners were essentially parasites.

13:42.800 --> 13:47.360
Because he thought everyone was entitled to the land, many of George's followers

13:47.360 --> 13:51.760
hesitated to even call a land value tax a tax.

13:51.760 --> 13:57.920
They preferred to call it basically rent paid to society in exchange for getting to

13:57.920 --> 14:03.440
exclusively use the land for whatever they wanted, while also compensating for the fact

14:03.440 --> 14:05.840
that others couldn't use it.

14:05.920 --> 14:11.200
By the way, uh, yeah, George's followers soon became known as Georgeus

14:11.200 --> 14:16.000
and George's whole economic ideology became known as Georgeism.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.880
Anyway, George's book and ideas became so popular that governments around the world

14:22.880 --> 14:24.160
got rid of all taxes.

14:24.960 --> 14:30.400
And that's why today we only have a land use tax.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.480
And we all lived happily ever after.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.440
The End

14:45.440 --> 14:46.160
Except no.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.000
No, not at all.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.960
What I just said, I was just making that up.

14:53.200 --> 15:06.320
You see, people who owned land, and this may be a bit surprising to you,

15:06.320 --> 15:08.960
didn't like the idea of a land value tax.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.240
Go figure, huh?

15:10.240 --> 15:16.000
Many people liked the fact that they could just let land sit there and it would automatically

15:16.000 --> 15:16.880
go up in value.

15:16.880 --> 15:24.080
In 1886, Henry once again gave politics an old try when he was recruited by the United

15:24.080 --> 15:27.520
Labor Party to run for mayor of New York City.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.040
However, he was up against the machine, aka the establishment.

15:33.680 --> 15:39.040
Okay, Tammany Hall, the powerful political organization that essentially controlled

15:39.040 --> 15:40.800
New York politics.

15:40.800 --> 15:46.000
Tammany Hall feared that if George won the election, politics in the city might be

15:46.000 --> 15:53.040
reorganized along class lines instead of ethnic lines, which is where Tammany got its power.

15:53.040 --> 15:59.360
Tammany Hall called George's supporters, quote, anarchists, nihilists, communists,

15:59.360 --> 16:01.040
and socialists.

16:01.040 --> 16:06.480
Well, George lost the election, but he surprised many with a strong second place finish.

16:06.480 --> 16:11.920
Not only that, but there is some evidence that voter fraud may have been involved.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.480
Just saying.

16:14.480 --> 16:18.640
His supporters were not even allowed to oversee the ballot count.

16:18.640 --> 16:24.640
Regardless, he did finish ahead of an obscure dude by the name of Theodore Roosevelt, and

16:24.640 --> 16:31.040
despite losing the election for the rest of his life, George's popularity only continued to grow.

16:31.040 --> 16:37.760
In 1897, he ran for mayor of New York City again, but just four days before the election,

16:37.760 --> 16:41.040
he suffered a fatal stroke that shocked the nation.

16:41.040 --> 16:47.760
His death made international headlines, and possibly as many as 200,000 people showed up

16:47.760 --> 16:49.280
to view his body.

16:49.280 --> 16:55.520
At the time of his death, Henry George was the most well-known economist around, and

16:55.520 --> 16:58.640
Georgism was arguably at its peak.

16:58.640 --> 17:03.760
And yet, I only learned about George and Georgism like three years ago.

17:03.760 --> 17:10.000
And as I researched for this video, I noticed that the man and his land value tax idea are

17:10.000 --> 17:12.640
more obscure than goat cheese on pizza.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.440
Why is that?

17:14.880 --> 17:17.360
Why did Georgism go out of style?

17:17.360 --> 17:20.080
Why did Georgism go out of style, huh?

17:20.080 --> 17:25.200
Well, first of all, in his later years, George was too much of a purist.

17:25.200 --> 17:30.000
He often refused to compromise on his ideals with other progressive reformers.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.480
Other progressive reformers didn't like how he was still okay with almost all capital,

17:34.480 --> 17:38.960
uh, existing, and how he rejected a strong role for government.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.120
They didn't like his opposition to public ownership of certain types of infrastructure,

17:43.120 --> 17:48.640
his support of free trade, and him being a gradualist versus trying to start a radical

17:48.640 --> 17:49.440
revolution.

17:49.440 --> 17:55.040
Overall, he frustrated fellow progressive reformers by not shutting up about a land

17:55.040 --> 17:59.760
value tax, thinking that was the only thing that could solve everybody's problems.

17:59.760 --> 18:04.400
But of course, there were also the landowners, and the speculators.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.200
Even today, much wealth is earned through owning land.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.560
And a land value tax threatens that.

18:12.560 --> 18:18.560
But more importantly, land speculators have tremendous power over the government and the

18:19.200 --> 18:23.600
media, and they would simply not get to make money anymore with a land value tax.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.560
Now, there are other reasons why Georgism faded out in the 1900s.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.920
World War I really hurt its momentum for starters.

18:31.920 --> 18:38.560
Another big thing that is probably not brought up enough by Georgia is that cars got way more

18:38.560 --> 18:44.560
popular during the century so that people could more easily travel longer distances to

18:44.560 --> 18:45.920
get to their land.

18:45.920 --> 18:51.360
Simply put, being able to get around more easily increased the amount of land available.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.280
See all this urban sprawl?

18:53.280 --> 18:57.600
That's because of cheaper land out on the fringes of metropolitan areas.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.560
And that's a big reason why Georgism became somewhat obsolete.

19:02.560 --> 19:08.560
Landowners have also been somewhat successful at other reforms to help the poor.

19:08.560 --> 19:14.720
Like welfare, which wouldn't you know it, also helps them out because this also helps

19:14.720 --> 19:16.560
their land value go up.

19:16.560 --> 19:23.840
But here I am on land in 2022, and there's been a renewed interest in Henry George and

19:23.840 --> 19:27.280
Georgism, especially with the younger folks online.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.720
What's up with that?

19:30.720 --> 19:37.120
Well, despite urban sprawl continuing to be a thing, land prices keep rising sharply.

19:37.120 --> 19:44.000
To a point now where many young folks are priced out, stuck as renters, maybe forever.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.520
The dream of owning a home to build up wealth is slowly fading away, so young folks are like,

19:51.520 --> 19:52.240
screw it.

19:52.240 --> 19:56.480
Let's revisit this land value tax idea again.

19:56.480 --> 20:02.000
You might be thinking, well Mr. Beat, if a land value tax is so great, why isn't there

20:02.000 --> 20:04.240
any place in the world that does it?

20:04.240 --> 20:08.880
And my response is, there are places in the world where they do it.

20:08.880 --> 20:14.480
It's not what Henry George envisioned, but variations of a land value tax exist around

20:14.480 --> 20:21.520
the world in places like Estonia, Singapore, Denmark, Taiwan, and even in parts of the United

20:21.520 --> 20:22.320
States.

20:22.320 --> 20:28.640
However, for a land value tax to truly be effective, it must be widespread.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.680
Otherwise, those not having to pay a land value tax will have an even bigger advantage.

20:33.680 --> 20:39.920
And if a land value tax was ever widely implemented, it likely just couldn't happen overnight.

20:39.920 --> 20:45.840
It would be incredibly unfair in the short term to property owners who paid a lot for

20:45.840 --> 20:51.760
their land, as many of them would likely see their land lose its value over time with a

20:51.760 --> 20:53.200
land value tax.

20:53.200 --> 20:58.480
What's fascinating to me is that George's politically isn't left wing or right wing,

20:58.560 --> 21:03.600
it's actually a good balance that unites liberty and equality.

21:03.600 --> 21:09.920
The more I learn about it, the more impressed I am with it, which is why it will never happen.

21:09.920 --> 21:33.760

Thanks again to Jacob Clifford for helping me out with this video.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.400
So there it is.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.040
I finally made a video about Georgism.

22:37.040 --> 22:40.400
And I did have a Georgist actually read over the script.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.480
So a shout out to Adam Monroe, an expert in Georgism.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.280
I found him on Twitter.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.480
You should follow him on Twitter.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.400
His Twitter handle is, wait for it, Tax Land, Not Man.

22:50.400 --> 22:55.200
Oh, and I hope I made it obvious that I am biased towards Georgism.

22:55.200 --> 22:55.920
I like it.

22:55.920 --> 23:01.440
So I especially, when I hear from you in the comments, if you are not a fan of Georgism,

23:02.080 --> 23:03.840
if you think Georgism sucks, let me know.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.960
And let me know why.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.280
Okay?

23:06.400 --> 23:07.440
Thanks for watching.
