2480	4560	Do you know who this man is?
4560	6000	You probably don't.
6000	10800	But he was once considered one of the most influential Americans in history.
10800	12720	One journalist called him, quote,
12720	16880	the most famous American economic writer and, quote,
16880	24160	author of a book which probably had a larger worldwide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.
24160	27840	Well, more on this man in the book he wrote in a few seconds.
27840	30560	But first, let's go to a random field.
30560	36160	Oh, hey, I'm Mr. Beat and I'm just sitting here in a random field touching grass.
36160	40000	The man you saw in that picture, his name was Henry George
40000	45840	and the book, which ended up selling millions, is called, make sure I get this right,
45840	51600	Progress and Poverty, an inquiry into the cause of industrial depression's end
51600	55280	of increase of wants with increase of wealth, the remedy.
56160	58320	Goodness, what a title that is.
58320	61760	A title so long that I lost my train of thought.
61760	62800	Where am I?
62800	64720	Why am I sitting in a random field?
66400	67680	Oh, I remember.
67680	72880	So I previously released a video about every major type of tax.
74000	75760	Oh, there's that video now.
77520	79360	You better hurry up and catch it before it's gone.
79360	82560	Uh, it's gone.
82640	89120	Anyway, in that video, I said there is a tax called the single tax
89120	91920	by the legendary Henry George.
91920	93840	I'm going to make a future video about this,
93840	99760	but I think the single tax on land is something worth reconsidering again.
99760	101840	The more I learn about it, the more I like it.
101840	104400	Well, this is that future video, okay?
104400	106720	And actually, I should have been more specific.
107280	113600	Henry George's single tax, the only tax that he believed should exist,
113600	116720	was a land value tax.
116720	122960	To help me explain it, let's bring in an economist and fellow YouTuber Jacob Clifford.
122960	123920	Thanks, Mr. Beat.
123920	124640	I appreciate it.
124640	126080	Thank you all very much.
126080	129440	A land value tax is a tax on unimproved land.
129440	132880	So just the land, not any buildings or improvements.
132880	134400	And that's one of the reasons that makes it-
134400	137520	But before he goes into more details about a land value tax,
137520	141440	let me tell you who this Henry George fellow was.
141440	146560	After all, if you're watching this, you probably don't know anything about Henry George,
146560	150320	even though he used to be kind of a big deal.
154400	161520	Henry George was born in Philadelphia on September 2, 1839, the second of 10 children.
161520	167760	His dad, Richard George, published religious books and was a devout Episcopalian.
167760	170480	Henry was, uh, not so much.
170480	176640	His dad forced him to go to the Episcopal Academy, but he hated it there, eventually dropping out.
176640	179120	That didn't mean he didn't enjoy learning, though.
179120	183760	He convinced his dad to hire him a tutor, and he still read a bunch,
183760	187680	and even attended lectures at the Franklin Institute.
187680	190960	For fun, he was particularly into economics.
190960	193600	He read Adam Smith and David Ricardo.
193600	200400	By the time he was 15, Henry had realized his parents were barely scraping by to feed the family,
200400	204320	and he knew if he wanted to make some money, he must go out on his own.
204320	208160	So he traveled the world as a cabin boy on a ship,
208160	211120	which means he basically took care of the captain's needs.
211120	213520	He got paid $6 a month.
213520	217120	Instead of returning to Philadelphia after he got done working at sea,
217120	220960	he went to San Francisco to first potentially seek gold,
220960	222320	but after that was a bust.
222320	227520	He worked as a typesetter, a wear and a rice mill, and a farm laborer.
227520	230880	The job he kept coming back to was typesetter, though.
230880	234560	Unfortunately, Henry rarely made much money.
235280	246880	When he was 21, he met Annie Fox, an orphaned immigrant from Australia,
246880	248800	and the two fell in love.
248800	252320	Annie's uncle, who had been her guardian after her grandma died,
252320	257760	didn't appreciate how poor Henry was, though, and didn't approve of the relationship,
257760	259920	but they secretly got married anyway.
259920	263840	Despite a happy marriage, the couple did struggle financially,
263840	267680	even though they couldn't afford to feed them, they had four kids together.
267680	271920	Henry George Jr., who later became a United States representative
271920	277440	and wrote a biography about his father, Richard, Jenny, and Anna.
277440	281840	Following the birth of Richard, times were so tough for the Georges
281840	284880	that Henry often had a beg for food.
284880	287520	He later recalled one story, quote,
287520	291440	I walked along the street and made up my mind to get money from the first man
291440	294320	whose appearance might indicate that he had it to give.
294320	298960	I stopped a man, a stranger, and told him I wanted $5.
298960	300640	He asked what I wanted it for.
300640	305440	I told him that my wife was confined and that I had nothing to give her to eat.
305440	306800	He gave me the money.
306800	310880	If he had not, I think I was desperate enough to have killed him.
310880	317600	Things began to turn for the better when Henry realized he wanted to be a writer in 1865.
317680	323120	By that time, he had steady printing work for the newly created San Francisco Times
323120	326720	and began writing political editorials for local newspapers.
326720	330160	Even though Henry never went to college and had no formal training,
330160	332960	his editorials became quite popular.
332960	336240	And due to this, he got promotions at the Times.
336240	339840	By the summer of 1867, he was the managing editor.
339840	346800	In 1868, he left the Times to become managing editor of the bigger San Francisco Chronicle.
346800	351600	Soon after that, he wrote his most influential article up to that point called
351600	353840	What the Railroad Will Bring Us.
353840	358640	It was a response to the first transcontinental railroad being completed,
358640	362800	and while most everybody was excited about it, Henry was a bit more cynical,
362800	366000	writing that the railroad would only benefit some people.
366000	372080	He argued the railroad would kill small towns and small businesses while propping up already
372080	375200	great cities and already huge corporations.
375200	382640	Keep in mind that this was in 1868, decades before the populist movement.
382640	386080	Henry's popularity as a writer only grew after that.
386080	390480	While he passionately called for future populist reforms like the secret ballots,
390480	394400	public ownership of certain natural monopolies, and the right to vote for women,
394400	398720	he also thought free trade was way better than protectionism.
398720	400080	Very nice.
401040	404880	And he dabbled in politics, running for the California State Assembly.
404880	410480	But was handily defeated by the, you guessed it, railroad industry.
410480	416160	As Henry's editorials grew more popular, his family finally got out of poverty.
416160	421200	But Henry wouldn't constantly stop thinking about poverty for the rest of his life.
427600	433360	He had two aha moments that are literally the reason why I am making a video about him
433360	435360	and his ideas today.
435360	439600	The first happened in 1868 when he traveled to New York City.
439600	444720	He was struck by the fact that those in poverty, in such a great city with great wealth,
444720	449840	were apparently a lot worse off than those in poverty back home in California,
449840	452320	a place with much less development.
452320	459920	The second aha moment happened one day in 1870 when Henry sat on his horse overlooking San Francisco Bay
459920	468160	after a dude told him that an seemingly unimportant acre of farmland nearby would sell for $1,000.
468160	473120	Quote, like a flash it came over me, that there was the reason of advancing poverty
473120	477360	with advancing wealth, with the growth of population, land grows in value,
477360	481520	and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.
481520	486240	Soon Henry wrote his first analysis of what he called the land question.
486240	493440	In 1871, Henry helped found the San Francisco Daily Evening Post and he became its editor.
493440	499760	This is when many first became exposed to his land value tax idea.
499760	507360	However, he accumulated lots of debt with the Evening Post and his family ended up in dire poverty again.
507360	514160	Fortunately for Henry, by 1876 he was now a minor celebrity and began giving speeches.
514160	517760	He also still made some money as a freelancer of sorts.
517760	523520	On September 18, 1877, he began to write his masterpiece book.
523520	528480	The one I told you about earlier, you know, with the long title, yeah, that's the one.
528480	532400	We'll just call it Progress and Poverty from here on out.
532400	540000	He finished the book in March 1879 and supposedly dropped to the floor and wept like a baby after completing it.
540000	541040	Late one night.
541040	544960	That sounds a bit dramatic, but maybe it happened.
544960	554000	Anyway, by this time he and his family were living in New York City and that is where Progress and Poverty got published in 1880.
554000	557440	And keep in mind at this time, he was 40 years old.
557440	558560	That's my age.
558560	568720	Well, the book didn't sell that well at first, but slowly but surely, thanks to word of mouth, it began to catch on, as did Henry George's reputation.
568720	570720	He promoted the book in Europe.
570800	576160	Spreading his solution for eradicating poverty and reducing extreme wealth inequality.
576160	585120	Yep, the world was learning about his single tax on the value of land to completely replace the taxes the workers paid on their income
585120	587760	and the taxes the owners paid on their capital.
587760	588720	Little did he know.
590320	592000	I've written papers on Little Did He Know.
593680	596000	I used to teach a class based on Little Did He Know.
596720	601600	I mean, I once gave an entire seminar on Little Did He Know.
601600	612640	That he would literally ignite a gigantic social movement that was a major catalyst of not just the populist movement, but the entire Progress-O-Vera.
612640	619520	Progress and Poverty sold millions of copies and eventually made Henry George a household name.
619520	624880	And apparently at the peak of the book's popularity, and I read this from many sources,
624880	628960	Henry George was the third most famous man in the United States.
628960	632320	Right behind Thomas Edison and Mark Twain, of course.
632320	637440	George's idea of a single land value tax became ridiculously popular.
637440	638960	Actually, can I jump in here?
638960	640320	Well, of course, Mr. Clifford.
640320	641600	Okay, great.
641600	646080	A land value tax is more efficient than other types of taxes.
646080	647840	Taxes influence decisions.
647840	651360	If we tax cigarettes, that's going to decrease smoking, which is good.
651360	656960	But if you tax things that society actually wants, that's going to decrease their consumption and production.
656960	660240	And that leads to something that economists call deadweight loss.
660240	664320	Inefficient markets that are not produced in the quantity that society actually wants or needs.
664320	669200	But since the supply of land is fixed, a land tax doesn't decrease its production.
669200	671360	It doesn't cause deadweight loss.
671360	678800	So sales taxes and excise taxes and even income taxes and corporate taxes can slow down the economy by discouraging production.
678800	684080	But George argued that a single land tax would actually encourage and promote economic activity
684080	688080	by discouraging people from hoarding land or just holding it for speculation.
688080	694640	If you own huge tracts of unimproved, valuable land, a land tax will encourage you to either improve the land
694640	699520	or sell it to somebody else that's going to improve the land by building houses or farms or factories
699520	702880	or something else that'll generate enough money to pay for the tax.
702880	707040	So in the end, all that land is used extremely efficiently
707120	711600	and the land tax means there's tax revenue for the government to provide public goods and services.
711600	715520	And George argued that that might be enough to provide universal basic income.
715520	716960	Well thanks Mr. Clifford.
716960	720320	Oh hey everyone, be sure to check out his YouTube channel.
720320	726560	His videos were the main videos I had my students watch when I taught Econ in the classroom.
726560	729280	Wait, you really forced your students to watch me?
729280	730320	It's true.
730320	736160	Anyway, in progress and poverty, George argued that a single land value tax was needed
736160	743920	because most of the wealth created by social and technological advances in an industrial free market economy
743920	746720	was actually owned by landowners.
746720	753760	And many of those landowners had monopolies over markets through something called economic rent.
753760	759040	Economic rent is basically income gained from controlling a limited resource.
759040	765520	So even though these landowners did nothing to improve the land value, they still got the profit.
765520	769600	And remember, this was land, a natural resource.
769600	771040	It was there already.
771040	773120	These landowners didn't create it.
773120	778960	They were just benefiting from something they did nothing to help create, nor improve.
778960	783040	In progress and poverty, George argued the game was rigged.
783040	788480	And the only way to fix the game was not to tax the worker on what they earn
788480	791600	because that would disincentivize them from working
791600	797040	and not to tax the owner of capital through taxes on what they own or buy
797040	801520	because that would disincentivize them from investing.
801520	807280	To George, land was common property and everyone was entitled to it.
807840	810160	But that doesn't mean he was a Marxist, though.
810160	810720	Oh, no.
812000	813840	George was a Georgist.
813840	816240	George was fine with capitalism.
816240	822800	He just wasn't a fan of rigged capitalism in which the landowners were essentially parasites.
822800	827360	Because he thought everyone was entitled to the land, many of George's followers
827360	831760	hesitated to even call a land value tax a tax.
831760	837920	They preferred to call it basically rent paid to society in exchange for getting to
837920	843440	exclusively use the land for whatever they wanted, while also compensating for the fact
843440	845840	that others couldn't use it.
845920	851200	By the way, uh, yeah, George's followers soon became known as Georgeus
851200	856000	and George's whole economic ideology became known as Georgeism.
856000	862880	Anyway, George's book and ideas became so popular that governments around the world
862880	864160	got rid of all taxes.
864960	870400	And that's why today we only have a land use tax.
870400	872480	And we all lived happily ever after.
872720	875440	The End
885440	886160	Except no.
888960	890000	No, not at all.
891200	892960	What I just said, I was just making that up.
893200	906320	You see, people who owned land, and this may be a bit surprising to you,
906320	908960	didn't like the idea of a land value tax.
908960	910240	Go figure, huh?
910240	916000	Many people liked the fact that they could just let land sit there and it would automatically
916000	916880	go up in value.
916880	924080	In 1886, Henry once again gave politics an old try when he was recruited by the United
924080	927520	Labor Party to run for mayor of New York City.
927520	933040	However, he was up against the machine, aka the establishment.
933680	939040	Okay, Tammany Hall, the powerful political organization that essentially controlled
939040	940800	New York politics.
940800	946000	Tammany Hall feared that if George won the election, politics in the city might be
946000	953040	reorganized along class lines instead of ethnic lines, which is where Tammany got its power.
953040	959360	Tammany Hall called George's supporters, quote, anarchists, nihilists, communists,
959360	961040	and socialists.
961040	966480	Well, George lost the election, but he surprised many with a strong second place finish.
966480	971920	Not only that, but there is some evidence that voter fraud may have been involved.
973120	974480	Just saying.
974480	978640	His supporters were not even allowed to oversee the ballot count.
978640	984640	Regardless, he did finish ahead of an obscure dude by the name of Theodore Roosevelt, and
984640	991040	despite losing the election for the rest of his life, George's popularity only continued to grow.
991040	997760	In 1897, he ran for mayor of New York City again, but just four days before the election,
997760	1001040	he suffered a fatal stroke that shocked the nation.
1001040	1007760	His death made international headlines, and possibly as many as 200,000 people showed up
1007760	1009280	to view his body.
1009280	1015520	At the time of his death, Henry George was the most well-known economist around, and
1015520	1018640	Georgism was arguably at its peak.
1018640	1023760	And yet, I only learned about George and Georgism like three years ago.
1023760	1030000	And as I researched for this video, I noticed that the man and his land value tax idea are
1030000	1032640	more obscure than goat cheese on pizza.
1032640	1033440	Why is that?
1034880	1037360	Why did Georgism go out of style?
1037360	1040080	Why did Georgism go out of style, huh?
1040080	1045200	Well, first of all, in his later years, George was too much of a purist.
1045200	1050000	He often refused to compromise on his ideals with other progressive reformers.
1050000	1054480	Other progressive reformers didn't like how he was still okay with almost all capital,
1054480	1058960	uh, existing, and how he rejected a strong role for government.
1058960	1063120	They didn't like his opposition to public ownership of certain types of infrastructure,
1063120	1068640	his support of free trade, and him being a gradualist versus trying to start a radical
1068640	1069440	revolution.
1069440	1075040	Overall, he frustrated fellow progressive reformers by not shutting up about a land
1075040	1079760	value tax, thinking that was the only thing that could solve everybody's problems.
1079760	1084400	But of course, there were also the landowners, and the speculators.
1084400	1089200	Even today, much wealth is earned through owning land.
1089200	1092560	And a land value tax threatens that.
1092560	1098560	But more importantly, land speculators have tremendous power over the government and the
1099200	1103600	media, and they would simply not get to make money anymore with a land value tax.
1103600	1108560	Now, there are other reasons why Georgism faded out in the 1900s.
1108560	1111920	World War I really hurt its momentum for starters.
1111920	1118560	Another big thing that is probably not brought up enough by Georgia is that cars got way more
1118560	1124560	popular during the century so that people could more easily travel longer distances to
1124560	1125920	get to their land.
1125920	1131360	Simply put, being able to get around more easily increased the amount of land available.
1131360	1133280	See all this urban sprawl?
1133280	1137600	That's because of cheaper land out on the fringes of metropolitan areas.
1137600	1142560	And that's a big reason why Georgism became somewhat obsolete.
1142560	1148560	Landowners have also been somewhat successful at other reforms to help the poor.
1148560	1154720	Like welfare, which wouldn't you know it, also helps them out because this also helps
1154720	1156560	their land value go up.
1156560	1163840	But here I am on land in 2022, and there's been a renewed interest in Henry George and
1163840	1167280	Georgism, especially with the younger folks online.
1169520	1170720	What's up with that?
1170720	1177120	Well, despite urban sprawl continuing to be a thing, land prices keep rising sharply.
1177120	1184000	To a point now where many young folks are priced out, stuck as renters, maybe forever.
1184000	1191520	The dream of owning a home to build up wealth is slowly fading away, so young folks are like,
1191520	1192240	screw it.
1192240	1196480	Let's revisit this land value tax idea again.
1196480	1202000	You might be thinking, well Mr. Beat, if a land value tax is so great, why isn't there
1202000	1204240	any place in the world that does it?
1204240	1208880	And my response is, there are places in the world where they do it.
1208880	1214480	It's not what Henry George envisioned, but variations of a land value tax exist around
1214480	1221520	the world in places like Estonia, Singapore, Denmark, Taiwan, and even in parts of the United
1221520	1222320	States.
1222320	1228640	However, for a land value tax to truly be effective, it must be widespread.
1228640	1233680	Otherwise, those not having to pay a land value tax will have an even bigger advantage.
1233680	1239920	And if a land value tax was ever widely implemented, it likely just couldn't happen overnight.
1239920	1245840	It would be incredibly unfair in the short term to property owners who paid a lot for
1245840	1251760	their land, as many of them would likely see their land lose its value over time with a
1251760	1253200	land value tax.
1253200	1258480	What's fascinating to me is that George's politically isn't left wing or right wing,
1258560	1263600	it's actually a good balance that unites liberty and equality.
1263600	1269920	The more I learn about it, the more impressed I am with it, which is why it will never happen.

1353440	1354400	So there it is.
1354400	1357040	I finally made a video about Georgism.
1357040	1360400	And I did have a Georgist actually read over the script.
1360400	1364480	So a shout out to Adam Monroe, an expert in Georgism.
1364480	1365280	I found him on Twitter.
1365280	1366480	You should follow him on Twitter.
1366480	1370400	His Twitter handle is, wait for it, Tax Land, Not Man.
1370400	1375200	Oh, and I hope I made it obvious that I am biased towards Georgism.
1375200	1375920	I like it.
1375920	1381440	So I especially, when I hear from you in the comments, if you are not a fan of Georgism,
1382080	1383840	if you think Georgism sucks, let me know.
1383840	1384960	And let me know why.
1384960	1385280	Okay?
1386400	1387440	Thanks for watching.
