2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,560
Do you know who this man is?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,000
You probably don't.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,800
But he was once considered one of the most influential Americans in history.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,720
One journalist called him, quote,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,880
the most famous American economic writer and, quote,

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,160
author of a book which probably had a larger worldwide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,840
Well, more on this man in the book he wrote in a few seconds.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,560
But first, let's go to a random field.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,160
Oh, hey, I'm Mr. Beat and I'm just sitting here in a random field touching grass.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
The man you saw in that picture, his name was Henry George

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,840
and the book, which ended up selling millions, is called, make sure I get this right,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Progress and Poverty, an inquiry into the cause of industrial depression's end

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
of increase of wants with increase of wealth, the remedy.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,320
Goodness, what a title that is.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
A title so long that I lost my train of thought.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,800
Where am I?

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
Why am I sitting in a random field?

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh, I remember.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,880
So I previously released a video about every major type of tax.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,760
Oh, there's that video now.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,360
You better hurry up and catch it before it's gone.

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
Uh, it's gone.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,120
Anyway, in that video, I said there is a tax called the single tax

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,920
by the legendary Henry George.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm going to make a future video about this,

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,760
but I think the single tax on land is something worth reconsidering again.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,840
The more I learn about it, the more I like it.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,400
Well, this is that future video, okay?

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,720
And actually, I should have been more specific.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,600
Henry George's single tax, the only tax that he believed should exist,

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,720
was a land value tax.

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,960
To help me explain it, let's bring in an economist and fellow YouTuber Jacob Clifford.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Thanks, Mr. Beat.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,640
I appreciate it.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,080
Thank you all very much.

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,440
A land value tax is a tax on unimproved land.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,880
So just the land, not any buildings or improvements.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,400
And that's one of the reasons that makes it-

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,520
But before he goes into more details about a land value tax,

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,440
let me tell you who this Henry George fellow was.

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,560
After all, if you're watching this, you probably don't know anything about Henry George,

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,320
even though he used to be kind of a big deal.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,520
Henry George was born in Philadelphia on September 2, 1839, the second of 10 children.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,760
His dad, Richard George, published religious books and was a devout Episcopalian.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
Henry was, uh, not so much.

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,640
His dad forced him to go to the Episcopal Academy, but he hated it there, eventually dropping out.

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
That didn't mean he didn't enjoy learning, though.

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,760
He convinced his dad to hire him a tutor, and he still read a bunch,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
and even attended lectures at the Franklin Institute.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,960
For fun, he was particularly into economics.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,600
He read Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,400
By the time he was 15, Henry had realized his parents were barely scraping by to feed the family,

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,320
and he knew if he wanted to make some money, he must go out on his own.

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,160
So he traveled the world as a cabin boy on a ship,

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,120
which means he basically took care of the captain's needs.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,520
He got paid $6 a month.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Instead of returning to Philadelphia after he got done working at sea,

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,960
he went to San Francisco to first potentially seek gold,

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,320
but after that was a bust.

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,520
He worked as a typesetter, a wear and a rice mill, and a farm laborer.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,880
The job he kept coming back to was typesetter, though.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,560
Unfortunately, Henry rarely made much money.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:06,880
When he was 21, he met Annie Fox, an orphaned immigrant from Australia,

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,800
and the two fell in love.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,320
Annie's uncle, who had been her guardian after her grandma died,

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,760
didn't appreciate how poor Henry was, though, and didn't approve of the relationship,

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,920
but they secretly got married anyway.

69
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,840
Despite a happy marriage, the couple did struggle financially,

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,680
even though they couldn't afford to feed them, they had four kids together.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,920
Henry George Jr., who later became a United States representative

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,440
and wrote a biography about his father, Richard, Jenny, and Anna.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Following the birth of Richard, times were so tough for the Georges

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,880
that Henry often had a beg for food.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
He later recalled one story, quote,

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,440
I walked along the street and made up my mind to get money from the first man

77
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
whose appearance might indicate that he had it to give.

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,960
I stopped a man, a stranger, and told him I wanted $5.

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,640
He asked what I wanted it for.

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,440
I told him that my wife was confined and that I had nothing to give her to eat.

81
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
He gave me the money.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
If he had not, I think I was desperate enough to have killed him.

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Things began to turn for the better when Henry realized he wanted to be a writer in 1865.

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,120
By that time, he had steady printing work for the newly created San Francisco Times

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
and began writing political editorials for local newspapers.

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
Even though Henry never went to college and had no formal training,

87
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
his editorials became quite popular.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
And due to this, he got promotions at the Times.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
By the summer of 1867, he was the managing editor.

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,800
In 1868, he left the Times to become managing editor of the bigger San Francisco Chronicle.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Soon after that, he wrote his most influential article up to that point called

92
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
What the Railroad Will Bring Us.

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,640
It was a response to the first transcontinental railroad being completed,

94
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,800
and while most everybody was excited about it, Henry was a bit more cynical,

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
writing that the railroad would only benefit some people.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,080
He argued the railroad would kill small towns and small businesses while propping up already

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,200
great cities and already huge corporations.

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,640
Keep in mind that this was in 1868, decades before the populist movement.

99
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,080
Henry's popularity as a writer only grew after that.

100
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,480
While he passionately called for future populist reforms like the secret ballots,

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,400
public ownership of certain natural monopolies, and the right to vote for women,

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
he also thought free trade was way better than protectionism.

103
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
Very nice.

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,880
And he dabbled in politics, running for the California State Assembly.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,480
But was handily defeated by the, you guessed it, railroad industry.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,160
As Henry's editorials grew more popular, his family finally got out of poverty.

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,200
But Henry wouldn't constantly stop thinking about poverty for the rest of his life.

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,360
He had two aha moments that are literally the reason why I am making a video about him

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
and his ideas today.

110
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,600
The first happened in 1868 when he traveled to New York City.

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,720
He was struck by the fact that those in poverty, in such a great city with great wealth,

112
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,840
were apparently a lot worse off than those in poverty back home in California,

113
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,320
a place with much less development.

114
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,920
The second aha moment happened one day in 1870 when Henry sat on his horse overlooking San Francisco Bay

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:48,160
after a dude told him that an seemingly unimportant acre of farmland nearby would sell for $1,000.

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,120
Quote, like a flash it came over me, that there was the reason of advancing poverty

117
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
with advancing wealth, with the growth of population, land grows in value,

118
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,520
and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,240
Soon Henry wrote his first analysis of what he called the land question.

120
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,440
In 1871, Henry helped found the San Francisco Daily Evening Post and he became its editor.

121
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,760
This is when many first became exposed to his land value tax idea.

122
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,360
However, he accumulated lots of debt with the Evening Post and his family ended up in dire poverty again.

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,160
Fortunately for Henry, by 1876 he was now a minor celebrity and began giving speeches.

124
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,760
He also still made some money as a freelancer of sorts.

125
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,520
On September 18, 1877, he began to write his masterpiece book.

126
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,480
The one I told you about earlier, you know, with the long title, yeah, that's the one.

127
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,400
We'll just call it Progress and Poverty from here on out.

128
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,000
He finished the book in March 1879 and supposedly dropped to the floor and wept like a baby after completing it.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
Late one night.

130
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,960
That sounds a bit dramatic, but maybe it happened.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:14,000
Anyway, by this time he and his family were living in New York City and that is where Progress and Poverty got published in 1880.

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
And keep in mind at this time, he was 40 years old.

133
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,560
That's my age.

134
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:28,720
Well, the book didn't sell that well at first, but slowly but surely, thanks to word of mouth, it began to catch on, as did Henry George's reputation.

135
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
He promoted the book in Europe.

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,160
Spreading his solution for eradicating poverty and reducing extreme wealth inequality.

137
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:45,120
Yep, the world was learning about his single tax on the value of land to completely replace the taxes the workers paid on their income

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
and the taxes the owners paid on their capital.

139
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,720
Little did he know.

140
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
I've written papers on Little Did He Know.

141
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
I used to teach a class based on Little Did He Know.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,600
I mean, I once gave an entire seminar on Little Did He Know.

143
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:12,640
That he would literally ignite a gigantic social movement that was a major catalyst of not just the populist movement, but the entire Progress-O-Vera.

144
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,520
Progress and Poverty sold millions of copies and eventually made Henry George a household name.

145
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,880
And apparently at the peak of the book's popularity, and I read this from many sources,

146
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,960
Henry George was the third most famous man in the United States.

147
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,320
Right behind Thomas Edison and Mark Twain, of course.

148
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,440
George's idea of a single land value tax became ridiculously popular.

149
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
Actually, can I jump in here?

150
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,320
Well, of course, Mr. Clifford.

151
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,600
Okay, great.

152
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,080
A land value tax is more efficient than other types of taxes.

153
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,840
Taxes influence decisions.

154
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,360
If we tax cigarettes, that's going to decrease smoking, which is good.

155
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,960
But if you tax things that society actually wants, that's going to decrease their consumption and production.

156
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,240
And that leads to something that economists call deadweight loss.

157
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
Inefficient markets that are not produced in the quantity that society actually wants or needs.

158
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,200
But since the supply of land is fixed, a land tax doesn't decrease its production.

159
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
It doesn't cause deadweight loss.

160
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,800
So sales taxes and excise taxes and even income taxes and corporate taxes can slow down the economy by discouraging production.

161
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,080
But George argued that a single land tax would actually encourage and promote economic activity

162
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
by discouraging people from hoarding land or just holding it for speculation.

163
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,640
If you own huge tracts of unimproved, valuable land, a land tax will encourage you to either improve the land

164
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,520
or sell it to somebody else that's going to improve the land by building houses or farms or factories

165
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,880
or something else that'll generate enough money to pay for the tax.

166
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,040
So in the end, all that land is used extremely efficiently

167
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,600
and the land tax means there's tax revenue for the government to provide public goods and services.

168
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,520
And George argued that that might be enough to provide universal basic income.

169
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,960
Well thanks Mr. Clifford.

170
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,320
Oh hey everyone, be sure to check out his YouTube channel.

171
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,560
His videos were the main videos I had my students watch when I taught Econ in the classroom.

172
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,280
Wait, you really forced your students to watch me?

173
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,320
It's true.

174
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,160
Anyway, in progress and poverty, George argued that a single land value tax was needed

175
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,920
because most of the wealth created by social and technological advances in an industrial free market economy

176
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,720
was actually owned by landowners.

177
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,760
And many of those landowners had monopolies over markets through something called economic rent.

178
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,040
Economic rent is basically income gained from controlling a limited resource.

179
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,520
So even though these landowners did nothing to improve the land value, they still got the profit.

180
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,600
And remember, this was land, a natural resource.

181
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
It was there already.

182
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
These landowners didn't create it.

183
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,960
They were just benefiting from something they did nothing to help create, nor improve.

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,040
In progress and poverty, George argued the game was rigged.

185
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,480
And the only way to fix the game was not to tax the worker on what they earn

186
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
because that would disincentivize them from working

187
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,040
and not to tax the owner of capital through taxes on what they own or buy

188
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,520
because that would disincentivize them from investing.

189
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,280
To George, land was common property and everyone was entitled to it.

190
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,160
But that doesn't mean he was a Marxist, though.

191
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,720
Oh, no.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,840
George was a Georgist.

193
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,240
George was fine with capitalism.

194
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,800
He just wasn't a fan of rigged capitalism in which the landowners were essentially parasites.

195
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,360
Because he thought everyone was entitled to the land, many of George's followers

196
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,760
hesitated to even call a land value tax a tax.

197
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,920
They preferred to call it basically rent paid to society in exchange for getting to

198
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,440
exclusively use the land for whatever they wanted, while also compensating for the fact

199
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,840
that others couldn't use it.

200
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,200
By the way, uh, yeah, George's followers soon became known as Georgeus

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,000
and George's whole economic ideology became known as Georgeism.

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,880
Anyway, George's book and ideas became so popular that governments around the world

203
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,160
got rid of all taxes.

204
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,400
And that's why today we only have a land use tax.

205
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,480
And we all lived happily ever after.

206
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,440
The End

207
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,160
Except no.

208
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
No, not at all.

209
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,960
What I just said, I was just making that up.

210
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:06,320
You see, people who owned land, and this may be a bit surprising to you,

211
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,960
didn't like the idea of a land value tax.

212
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
Go figure, huh?

213
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,000
Many people liked the fact that they could just let land sit there and it would automatically

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
go up in value.

215
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,080
In 1886, Henry once again gave politics an old try when he was recruited by the United

216
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,520
Labor Party to run for mayor of New York City.

217
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,040
However, he was up against the machine, aka the establishment.

218
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,040
Okay, Tammany Hall, the powerful political organization that essentially controlled

219
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
New York politics.

220
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Tammany Hall feared that if George won the election, politics in the city might be

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,040
reorganized along class lines instead of ethnic lines, which is where Tammany got its power.

222
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,360
Tammany Hall called George's supporters, quote, anarchists, nihilists, communists,

223
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
and socialists.

224
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,480
Well, George lost the election, but he surprised many with a strong second place finish.

225
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,920
Not only that, but there is some evidence that voter fraud may have been involved.

226
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
Just saying.

227
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,640
His supporters were not even allowed to oversee the ballot count.

228
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Regardless, he did finish ahead of an obscure dude by the name of Theodore Roosevelt, and

229
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,040
despite losing the election for the rest of his life, George's popularity only continued to grow.

230
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,760
In 1897, he ran for mayor of New York City again, but just four days before the election,

231
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,040
he suffered a fatal stroke that shocked the nation.

232
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,760
His death made international headlines, and possibly as many as 200,000 people showed up

233
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
to view his body.

234
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,520
At the time of his death, Henry George was the most well-known economist around, and

235
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,640
Georgism was arguably at its peak.

236
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,760
And yet, I only learned about George and Georgism like three years ago.

237
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:10,000
And as I researched for this video, I noticed that the man and his land value tax idea are

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,640
more obscure than goat cheese on pizza.

239
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,440
Why is that?

240
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,360
Why did Georgism go out of style?

241
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,080
Why did Georgism go out of style, huh?

242
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,200
Well, first of all, in his later years, George was too much of a purist.

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,000
He often refused to compromise on his ideals with other progressive reformers.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,480
Other progressive reformers didn't like how he was still okay with almost all capital,

245
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
uh, existing, and how he rejected a strong role for government.

246
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
They didn't like his opposition to public ownership of certain types of infrastructure,

247
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,640
his support of free trade, and him being a gradualist versus trying to start a radical

248
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
revolution.

249
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,040
Overall, he frustrated fellow progressive reformers by not shutting up about a land

250
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,760
value tax, thinking that was the only thing that could solve everybody's problems.

251
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,400
But of course, there were also the landowners, and the speculators.

252
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Even today, much wealth is earned through owning land.

253
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,560
And a land value tax threatens that.

254
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,560
But more importantly, land speculators have tremendous power over the government and the

255
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,600
media, and they would simply not get to make money anymore with a land value tax.

256
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,560
Now, there are other reasons why Georgism faded out in the 1900s.

257
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,920
World War I really hurt its momentum for starters.

258
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,560
Another big thing that is probably not brought up enough by Georgia is that cars got way more

259
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,560
popular during the century so that people could more easily travel longer distances to

260
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,920
get to their land.

261
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,360
Simply put, being able to get around more easily increased the amount of land available.

262
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
See all this urban sprawl?

263
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,600
That's because of cheaper land out on the fringes of metropolitan areas.

264
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,560
And that's a big reason why Georgism became somewhat obsolete.

265
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Landowners have also been somewhat successful at other reforms to help the poor.

266
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,720
Like welfare, which wouldn't you know it, also helps them out because this also helps

267
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,560
their land value go up.

268
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,840
But here I am on land in 2022, and there's been a renewed interest in Henry George and

269
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,280
Georgism, especially with the younger folks online.

270
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
What's up with that?

271
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,120
Well, despite urban sprawl continuing to be a thing, land prices keep rising sharply.

272
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,000
To a point now where many young folks are priced out, stuck as renters, maybe forever.

273
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,520
The dream of owning a home to build up wealth is slowly fading away, so young folks are like,

274
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,240
screw it.

275
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,480
Let's revisit this land value tax idea again.

276
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,000
You might be thinking, well Mr. Beat, if a land value tax is so great, why isn't there

277
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
any place in the world that does it?

278
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,880
And my response is, there are places in the world where they do it.

279
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,480
It's not what Henry George envisioned, but variations of a land value tax exist around

280
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,520
the world in places like Estonia, Singapore, Denmark, Taiwan, and even in parts of the United

281
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,320
States.

282
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,640
However, for a land value tax to truly be effective, it must be widespread.

283
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,680
Otherwise, those not having to pay a land value tax will have an even bigger advantage.

284
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,920
And if a land value tax was ever widely implemented, it likely just couldn't happen overnight.

285
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,840
It would be incredibly unfair in the short term to property owners who paid a lot for

286
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,760
their land, as many of them would likely see their land lose its value over time with a

287
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,200
land value tax.

288
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,480
What's fascinating to me is that George's politically isn't left wing or right wing,

289
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,600
it's actually a good balance that unites liberty and equality.

290
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,920
The more I learn about it, the more impressed I am with it, which is why it will never happen.

291
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:33,760
This video is sponsored in part by Fabulous, the number one self-help app to help you build

295
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,040
One thing that I've been trying to get better at lately is eating more fruits and vegetables.

296
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,120
Well, my Fabulous premium account has kept me on track and held me accountable, Dad Gummett.

Thanks again to Jacob Clifford for helping me out with this video.

305
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,400
So there it is.

306
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,040
I finally made a video about Georgism.

307
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,400
And I did have a Georgist actually read over the script.

308
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
So a shout out to Adam Monroe, an expert in Georgism.

309
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,280
I found him on Twitter.

310
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
You should follow him on Twitter.

311
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,400
His Twitter handle is, wait for it, Tax Land, Not Man.

312
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,200
Oh, and I hope I made it obvious that I am biased towards Georgism.

313
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,920
I like it.

314
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,440
So I especially, when I hear from you in the comments, if you are not a fan of Georgism,

315
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
if you think Georgism sucks, let me know.

316
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,960
And let me know why.

317
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,280
Okay?

318
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
Thanks for watching.
