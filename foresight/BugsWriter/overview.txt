Checking BugsWriter/ep3. Noise suppression with rn-noise by @Mashedd ï½œ #4BugsWriter.txt
1. **Discord on Linux**: The Linux version of Discord has not received significant updates recently, and as such, features like noise suppression (crisp audio) are not available on the platform.

2. **Crisp Audio Alternatives**: Before the recent update to Discord on Linux, users could use Crisp, a third-party noise-canceling software for Mac and Windows. However, Crisp is not supported on Linux either.

3. **RN Noise Command Line (CLI)**: The presenter discovered RN Noise CLI as an alternative solution for noise cancellation on Linux. It works similarly to Cadmus, which is based on pulse audio noise suppression plugin. RN Noise is a library that provides noise-canceling functionality.

4. **Installation and Usage**: RN Noise can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. It has a configuration file where users can specify their preferred settings, including which microphone to use. The presenter demonstrated how to set it up so that RN Noise starts automatically upon logging into their Linux session.

5. **Automation**: The presenter uses a script in their `~/.xinitrc` file (for systems using xinit) or equivalent startup scripts (like for Arch users) to activate RN Noise upon starting their desktop environment, ensuring the noise-canceling microphone is ready to use without manual intervention.

6. **Community Appreciation**: The presenter gives credit to NESP for creating RN Noise and expresses hope that the original developer continues to maintain the project.

7. **Summary**: The video explains how to obtain crisp audio in Discord on Linux by using RN Noise Command Line, a third-party tool that provides noise cancellation functionality. The presenter shares their method of automating the startup of this tool for seamless use without having to manually activate it every time they start their desktop environment. This solution is presented as a useful workaround until Discord officially implements noise suppression on Linux.
