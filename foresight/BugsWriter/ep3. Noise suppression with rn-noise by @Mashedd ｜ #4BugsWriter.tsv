0	10000	Welcome back to another video today. I want to show you guys, I mean, quick, but something I have really enjoyed, something that's just really helpful.
10000	18000	Okay, so, you know, you're on Linux, if you're a Linux user, you might be also a Linux gamer, you know, we love gaming.
18000	29000	I actually don't even play that many games nowadays, but, you know, schools got me latched up right now, but one of the programs we, you know, gamers use is Discord.
29000	35000	And a feature that they added like, I don't know, a year or two ago is crisp, like crisp noise canceling.
35000	41000	And I have to say, an amazing feature, you can just toggle it and boom, you got noise canceling, just easy.
41000	51000	And, yeah, if you got a noisy room, it's just, you know, or you got, you know, as gamers, we had mechanical keyboards out, you know, like, you know, they sound like that.
51000	59000	So, you know, you don't want to be playing in a game, like, and then just like, you know, hearing this, like all your mates hearing that.
59000	70000	So, yeah, it's pretty useful. And the problem is, the Linux version of Discord is probably out of touch, like, un-maintained, let's say.
70000	77000	There was only an update recently, but I don't think it added anything, or at least I didn't notice anything, maybe it fixed some bug or something.
77000	82000	But before that, I don't think there was an entire update for a year, or multiple months.
82000	90000	So, yeah, and there's a lot of things you can't even screen share with audio, and there is no crisp audio.
90000	95000	And if we go to crisp, there's the website, you know, it's only available for Mac and Windows.
95000	99000	So it's just not included into Discord. And I don't think it's Discord's fault.
99000	106000	I think it's like, crisp, it just doesn't have, you know, it's not supported on Linux. It's as simple as that.
106000	112000	So what's the solution? Well, you have to use your own noise-canceling program, software, whatever.
112000	125000	And initially, you know, initially there was one program called Cadmus, which is actually pretty good, although I think it's not maintained anymore.
125000	133000	It's pretty good, though. It's GUI, however. And if you know me, I'm minimalist, and I don't like GUIs, I love the terminal.
133000	138000	So, yeah, it's pretty good, but you can't auto-activate it.
138000	143000	So my first problem was, you can auto-activate it. If you could auto-activate it, then I wouldn't even care it's GUI.
143000	147000	But you have to auto-activate it, and to activate it, you have to activate it for the GUI.
147000	156000	So this is not it. And for a long time, I was looking for a noise-canceling solution, and I found it, I don't know, like a month ago.
156000	163000	And that is RN Noise Command Line, or CLI.
163000	168000	This program is really good, because it's basically Cadmus.
168000	176000	Because Cadmus is actually based on this pulse audio, GUI front end for this pulse audio noise suppression plugin.
176000	181000	If we go to this, and we read it, then it's, oh, it's based on RN Noise.
181000	190000	And then this is just a library for noise-canceling. And RN Noise is also just based on this plugin, which is also based on that.
190000	196000	So, yeah, it's basically the same thing as Cadmus, and you get extremely similar results.
196000	204000	And it is very simple, you just install it through the Python Pi, I don't know what it stands for, Python Pi, just pip install.
205000	212000	There's a configuration file where you can put in your default settings.
212000	220000	I mean, if I bring up a terminal and I just type in RN Noise, it comes up with this menu and we can just list our devices, we can list our status.
220000	233000	So it is currently activated, although I'm not talking, I'm talking for my normal mic, but yeah, whenever I go on Discord, I always use the new RN Noise, like the D-Noised mic.
233000	240000	And to activate it, how do you deactivate?
240000	243000	Deactivate.
243000	246000	Wait, I can't spell.
246000	254000	Okay, so if we deactivate it, so I no longer have the RN Noise, so if I just type in RN Noise, activate.
254000	262000	And let me show you, I got a configuration file here, and all it is is just I'm inputting, because this is the device, this is my microphone.
262000	274000	So all it does is just when it activates, if there wasn't this file, if I just delete it and save, it will tell me, like, hey, which device do you want to use?
274000	276000	So let me just, okay.
276000	282000	So it's like got the device, like actual name and then kind of what it's translated to in English.
282000	285000	And then you can just choose whichever one.
285000	296000	But the one I always use is just number one, which I can just put into this configuration file, so that when I run RN Noise, active automatically.
296000	303000	Great, this is just I run one command and my noise activation, I have a D-Noised microphone.
303000	307000	However, that is still too much, I don't want to run even a single command.
307000	312000	So what I've done is I run it in my X in at RC.
312000	320000	And this is just, I guess you could say like an auto activate from like launch type script, or how you want to call it.
320000	324000	Usually you use it if you're on like arch or some minimalist space distro.
324000	327000	If you're on a boon tree or something, you'll probably be using something else.
327000	332000	But yeah, this is just where I activate my, like everything I need.
332000	335000	And, you know, at the end, I activate D-Men or DWM.
335000	338000	And that's my window manager.
338000	343000	And just have a command here, RN Noise, activate and then it just activates my D-Noised mic.
343000	345000	And it's as simple as that.
345000	347000	And honestly, it just works.
347000	357000	It don't have to think about, you know, I always have a D-Noised mic before I would have to open up this Stallone tray, which it's just basically a tray system tray.
357000	359000	If you don't actually have one, which I don't.
359000	366000	And then out, because I had the app image, I'm sure there's a way to download it for like arch or something, but I don't know why I just ran the app image.
366000	376000	So I would have a execute app image command like this one, and it would activate and then I have to click on it and then I have to click activate mic.
376000	378000	It was just somewhat of a pain.
378000	379000	It was somewhat of a pain.
379000	381000	And this is just much better.
381000	383000	Very simple.
383000	385000	All credit goes to NESP.
385000	387000	Really appreciate this guy's work.
387000	388000	I started because I'm like, damn, this is really good.
388000	390000	And I think I also, I'm the one who forked it.
390000	393000	Yeah, I forked it because I'm like, wow, this is really good.
393000	396000	I hope he like doesn't just like nuke it or something.
396000	398000	So yeah.
398000	401000	Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video.
401000	403000	Hope you can use this.
403000	405000	I find this really useful.
405000	406000	And yeah, it's very simple.
406000	408000	Anyways, that's it.
