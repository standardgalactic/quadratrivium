00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Welcome back to another video today. I want to show you guys, I mean, quick, but something I have really enjoyed, something that's just really helpful.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
Okay, so, you know, you're on Linux, if you're a Linux user, you might be also a Linux gamer, you know, we love gaming.

00:18.000 --> 00:29.000
I actually don't even play that many games nowadays, but, you know, schools got me latched up right now, but one of the programs we, you know, gamers use is Discord.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
And a feature that they added like, I don't know, a year or two ago is crisp, like crisp noise canceling.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
And I have to say, an amazing feature, you can just toggle it and boom, you got noise canceling, just easy.

00:41.000 --> 00:51.000
And, yeah, if you got a noisy room, it's just, you know, or you got, you know, as gamers, we had mechanical keyboards out, you know, like, you know, they sound like that.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
So, you know, you don't want to be playing in a game, like, and then just like, you know, hearing this, like all your mates hearing that.

00:59.000 --> 01:10.000
So, yeah, it's pretty useful. And the problem is, the Linux version of Discord is probably out of touch, like, un-maintained, let's say.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
There was only an update recently, but I don't think it added anything, or at least I didn't notice anything, maybe it fixed some bug or something.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
But before that, I don't think there was an entire update for a year, or multiple months.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
So, yeah, and there's a lot of things you can't even screen share with audio, and there is no crisp audio.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
And if we go to crisp, there's the website, you know, it's only available for Mac and Windows.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
So it's just not included into Discord. And I don't think it's Discord's fault.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
I think it's like, crisp, it just doesn't have, you know, it's not supported on Linux. It's as simple as that.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
So what's the solution? Well, you have to use your own noise-canceling program, software, whatever.

01:52.000 --> 02:05.000
And initially, you know, initially there was one program called Cadmus, which is actually pretty good, although I think it's not maintained anymore.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
It's pretty good, though. It's GUI, however. And if you know me, I'm minimalist, and I don't like GUIs, I love the terminal.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
So, yeah, it's pretty good, but you can't auto-activate it.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
So my first problem was, you can auto-activate it. If you could auto-activate it, then I wouldn't even care it's GUI.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
But you have to auto-activate it, and to activate it, you have to activate it for the GUI.

02:27.000 --> 02:36.000
So this is not it. And for a long time, I was looking for a noise-canceling solution, and I found it, I don't know, like a month ago.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
And that is RN Noise Command Line, or CLI.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
This program is really good, because it's basically Cadmus.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
Because Cadmus is actually based on this pulse audio, GUI front end for this pulse audio noise suppression plugin.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
If we go to this, and we read it, then it's, oh, it's based on RN Noise.

03:01.000 --> 03:10.000
And then this is just a library for noise-canceling. And RN Noise is also just based on this plugin, which is also based on that.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
So, yeah, it's basically the same thing as Cadmus, and you get extremely similar results.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
And it is very simple, you just install it through the Python Pi, I don't know what it stands for, Python Pi, just pip install.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
There's a configuration file where you can put in your default settings.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
I mean, if I bring up a terminal and I just type in RN Noise, it comes up with this menu and we can just list our devices, we can list our status.

03:40.000 --> 03:53.000
So it is currently activated, although I'm not talking, I'm talking for my normal mic, but yeah, whenever I go on Discord, I always use the new RN Noise, like the D-Noised mic.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
And to activate it, how do you deactivate?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Deactivate.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Wait, I can't spell.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
Okay, so if we deactivate it, so I no longer have the RN Noise, so if I just type in RN Noise, activate.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
And let me show you, I got a configuration file here, and all it is is just I'm inputting, because this is the device, this is my microphone.

04:22.000 --> 04:34.000
So all it does is just when it activates, if there wasn't this file, if I just delete it and save, it will tell me, like, hey, which device do you want to use?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
So let me just, okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
So it's like got the device, like actual name and then kind of what it's translated to in English.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And then you can just choose whichever one.

04:45.000 --> 04:56.000
But the one I always use is just number one, which I can just put into this configuration file, so that when I run RN Noise, active automatically.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
Great, this is just I run one command and my noise activation, I have a D-Noised microphone.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
However, that is still too much, I don't want to run even a single command.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
So what I've done is I run it in my X in at RC.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
And this is just, I guess you could say like an auto activate from like launch type script, or how you want to call it.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Usually you use it if you're on like arch or some minimalist space distro.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
If you're on a boon tree or something, you'll probably be using something else.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
But yeah, this is just where I activate my, like everything I need.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And, you know, at the end, I activate D-Men or DWM.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And that's my window manager.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
And just have a command here, RN Noise, activate and then it just activates my D-Noised mic.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And it's as simple as that.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
And honestly, it just works.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
It don't have to think about, you know, I always have a D-Noised mic before I would have to open up this Stallone tray, which it's just basically a tray system tray.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
If you don't actually have one, which I don't.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
And then out, because I had the app image, I'm sure there's a way to download it for like arch or something, but I don't know why I just ran the app image.

06:06.000 --> 06:16.000
So I would have a execute app image command like this one, and it would activate and then I have to click on it and then I have to click activate mic.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
It was just somewhat of a pain.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It was somewhat of a pain.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And this is just much better.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Very simple.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
All credit goes to NESP.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Really appreciate this guy's work.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
I started because I'm like, damn, this is really good.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And I think I also, I'm the one who forked it.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, I forked it because I'm like, wow, this is really good.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I hope he like doesn't just like nuke it or something.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Hope you can use this.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I find this really useful.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
And yeah, it's very simple.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Anyways, that's it.
