00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome back to another video today. I want to show you guys, I mean, quick, but something I have really enjoyed, something that's just really helpful.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, so, you know, you're on Linux, if you're a Linux user, you might be also a Linux gamer, you know, we love gaming.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I actually don't even play that many games nowadays, but, you know, schools got me latched up right now, but one of the programs we, you know, gamers use is Discord.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And a feature that they added like, I don't know, a year or two ago is crisp, like crisp noise canceling.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And I have to say, an amazing feature, you can just toggle it and boom, you got noise canceling, just easy.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And, yeah, if you got a noisy room, it's just, you know, or you got, you know, as gamers, we had mechanical keyboards out, you know, like, you know, they sound like that.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, you know, you don't want to be playing in a game, like, and then just like, you know, hearing this, like all your mates hearing that.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, yeah, it's pretty useful. And the problem is, the Linux version of Discord is probably out of touch, like, un-maintained, let's say.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There was only an update recently, but I don't think it added anything, or at least I didn't notice anything, maybe it fixed some bug or something.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But before that, I don't think there was an entire update for a year, or multiple months.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, yeah, and there's a lot of things you can't even screen share with audio, and there is no crisp audio.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And if we go to crisp, there's the website, you know, it's only available for Mac and Windows.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So it's just not included into Discord. And I don't think it's Discord's fault.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think it's like, crisp, it just doesn't have, you know, it's not supported on Linux. It's as simple as that.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So what's the solution? Well, you have to use your own noise-canceling program, software, whatever.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And initially, you know, initially there was one program called Cadmus, which is actually pretty good, although I think it's not maintained anymore.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's pretty good, though. It's GUI, however. And if you know me, I'm minimalist, and I don't like GUIs, I love the terminal.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, yeah, it's pretty good, but you can't auto-activate it.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So my first problem was, you can auto-activate it. If you could auto-activate it, then I wouldn't even care it's GUI.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But you have to auto-activate it, and to activate it, you have to activate it for the GUI.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So this is not it. And for a long time, I was looking for a noise-canceling solution, and I found it, I don't know, like a month ago.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And that is RN Noise Command Line, or CLI.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This program is really good, because it's basically Cadmus.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because Cadmus is actually based on this pulse audio, GUI front end for this pulse audio noise suppression plugin.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If we go to this, and we read it, then it's, oh, it's based on RN Noise.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And then this is just a library for noise-canceling. And RN Noise is also just based on this plugin, which is also based on that.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, yeah, it's basically the same thing as Cadmus, and you get extremely similar results.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it is very simple, you just install it through the Python Pi, I don't know what it stands for, Python Pi, just pip install.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There's a configuration file where you can put in your default settings.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I mean, if I bring up a terminal and I just type in RN Noise, it comes up with this menu and we can just list our devices, we can list our status.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So it is currently activated, although I'm not talking, I'm talking for my normal mic, but yeah, whenever I go on Discord, I always use the new RN Noise, like the D-Noised mic.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And to activate it, how do you deactivate?

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Deactivate.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait, I can't spell.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, so if we deactivate it, so I no longer have the RN Noise, so if I just type in RN Noise, activate.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And let me show you, I got a configuration file here, and all it is is just I'm inputting, because this is the device, this is my microphone.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So all it does is just when it activates, if there wasn't this file, if I just delete it and save, it will tell me, like, hey, which device do you want to use?

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So let me just, okay.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So it's like got the device, like actual name and then kind of what it's translated to in English.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And then you can just choose whichever one.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But the one I always use is just number one, which I can just put into this configuration file, so that when I run RN Noise, active automatically.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Great, this is just I run one command and my noise activation, I have a D-Noised microphone.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
However, that is still too much, I don't want to run even a single command.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So what I've done is I run it in my X in at RC.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And this is just, I guess you could say like an auto activate from like launch type script, or how you want to call it.

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Usually you use it if you're on like arch or some minimalist space distro.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you're on a boon tree or something, you'll probably be using something else.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But yeah, this is just where I activate my, like everything I need.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And, you know, at the end, I activate D-Men or DWM.

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And that's my window manager.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And just have a command here, RN Noise, activate and then it just activates my D-Noised mic.

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it's as simple as that.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And honestly, it just works.

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It don't have to think about, you know, I always have a D-Noised mic before I would have to open up this Stallone tray, which it's just basically a tray system tray.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you don't actually have one, which I don't.

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then out, because I had the app image, I'm sure there's a way to download it for like arch or something, but I don't know why I just ran the app image.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I would have a execute app image command like this one, and it would activate and then I have to click on it and then I have to click activate mic.

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It was just somewhat of a pain.

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It was somewhat of a pain.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And this is just much better.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Very simple.

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All credit goes to NESP.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Really appreciate this guy's work.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I started because I'm like, damn, this is really good.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I think I also, I'm the one who forked it.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, I forked it because I'm like, wow, this is really good.

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I hope he like doesn't just like nuke it or something.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So yeah.

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hope you can use this.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I find this really useful.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And yeah, it's very simple.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Anyways, that's it.
