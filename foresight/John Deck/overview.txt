1. The discussion revolved around the concept of evidence within the context of biodiversity data and the role of objects (like a stolen box from Greg's Herbarium) as tokens or occurrences but not necessarily as evidence themselves.

2. There is a need for a clear distinction between a record (observation, collection, etc.) and the physical object or specimen it refers to. This distinction is important for understanding the nature of data and how it relates to real-world occurrences.

3. The Darwin Core framework, which was originally designed to standardize biodiversity data, has limitations in terms of accommodating descriptive metadata about specimens or occurrences. There is a suggestion for additional classes that could be related to organisms and their parts to better represent these aspects.

4. The term 'basis of record' was discussed, with concerns about its clarity and the range of things it encompasses, such as location, events, and identifications. It seems there is some confusion or overloading in what 'basis of record' actually means.

5. There is an existing ontology developed by Bob Morris, which builds upon Darwin SW and incorporates elements from Roger Hayam's earlier work on the Tadwick ontology. This ontology was created as a practical tool for curators to deal with AOD (Advanced On-line Data) records.

6. It was suggested that section undertaking could benefit from a workshop similar to the one held in Kansas, and this might also preview discussions for tomorrow, which will delve into where and how to take this ontology development forward.

7. The conversation highlighted the importance of clarifying terms and roles within the biodiversity data framework to ensure that the metadata captured accurately reflects the evidence or assertions being made. This is crucial for the integrity and utility of biodiversity data.
