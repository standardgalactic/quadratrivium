0	11000	John asked me, in the absence of Stephen Camm, who developed Darwinist W, John asked me to talk a little bit about it.
11000	23000	And I thought I would, it's okay with everybody, take the liberty of situating that work in the context of the general issue of how to represent Darwin core in RDF.
23000	32000	And so, because I know that both Stephen Camm have created Darwinist W for two reasons.
32000	43000	One, they had an immediate need to represent data and perhaps before consensus was reached within TADWIG about how exactly to do that.
43000	51000	And two, they saw it as a first step towards building consensus around a canonical way to do it.
51000	66000	But I think that everybody, with one exception at the end, who has sort of proposed a way of doing it, agrees that these are initial steps and some consensus and further thought is required.
66000	76000	So the first thing, so just to give a brief overview, even before we talk about any extensions, I wanted to illustrate the fact that Darwin core as it is is an ontology.
76000	83000	And like any ontology, you can represent data with it and you can query over that data.
83000	92000	And then we can talk a little bit about some of the shortcomings in Darwin core as it is an ontology and some of the proposed solutions.
92000	98000	So I'll exit out of the show.
98000	101000	I'll wait for refresh at 75 Hertz.
101000	103000	Okay.
103000	109000	So here is Darwin core.
109000	112000	This is the canonical description.
112000	115000	It's, you can see in the URL, it's an RDF document.
115000	119000	This is the HTML representation of it.
119000	124000	And it is, as John said, a bag of terms.
124000	128000	Behavior, binomial, collection ID, decimal latitude.
128000	132000	You can look at its RDF representation.
132000	140000	It's somewhat difficult to read in Safari.
140000	158000	But the, you know, John said that when they created this canonical RDF representation, they sort of didn't have the semantic web in mind or rather they had it in mind and didn't want to deal with it because I thought it would be dealt with later on.
158000	168000	But to my mind, this is well suited for the semantic web and is a legitimate ontology in its own right.
168000	174000	It's a list of the things that there are in the world of biodiversity.
174000	190000	And to illustrate that, I expressed the occurrences from the Woods Hole Bioblitz in RDF only using the Darwin core namespace.
190000	197000	So without, without any additions, you could say, well, so here's, here's an occurrence and here are a couple.
197000	199000	There are two different identifications of it.
199000	205000	One saying it was an ampelopsis and one saying that it was something else.
205000	209000	Parthenosisis kinchifolia.
209000	219000	And then each of those identifications and occurrences have their own, have their own good.
219000	231000	And you might, this right away sort of illustrates one of the, one of the issues that here identification is being used as a property of occurrence.
231000	243000	But then if you, if you look at the GUID of that identification, you'll see that you can also use identification as a class.
244000	247000	And that's, that's okay.
247000	256000	The reasoners don't, you know, overheat and, and blow a fuse because of course a property is a class.
256000	260000	And so there's no, you know, there's no, not necessarily attention there.
260000	263000	Nevertheless, it's, you know, it's bad form, of course.
263000	267000	I mean, I think to have the same term that's both a property and a class.
267000	281000	So at a minimum, my suggestion, you know, as a first layer, semantic layer would be to roughly double the number of terms and to introduce, you know, disambiguate when you're using identification as a class and when you're using it as a property.
281000	290000	So introduce a hazard identification, hazard occurrence, hazard habitat, et cetera.
290000	306000	But even as it is, you can, you know, reason over the data, you can issue sparkle queries and, and get, you know, get answers.
307000	314000	So I guess we're going to be talking more this afternoon and tomorrow.
314000	325000	But I guess my viewer, the viewer's preview of my position is that I think we should make as small changes to the existing way of doing things as possible.
326000	335000	So the next, so, so Steve, now I've opened up Darwin S.W., the class diagram.
335000	341000	I know that it can't be seen from the back, but it can't be seen any, any better on the slide.
341000	347000	If you, if you click on the last, the ready talk slide there, it'll show the same thing we have.
347000	348000	Okay.
348000	349000	The one.
349000	350000	Ready talk, here we go.
350000	351000	So.
351000	353000	That's what's being shown.
353000	354000	All right.
354000	358000	So can you go to the slide that has the, the class diagram?
358000	362000	I think it's the third slide.
362000	381000	So as there was a lot of discussion, as John was mentioning about how to move, how to, how to move Darwin core, how to make Darwin core more appropriate for, for, for representing data in RDF and on the semantic web in general.
381000	385000	And a lot of it centered around the overloading of the term occurrence.
385000	392000	So Steve, since you're with us, I'll let you talk about, you know, Darwin S.W. in a minute.
392000	404000	But I wanted to sort of just say what, what I think is it's, you know, most important contribution, which is that it teases out some of the overloading of occurrence that went on.
404000	408000	And, and it does this by introducing a new term token.
408000	427000	So, and John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that part of the issue was that coming out of a collections mentality, an occurrence was thought of as it could be a specimen or it could be an image or it could be a tissue sample.
427000	432000	And, or it could just be something that, that you, that you saw.
432000	444000	And so Steve says, well, actually, to be more correct, the specimen or the tissue sample or the photograph are tokens of the occurrence.
444000	449000	Word of mouth could be a token of the occurrence and those tokens all serve as evidence.
449000	456000	So I think he settled on token because evidence, he tried to introduce the term evidence.
456000	462000	I might be wrong about the history and then there was too much argument over what evidence properly means and so he settled on token.
462000	475000	Similarly, he tried to introduce the term individual and I think there was agreement that that would be a good term to add, a good concept to add to the graph.
475000	482000	But there is no agreement on what it should be called and what its scope should be and whether it would include a flock of geese or a pack of wolves.
482000	487000	And so I think that's left out, right? So there's still no individual in Darwin Corps.
487000	500000	Individual Darwin Corps, but the discussion did go forward and accept as a scope for the concept of populations down to mixed tax on things.
500000	501000	Right.
501000	503000	And it would be called enormous.
503000	506000	So that's still though to be, that's not yet introduced.
506000	534000	So the other thing to, I guess, notice is that these classes and the properties associated to them are normalized in the sense that if you look at identification, that can only be applied to a token, not to an occurrence or so.
534000	544000	And similarly, the tax on itself, which is the determination, is then a property of the identification.
544000	546000	Joel, can you do full screen?
546000	550000	Yeah, that would be a good idea.
550000	553000	That's a great idea.
553000	561000	So just to point to what I was talking to, here's the occurrence, here are the new terms, token and individual organism.
561000	575000	And looking back, I didn't find the email, but from about two years ago, when a Darwin Corps was first represented in that RDF manner, there was a question, should there be any domain constraints on any of these terms, like, for example, identification?
575000	586000	And the decision was made, you know, no, because that could lead to too much potential for misuse if people apply these terms.
586000	598000	And this is something that I'm, you know, interested in, is in a very loose context, if people are applying identifications to samples or to pictures or to occurrences or to organisms.
598000	606000	But Steve is sort of much more principled and says, you know, identification properly has, you know, the domain of the token.
606000	611000	Is there identification by identification?
611000	613000	Steve?
613000	615000	I'm sorry, what was the question?
615000	619000	The question is, is there a definition of identification?
619000	622000	And I think...
622000	640000	Well, I mean, identification, in all of the Darwin Corps classes, there's not a clear definition in the sense of what the, how they are connected to the other classes.
640000	651000	And I mean, I think that identification, well, identification connects something to a taxon concept.
651000	655000	And I guess the question is, what is that something that is being identified?
655000	669000	So, you know, we took the position that identification was connecting some kind of a nebulous thing,
669000	673000	which we call the individual organism to a taxon.
673000	677000	Is the, is an identification an event?
677000	678000	Yes.
678000	679000	I'm sorry?
679000	682000	Is identification an event?
682000	683000	No.
683000	689000	It is not defined as an event.
689000	693000	It's defined as a category of information in Darwin Corps.
693000	695000	Result of the event.
695000	697000	Conceptually, it is an event.
697000	709000	The term event in Darwin Corps derives from the Dublin Corps, which is why it doesn't say collecting event within the current session or the current sense of Darwin Corps.
709000	713000	So, we know there are many kinds of events in all the work we do.
713000	726000	So, I'll make a general point, which is, if you're going to do a semantic version of the Darwin Corps, then you need definitions, which would be formulated using something like owl.
727000	730000	That's, you should be nodding your head.
730000	734000	Well, only if I agree with you, right?
734000	746000	And then the second point I would make is that, at the moment, I think many of these terms are just going to create puzzlement, because they're so abstract.
746000	753000	So, most people don't use token in their daily data collection business, I would suppose.
753000	762000	Can they understand, actually, and the work we just pointed out, some of the problems with the n-view of the year that we're dealing with, in that you do have tractable terms of the year.
762000	769000	Identification, and it has a definition, says it's information, or category of information.
769000	771000	That's not, it doesn't tell you much.
771000	773000	It says a thing.
773000	776000	But at the same time, it's the same point I got here.
776000	777000	Oh, wait.
777000	782000	In my mind, when you say identification, I see a process.
782000	784000	I see a narrative.
784000	787000	We have a long history of modeling in this community.
787000	788000	Yeah.
788000	794000	As I was telling, you know, it goes back to, you know, 92 or 90 when we started doing this.
794000	809000	And it's an identification as an event with, as an association of something biological with a taxonomy done by someone at some time is common to virtually all the models that we have done.
809000	810000	When they have that.
810000	812000	Except that it's not an event.
812000	823000	Except that in the Darwin court, because we didn't do assembly of terms into concepts like this, you know, the structure that we've been talking about, it's not included.
824000	829000	So I'm making a general point that if you're using abstract terms, that's fine.
829000	835000	But then you're not going to help the user unless you define those abstract terms.
835000	842000	And if he said, but we have an established community here, which knows what they're doing, you're creating a mystery.
842000	848000	Because you want your data to be viewable from the outside by Japanese people with really nice machines.
848000	850000	They will not understand.
850000	851000	Japanese have really nice machines.
851000	852000	This is the point that we're at.
852000	862000	We're at the point of saying, yes, we all agree that we need to have a structural thing that's called a taxonomic identification or something like that.
862000	867000	And that it has the properties or that it has the same basic shape as an event.
867000	873000	Although, I mean, defining identification as an event, I'm not saying it isn't.
873000	874000	I'm not saying.
874000	875000	No, I don't care how it's done.
875000	877000	I just want to see the result.
877000	881000	But I'm just saying that if you want to avoid, that could also be confusing.
881000	885000	If the goal is to avoid confusion, people have an idea of what identification is.
885000	887000	Is it an event?
887000	888000	So I don't know.
888000	890000	I'm just saying you need definitions.
890000	897000	And there is a way of doing definitions within the semantic web, which is well understood and which will give you all kinds of benefits.
897000	905000	But just let me let me repeat what John and I discussed yesterday.
905000	908000	You have Darwin Core.
908000	909000	It's full of terms.
909000	911000	It's full of quasi-definition.
911000	925000	Go through Darwin Core as it is and try and define every single term using our, which is the standard that we're more or less forced to use for doing this currently.
925000	927000	Sometimes it will be easy.
927000	928000	A comment.
928000	929000	Yeah?
930000	945000	I think one of the way we looked at things like identification, occurrence, and event, in some sense, there are nodes that connect different things.
945000	955000	So, you know, identification is the thing that connects an organism to a taxon or a taxon concept.
955000	974000	And so I think that was one of the reasons why when we got hung up on trying to define what these different things meant, that really we were essentially talking about joins between other categories of things.
974000	979000	So that is one way of doing definitions.
979000	983000	When you do it, then we will see whether the definition is intelligible.
983000	990000	But the result has to help people to understand what particular data expressed in a certain way means.
990000	996000	And it has to help people understand how to annotate their own data in the same way.
996000	1003000	And it seems that within this community, there are indeed people who know exactly what you just said means.
1003000	1005000	I don't know what it means.
1005000	1012000	And I can see all kinds of objections that other people might have based on what you've said.
1012000	1024000	But Barry, I mean, sometimes the semantics that can be expressed in English, I mean, do you say that the full semantics that would express natural language should be expressed in owl?
1024000	1027000	What I say is there should be an experiment.
1027000	1036000	Take the Darwin quote, try and define all the terms using owl, because that's the standard that we're forced to use today.
1036000	1038000	And see what you get.
1038000	1040000	You will learn all kinds of things.
1040000	1046000	You will learn that you don't know whether identification is an event or not an event, maybe.
1046000	1056000	I know that the word token is used in a funny way, because some things which meet the definition of token are not listed on the token within the structure that you have now.
1056000	1067000	And then the ontology that will be generated automatically from that set of definitions, when you run it through the reasoner, will give you a list of categorization errors.
1067000	1068000	I'm assuming.
1068000	1069000	So this is an experiment.
1069000	1071000	I have no idea how it will turn out.
1071000	1080000	Once you get that list, you can change some of the definitions and you can consult with your colleagues to find better definitions.
1080000	1085000	And the result will be something which will be a step forward.
1085000	1089000	Maybe it won't replace the Darwin quote, but it will be a step forward and understand it.
1089000	1090000	Right.
1090000	1092000	So I mean, those experiments have been done.
1092000	1097000	They're being done, you know, as we speak.
1097000	1102000	And it's not clear to me that it will result in a step forward.
1102000	1112000	And for example, if you get a categorization error, we don't need to classify.
1112000	1126000	I mean, in a lot of ontology applications, the goal is to classify the ontology to get a complete listing of the type hierarchy, of the class hierarchy, and also an instance categorization.
1126000	1132000	But the artifacts of biodiversity informatics are typed.
1132000	1134000	They come typed.
1134000	1146000	I mean, we don't need to, you know, run some record into a machine and know whether or not that's an identification.
1146000	1148000	I mean, it will tell us it's an identification.
1148000	1152000	If something's a picture, if something's a digital still image, we'll know that it's a digital still image.
1152000	1154000	I truly think that you do need to do this.
1154000	1158000	It's a basic quality assurance step.
1158000	1165000	And anyone who's working with this magic web would assume that that would be the basic step that everyone does.
1165000	1170000	Well, that's, I mean, the fact that you don't want to do it is strange.
1170000	1175000	It's like not wanting to use a spellchecker.
1175000	1184000	Well, I mean, not every class, if you want to say, I mean, a class is defined simply by introducing it as a class.
1184000	1185000	You need to define it.
1185000	1187000	It inherits from our class.
1187000	1189000	And there, it's defined.
1189000	1193000	And now, as human beings, we attach some meaning to it.
1193000	1199000	And so we write our application code to understand that term according to our understanding of it.
1199000	1208000	And yes, there's a vision of the semantic web in which, you know, we don't have to write the code because we'll have general purpose processors
1208000	1215000	that can look at the machine definition and understand how to process it.
1215000	1223000	I'm not saying that that won't happen, but it doesn't have to happen to get a lot of value out of the semantic web.
1223000	1226000	Let me, let me just say one more thing.
1226000	1235000	So the gene ontology used to be a very clunky back of the envelope word list, just a very, very minimal structure.
1235000	1243000	After a few years, people have the idea to try and produce logically coherent definitions of the gene ontology terms.
1243000	1247000	Immediately, immediately, they started that with just a few definitions.
1247000	1250000	They discovered errors, they discovered gaps.
1250000	1255000	And when they actually finished with all the definitions, they discovered all kinds of interesting things about the ontology,
1255000	1259000	which helped the ontology from a biological point of view.
1259000	1261000	It became better in every respect.
1261000	1264000	Now, you should want to do that.
1264000	1266000	It's a healthy desire.
1266000	1270000	It's a sign of a clean living individual.
1270000	1274000	The fact that you don't want to do it is strange.
1274000	1280000	I mean, I think a rule of ontologies should be no naked terms.
1280000	1283000	Except highly general primitives.
1283000	1285000	Because you can't define everything.
1285000	1287000	You can't define everything like the W3 specs or in some sort of a form.
1287000	1289000	Yeah, but you can't define everything.
1289000	1291000	Otherwise, you would have an infinite change.
1291000	1293000	You have to use some words without that.
1293000	1295000	It becomes problematic.
1295000	1299000	But, you know, at the level that we're talking about in Darwin Park, we completely agree with Barry.
1299000	1303000	Minimally, we should have a natural language definition and ideally something a bit more formal.
1303000	1306000	Well, I certainly agree we should have a natural language definition.
1306000	1316000	But I think a legitimate vision for the semantic web is that the ontologies serve as dictionaries for human users,
1316000	1321000	that you have the namespace, and you say, if we're talking about a Darwin core identification,
1321000	1324000	everybody can look and say, oh, that's what a Darwin core identification is.
1324000	1327000	Anybody that can understand natural language.
1327000	1334000	And then only write code that uses Darwin core colon identification in that way.
1334000	1339000	And that, I think, is already a big step forward because you have a canonical place where people look and say,
1339000	1342000	if you're using a DWC identification, you have to use it in this way.
1342000	1348000	So, if you want to say that there shouldn't be naked terms, I can't know.
1348000	1352000	I don't know what there should and shouldn't be, but I know that there is value from naked terms.
1353000	1356000	Because 90% of the value of the semantic web comes from the namespace.
1356000	1358000	It comes from the disambiguation.
1358000	1364000	For any naked term you put up there, unless you want it to be completely unconstrained,
1364000	1370000	run a little bit of a few hints about usage or formal definitions.
1370000	1374000	I think it can do nothing but help as long as it doesn't over constrain.
1374000	1376000	But you can try to constrain it as much as you want.
1376000	1380000	But those hints can be in English. They don't have to be in Al.
1381000	1385000	What's the danger of that? What do you lose by having them in Al?
1385000	1387000	I don't get what the resistance is to it.
1387000	1390000	Because it's a lot harder to figure out how to model them in Al.
1390000	1398000	Well, because it's a lot easier than for people to say things that they don't really mean.
1398000	1412000	For example, the Darwin core type hierarchy used to define subclasses of events
1412000	1419000	and subclasses of collection events, subclasses of specimens.
1419000	1424000	And it was pointed out, and I think it was Steve that pointed it out,
1424000	1429000	that the result was that a preserved specimen is an event.
1429000	1434000	Obviously, if your Al hierarchy is wrong, it's going to cause problems.
1434000	1443000	For a particular point of view, from a particular point of view, that Al hierarchy was right.
1444000	1454000	Another example is that one of the first descriptions of terms that people add,
1454000	1458000	especially if they're using protégé because it encourages it, is domain constraints.
1458000	1460000	What does this term apply to?
1460000	1466000	But, of course, those constraints don't act as integrity constraints as they do in a database.
1466000	1472000	They act as grist for a reasoning mill.
1472000	1479000	And so now, if you say identification, and Steve gets to this, if we ever get to his slides,
1479000	1484000	we'll see that he recognizes this as one of the potential criticism,
1484000	1488000	one of the criticisms of his current representation,
1488000	1493000	is that by having this highly normalized view where identification only applies to a token,
1493000	1498000	if somebody identifies an image using the term identification,
1498000	1502000	then that reasoner will assume that, well, okay, an image is a token.
1502000	1510000	If somebody identifies, well, what if somebody identifies an occurrence,
1510000	1512000	then you have to reason that the occurrence is a token.
1512000	1514000	If somebody tries to identify a species...
1514000	1517000	If they identify wrong, they're not using the definition of...
1517000	1524000	This is exactly my point, is that the more complicated the ontology it is,
1524000	1530000	the easier it is to say things that have implications that you don't want to imply.
1530000	1535000	So the idea is that you would have good language definitions to help the user,
1535000	1540000	and you would have good logical definitions to do basic quality control.
1540000	1542000	Doing both of those will help the other.
1542000	1544000	So you'll get better English definitions by doing the logic.
1544000	1547000	You'll get better logical definitions by doing the English definitions.
1547000	1551000	And users will have some clue as to how to use.
1551000	1555000	Like, if I go to the Dharma Corp. now as a naive user,
1555000	1558000	I wouldn't know how to use the term because I don't know what they're supposed to mean.
1558000	1560000	And there's no guidance for me.
1560000	1564000	There's no logical relationship that attacks the definitions are vague.
1564000	1566000	So I don't know what to put where.
1566000	1570000	I'm even saying, like in semantic Dharma Corp.
1570000	1578000	Saying that an occurrence is a junction of an event with an identification,
1578000	1582000	I think it's helpful compared to the circular definition that exists in the current Dharma Corp.
1582000	1586000	Dharma Corp. standard that says an occurrence is an occurrence.
1586000	1591000	And I think it's a good practice to have those best practice examples.
1591000	1598000	They established within all the Ikea world that I think nearly everywhere they are needed.
1598000	1605000	You need some guidelines with good examples in there where you can find yourself again with fewer things.
1605000	1608000	I just say one thing.
1608000	1612000	Buffer is designed to incorporate exactly those best practices.
1612000	1616000	And if you're forced to specify whether a token is an occurrence or a continuum,
1616000	1619000	or whether an identification is an occurrence or a continuum,
1619000	1626000	that will bring almost cost-free and immediate improvement in usability.
1627000	1632000	Do you want to show the slides?
1632000	1636000	Yeah, Steve, are you still in the mood to go through your slides?
1636000	1640000	Yeah, well, I don't know if you have to go through all of them,
1640000	1644000	but could you go back one slide from the one you're on right now?
1644000	1652000	So, I mean, this is really the kind of core relationships between the different classes.
1652000	1659000	And, you know, the discussion was going on about, like, well, what is an identification?
1659000	1669000	And essentially, the reason identification has to be in there is because you have many to one relationship
1669000	1672000	between taxons and identifications.
1672000	1678000	There can be many identifications that relate to a particular taxon concept.
1678000	1685000	And likewise, the reason that there's a connection between identification and an organism
1685000	1691000	is because you can have many identifications for a particular organism.
1691000	1699000	So essentially, each of those connections between the pink things there represent one to many relationships.
1699000	1703000	And that's why they were separated out as different classes.
1703000	1713000	So, I don't, you know, I didn't get terribly hung up on what the exact definition was of event or occurrence,
1713000	1721000	but just simply saying that there are connections between things where you have one to many relationships.
1721000	1730000	The blue section in the middle, could you advance down two slides?
1730000	1738000	This is, I think, the place where we sort of don't have agreement on what the structure of this should be.
1738000	1743000	I mean, the slide that I just showed you, there really seemed to be more or less a consensus among people
1743000	1746000	in our discussion that that was how things were related.
1746000	1753000	But in terms of what's the relationship between identifications and occurrences,
1753000	1760000	you know, we stuck this thing which essentially should have probably been defined
1760000	1766000	as taxonomically heterogeneous identity in between identifications and occurrences.
1766000	1772000	And what exactly that means is a subject of discussion.
1772000	1778000	But I think the idea of token, really, if you just don't call it token and you call it evidence,
1778000	1782000	that essentially defines what token is.
1782000	1786000	It could be evidence that an organism occurred at a particular spot.
1786000	1789000	It could be evidence that's the basis for an identification.
1789000	1791000	It's just simply evidence.
1791000	1795000	And it could even be the same thing as an individual organism,
1795000	1798000	or it could be something derived from an individual organism.
1798000	1811000	So, you know, what we call token just simply means evidence of some form.
1811000	1820000	So, anyway, that's about all I wanted to say.
1820000	1824000	So, Steve, you haven't been here for earlier discussions,
1824000	1829000	but one, I've made a series of very simple and very boring points.
1829000	1832000	And I'll continue to make them until I die.
1832000	1840000	And one boring point that I've made is that when you're building an ontology or a terminology resource,
1840000	1847000	then you should be aware of using a very general term which has all kinds of meanings in other contexts
1847000	1852000	to mean exactly what you want to mean for your specific purpose.
1852000	1858000	And one of the reasons why that is a bad thing is because other people are going to want to use the data
1858000	1864000	which you've annotated using your resource to do all kinds of unanticipated things.
1864000	1869000	And if they find that you're using a word that for them has a much more general meaning,
1869000	1876000	then they will not find it easy to use the data annotated in your terms.
1876000	1882000	Now, the word evidence is going to be used by nearly every scientist.
1882000	1884000	And it's going to mean statistical evidence.
1884000	1888000	It's going to mean evidence on the basis of what was calculated.
1888000	1894000	It's going to mean evidence in your sense, evidence pertaining to a sample, for instance.
1894000	1896000	So, you shouldn't use the word evidence.
1896000	1903000	Maybe you can call it Darwin evidence or Herborium evidence, but you can't just call it evidence.
1903000	1910000	Right. Well, I mean, this is a part of the whole problem with defining what an individual organism was
1910000	1915000	because the term individual has a particular meaning.
1915000	1923000	And so that's why it really probably should have been called taxonomically homogenous entity
1923000	1928000	because that's essentially what we intended for it to mean.
1928000	1933000	But, you know, there's history in what people call things.
1933000	1940000	And, you know, I'm not sure what the best thing, token, was something that basically we made up.
1940000	1944000	And so that might be a better term than evidence.
1944000	1947000	Token is not a good word because it too has a history, unfortunately.
1947000	1949000	So this is really hard.
1949000	1956000	What is almost every term you can think of to use has somebody has used previously to mean something?
1956000	1957000	Absolutely.
1957000	1962000	So maybe long names like Darwin-Cora evidence or something are better.
1962000	1968000	So it's hard work, but it has been done successfully in many different fields.
1968000	1973000	And we've learned things. There are some lessons learned from all of that.
1973000	1979000	I'm just going to mention one further lesson learned because I think it's important to see one difference
1979000	1983000	between the Dublin-Cora and the Darwin-Cora.
1983000	1991000	The Dublin-Cora is pretty straightforwardly what we might call first order.
1991000	2001000	And what that means is that if it's talking about, say, a registration for copyright purposes,
2001000	2007000	then it will introduce a term which means registration for copyright purposes.
2007000	2012000	The Darwin-Cora is sometimes first order in that sense.
2012000	2016000	So I think I have an example here.
2016000	2024000	So establishment means is defined as a process by which an individual establishes itself.
2024000	2025000	So that's first order.
2025000	2029000	The term refers to what we would think the term would mean.
2029000	2034000	But behavior in Darwin-Cora is defined as the second order.
2034000	2036000	Behavior doesn't mean behavior in the Darwin-Cora.
2036000	2039000	It means the description of behavior.
2039000	2040000	So it's second order.
2040000	2051000	And very many terms in the Darwin-Cora are terms of the form an X is information about an X.
2051000	2058000	So a good clean first order terminology would define every term as an X is an X.
2058000	2062000	Darwin-Cora defines very many terms as an X is an information about X.
2062000	2065000	Now that's a mistake.
2065000	2068000	If it was done systematically, it might be okay.
2068000	2071000	But generally it's not been done systematically.
2071000	2075000	And it's a mistake which has to be fixed.
2075000	2083000	And the reason why I draw attention to this one is because other similar resources.
2083000	2086000	So there's one very famous resource in medicine called HL7.
2086000	2088000	Made exactly the same mistake.
2088000	2091000	And the result is that it's now unusable.
2091000	2096000	It's so complicated because people never know whether they're talking about X.
2096000	2102000	For instance, somebody giving somebody a drug or information about X,
2102000	2106000	which would be the description of somebody giving somebody a drug.
2106000	2109000	Now I don't know why I'm addressing this comment to you,
2109000	2112000	because it's really a comment to all Darwin-Core people.
2112000	2116000	But this is something which needs to be got right, I think.
2116000	2127000	In what sense is divusing the term evidence that clashes with other uses of the word evidence?
2127000	2132000	Because you don't mean any kind of evidence.
2132000	2137000	You mean evidence incorporated in a certain collection object,
2137000	2141000	either as a report or as a seed sample.
2141000	2149000	That really, from our point of view, a token could be any kind of evidence.
2149000	2154000	I mean, it could be a photograph, it could be a specimen,
2154000	2157000	it could be notes that somebody has written down.
2157000	2161000	So we really didn't have a restriction as to what that should be.
2161000	2163000	And maybe that's not well-defined enough,
2163000	2168000	but the reason why we added these two blue bubbles in the middle
2168000	2172000	is mostly because of the extreme overloading of occurrence.
2172000	2175000	You know, you would ask people what does an occurrence mean,
2175000	2181000	and they would say it means that there was an organism at a particular location in a particular time.
2181000	2184000	But then when you would see how people were actually using the term occurrence,
2184000	2189000	they were using it to mean a specimen glued onto a piece of paper.
2189000	2195000	So, you know, it may be that we didn't choose the best terms for these classes that we introduced,
2195000	2200000	but it was an attempt to try to separate out some of the different ways
2200000	2205000	that people were using a term, particularly occurrence.
2205000	2209000	In this case, we're not arguing about the term class, which is a token,
2209000	2214000	but the word for the property, which has evidence, or evidence for,
2214000	2221000	and I guess I can't see the way you're using it, sort of, you know,
2221000	2224000	I can't see the way you're using it being incompatible.
2224000	2232000	What I came up with in Darwin S.W. was really a compromise between Kim and me about,
2232000	2238000	and actually originally I had suggested that we don't even have a class called token,
2238000	2242000	that we have the terms that are shown on the slide there,
2242000	2250000	like is basis for identification and identification based on, or evidence for, or has evidence,
2250000	2254000	those terms could simply be applied to anything that people would use for evidence,
2254000	2259000	and so I actually was originally advocating that we don't have a class named token,
2259000	2267000	and Kim said, let's have a class named token so that we could say what the object,
2267000	2273000	we could have a term to describe what the object of something like has evidence,
2273000	2276000	what is that an instance of.
2276000	2281000	I didn't really see token as a thing necessarily that needed to be defined.
2281000	2287000	Yeah, so I have right now, just for, I guess contrast,
2287000	2300000	Pete's taxonconcept.org, so Pete DeVries has put a lot of time into not only creating an ontology,
2300000	2307000	but populating it and putting a sparkle front end onto the resulting knowledge base,
2307000	2314000	and Barry, I wonder if, you know, he takes the approach that I think that Barry is suggesting
2314000	2319000	where there's no ambiguity in the term, identification has label image,
2319000	2325000	so the domain of the term is part of the property.
2325000	2331000	I don't like that. That commits the sin of not reusing established relations,
2331000	2333000	but inventing new ones.
2333000	2352000	I don't like it either, but it, I mean, it, in a sense, it's of the same approach as,
2352000	2361000	so why don't you like it?
2361000	2370000	Because relations are the glue, and they are going to be gluing different ontology resources,
2370000	2373000	as well as gluing terms within ontology resources,
2373000	2378000	and that means that we need, as far as possible, to have a small number of relations which everyone uses,
2378000	2385000	rather than having highly specific relations which are tied just to a particular small locus.
2385000	2390000	So the more we can have generalizable glue, like part of and so forth,
2390000	2394000	the more our ontologies will work well together.
2394000	2398000	And it's, so one of the things that you said earlier is right.
2398000	2404000	If people get hold of owl, if people get hold of owl, they'll do bad things.
2404000	2410000	Owl is such a nice thing. You can create all kinds of filigree with owl,
2410000	2413000	and most of it doesn't have any thought attached to it.
2413000	2417000	So owl is not good enough. What you need is owl plus thinking,
2417000	2420000	and that's why writing English definitions is a good thing.
2420000	2427000	Now one way in which once people get hold of owl, they go mad is inventing these new relations.
2427000	2432000	Has Paris temperature preference for,
2432000	2436000	which means they like Paris because it's hot or something?
2444000	2450000	Yeah, that's one step in the right direction, but ideally you don't need a relation with the word Paris.
2450000	2457000	So what is the guideline for when you have a special relationship that you call out and define
2457000	2460000	when you try to just use some generics?
2460000	2465000	So providing you define the relation, you can always eliminate it if you need to.
2465000	2470000	So that's already a good step, but that's another reason why we need to have definitions.
2470000	2473000	Right, so taking the example has evidence.
2473000	2481000	You were suggesting that that needs to be qualified so that we know this is Darwin has evidence.
2481000	2487000	So I think evidence could be the subject of another three-day meeting all by itself.
2487000	2496000	So that evidence is a very difficult topic, and I think that what you really mean by evidence
2496000	2502000	is the stuff in the box, whether it's a piece of paper or a photograph or a seed stuck to a piece of paper.
2502000	2512000	You don't mean evidence in the sense in which most scientists mean evidence, which is arguments, data.
2512000	2515000	You mean that specific stuff in the box.
2515000	2524000	But Steve, everything that Steve would call evidence that also fits your definition of evidence.
2524000	2525000	Wait a second.
2525000	2526000	Yeah, and vice versa.
2526000	2529000	No, but it doesn't because it doesn't.
2530000	2537000	So let's suppose that somebody steals something from Eric, is it?
2537000	2538000	You're Herbarium.
2538000	2539000	Greg.
2539000	2540000	Greg.
2540000	2541000	Greg, sorry.
2541000	2542000	At least I got a number of letters.
2542000	2549000	Somebody steals a box from Greg's Herbarium and gives it to his girlfriend as a Christmas present.
2549000	2552000	And it's a nice flower or something, so she's happy.
2552000	2554000	That's not Eric's girlfriend, is it?
2554000	2558000	No, the thief gives it to his girlfriend.
2558000	2563000	Then it's the same object, but it's not evidence.
2563000	2567000	Evidence is a role that an object plays or something like that.
2567000	2570000	An object is not evidence.
2570000	2577000	Having this category of token is really what do you call specimens?
2577000	2582000	And I think people have been saying that specimens are occurrences.
2582000	2589000	If you ask people what they mean when they say occurrence, they don't really mean a specimen.
2589000	2594000	And so the question, the problem is that within the existing Darwin core classes,
2594000	2605000	there isn't really any class that's appropriate to place the descriptive metadata about a specimen.
2606000	2616000	I think there needs to be perhaps some other classes that are related to organisms and parts of organisms.
2616000	2621000	But we didn't define in Darwin SW.
2621000	2624000	I mean, I think they need to be defined.
2624000	2629000	But those are the kinds of things that could be used as evidence.
2629000	2633000	So I think everyone agrees with that proposal that you just made.
2633000	2636000	That's one I've talked to anyway.
2636000	2640000	Right now it's 11.30, and we were going to move on to end vote too.
2640000	2645000	So that might be a good stopping point, unless there's any other pressing...
2645000	2653000	I just wanted to clarify, and I think I'm not sure if the impression that you've got of people in this room is complete.
2653000	2662000	In that is that the Darwin core was a synthesis of people focused on observation data, monitoring data,
2662000	2666000	there's no evidence except what the human saw and then records.
2666000	2668000	But then there would be the record.
2668000	2670000	Can I ask?
2670000	2675000	Or if it's a digital or whatever, and then there's the stuff in the box that could be a physicist.
2675000	2677000	Okay, that's fine, but we...
2677000	2684000	This may be a question for Steve, but I mean, it seems like there should be or is at least a philosophical relationship
2684000	2687000	between token and basis of reference. Is that correct?
2687000	2692000	I couldn't hear the whole question.
2692000	2702000	It seems like there's at least a philosophical or underlying relationship between the Darwin core term, basis of record,
2702000	2708000	and what you guys are referring to as tokens, which is basically a basis for an assertion or a word.
2708000	2711000	I think you were right.
2711000	2715000	Yeah, isn't that right, Steve, that you were trying to clarify basis of record?
2716000	2720000	Were we trying to clarify basis of record?
2720000	2730000	Well, in other words, the difference is though that it's really not the basis of the record,
2730000	2738000	it's the basis of the assertion that a certain individual occurred in a certain place.
2738000	2742000	And again, basis of record seemed, and Steve, I think...
2742000	2748000	Maybe Steve should say why he didn't use basis of record, but that seemed tied to collection objects.
2748000	2756000	Well, basis of record is another thing that I think is overloaded, because when you look at the possible values for it,
2756000	2761000	it contains things like location, events, identifications.
2761000	2770000	So I think part of the problem is what basis of record means isn't exactly clear.
2773000	2777000	So I promised John that I'd make way for Norman.
2777000	2782000	I wanted to mention an ontology that Bob Morris developed,
2782000	2791000	primarily taking Darwin SW and then grafting on some pieces of Roger Hayam's earlier Tadwick ontology
2791000	2800000	for certain components of AOD records, data annotation records.
2800000	2804000	And I told him I wanted to mention it, so I'll just read you what it replied.
2804000	2808000	If you say anything at all about it, it probably should be that it is an ontology of convenience
2808000	2815000	for dealing with the concerns of curators largely made by trimming Darwin SW, adding some things from the Tadwick ontologies.
2815000	2822000	And then it goes on to say, I think section undertaking needs a workshop of comparable length to the one in Kansas,
2822000	2830000	and maybe this is also a viewer's preview of the discussions tomorrow, which would be where do we take this...
