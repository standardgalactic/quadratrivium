00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
John asked me, in the absence of Stephen Camm, who developed Darwinist W, John asked me to talk a little bit about it.

00:11.000 --> 00:23.000
And I thought I would, it's okay with everybody, take the liberty of situating that work in the context of the general issue of how to represent Darwin core in RDF.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
And so, because I know that both Stephen Camm have created Darwinist W for two reasons.

00:32.000 --> 00:43.000
One, they had an immediate need to represent data and perhaps before consensus was reached within TADWIG about how exactly to do that.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
And two, they saw it as a first step towards building consensus around a canonical way to do it.

00:51.000 --> 01:06.000
But I think that everybody, with one exception at the end, who has sort of proposed a way of doing it, agrees that these are initial steps and some consensus and further thought is required.

01:06.000 --> 01:16.000
So the first thing, so just to give a brief overview, even before we talk about any extensions, I wanted to illustrate the fact that Darwin core as it is is an ontology.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
And like any ontology, you can represent data with it and you can query over that data.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
And then we can talk a little bit about some of the shortcomings in Darwin core as it is an ontology and some of the proposed solutions.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
So I'll exit out of the show.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll wait for refresh at 75 Hertz.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
So here is Darwin core.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
This is the canonical description.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
It's, you can see in the URL, it's an RDF document.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
This is the HTML representation of it.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
And it is, as John said, a bag of terms.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Behavior, binomial, collection ID, decimal latitude.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
You can look at its RDF representation.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
It's somewhat difficult to read in Safari.

02:20.000 --> 02:38.000
But the, you know, John said that when they created this canonical RDF representation, they sort of didn't have the semantic web in mind or rather they had it in mind and didn't want to deal with it because I thought it would be dealt with later on.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
But to my mind, this is well suited for the semantic web and is a legitimate ontology in its own right.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
It's a list of the things that there are in the world of biodiversity.

02:54.000 --> 03:10.000
And to illustrate that, I expressed the occurrences from the Woods Hole Bioblitz in RDF only using the Darwin core namespace.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
So without, without any additions, you could say, well, so here's, here's an occurrence and here are a couple.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
There are two different identifications of it.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
One saying it was an ampelopsis and one saying that it was something else.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Parthenosisis kinchifolia.

03:29.000 --> 03:39.000
And then each of those identifications and occurrences have their own, have their own good.

03:39.000 --> 03:51.000
And you might, this right away sort of illustrates one of the, one of the issues that here identification is being used as a property of occurrence.

03:51.000 --> 04:03.000
But then if you, if you look at the GUID of that identification, you'll see that you can also use identification as a class.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And that's, that's okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
The reasoners don't, you know, overheat and, and blow a fuse because of course a property is a class.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
And so there's no, you know, there's no, not necessarily attention there.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Nevertheless, it's, you know, it's bad form, of course.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I mean, I think to have the same term that's both a property and a class.

04:27.000 --> 04:41.000
So at a minimum, my suggestion, you know, as a first layer, semantic layer would be to roughly double the number of terms and to introduce, you know, disambiguate when you're using identification as a class and when you're using it as a property.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
So introduce a hazard identification, hazard occurrence, hazard habitat, et cetera.

04:50.000 --> 05:06.000
But even as it is, you can, you know, reason over the data, you can issue sparkle queries and, and get, you know, get answers.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
So I guess we're going to be talking more this afternoon and tomorrow.

05:14.000 --> 05:25.000
But I guess my viewer, the viewer's preview of my position is that I think we should make as small changes to the existing way of doing things as possible.

05:26.000 --> 05:35.000
So the next, so, so Steve, now I've opened up Darwin S.W., the class diagram.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
I know that it can't be seen from the back, but it can't be seen any, any better on the slide.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
If you, if you click on the last, the ready talk slide there, it'll show the same thing we have.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Okay.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
The one.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Ready talk, here we go.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
So.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
That's what's being shown.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
All right.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
So can you go to the slide that has the, the class diagram?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I think it's the third slide.

06:02.000 --> 06:21.000
So as there was a lot of discussion, as John was mentioning about how to move, how to, how to move Darwin core, how to make Darwin core more appropriate for, for, for representing data in RDF and on the semantic web in general.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
And a lot of it centered around the overloading of the term occurrence.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
So Steve, since you're with us, I'll let you talk about, you know, Darwin S.W. in a minute.

06:32.000 --> 06:44.000
But I wanted to sort of just say what, what I think is it's, you know, most important contribution, which is that it teases out some of the overloading of occurrence that went on.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And, and it does this by introducing a new term token.

06:48.000 --> 07:07.000
So, and John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that part of the issue was that coming out of a collections mentality, an occurrence was thought of as it could be a specimen or it could be an image or it could be a tissue sample.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
And, or it could just be something that, that you, that you saw.

07:12.000 --> 07:24.000
And so Steve says, well, actually, to be more correct, the specimen or the tissue sample or the photograph are tokens of the occurrence.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Word of mouth could be a token of the occurrence and those tokens all serve as evidence.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
So I think he settled on token because evidence, he tried to introduce the term evidence.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
I might be wrong about the history and then there was too much argument over what evidence properly means and so he settled on token.

07:42.000 --> 07:55.000
Similarly, he tried to introduce the term individual and I think there was agreement that that would be a good term to add, a good concept to add to the graph.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
But there is no agreement on what it should be called and what its scope should be and whether it would include a flock of geese or a pack of wolves.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
And so I think that's left out, right? So there's still no individual in Darwin Corps.

08:07.000 --> 08:20.000
Individual Darwin Corps, but the discussion did go forward and accept as a scope for the concept of populations down to mixed tax on things.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Right.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And it would be called enormous.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
So that's still though to be, that's not yet introduced.

08:26.000 --> 08:54.000
So the other thing to, I guess, notice is that these classes and the properties associated to them are normalized in the sense that if you look at identification, that can only be applied to a token, not to an occurrence or so.

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
And similarly, the tax on itself, which is the determination, is then a property of the identification.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Joel, can you do full screen?

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, that would be a good idea.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
That's a great idea.

09:13.000 --> 09:21.000
So just to point to what I was talking to, here's the occurrence, here are the new terms, token and individual organism.

09:21.000 --> 09:35.000
And looking back, I didn't find the email, but from about two years ago, when a Darwin Corps was first represented in that RDF manner, there was a question, should there be any domain constraints on any of these terms, like, for example, identification?

09:35.000 --> 09:46.000
And the decision was made, you know, no, because that could lead to too much potential for misuse if people apply these terms.

09:46.000 --> 09:58.000
And this is something that I'm, you know, interested in, is in a very loose context, if people are applying identifications to samples or to pictures or to occurrences or to organisms.

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
But Steve is sort of much more principled and says, you know, identification properly has, you know, the domain of the token.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Is there identification by identification?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Steve?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm sorry, what was the question?

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
The question is, is there a definition of identification?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
And I think...

10:22.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, I mean, identification, in all of the Darwin Corps classes, there's not a clear definition in the sense of what the, how they are connected to the other classes.

10:40.000 --> 10:51.000
And I mean, I think that identification, well, identification connects something to a taxon concept.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And I guess the question is, what is that something that is being identified?

10:55.000 --> 11:09.000
So, you know, we took the position that identification was connecting some kind of a nebulous thing,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
which we call the individual organism to a taxon.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Is the, is an identification an event?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yes.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm sorry?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Is identification an event?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
No.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
It is not defined as an event.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
It's defined as a category of information in Darwin Corps.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Result of the event.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Conceptually, it is an event.

11:37.000 --> 11:49.000
The term event in Darwin Corps derives from the Dublin Corps, which is why it doesn't say collecting event within the current session or the current sense of Darwin Corps.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
So, we know there are many kinds of events in all the work we do.

11:53.000 --> 12:06.000
So, I'll make a general point, which is, if you're going to do a semantic version of the Darwin Corps, then you need definitions, which would be formulated using something like owl.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
That's, you should be nodding your head.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Well, only if I agree with you, right?

12:14.000 --> 12:26.000
And then the second point I would make is that, at the moment, I think many of these terms are just going to create puzzlement, because they're so abstract.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.000
So, most people don't use token in their daily data collection business, I would suppose.

12:33.000 --> 12:42.000
Can they understand, actually, and the work we just pointed out, some of the problems with the n-view of the year that we're dealing with, in that you do have tractable terms of the year.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
Identification, and it has a definition, says it's information, or category of information.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
That's not, it doesn't tell you much.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It says a thing.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
But at the same time, it's the same point I got here.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh, wait.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
In my mind, when you say identification, I see a process.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I see a narrative.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
We have a long history of modeling in this community.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
As I was telling, you know, it goes back to, you know, 92 or 90 when we started doing this.

13:14.000 --> 13:29.000
And it's an identification as an event with, as an association of something biological with a taxonomy done by someone at some time is common to virtually all the models that we have done.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
When they have that.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Except that it's not an event.

13:32.000 --> 13:43.000
Except that in the Darwin court, because we didn't do assembly of terms into concepts like this, you know, the structure that we've been talking about, it's not included.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
So I'm making a general point that if you're using abstract terms, that's fine.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
But then you're not going to help the user unless you define those abstract terms.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
And if he said, but we have an established community here, which knows what they're doing, you're creating a mystery.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Because you want your data to be viewable from the outside by Japanese people with really nice machines.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
They will not understand.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Japanese have really nice machines.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
This is the point that we're at.

14:12.000 --> 14:22.000
We're at the point of saying, yes, we all agree that we need to have a structural thing that's called a taxonomic identification or something like that.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
And that it has the properties or that it has the same basic shape as an event.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
Although, I mean, defining identification as an event, I'm not saying it isn't.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I'm not saying.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
No, I don't care how it's done.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I just want to see the result.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
But I'm just saying that if you want to avoid, that could also be confusing.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
If the goal is to avoid confusion, people have an idea of what identification is.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Is it an event?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
So I don't know.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I'm just saying you need definitions.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
And there is a way of doing definitions within the semantic web, which is well understood and which will give you all kinds of benefits.

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
But just let me let me repeat what John and I discussed yesterday.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
You have Darwin Core.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
It's full of terms.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It's full of quasi-definition.

15:11.000 --> 15:25.000
Go through Darwin Core as it is and try and define every single term using our, which is the standard that we're more or less forced to use for doing this currently.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Sometimes it will be easy.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
A comment.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah?

15:30.000 --> 15:45.000
I think one of the way we looked at things like identification, occurrence, and event, in some sense, there are nodes that connect different things.

15:45.000 --> 15:55.000
So, you know, identification is the thing that connects an organism to a taxon or a taxon concept.

15:55.000 --> 16:14.000
And so I think that was one of the reasons why when we got hung up on trying to define what these different things meant, that really we were essentially talking about joins between other categories of things.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
So that is one way of doing definitions.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
When you do it, then we will see whether the definition is intelligible.

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
But the result has to help people to understand what particular data expressed in a certain way means.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
And it has to help people understand how to annotate their own data in the same way.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
And it seems that within this community, there are indeed people who know exactly what you just said means.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I don't know what it means.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
And I can see all kinds of objections that other people might have based on what you've said.

16:52.000 --> 17:04.000
But Barry, I mean, sometimes the semantics that can be expressed in English, I mean, do you say that the full semantics that would express natural language should be expressed in owl?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
What I say is there should be an experiment.

17:07.000 --> 17:16.000
Take the Darwin quote, try and define all the terms using owl, because that's the standard that we're forced to use today.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And see what you get.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You will learn all kinds of things.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
You will learn that you don't know whether identification is an event or not an event, maybe.

17:26.000 --> 17:36.000
I know that the word token is used in a funny way, because some things which meet the definition of token are not listed on the token within the structure that you have now.

17:36.000 --> 17:47.000
And then the ontology that will be generated automatically from that set of definitions, when you run it through the reasoner, will give you a list of categorization errors.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm assuming.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
So this is an experiment.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I have no idea how it will turn out.

17:51.000 --> 18:00.000
Once you get that list, you can change some of the definitions and you can consult with your colleagues to find better definitions.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And the result will be something which will be a step forward.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Maybe it won't replace the Darwin quote, but it will be a step forward and understand it.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Right.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
So I mean, those experiments have been done.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
They're being done, you know, as we speak.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
And it's not clear to me that it will result in a step forward.

18:22.000 --> 18:32.000
And for example, if you get a categorization error, we don't need to classify.

18:32.000 --> 18:46.000
I mean, in a lot of ontology applications, the goal is to classify the ontology to get a complete listing of the type hierarchy, of the class hierarchy, and also an instance categorization.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
But the artifacts of biodiversity informatics are typed.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
They come typed.

18:54.000 --> 19:06.000
I mean, we don't need to, you know, run some record into a machine and know whether or not that's an identification.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I mean, it will tell us it's an identification.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
If something's a picture, if something's a digital still image, we'll know that it's a digital still image.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I truly think that you do need to do this.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
It's a basic quality assurance step.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
And anyone who's working with this magic web would assume that that would be the basic step that everyone does.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, that's, I mean, the fact that you don't want to do it is strange.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
It's like not wanting to use a spellchecker.

19:35.000 --> 19:44.000
Well, I mean, not every class, if you want to say, I mean, a class is defined simply by introducing it as a class.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
You need to define it.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
It inherits from our class.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And there, it's defined.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
And now, as human beings, we attach some meaning to it.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
And so we write our application code to understand that term according to our understanding of it.

19:59.000 --> 20:08.000
And yes, there's a vision of the semantic web in which, you know, we don't have to write the code because we'll have general purpose processors

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
that can look at the machine definition and understand how to process it.

20:15.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm not saying that that won't happen, but it doesn't have to happen to get a lot of value out of the semantic web.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Let me, let me just say one more thing.

20:26.000 --> 20:35.000
So the gene ontology used to be a very clunky back of the envelope word list, just a very, very minimal structure.

20:35.000 --> 20:43.000
After a few years, people have the idea to try and produce logically coherent definitions of the gene ontology terms.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Immediately, immediately, they started that with just a few definitions.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
They discovered errors, they discovered gaps.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
And when they actually finished with all the definitions, they discovered all kinds of interesting things about the ontology,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
which helped the ontology from a biological point of view.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
It became better in every respect.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Now, you should want to do that.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It's a healthy desire.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
It's a sign of a clean living individual.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
The fact that you don't want to do it is strange.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
I mean, I think a rule of ontologies should be no naked terms.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Except highly general primitives.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Because you can't define everything.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
You can't define everything like the W3 specs or in some sort of a form.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, but you can't define everything.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Otherwise, you would have an infinite change.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
You have to use some words without that.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
It becomes problematic.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
But, you know, at the level that we're talking about in Darwin Park, we completely agree with Barry.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Minimally, we should have a natural language definition and ideally something a bit more formal.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Well, I certainly agree we should have a natural language definition.

21:46.000 --> 21:56.000
But I think a legitimate vision for the semantic web is that the ontologies serve as dictionaries for human users,

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
that you have the namespace, and you say, if we're talking about a Darwin core identification,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
everybody can look and say, oh, that's what a Darwin core identification is.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Anybody that can understand natural language.

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
And then only write code that uses Darwin core colon identification in that way.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
And that, I think, is already a big step forward because you have a canonical place where people look and say,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
if you're using a DWC identification, you have to use it in this way.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
So, if you want to say that there shouldn't be naked terms, I can't know.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
I don't know what there should and shouldn't be, but I know that there is value from naked terms.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Because 90% of the value of the semantic web comes from the namespace.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It comes from the disambiguation.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
For any naked term you put up there, unless you want it to be completely unconstrained,

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
run a little bit of a few hints about usage or formal definitions.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
I think it can do nothing but help as long as it doesn't over constrain.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But you can try to constrain it as much as you want.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
But those hints can be in English. They don't have to be in Al.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
What's the danger of that? What do you lose by having them in Al?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I don't get what the resistance is to it.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Because it's a lot harder to figure out how to model them in Al.

23:10.000 --> 23:18.000
Well, because it's a lot easier than for people to say things that they don't really mean.

23:18.000 --> 23:32.000
For example, the Darwin core type hierarchy used to define subclasses of events

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
and subclasses of collection events, subclasses of specimens.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
And it was pointed out, and I think it was Steve that pointed it out,

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
that the result was that a preserved specimen is an event.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Obviously, if your Al hierarchy is wrong, it's going to cause problems.

23:54.000 --> 24:03.000
For a particular point of view, from a particular point of view, that Al hierarchy was right.

24:04.000 --> 24:14.000
Another example is that one of the first descriptions of terms that people add,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
especially if they're using protégé because it encourages it, is domain constraints.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
What does this term apply to?

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
But, of course, those constraints don't act as integrity constraints as they do in a database.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
They act as grist for a reasoning mill.

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
And so now, if you say identification, and Steve gets to this, if we ever get to his slides,

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
we'll see that he recognizes this as one of the potential criticism,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
one of the criticisms of his current representation,

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
is that by having this highly normalized view where identification only applies to a token,

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
if somebody identifies an image using the term identification,

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
then that reasoner will assume that, well, okay, an image is a token.

25:02.000 --> 25:10.000
If somebody identifies, well, what if somebody identifies an occurrence,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
then you have to reason that the occurrence is a token.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
If somebody tries to identify a species...

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
If they identify wrong, they're not using the definition of...

25:17.000 --> 25:24.000
This is exactly my point, is that the more complicated the ontology it is,

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
the easier it is to say things that have implications that you don't want to imply.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
So the idea is that you would have good language definitions to help the user,

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
and you would have good logical definitions to do basic quality control.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Doing both of those will help the other.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So you'll get better English definitions by doing the logic.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
You'll get better logical definitions by doing the English definitions.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
And users will have some clue as to how to use.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Like, if I go to the Dharma Corp. now as a naive user,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I wouldn't know how to use the term because I don't know what they're supposed to mean.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And there's no guidance for me.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
There's no logical relationship that attacks the definitions are vague.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So I don't know what to put where.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
I'm even saying, like in semantic Dharma Corp.

26:10.000 --> 26:18.000
Saying that an occurrence is a junction of an event with an identification,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
I think it's helpful compared to the circular definition that exists in the current Dharma Corp.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Dharma Corp. standard that says an occurrence is an occurrence.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
And I think it's a good practice to have those best practice examples.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
They established within all the Ikea world that I think nearly everywhere they are needed.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
You need some guidelines with good examples in there where you can find yourself again with fewer things.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
I just say one thing.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
Buffer is designed to incorporate exactly those best practices.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
And if you're forced to specify whether a token is an occurrence or a continuum,

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
or whether an identification is an occurrence or a continuum,

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
that will bring almost cost-free and immediate improvement in usability.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Do you want to show the slides?

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah, Steve, are you still in the mood to go through your slides?

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
Yeah, well, I don't know if you have to go through all of them,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
but could you go back one slide from the one you're on right now?

27:24.000 --> 27:32.000
So, I mean, this is really the kind of core relationships between the different classes.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
And, you know, the discussion was going on about, like, well, what is an identification?

27:39.000 --> 27:49.000
And essentially, the reason identification has to be in there is because you have many to one relationship

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
between taxons and identifications.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
There can be many identifications that relate to a particular taxon concept.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
And likewise, the reason that there's a connection between identification and an organism

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
is because you can have many identifications for a particular organism.

28:11.000 --> 28:19.000
So essentially, each of those connections between the pink things there represent one to many relationships.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
And that's why they were separated out as different classes.

28:23.000 --> 28:33.000
So, I don't, you know, I didn't get terribly hung up on what the exact definition was of event or occurrence,

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
but just simply saying that there are connections between things where you have one to many relationships.

28:41.000 --> 28:50.000
The blue section in the middle, could you advance down two slides?

28:50.000 --> 28:58.000
This is, I think, the place where we sort of don't have agreement on what the structure of this should be.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
I mean, the slide that I just showed you, there really seemed to be more or less a consensus among people

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
in our discussion that that was how things were related.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
But in terms of what's the relationship between identifications and occurrences,

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
you know, we stuck this thing which essentially should have probably been defined

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
as taxonomically heterogeneous identity in between identifications and occurrences.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
And what exactly that means is a subject of discussion.

29:32.000 --> 29:38.000
But I think the idea of token, really, if you just don't call it token and you call it evidence,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
that essentially defines what token is.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
It could be evidence that an organism occurred at a particular spot.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
It could be evidence that's the basis for an identification.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It's just simply evidence.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
And it could even be the same thing as an individual organism,

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
or it could be something derived from an individual organism.

29:58.000 --> 30:11.000
So, you know, what we call token just simply means evidence of some form.

30:11.000 --> 30:20.000
So, anyway, that's about all I wanted to say.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
So, Steve, you haven't been here for earlier discussions,

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
but one, I've made a series of very simple and very boring points.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
And I'll continue to make them until I die.

30:32.000 --> 30:40.000
And one boring point that I've made is that when you're building an ontology or a terminology resource,

30:40.000 --> 30:47.000
then you should be aware of using a very general term which has all kinds of meanings in other contexts

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
to mean exactly what you want to mean for your specific purpose.

30:52.000 --> 30:58.000
And one of the reasons why that is a bad thing is because other people are going to want to use the data

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
which you've annotated using your resource to do all kinds of unanticipated things.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
And if they find that you're using a word that for them has a much more general meaning,

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
then they will not find it easy to use the data annotated in your terms.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
Now, the word evidence is going to be used by nearly every scientist.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And it's going to mean statistical evidence.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
It's going to mean evidence on the basis of what was calculated.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
It's going to mean evidence in your sense, evidence pertaining to a sample, for instance.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
So, you shouldn't use the word evidence.

31:36.000 --> 31:43.000
Maybe you can call it Darwin evidence or Herborium evidence, but you can't just call it evidence.

31:43.000 --> 31:50.000
Right. Well, I mean, this is a part of the whole problem with defining what an individual organism was

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
because the term individual has a particular meaning.

31:55.000 --> 32:03.000
And so that's why it really probably should have been called taxonomically homogenous entity

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
because that's essentially what we intended for it to mean.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
But, you know, there's history in what people call things.

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
And, you know, I'm not sure what the best thing, token, was something that basically we made up.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
And so that might be a better term than evidence.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Token is not a good word because it too has a history, unfortunately.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
So this is really hard.

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
What is almost every term you can think of to use has somebody has used previously to mean something?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Absolutely.

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
So maybe long names like Darwin-Cora evidence or something are better.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
So it's hard work, but it has been done successfully in many different fields.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
And we've learned things. There are some lessons learned from all of that.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm just going to mention one further lesson learned because I think it's important to see one difference

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
between the Dublin-Cora and the Darwin-Cora.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
The Dublin-Cora is pretty straightforwardly what we might call first order.

33:11.000 --> 33:21.000
And what that means is that if it's talking about, say, a registration for copyright purposes,

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
then it will introduce a term which means registration for copyright purposes.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
The Darwin-Cora is sometimes first order in that sense.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
So I think I have an example here.

33:36.000 --> 33:44.000
So establishment means is defined as a process by which an individual establishes itself.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
So that's first order.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
The term refers to what we would think the term would mean.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
But behavior in Darwin-Cora is defined as the second order.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Behavior doesn't mean behavior in the Darwin-Cora.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
It means the description of behavior.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
So it's second order.

34:00.000 --> 34:11.000
And very many terms in the Darwin-Cora are terms of the form an X is information about an X.

34:11.000 --> 34:18.000
So a good clean first order terminology would define every term as an X is an X.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
Darwin-Cora defines very many terms as an X is an information about X.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Now that's a mistake.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
If it was done systematically, it might be okay.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
But generally it's not been done systematically.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
And it's a mistake which has to be fixed.

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
And the reason why I draw attention to this one is because other similar resources.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
So there's one very famous resource in medicine called HL7.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Made exactly the same mistake.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
And the result is that it's now unusable.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
It's so complicated because people never know whether they're talking about X.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
For instance, somebody giving somebody a drug or information about X,

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
which would be the description of somebody giving somebody a drug.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Now I don't know why I'm addressing this comment to you,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
because it's really a comment to all Darwin-Core people.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
But this is something which needs to be got right, I think.

35:16.000 --> 35:27.000
In what sense is divusing the term evidence that clashes with other uses of the word evidence?

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
Because you don't mean any kind of evidence.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
You mean evidence incorporated in a certain collection object,

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
either as a report or as a seed sample.

35:41.000 --> 35:49.000
That really, from our point of view, a token could be any kind of evidence.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
I mean, it could be a photograph, it could be a specimen,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
it could be notes that somebody has written down.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
So we really didn't have a restriction as to what that should be.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And maybe that's not well-defined enough,

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
but the reason why we added these two blue bubbles in the middle

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
is mostly because of the extreme overloading of occurrence.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
You know, you would ask people what does an occurrence mean,

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
and they would say it means that there was an organism at a particular location in a particular time.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
But then when you would see how people were actually using the term occurrence,

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
they were using it to mean a specimen glued onto a piece of paper.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
So, you know, it may be that we didn't choose the best terms for these classes that we introduced,

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
but it was an attempt to try to separate out some of the different ways

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
that people were using a term, particularly occurrence.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
In this case, we're not arguing about the term class, which is a token,

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
but the word for the property, which has evidence, or evidence for,

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
and I guess I can't see the way you're using it, sort of, you know,

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
I can't see the way you're using it being incompatible.

37:04.000 --> 37:12.000
What I came up with in Darwin S.W. was really a compromise between Kim and me about,

37:12.000 --> 37:18.000
and actually originally I had suggested that we don't even have a class called token,

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
that we have the terms that are shown on the slide there,

37:22.000 --> 37:30.000
like is basis for identification and identification based on, or evidence for, or has evidence,

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
those terms could simply be applied to anything that people would use for evidence,

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
and so I actually was originally advocating that we don't have a class named token,

37:39.000 --> 37:47.000
and Kim said, let's have a class named token so that we could say what the object,

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
we could have a term to describe what the object of something like has evidence,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
what is that an instance of.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
I didn't really see token as a thing necessarily that needed to be defined.

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah, so I have right now, just for, I guess contrast,

38:07.000 --> 38:20.000
Pete's taxonconcept.org, so Pete DeVries has put a lot of time into not only creating an ontology,

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
but populating it and putting a sparkle front end onto the resulting knowledge base,

38:27.000 --> 38:34.000
and Barry, I wonder if, you know, he takes the approach that I think that Barry is suggesting

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
where there's no ambiguity in the term, identification has label image,

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
so the domain of the term is part of the property.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
I don't like that. That commits the sin of not reusing established relations,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
but inventing new ones.

38:53.000 --> 39:12.000
I don't like it either, but it, I mean, it, in a sense, it's of the same approach as,

39:12.000 --> 39:21.000
so why don't you like it?

39:21.000 --> 39:30.000
Because relations are the glue, and they are going to be gluing different ontology resources,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
as well as gluing terms within ontology resources,

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
and that means that we need, as far as possible, to have a small number of relations which everyone uses,

39:38.000 --> 39:45.000
rather than having highly specific relations which are tied just to a particular small locus.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
So the more we can have generalizable glue, like part of and so forth,

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
the more our ontologies will work well together.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
And it's, so one of the things that you said earlier is right.

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
If people get hold of owl, if people get hold of owl, they'll do bad things.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
Owl is such a nice thing. You can create all kinds of filigree with owl,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
and most of it doesn't have any thought attached to it.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
So owl is not good enough. What you need is owl plus thinking,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
and that's why writing English definitions is a good thing.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
Now one way in which once people get hold of owl, they go mad is inventing these new relations.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Has Paris temperature preference for,

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
which means they like Paris because it's hot or something?

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
Yeah, that's one step in the right direction, but ideally you don't need a relation with the word Paris.

40:50.000 --> 40:57.000
So what is the guideline for when you have a special relationship that you call out and define

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
when you try to just use some generics?

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
So providing you define the relation, you can always eliminate it if you need to.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
So that's already a good step, but that's another reason why we need to have definitions.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Right, so taking the example has evidence.

41:13.000 --> 41:21.000
You were suggesting that that needs to be qualified so that we know this is Darwin has evidence.

41:21.000 --> 41:27.000
So I think evidence could be the subject of another three-day meeting all by itself.

41:27.000 --> 41:36.000
So that evidence is a very difficult topic, and I think that what you really mean by evidence

41:36.000 --> 41:42.000
is the stuff in the box, whether it's a piece of paper or a photograph or a seed stuck to a piece of paper.

41:42.000 --> 41:52.000
You don't mean evidence in the sense in which most scientists mean evidence, which is arguments, data.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
You mean that specific stuff in the box.

41:55.000 --> 42:04.000
But Steve, everything that Steve would call evidence that also fits your definition of evidence.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Wait a second.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, and vice versa.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
No, but it doesn't because it doesn't.

42:10.000 --> 42:17.000
So let's suppose that somebody steals something from Eric, is it?

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
You're Herbarium.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Greg.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Greg.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
Greg, sorry.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
At least I got a number of letters.

42:22.000 --> 42:29.000
Somebody steals a box from Greg's Herbarium and gives it to his girlfriend as a Christmas present.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
And it's a nice flower or something, so she's happy.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
That's not Eric's girlfriend, is it?

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
No, the thief gives it to his girlfriend.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
Then it's the same object, but it's not evidence.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Evidence is a role that an object plays or something like that.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
An object is not evidence.

42:50.000 --> 42:57.000
Having this category of token is really what do you call specimens?

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
And I think people have been saying that specimens are occurrences.

43:02.000 --> 43:09.000
If you ask people what they mean when they say occurrence, they don't really mean a specimen.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
And so the question, the problem is that within the existing Darwin core classes,

43:14.000 --> 43:25.000
there isn't really any class that's appropriate to place the descriptive metadata about a specimen.

43:26.000 --> 43:36.000
I think there needs to be perhaps some other classes that are related to organisms and parts of organisms.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
But we didn't define in Darwin SW.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
I mean, I think they need to be defined.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
But those are the kinds of things that could be used as evidence.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
So I think everyone agrees with that proposal that you just made.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
That's one I've talked to anyway.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
Right now it's 11.30, and we were going to move on to end vote too.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
So that might be a good stopping point, unless there's any other pressing...

44:05.000 --> 44:13.000
I just wanted to clarify, and I think I'm not sure if the impression that you've got of people in this room is complete.

44:13.000 --> 44:22.000
In that is that the Darwin core was a synthesis of people focused on observation data, monitoring data,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
there's no evidence except what the human saw and then records.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
But then there would be the record.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Can I ask?

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
Or if it's a digital or whatever, and then there's the stuff in the box that could be a physicist.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Okay, that's fine, but we...

44:37.000 --> 44:44.000
This may be a question for Steve, but I mean, it seems like there should be or is at least a philosophical relationship

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
between token and basis of reference. Is that correct?

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
I couldn't hear the whole question.

44:52.000 --> 45:02.000
It seems like there's at least a philosophical or underlying relationship between the Darwin core term, basis of record,

45:02.000 --> 45:08.000
and what you guys are referring to as tokens, which is basically a basis for an assertion or a word.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
I think you were right.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
Yeah, isn't that right, Steve, that you were trying to clarify basis of record?

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
Were we trying to clarify basis of record?

45:20.000 --> 45:30.000
Well, in other words, the difference is though that it's really not the basis of the record,

45:30.000 --> 45:38.000
it's the basis of the assertion that a certain individual occurred in a certain place.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
And again, basis of record seemed, and Steve, I think...

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
Maybe Steve should say why he didn't use basis of record, but that seemed tied to collection objects.

45:48.000 --> 45:56.000
Well, basis of record is another thing that I think is overloaded, because when you look at the possible values for it,

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
it contains things like location, events, identifications.

46:01.000 --> 46:10.000
So I think part of the problem is what basis of record means isn't exactly clear.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
So I promised John that I'd make way for Norman.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
I wanted to mention an ontology that Bob Morris developed,

46:22.000 --> 46:31.000
primarily taking Darwin SW and then grafting on some pieces of Roger Hayam's earlier Tadwick ontology

46:31.000 --> 46:40.000
for certain components of AOD records, data annotation records.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
And I told him I wanted to mention it, so I'll just read you what it replied.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
If you say anything at all about it, it probably should be that it is an ontology of convenience

46:48.000 --> 46:55.000
for dealing with the concerns of curators largely made by trimming Darwin SW, adding some things from the Tadwick ontologies.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
And then it goes on to say, I think section undertaking needs a workshop of comparable length to the one in Kansas,

47:02.000 --> 47:10.000
and maybe this is also a viewer's preview of the discussions tomorrow, which would be where do we take this...
