0	7800	Hi everyone, in this video I'll tell you the story of human philosophy encompassing an incredible 2500 years of philosophical history.
7800	12800	By the end of this video you will know all the basic philosophical ideas, schools, approaches,
12800	17000	as well as some of the most influential philosophers from around the world.
17000	22300	The video has 4 major parts and each with 2-3 sections, just like chapters and books.
22300	29400	In part 1 I'll answer the most fundamental question, why are humans the only species that have invented philosophy?
29400	31900	Or where does philosophy really come from?
31900	36300	Also, how has philosophy evolved in the past 2500 years?
36300	41600	And why philosophy has so many branches such as ontology, epistemology, rationalism,
41600	46800	periscism, humanism, utilitarianism, existentialism, postmodernism and more.
46800	51800	In part 2 I'll look at the origin and differences between Eastern philosophy and Western philosophy.
51800	60500	Why one emphasizes spirituality and changing yourself while the other emphasizes rationality and changing the world?
60500	69300	I'll look at the Greek giants of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, as well as the 3 giants of Eastern philosophy, the Buddha, Lao Tzu and Confucius.
69300	73000	In part 3 I'll look at the philosophy of life and human civilization.
73000	77500	Is the purpose of human civilization to promote equality or competition?
77500	81500	Is the purpose of human life to seek knowledge or happiness?
81500	94100	I'll discuss philosophers such as Sanzu, Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, Erasmus, Michel de Montaigne, Francis Bacon, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault and Bertrand Russell.
94100	98000	In part 4 I'll tackle the question of knowledge and human motivation.
98000	99900	How do we know reality?
99900	106800	I'll discuss a school of European rationalism versus British empiricism and Kant's reconciliation of the two.
106900	112500	After Kant, two distinct schools of philosophy emerged to explain human motivation.
112500	115700	One sociological and one psychological.
115700	120900	Hegel's sociological philosophy argue we are motivated by historical forces.
120900	126900	While Schopenhauer's psychological philosophy argue we are motivated by a blind subconscious will.
126900	136700	So get yourself a strong cup of coffee and some popcorn and let fiction beats take you on a journey of how homo sapiens huge brain terrify their tiny heart.
136800	145800	As a result they invented all sorts of beasts from gods to demons to fairies in attempt to comfort themselves and explain the world.
145800	151000	But also invented philosophy to answer three deep existential questions.
151000	152400	Why am I here?
152400	155400	Where have I come from and where am I going?
155400	161400	To answer your first question you are here because you are curious about philosophy so let's begin.
164600	165900	What is philosophy?
165900	167500	How did we come about it?
167500	169000	And why do we need it?
169000	171100	And what has happened to philosophy today?
171100	172900	And what's the future of philosophy?
172900	177900	Today I'll answer all these questions as I discuss the rise and fall of human philosophy.
177900	185900	We humans utilize three massive weapons to navigate the world around us and they're all built in inside us.
185900	192700	As a result we humans are the most sophisticated animal that has ever lived on earth which is incredible.
192700	199700	Next time someone complains about the world being unfair remind them of these amazing tools that every human has.
199700	202700	While other animals don't have all of them.
202700	203700	What are they?
206400	214400	Like all animals the first and most important tool is instinct which most of the time subconsciously shapes our behavior.
214400	216700	We have three basic instincts.
216700	218700	Food, sex, company.
218700	221900	Our first and most important instinct is survival.
221900	227200	We spend a minimum of eight hours or one third of a day working to earn bread.
227200	229300	Imagine we didn't have this instinct.
229300	231400	How would you motivate yourself to work?
231400	234700	Or worse still how would you motivate others to work?
234700	237900	Our survival instinct goes beyond food.
237900	243000	We instinctively avoid danger and anything that threatens our life.
243000	246500	Do you think what happened to creatures who didn't have survival instinct?
246500	249700	They needed a self-help book to motivate themselves.
249700	259200	After working eight hours in the evenings we spend hours prowling our city center bars and restaurants in search of a mate or courting a mate.
259200	261700	This is the instinct to procreate.
261700	266000	Of course nowadays we chase a mate for recreational purposes.
266000	274700	The sexual urge is so strongly wired in us especially men that we do it despite the fact that most of us have no plan to have children.
274700	283200	The giant panda is going extinct because they have become too lethargic to have sex so the Chinese government spends lots of money to make more pandas.
283200	286200	Imagine our ancestors didn't want to procreate.
286200	287700	We wouldn't be here.
287700	292400	Our third most basic instinct is seeking the company of other humans.
292400	297600	While men have a stronger sexual urge, women have a stronger urge for company.
297600	303400	Without this instinct we would all end up alone and perhaps would never have a civilization.
303400	312300	Basically our instincts tell us what to do most of the time so we don't have to really think about it or twist our brain to motivate ourselves to do these things.
312300	321500	We instinctively seek food, a partner and a company of other people which allow our conscious brain to save energy on something else.
322500	333500	The second weapon in how we navigate life is our emotions which fluctuates day to day and allows us to understand ourselves and those around us.
333500	337000	Our emotions give us hints about our environment.
337000	343500	Depending on the time and place we feel angry, sad, frightened, content, happy and ecstatic.
343500	352500	If instincts are like climate that remains stable long term, our emotions are like weather that regulates our daily life.
352500	360000	Our instinctive urges push us to do things to achieve what we want but our environment says yes or no.
360000	364500	For example, seeking a partner we want someone but that person wants someone else.
364500	368500	Here comes our emotions to allow us to cope with this failure.
368500	373500	Or worse still our survival is threatened, our emotions allow us to cope.
373500	379000	So emotions allow us to grow, change and adapt to a new place or a person somewhat quickly.
379000	384000	Our emotions are incredibly powerful and motivating us to do things right away.
384000	390000	Negative or positive emotions help us grow and move on and seek a better environment.
390000	395500	In fact one of the reasons human conquer the world is because we are not happy where we are for a long time.
395500	399500	Apart from seeking food and safety we are also motivated by boredom.
399500	404500	So our emotions give our conscious mind more free time to do other things.
404500	410000	Instead our emotions do the job for us and motivating us to move, grow and change.
412000	415500	Our third and perhaps the most sophisticated weapon we have is reason,
415500	420000	which is the basis of science and technology which allows civilizations to flourish.
420500	422500	This makes us different from other animals,
422500	428500	our ability to make rational decisions based on informed knowledge and calculated risk.
428500	431500	Instinct and emotions are hardwired in us from birth
431500	436000	but rationality is mostly learned through direct experience of our own
436000	442500	as well as knowledge passed on from our parents and ancestors either orally or in writing.
442500	447000	In fact our rationality is so powerful that it can regulate our instinct and emotions.
447000	455000	For example our ability to delay gratification allows us to forgo our present pleasure for future and long term pleasure.
455000	459500	Of course not all humans are born equal when it comes to delayed gratification.
459500	463500	Some want their cake right away, some can wait a bit longer
463500	468500	but rationality is an incredible tool for us to look long term not just here and now.
468500	472500	Today we live in a modern world or in the age of rationality.
472500	478000	All our modern technological conveniences are the result of rational science.
478000	484000	To sum up humans are hardwired with three incredible tools, instincts, emotions and reason.
484000	487000	But where does philosophy fit in this?
489000	492000	The word philosophy in Greek means the love of wisdom.
492000	495000	So the first true human science was philosophy.
495000	500000	In fact philosophers were the first rational thinkers who replaced the wise old men or women.
500500	504500	They were career thinkers meaning they were known for their thoughts and wisdoms.
504500	508500	So philosophy at its core is a structure rational thinking.
508500	511500	In other words its foundation is rationality.
511500	512500	Why?
512500	518500	We humans developed a more sophisticated brain, perhaps the discovery of fire allowed us to cook our food.
518500	524500	So we could digest our food much quicker as a result we had more time to think.
524500	526500	When you're busy you have no time to think.
526500	531000	In fact I do my thinking while in the toilet because I don't have my smartphone with me.
531000	535000	But this brain good in many ways also came with a disadvantage.
535000	539000	It allows us to develop acute consciousness or self awareness.
539000	543000	The more we understand our environment and our own existence,
543000	547000	the more we start to brood and ask difficult questions.
547000	553000	One reason today we control our brain by keeping ourselves busy or hooked on something
553000	556000	like work or entertainment or smartphone.
556000	560500	With this thinking brain came the most devastating awareness of all death.
560500	565500	Other animals might know death when it comes to them so they instinctively avoid danger.
565500	569500	But we human beasts know death from an early age.
569500	573500	As rational animals we learn from the past to anticipate the future.
573500	576500	In other words we anticipate death.
576500	580500	Despite trying not to think about it we have this fear in the back of our mind.
580500	585500	So this brain of ours became powerful enough to ask important questions.
585500	587000	Why are we here?
587000	590000	What is reality and how we know it?
590000	594500	Early humans couldn't explain the world, life, the things around them,
594500	599000	especially the sun, the light, seasons, thunder, fire, etc.
599000	601500	But the most important question was why death?
601500	606500	This is the main theme of the oldest surviving human story, the Epic of Galgamesh.
606500	611500	Written three or four thousand years ago in which the hero is seeking immortality.
611500	613500	But unfortunately he fails.
613500	618500	So to console himself he builds a city so people could remember him.
618500	622500	Other humans invented gods and religions as security blankets.
622500	629500	In fact the fear of death is so strong in humans that nearly every religion has extended life to afterlife.
629500	632000	So death couldn't scare us anymore.
632000	636000	You could say that human life is so short that we have to have an afterlife.
636000	639000	However today most people don't believe in afterlife.
639000	645000	Politically or practically early human societies were ruled by its strongest among them or a group of strong men.
645000	652000	Then through the passage of time generations later myths, legends and stories about these strong people were created.
652000	659000	As time passed these legends and myths gave these early strong people titanic god-like roles.
659000	665000	As Italo Calvino once said, folktales are told and retold so many times that they become like pebbles.
665000	667000	Smooth, shiny and perfect.
667000	674000	Of course the earliest gods were usually known human phenomena such as the sun, thunder, light, dark, earth and so forth.
674000	677000	But over time they took a semi-human form.
677000	684000	Later these ideas became more sophisticated in the form of religion that told sophisticated stories about the origin of life
684000	689000	and also explained death through afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.
689000	694000	But philosophers tried to explain without relying on gods and the supernatural.
694000	701000	So they used reason to ask two important questions which became the two main pillars of philosophy.
701000	706000	One what's really out there and two how we know it.
706000	711000	So ontology asks what's reality and what things exist or don't exist.
711000	715000	And epistemology asks how we know the world.
715000	722000	So philosophy became a rational tool for humans to understand the world, the meaning of life and how to navigate the world correctly.
722000	727000	So early philosophers studied all sciences from stars to frogs and everything in between.
727000	735000	But if you bolded down the three main subjects for philosophers were the physical world, the origin of life and the human mind.
735000	739000	In other words, what is the world and how does it work?
739000	741000	What is life and how it works?
741000	744000	And what is human mind and how does it work?
744000	749000	So remember these three main topics also play philosophy's own downfall.
749000	755000	As time passed, philosophy became too big and too sophisticated so it gave birth to other disciplines.
755000	759000	In 15th and 16th century Europe, the first baby was born.
759000	763000	For example Galileo, Copernicus and Newton were the pioneers of physics.
763000	771000	So physicists took over the job of studying the world, the universe, stars, planets and matter as a whole.
771000	776000	A big load was off the philosophers' shoulders and now they focus more on metaphysics.
776000	780000	i.e. the meaning of life and the property of the human mind.
780000	784000	Then in the 18th and 19th century however, another baby was born.
784000	787000	Biology took over the job of studying life.
787000	791000	Philosophers no longer needed to dissect, frog to understand the human body.
791000	800000	An important biologist was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionized everything we know about life and its origin.
800000	804000	So philosophers were left only to focus on the human mind.
804000	808000	But unfortunately they would snatch that away from philosophers too.
808000	814000	In the late 19th century and early 20th century, philosophy gave birth to its last baby.
814000	819000	We call it psychology that took over the job of studying the human mind.
819000	829000	Two big names are Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, who both placed importance on the subconscious, the unconscious mind, as greater motivation in human behavior.
829000	832000	So philosophers didn't have to diagnose a human mind anymore.
832000	841000	Few first centuries philosophers were doing the jobs of four people, a physicist, a biologist, a psychologist, and a philosopher.
841000	846000	Now they could enjoy a bit more free time and just sit in their comfy chairs and be philosophers.
846000	849000	After all, everyone has to retire at some point.
849000	852000	But retirement is a tough period in anyone's life.
852000	858000	With that things to do, you either face an existential crisis or become lazy and wrought away.
858000	861000	So today philosophers have become a bit lazy on the whole.
861000	867000	But also they are a bit out of touch because physics, biology, and psychology have become too specialized.
867000	872000	So philosophers don't have the time to rigorously study all three disciplines.
872000	881000	Also they don't want to get their hands dirty dissecting frogs or spending hours staring at telescopes to study the stars or spend time with mentally ill patients.
881000	885000	So the big question is, what is the purpose of philosophy today?
885000	888000	Should it unify physics, biology, and psychology once again?
888000	890000	Or should it find a new path for itself?
890000	899000	Frederick Nietzsche, the first to fully diagnose the problem of Western philosophy, took philosophy back to the cave through his Zoro Tustra.
899000	905000	Who instead of prophesizing for a single god and the divine tell us about the new type of human.
905000	912000	Ubermansch, who instead of following social values, create new ones through their artistic and philosophical works.
912000	916000	Like the early humans who went to the cave to gain wisdom.
916000	920000	Nietzsche accrued science philosophy for being too rational, not passionate enough.
920000	926000	Philosophy is an old man who has produced many amazing kids and now feels lost for a purpose.
926000	929000	Why? It's very simple. It lacks passion.
929000	933000	Philosophy started as a rational tool, but it was also its downfall.
933000	942000	As we saw, science like physics, biology took over the rational side of philosophy and psychology took over the irrational side of philosophy, to put it very crudely.
942000	944000	What is left? Not much.
944000	949000	Is philosophy completely doomed? Well, not quite, I have an answer.
949000	954000	Earlier I mentioned the three big human weapons, instincts, emotions, and reason.
954000	958000	Biology and psychology are taking care of the instinct and the unconscious.
958000	964000	Literature takes care of the human emotions through storytelling, and science takes care of reason.
964000	970000	So is philosophy without a channel? Not quite. My solution is human intuition.
970000	975000	There you go. A new philosophy should be based on human intuition.
977000	984000	What is intuition? In a nutshell, instincts are mostly unconscious. Reason is mostly conscious.
984000	988000	And emotions are somewhere in the middle. Where does intuition fit in?
988000	995000	It is somewhere between instinct, the hard rock foundation, and reason, the hard rock roof over your head.
995000	1004000	So intuition is fluid between two solid surfaces, and also right next to emotions, which is very volatile and even more fluid.
1004000	1009000	Intuition is a layer deeper than rationality and a level above instinct.
1009000	1015000	So the new philosophy should be based on intuition because it has direct access to instinct, but also reason.
1015000	1022000	So in a way, it fits right between the unconscious psychology and the conscious rational sciences like physics and biology.
1022000	1028000	Scientists don't utilize intuition, so it's a perfect tool for philosophy to understand and explain the world.
1028000	1035000	Why intuition? An intuition-based philosophy can equip us with a better weapon to cope with suffering.
1035000	1043000	Rationality through sciences provides us with security, physical utility, and comfort through medicine and technology, like a traditional father would.
1043000	1047000	Science builds your house, produces your food and clothes.
1047000	1053000	Emotions provide you with love and care like a traditional mother would, which is literature and stories.
1053000	1064000	Intuition provides you with the ability to have insights, original ideas, inventiveness, and the ability to connect dots so you have a goal or mission in your life, or relevance in society.
1064000	1071000	Intuition is fast, snappy, and in the moment insight, or genius that allows societies move forward.
1071000	1076000	In fact, most inventions and discoveries can be attributed to intuition, not rational thinking.
1076000	1084000	Reason is slow, instinct is too rigid, and emotions cloud your judgment in the moment, but intuition is hit and miss.
1084000	1087000	When it hits, it sparks a new light.
1088000	1094000	So, is there a philosopher who bases his philosophy on intuition? I'm glad you asked, yes there is.
1094000	1101000	Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, argued that intuition can vitalize life and give us a new spark.
1101000	1105000	As Nietzsche argued, reason-based philosophy has become too stale.
1105000	1110000	For Bergson, intuition is the closest thing to a direct experience of something.
1110000	1115000	For example, if you want to know a city, you can read all the maps and photographs of the buildings.
1115000	1119000	But it cannot be as good as if you walk the streets of that city.
1119000	1125000	For example, you can never fully convey the taste of an apple to someone who has never eaten an apple.
1125000	1131000	That intuitive experience is the closest we humans get to experiencing the taste of an apple.
1131000	1137000	So, intuition takes us back to our nature, while reason is moving us away from nature.
1137000	1142000	Of course, Bergson is famous for his philosophy of time, creativity, and humor.
1142000	1148000	He thought intuition and life go together. We know reason tries to tame our natural instincts and emotions.
1148000	1155000	Rightly so, but it can also go too far in taming us into a docile animal with no vitality.
1155000	1161000	Bergson's philosophy is called vitalism because he wanted to liberate us from the chain of reason.
1163000	1168000	So, philosophy started as a rational tool to understand the world, life, and the human mind.
1168000	1172000	Then it gave away those roles to physicists, biologists, and psychologists.
1172000	1176000	Now it's almost become redundant, so we need a new intuitive philosophy.
1176000	1181000	But to really understand philosophy and where it's done today, we need to know the history of philosophy.
1181000	1190000	It's various schools, approaches, eastern, western, humanists, animalists, rationalists, empiricists, social philosophy versus individual philosophy.
1190000	1198000	So, in the following episodes, I'll go through human philosophy to give you an overview of the entire 2005-100 years of human philosophy.
1198000	1206000	Next, I'll explain some of the common philosophical terms, like what is the difference between ontology and epistemology, physics and metaphysics,
1206000	1214000	rationalism versus empiricism, humanism versus utilitarianism, existentialism versus postmodernism and more.
1214000	1216000	Stay tuned. Thank you for watching.
1220000	1227000	Previously, I discussed that philosophy at its core deals with two fundamental questions, what is and how we know it.
1227000	1232000	Those two questions in turn lead to other questions, like how we should live our lives.
1232000	1239000	So, in this segment, I'll look at some important philosophical terms, questions, and various branches of philosophy.
1239000	1245000	For example, what are the differences between ontology and epistemology, or between reason and logic,
1245000	1251000	or between humanism and utilitarianism, or between existentialism and postmodernism.
1251000	1257000	What is metaphysics? What is the difference between rationalism and empiricism, and what is phenomenology?
1257000	1263000	And most importantly, why we grapple with the biggest question today between egalitarianism and elitism.
1265000	1267000	Ontology versus epistemology.
1267000	1270000	Early philosophy was based on two main questions.
1270000	1276000	What is reality, which became ontology, and how we know it, which is epistemology.
1276000	1279000	So ontology asks what is and what is not.
1279000	1284000	And epistemology asks how we know the thing that exists or does not exist.
1284000	1290000	For example, according to ontological philosophy, humans are either animals or not animals.
1290000	1294000	If not animals, therefore humans are sacred and fundamentally valuable.
1295000	1302000	It is accepted as a foundation based on your beliefs, so murdering a human being is one of the most serious crimes.
1302000	1308000	So, thou shalt not kill is based on ontological notion that human life is sacred.
1308000	1315000	So ontological philosophy gave birth to sciences in order to understand the world, nature, and human biology.
1315000	1318000	Aristotle is usually considered the father of modern sciences.
1318000	1322000	Epistemology, on the other hand, is about how we gather knowledge.
1322000	1325000	A good example is how we know where we know.
1325000	1332000	Immanuel Kant said we can never know reality as it is, but we only know things on a limited level.
1332000	1340000	Why? Because everything has to funnel through the human mind, which is a structure in a way that categorizes things in a certain way.
1340000	1346000	In other words, we humans put a structure onto the world based on how the human mind works.
1346000	1352000	And the world in itself is unknowable to us because we cannot get out of our human mind.
1352000	1354000	We can never know the thing in itself.
1354000	1364000	Michel Foucault went a step further saying that knowledge is power, meaning those in position of science and technology have immense power over others.
1364000	1368000	He said there is no impartial or power-free science.
1368000	1371000	Knowledge is a tool in the hands of the powerful.
1371000	1382000	I'll discuss these more later, so to sum up, ontology is the philosophy of existence, while epistemology is the philosophy of knowledge of that existence.
1382000	1385000	Metaphysics vs Physics
1385000	1391000	Physics was part of philosophical studies until a few centuries ago, before it became a separate discipline.
1391000	1397000	Physics mainly studies matter, from the smallest particles to the biggest stars.
1397000	1408000	Metaphysics, however, is the study of what is beyond the physical world, like ideas, forms, and soul, which is closer to the religious idea of God and the spirits.
1408000	1415000	A scientist might say human consciousness is rooted in matter and would not exist without brain cells.
1415000	1424000	A metaphysician, on the other hand, might say consciousness is independent of matter, either comes from the higher power or the universe itself is conscious.
1424000	1431000	So, physics is the study of physical matter, while metaphysics is the study of non-physical entities.
1433000	1435000	Reason vs Logic
1435000	1438000	Logic has its origins in mathematics.
1438000	1445000	For example, 2 plus 2 equals 4 is logical, because it follows a very rigid rule that gives you one answer.
1445000	1450000	But logic is also used as a language of philosophy in order to communicate philosophical ideas.
1450000	1455000	So, logic is like a foundation on which philosophical debates take place.
1455000	1466000	Without logic, it is very hard to talk to other people, because in order for a discussion to take place, there has to be some ground basic rules on which all philosophers agree.
1466000	1470000	So, logic is a method of communication for philosophical arguments.
1470000	1476000	A good example is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who wanted to make communication as precise as possible.
1476000	1480000	Also, Bertrand Russell applied mathematics to philosophy.
1480000	1482000	Reason and logic often go hand in hand.
1482000	1494000	Since logic is very rigid, like a computer or a game of chess, some argue it limits human ability to express things that go beyond logic, like human emotions and passion.
1494000	1501000	So, reason or rationality is somewhat more subjective and less scientifically rigorous, like logic.
1501000	1506000	So, reason is often used to persuade people, while logic is outcome is independent.
1506000	1513000	In other words, if someone uses logic, the outcome might not benefit the argument, while reason is a bit more selective.
1513000	1516000	So, people use reason to support their argument.
1516000	1522000	We often use rationalization as a negative form of reason used to persuade people.
1522000	1526000	Logic is more mathematical, while reason is more linguistic.
1527000	1530000	Rationalism versus empiricism.
1530000	1537000	Rationalism is a school of philosophy that believes we understand the world based on our prior ability to reason.
1537000	1542000	It places human beings as a special creature with the ability to know the world,
1542000	1548000	so it has its roots in religion that places human beings as an exception to the animal kingdom.
1548000	1552000	In other words, we are pre-assembled with reason as a tool.
1552000	1556000	A good example of a rationalist is René Descartes, who famously said,
1556000	1558000	I think therefore I am.
1558000	1562000	In other words, the ability to rationalize a thing was enough to know our existence.
1562000	1565000	Leibniz was another famous rationalist.
1565000	1569000	Empiricism, on the other hand, believes that we know the world through experience.
1569000	1572000	Our thoughts come as a result of experience.
1572000	1576000	We know the property of fire because we experience the heat.
1576000	1580000	Babies have no fear of fire inside them from birth.
1580000	1584000	We experience the pain, therefore we associate fire with pain.
1584000	1589000	Empiricism is more British, while rationalism is more continental European, mainly French and German.
1589000	1592000	Famous empiricists were John Locke and David Hume.
1592000	1598000	Empiricism is also close to pragmatism, most associated with northern European cold climates,
1598000	1601000	which make you become more practical.
1601000	1605000	Immanuel Kant combined rationalism and empiricism in his philosophy,
1605000	1608000	saying that experience is not enough to know the world.
1608000	1612000	Our own mental structure imposes categories to the world.
1612000	1616000	In other words, we are not passive, just receiving knowledge through experiences,
1616000	1619000	but we actively give the world a structure.
1619000	1624000	He said we cannot know the world as it is, but we know it as our mind's structure.
1624000	1629000	But our knowledge of the world is limited to the limit of the human mental structure.
1629000	1637000	Kant's philosophy also gave rise to a phenomenology that studies an object relative to our own experience.
1637000	1639000	Not the object in of itself.
1639000	1644000	Kant made a distinction between phenomena, which is how we experience the world,
1644000	1648000	and phenomena, which is the world in itself, which we can never know.
1648000	1649000	I'll discuss this later.
1649000	1652000	So, for rationalists, we know the world because we know.
1652000	1657000	While for empiricists, we know the world because we experience things.
1658000	1661000	Political philosophy versus ethics.
1661000	1666000	Ethics is a branch of philosophy that deals with morality, justice, and the legal system.
1666000	1674000	Ethics is more practical and pragmatic, while political philosophy deals with how societies decide what is right and what is wrong,
1674000	1679000	and how to live peacefully in a society, and how we punish those who break rules.
1679000	1684000	As a society evolves, so does its morality, so ethics change.
1684000	1689000	Something that might be morally acceptable a few centuries ago is not acceptable today.
1689000	1691000	It also depends on culture.
1691000	1695000	Some actions are morally right in one culture, but not in another.
1695000	1699000	Political philosophy is the study of ethics and how it changes.
1701000	1703000	Egalitarianism versus elitism.
1703000	1711000	One of the most fundamental questions philosophy has grappled over centuries is the idea of equality versus quality.
1711000	1715000	Egalitarian philosophy has its roots and religions, such as Christianity,
1715000	1719000	that all humans have equal dignity and are equally sacred.
1719000	1726000	But egalitarianism as a philosophy became prominent in Europe during the Enlightenment period of 18th and 19th centuries.
1726000	1735000	Karl Marx is perhaps the most famous egalitarian philosopher who believed in a communist society where all the resources were shared equally among people.
1735000	1742000	Elitism, on the other hand, believes that we should run society best in meritocracy, meaning not everyone gets a trophy.
1742000	1747000	Some people deserve certain rights and privileges because they earn those things.
1747000	1755000	Elitism has its roots and nature because the animal kingdom runs on a hierarchy, which is part of the evolutionary process.
1755000	1762000	The most famous elitist philosopher was Friedrich Nietzsche, who incidentally lived around the same time as Marx.
1762000	1768000	For Nietzsche, great artists and philosophers are not the same as ordinary people, therefore should not be treated so.
1768000	1776000	Today, the biggest debate in the West is these two schools of thought, equality for all or privileges for those who earn them.
1776000	1782000	So, egalitarian philosophy believes in equality for all while elitist philosophy believes in merits.
1784000	1786000	Humanism vs. Utilitarianism
1786000	1792000	Humanism was born in Europe during the Enlightenment of 18th century, which replaced God with humans.
1792000	1799000	Instead of the divine being in charge of this planet, we rational humans assumed the ownership of this planet.
1799000	1807000	Humanists believe in an egalitarian world where all humans are equal, which is rooted in religions and belief that humans are created equal.
1807000	1815000	But in reality, that is not true. Not all humans are equal. Some are more equal than others, as Giorgio will famously say in Animal Farm.
1815000	1822000	So, in philosophy, the big question is this. Which humans should determine our social, political and moral values?
1823000	1830000	Here comes utilitarianism, a branch of humanism that believes in moral values that benefit the greatest number of people.
1830000	1834000	Not all humans, but the largest majority of humans.
1834000	1838000	The word utility focuses on how something benefits someone.
1838000	1845000	Pre-enlightenment world was dominated by kings and aristocrats while the majority worked to benefit the minority.
1845000	1852000	With its roots in Machiavelli's philosophy of end justifies the means, utilitarianism turned it on its head.
1852000	1855000	Instead of the minority, it focused on the majority.
1855000	1862000	All actions should be judged by the results that bring the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.
1862000	1868000	Utilitarianism was big in England and the most famous one was Jeremy Bentham and later Stuart Mill.
1868000	1873000	Today's democracy is a little like utilitarian majority rule, at least on paper.
1873000	1882000	Humanism also gave birth to other isms such as socialism that divides the world based on class, feminism that divides the world based on gender,
1882000	1887000	and nationalism that divides the world based on nationality or ethnicity or language.
1887000	1893000	So, humanism puts human in charge of the planet and utilitarianism says the majority of humans.
1894000	1898000	Postmodernism vs Existentialism
1898000	1907000	Existentialism popularized after the philosophy of Nietzsche argues that everything starts with our existence, not God or some divine essence.
1907000	1912000	There is no divine spark, but we just develop a sense of self during our life.
1912000	1915000	Nothing is given to us prior to our birth.
1915000	1924000	A famous existentialist philosopher was Jean-Paul Sartre, who said that since we have no essence, we are responsible to make something of ourselves.
1924000	1927000	He famously said that we are condemned to be free.
1927000	1937000	While existentialism is concerned with the individual, postmodernism popularized in France is more concerned with communities or cultural groups.
1937000	1947000	Just like existentialism, it is also rooted in the philosophy of Nietzsche, specifically in his criticisms of a single truth within the Western philosophical tradition.
1947000	1955000	While existentialism focuses on the condition of the modern existence, postmodernism focuses on the idea of truth and social values.
1955000	1959000	Western philosophy believed in a single truth, like the idea of a single God.
1959000	1969000	So postmodernism questioned European modernity as a project to unify the whole world around European values of individualism, freedom and materialism.
1969000	1973000	According to postmodernists, all cultures are as valid as European culture.
1973000	1978000	Therefore, the world doesn't have to become like Europe to be considered civilized.
1978000	1985000	Postmodernism is a reaction to modernity, which includes the Enlightenment humanism on the one hand, but colonialism on the other.
1985000	1991000	Postmodernists put emphasis on power relations, how the weak are forcefully pushed one side.
1991000	2003000	A famous postmodernist, Michel Foucault, analyzed how the modern state developed effective tools to control people through the prison system, surveillance, mass education and more.
2003000	2014000	He argued that even sexuality is a power dynamic, men oppressing women, which had a huge influence on the third wave feminism that some argue has become anti-men, anti-masculinity.
2014000	2019000	Foucault even said all knowledge is tied to power, so there is no independent science.
2019000	2024000	Therefore, science and technology are tools for the powerful to control the weak.
2024000	2033000	So to sum up, the core philosophy includes ontology of existence and epistemology of knowledge and everything else is a branch of these two.
2033000	2036000	Physics and metaphysics are part of ontology.
2036000	2043000	Physics deals with matter, while metaphysics deals with non-material phenomena such as ideas, consciousness.
2043000	2047000	Reason and logic, rationalism and empiricism are part of epistemology.
2047000	2054000	Reason is a tool to persuade others, therefore more subjective, while logic is mathematical and impartial.
2054000	2062000	Rationalism says knowledge comes from within, while empiricism says knowledge only comes from experience or outside.
2062000	2066000	So outside ontology and epistemology is the philosophy of how to live.
2066000	2074000	Political philosophy studies morality of good and bad, equality or meritocracy, majority, mass or minority elite.
2074000	2076000	This is also tied to the meaning of life.
2076000	2083000	Existentialism puts emphasis on the individual, while postmodernism puts emphasis on the group identity.
2083000	2087000	Next, I'll look at the differences between Eastern and Western philosophies.
2087000	2091000	Why one focuses on physical science while the other on mental well-being?
2091000	2099000	Which should we prioritize, building rockets to conquer space or do yoga for a more peaceful mind on Earth?
2102000	2110000	In the 1930s, there was an interesting conversation between the greatest Indian poet and philosopher Tagore and the greatest German scientist Einstein.
2110000	2114000	The conversation centered on the idea of reality, truth and beauty.
2114000	2118000	Einstein believed in an objective reality outside the human.
2118000	2122000	While Tagore insisted on the subjective interpretation of reality.
2122000	2129000	To boil it down, Einstein believed in the old theory of physics, solid matter existing with or without humans.
2129000	2138000	While Tagore was alluding to the mysterious theory of quantum physics, that our perception or observation of matter is never really objective.
2138000	2143000	The conversation illustrated the differences in Eastern and Western ways of thinking about reality.
2143000	2147000	One more pragmatic, while the other more spiritual.
2147000	2150000	Now let's look at the typical hero in the East and West.
2150000	2158000	A Western hero wants to change the world to make it better for himself and those around him, while an Eastern hero wants to change himself.
2158000	2170000	Western superheroes fight evil to restore justice, peace, correct the incorrect, while Asian heroes either accept their fate or retreat to a forest for some contemplation.
2170000	2176000	Jesus perhaps the greatest Western hero confronted injustice and paid for it with his own life.
2176000	2180000	A sacrifice you can see manifests in Harry Potter as well.
2180000	2184000	The Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, however, went to the forest to change himself.
2184000	2187000	Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, retreated the mountains.
2187000	2192000	In other words, Western philosophy is about change while Eastern philosophy is more about accepting your fate.
2192000	2199000	A great example of this in literature can be seen in the novels of the Japanese British Nobel Prize-winning author Kazuo Shiguro.
2199000	2204000	His characters obey their fate and rarely question their somewhat unfair circumstances.
2204000	2209000	However, a typical hero in the West would rebel against their circumstance to change the world.
2209000	2219000	Accepting one's fate or putting up with an unfavorable environment is seen as a sign of weakness in the West, while those same traits are seen as a sign of strength in the East.
2219000	2223000	By the East, my focus is mainly Old India, China and Japan.
2223000	2229000	So a Western hero wants to change the world while an Eastern hero wants to change himself to adapt.
2229000	2237000	In today's world, East and West have come together a lot because Western mode of production, i.e. capitalism, has taken over the world.
2237000	2241000	But if you look closer, a bit deeper, you see a clear philosophical distinction.
2241000	2245000	And if you go back in time, the distinction appears more clear.
2245000	2252000	Why has Eastern philosophy's main focus been on mental well-being, happiness and spirituality and community,
2252000	2260000	while Western philosophy's main focus has been physical well-being, rational science, technology, materialism and individualism?
2260000	2265000	Of course, there's a broad generalization, as there are so many philosophers on either side who are exceptions to the rule.
2265000	2272000	But generally speaking, the main distinction is spiritualism versus materialism, community versus individualism.
2272000	2278000	So in this video, I'll look at some of the answers, but also give more detail about the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy.
2278000	2282000	Does the climate, terrain and the soil have anything to do with it?
2282000	2287000	Are merchants more concerned with materialism and farmers more with spirituality?
2289000	2294000	Western philosophy, as we know, has its roots in ancient Greece and later in Rome.
2294000	2299000	The Greeks and Romans were influenced by other civilizations, such as the Egyptians and the Babylonians.
2299000	2304000	But there are very little or no written records of an organized philosophy prior to the Greeks.
2304000	2309000	Eastern philosophy has its roots in Indian civilization and the Chinese civilization.
2309000	2316000	If you look at their geographies, Greece is made up of some islands, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.
2316000	2319000	So large bodies of water sandwiching the land areas.
2319000	2324000	So if you want to move around, all you need is a boat and you could hop from island to island.
2324000	2328000	This allows much smoother way to move things around.
2328000	2330000	There's less friction on water than land.
2331000	2336000	The ancient Greeks heavily relied on imported food due to its soil not being very fertile.
2336000	2343000	As a result, the Greeks relied on traits which brought goods from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Central Europe and more.
2343000	2347000	But with this commodity trait also came ideas in knowledge.
2347000	2352000	So the region was a hub of cultural, scientific and technological exchange.
2352000	2357000	This promoted a more rational discourse which allowed the Greeks to develop a more sophisticated science.
2357000	2365000	For example, Euclid's element is the oldest science book, which I'm sure was influenced by the Egyptians, the Babylonians and the Phoenicians.
2365000	2371000	Pythagoras developed his mathematics. Aristotle studied all kinds of things including animals.
2371000	2380000	In fact, the first Greek philosopher Thales was an olive merchant himself who based his philosophy on water being the most important thing in the world.
2380000	2386000	He famously predicted that good weather, i.e. lots of rain, produced lots of olives, so he got very rich.
2386000	2392000	So the Greeks relied on traits which allowed the exchanges of ideas and practical sciences.
2392000	2397000	Indian and Chinese civilizations, however, are more centered around rivers and mountains.
2397000	2399000	In other words, quite different from ancient Greece.
2399000	2405000	India and China were blessed by its many rivers that brought amazing soil from the Himalayas.
2405000	2413000	So their agricultural economy could sustain a huge population in big cities, making China and India mostly self-sufficient.
2414000	2417000	Trade with other peoples was a plus, but not essential.
2417000	2429000	China's Yellow and Yangtze rivers and ancient India's Indus and Ganges rivers are all starting the snowy mountains of Himalayas and traverse thousands of kilometers which bring the fertile soil.
2429000	2435000	It's no surprise that both India and China relied on a crop that is incredibly water-thirsty, rice.
2435000	2443000	It's also no surprise that Sadguru, the greatest Indian guru in the world today, has a simple message, save the soil.
2443000	2447000	Because soil and farming ran really deep in Eastern philosophy.
2447000	2458000	So Greece's geographical terrain allowed trade to flourish between various peoples and cultures, while ancient China and India relied on their rivers to bring good soil to them.
2458000	2464000	The Greeks had to seek food from somewhere else while the Chinese and Indians waited for their rivers to bring food to them.
2464000	2473000	As a result, from a survival point of view, for the Greeks, merchants were the most important class of people, while in the East, farmers were the most important class of people.
2473000	2484000	Since merchants are mobile while farmers are stationary because you cannot carry around your land, these allowed the Greeks to be more open-minded to new ideas, new technology, new sciences.
2484000	2490000	Merchants are also less attached to their ways, therefore easily follow the market or commodity.
2490000	2497000	Today you sell rice, tomorrow potato. Farmers, however, have a harder time to change and adapt quickly.
2497000	2504000	So Western philosophy geared more towards pragmatic sciences while Eastern philosophy geared more towards spiritualism.
2504000	2512000	If merchants don't like something, they change, but if farmers don't get enough water, they wait for the following season or accept their fate.
2512000	2520000	It's harder to leave your land than migrate, so Western philosophy is more change-oriented while Eastern philosophy is more fatalistic.
2520000	2522000	In other words, you change yourself.
2524000	2531000	Climate also plays a role. India and China tend to be warmer throughout there, so it makes sense to be in here and now, which Buddhism teaches.
2531000	2536000	Also, seasons play a predictable pattern every year and people live a more cyclical life.
2536000	2543000	Monsoon comes every year, rivers flood at specific time of the year. In a way, it was very similar to the Egyptian way of life around the River Nile.
2543000	2550000	Of course, when you rely on a river, you also experience great famines, but they come every few years or decade.
2550000	2555000	The Greeks navigated the seas where you are for the most part in control of where you are going.
2555000	2559000	Meanwhile, Eastern civilizations were centered around rivers.
2559000	2563000	On rivers, your course is fixed. The river takes you where the river takes you.
2563000	2571000	As a result, Eastern philosophy is more fatalistic. The fate of humans, animals and plants are in the hands of the same rivers.
2571000	2581000	It meant that they saw all living beings as part of one big family, so they didn't put humans as being outsiders or special or above everybody else.
2581000	2587000	In Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, we are not only from nature, we are nature, just like other living beings.
2587000	2593000	The Greeks, however, experienced colder winters, so they had to source and accumulate food for colder days.
2593000	2600000	Since they relied on trade, wars always disrupted trade routes, which meant you had to source your food from somewhere else.
2600000	2607000	Merchants relied on peacetime to continue trade, but they also benefited from wars as certain commodities were more sought after.
2607000	2613000	It is the old adage, war fuels the economy as money is moved around faster than peacetime.
2613000	2621000	Since things are pretty unpredictable, the Greeks had to think long term and prepare not just for the cold winter, but for the future in case of warfare.
2621000	2626000	Future became the most important time, not here now, but next month, next year.
2626000	2634000	You couldn't afford to be here now like a Zen Buddhist, so this long term or linear perception of time became the dominant way of looking at the world among the Greeks.
2634000	2642000	A famous example is Aristotle's teleological philosophy that everything has a purpose, usually a single destination in the future.
2643000	2654000	Western philosophy also, through an exchange with the Middle Eastern religions like Judaism, Christianity and later Islam, came to understand that humans were separate from the animal kingdom.
2654000	2658000	We are kicked out of the garden of Eden, punished for our mistakes.
2658000	2666000	As a result, you try to compensate for your past mistakes. You want to correct the incorrect. What do you do? You fight for causes.
2666000	2674000	If you look at literature, heroes are often people who have sinned or made terrible mistakes. To redeem themselves, they fight injustice.
2674000	2684000	One way to fight for injustice is to make other people's lives better, often materially. You study the world, you invent new technology to make life easier for others.
2684000	2689000	Eastern philosophers were not looking for material comfort, but more for mental and spiritual comfort.
2689000	2695000	Buddha and Lausi left the city in their spiritual quest and went to the mountains and forests.
2695000	2699000	Solitude allows you to seek answers inside you, not on the outside.
2699000	2709000	Even today, most Buddhist temples in India, Japan and China are located in the mountains and forests, away from the crowd, so people can get away from other people.
2709000	2714000	The core doctrine of Buddhism is that material comfort doesn't make you happy in the long run.
2715000	2723000	The Greeks, however, gathered in the city to debate and dialogue like Socrates, who would walk around on the streets of Athens, asking people questions.
2723000	2728000	While others established schools like Plato's Academy or Aristotle's Lyceum.
2728000	2733000	Western philosophy relied on dialogue and exchange, like merchants do, to flourish, learn and improve.
2733000	2741000	The West built universities, churches and schools in the middle of town and villages, so everyone could come, not some remote temples nobody could go to.
2741000	2747000	In Eastern philosophy, you don't force your will on nature to control or change it, but you try to flow with nature.
2747000	2758000	Since both India and Chinese civilization were centered around rivers, often river flow is seen as a nature's way, in which you don't resist or remove obstacles in your way, but move around those obstacles.
2758000	2761000	In other words, you change yourself, not the outside world.
2761000	2766000	A good example is Indian traffic moves around an obstacle, be it a cow or an accident.
2766000	2770000	While in the West, a small accident on the road brings everything to a halt.
2770000	2775000	So Eastern philosophy tells you to be more fluid, flexible like yoga and less rigid.
2775000	2781000	But Western philosophy relies on manipulating nature through science and technology to make life easier for humans.
2781000	2784000	As a result, we live in a very comfortable period in history.
2784000	2789000	Millions of people couldn't survive to adulthood, but today, child mortality is its lowest in history.
2789000	2791000	People live longer, healthier.
2791000	2796000	But this also has negative consequences for other species on Earth, as the more comfortable we are,
2796000	2800000	the harder it becomes for some other species in some areas.
2802000	2811000	Asians are on average physically smaller than Europeans, perhaps due to genetic mutation or sexual selection, or possibly due to eating less protein.
2811000	2815000	As farmers rely on rice, which is a staple diet in most of Asia.
2815000	2817000	How to cope with poor diet?
2817000	2822000	Martial arts in China and New India are used to strengthen and discipline the body.
2822000	2826000	Eastern philosophy center on the body as a vehicle to get to a higher place.
2826000	2831000	And this also means Eastern philosophy is more about avoiding conflict rather than confronting others.
2831000	2834000	Taoism and Buddhism and Hinduism promote non-violence.
2834000	2840000	Vegetarianism, although trending in the West today, has been practiced in the East for thousands of years.
2840000	2848000	Jainism is an Indian religion that promotes strict vegetarian diet, and Gandhi, a pacifist himself, admired Jainism for that.
2849000	2854000	Unlike Asians, the Greeks ate a lot of bread, which is four times more protein-rich than rice.
2854000	2863000	Since the Greek states were constantly fighting against one another, as well as the Persians, they developed the Olympic Games, which was to train soldiers for wars.
2863000	2868000	It is no surprise that it was the Greeks who made it all the way to India through Alexander the Great.
2868000	2874000	While we have no records of invading armies from India or China going to Persia or the Middle East,
2874000	2880000	it was the nomadic Mongols who made it to Europe, not the more sophisticated civilizations like the Chinese and Indians.
2880000	2883000	In fact, the Chinese built walls to shield themselves from the Mongols.
2883000	2891000	And India was ravaged by a series of invasions by the Greeks, the Persians, the Muslims, the Mongols, and even the British.
2891000	2896000	Why? Eastern philosophy is less centered on conquering the world, but conquering yourself.
2896000	2902000	For example, Buddhism is centered on the inner conflict of fighting or resisting your own desires.
2902000	2910000	If you focus on your inner conflict, you are less likely to engage in an external physical conflict, such as tribal or ideological.
2910000	2917000	In Hindu yogi teaching, your soul is the real you, while your physical body is acquired through food you put in your mouth.
2917000	2923000	Not just that, you also acquire your ego or the sense of self through impressions and experiences with others.
2923000	2929000	So your soul is permanent and your body and ego are temporary, fleeting, and acquired.
2929000	2933000	Now, Einstein versus Tagore conversation on the nature of reality makes sense.
2933000	2938000	Einstein sees an external world, while Tagore sees everything internal.
2938000	2943000	In other words, yogi philosophy is based on the pursuit of becoming one with the universe.
2943000	2948000	Quantum physics has a similar theory that as soon as you observe something, you change it.
2948000	2952000	In other words, we are not separate from the world or universe, we are with the universe.
2952000	2957000	The world is not outside us, but we are the universe, it's inside us.
2957000	2965000	So yoga is one way to tap into or get closer to your universal soul by taming your body and ego and desires.
2965000	2969000	The idea is to let your soul control you, not your body control your soul.
2969000	2976000	Eastern philosophy is based on negation of self, while Western philosophy is firmly rooted in the idea of individual self.
2976000	2986000	As a result of this, the East tends to be more communitarian, where the individual is less important than the community or the universe, while the West tends to be more individualistic.
2986000	2990000	Buddhism's core philosophy is to remove the self to ease suffering.
2990000	2994000	Wanting or desiring is seen as negative because you are feeding the ego.
2994000	2999000	The Greeks are more of a merchant's mentality to grow more profit and become wealthy and wealthier.
2999000	3004000	Merchants are more focused on material success and less concerned with the spiritual side of life.
3004000	3010000	As a result, it was the Greeks who developed a more rational scientific method to understand the material world.
3010000	3017000	This scientific method allowed objectivity which meant that Greek scholars could disagree with their mentors.
3017000	3023000	Even thinkers like Plato openly disagreed with his teacher Socrates, an Aristotle question Plato.
3023000	3029000	In the East, however, openly questioning your teacher was and still is a form of disrespect.
3029000	3033000	Instead of finding flaws in those older than you, you're supposed to respect.
3033000	3038000	This is especially important in Confucianism. Sensei is someone you do not challenge.
3039000	3046000	Western philosophy makes a distinction between good and evil as almost separate entities and separate individuals or even groups.
3046000	3052000	Often in warfare, the enemy is seen as evil to motivate your soldiers to die in defense of good.
3052000	3060000	This is true on both sides. So once you assign goodness with one way of seeing the world, the opposite of that is naturally bad or even evil.
3060000	3066000	This spout of good against evil allows progress. Those victorious can claim goodness.
3066000	3071000	And these, however, both good and bad are seen as more psychological and less ideological.
3071000	3075000	So good and bad are one or two sides of the same coin.
3075000	3080000	The yin and yang in Taoism means every person has dark and light, good and evil built in them.
3080000	3087000	Good and evil coexist so no matter how much society progresses, it doesn't change the core yin and yang existence.
3087000	3091000	We as humans are neither good nor bad, but a bit of both.
3091000	3096000	Our job is to understand this so we keep a good balance between the two forces.
3096000	3101000	I think the most fundamental difference between Eastern and Western philosophy is the idea of linear progress.
3101000	3107000	In the West, versus a cyclical notion in the East, especially in Indian philosophy, the Greeks believed in progress.
3107000	3112000	Socrates developed his questioning method of getting to the objective truth.
3112000	3118000	Plato introduced the idea of perfection, and Aristotle came out with telos for purpose.
3118000	3124000	So getting to Socratic truth, Platonic perfection and Aristotelian telos, or purpose,
3124000	3128000	gave birth to a Western progressive philosophy and science.
3128000	3131000	So instead of focusing too much on the spiritual side of life,
3131000	3136000	the West focused on making the physical life easier by deploying a scientific method
3136000	3140000	to understand the world and invent technologies that made life easier.
3140000	3145000	As a result, most people today live a comfortable life thanks to Western civilization.
3145000	3148000	People live longer thanks to Western medicine and technology.
3148000	3152000	When survival is no longer an issue, people seek meaning and purpose.
3152000	3158000	So Eastern philosophy plays a major role in bringing inner peace for millions of people in the East,
3158000	3162000	as well as in the West who seek meaning beyond material comfort.
3162000	3170000	So to sum up, climate, terrain and food impacted how the East and West prioritized philosophical understanding of the world.
3170000	3176000	The Greeks relied on merchants and trades, so the priority went to practical sciences and rationality,
3176000	3180000	while in the East farming allowed big cities to flourish and people lived longer.
3180000	3184000	As a result, philosophers were seeking happiness, not physical comfort.
3184000	3188000	Life expectancy also grew in the East, which allowed more reflection in old age.
3188000	3192000	When young, people seek success, but in old age, people search for meaning.
3192000	3196000	Next, I'll discuss the Greek trio of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle
3196000	3199000	by looking at their similarities and differences.
3202000	3210000	In 399 BC, the Greek democracy condemned one of the greatest philosophers to death for spreading bad ideas among the youth.
3210000	3215000	Today, he is considered the father of Western philosophy and possibly the father of Western civilization.
3215000	3221000	His tragic death sparked a new human philosophy that was based on rational thinking, not religious dogma.
3221000	3225000	Who was this man? It was of course Mr. Socrates.
3225000	3231000	Well, he lost his life, but rationality triumphed. He paid the price with his own life.
3231000	3238000	It's no surprise or exaggeration to tell you that Western philosophy originated in Greece, mainly in the city of Athens.
3238000	3247000	Previously, I talked about the differences between Eastern and Western philosophies due to different terrains, food production, cultural exchanges and so on,
3247000	3252000	that gave rise to its spiritualism in the East, while rationalism in the West.
3252000	3261000	Eastern philosophy centered on farming and rivers became fatalistic, while the Greeks centered on trade and disease became rationalistic.
3261000	3269000	So here I'll talk about the three of the most famous forefathers of Western rational philosophy, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.
3269000	3273000	Before I talk about the big three, let me mention a few who came before.
3273000	3279000	The first known Greek philosopher was Thalys of Miletus, who said that everything is made of water.
3279000	3286000	Today we know that 60% of human body and 70% of our brain are made of water, so he was right.
3286000	3293000	He also used reason to predict how the weather affected olive harvest and made a lot of money as a result.
3293000	3302000	People at the time believed the good or bad harvest was in the hands of gods, so Thalys understood that it had nothing to do with it, but just good weather.
3302000	3310000	So Western philosophy from the very earliest time emphasized rationality to understand and manipulate nature to benefit humans.
3310000	3312000	And he was a businessman.
3312000	3319000	Another notable philosopher was Pythagoras, famous for his theorem A squared B squared equals C squared.
3319000	3324000	He argued that the world is run by mathematical rules, which can be understood through numbers.
3324000	3328000	Even musical harmony is ruled by geometrical rules.
3328000	3335000	So Pythagoras based his ideas on mathematical logic, which is a step deeper and more rigid than rationality.
3335000	3347000	Another logical philosopher was Parminides, who also used logical thinking, a reasoning to prove that human experience gives us false perception of the world, often contradicts with logical thinking.
3347000	3353000	So early Greek philosophers paved the way for rationality to become the method of thinking.
3356000	3357000	Socrates
3357000	3363000	If you have to name one person as the founder of Western philosophy, one name stands tall above everybody else.
3363000	3373000	It is of course Mr Socrates, not the football legend from Brazil, but the ancient Greek dude who lived between 469 and 399 BCE.
3373000	3381000	He was the true father of Western philosophy because he developed a robust philosophical method to understand the meaning of life and to expose dogmas.
3381000	3385000	Unlike everyone else, he did not accept things at face value.
3385000	3397000	His questioning or dialectical method of examining everything through a series of questions to get to the bottom of things or finding the truth became the basis of modern scientific method.
3397000	3403000	To understand something, you have to go through a series of questions like what, where, when, why and how.
3403000	3408000	Once you go through all these questions, the answer you get tends to be the best answer out there.
3408000	3414000	Today's science does the same thing. Scientific theories are tested through a series of experiments.
3414000	3417000	Socrates also questioned the purpose of life itself.
3417000	3420000	For him, the purpose of life was to be virtuous.
3420000	3422000	How can you be virtuous?
3422000	3425000	Again, you have to examine your life critically.
3425000	3429000	You cannot sit in your comfortable chair and live in ignorance.
3429000	3432000	Uncomfortable truths are better than comforting lies.
3432000	3436000	He famously said, the unexamined life is not worth living.
3436000	3441000	In other words, ignorance wasn't bliss, just stupid and unworthy.
3441000	3446000	These had a massive psychological shift in how people saw the world and themselves.
3446000	3448000	You couldn't just rely on gods or even the priests.
3448000	3453000	You had the ability to rationally question things and get to the truth for yourself.
3453000	3465000	The Athenian democracy saw him as a threat, awakening the youth, so they forced him to sip hemlock poison which killed him in 399 BC, making him a true martyr of philosophy.
3465000	3472000	Socrates was a street philosopher who walked around streets of Athens to question people and have a dialogue about life and philosophy.
3472000	3477000	He was like a modern day provocateur or a whistleblower. The authorities didn't like it.
3477000	3482000	Socrates' philosophical legacy was to make truth the most important aim of philosophy.
3482000	3487000	Philosophy wasn't to tell you comforting lies, but it was to challenge you into discomfort.
3487000	3498000	And Western philosophy, Socrates narrowed its scope into one single truth, which is the basis of modern science today, searching for the ultimate theory that explains everything.
3498000	3504000	Quote, there is only one good knowledge, one evil ignorance.
3504000	3516000	This single truth became the cornerstone of Western philosophy for almost 2005 and 8 years, until the German Nietzsche questioned it, paving the way for postmodernism that believed in multiple truths.
3516000	3523000	Socrates didn't leave any written records, because he was busy on the streets challenging strangers about their truths.
3523000	3528000	I wonder if he was around today, how he would challenge people about my truth, your truth.
3528000	3534000	First people would think he's crazy, second he would go mad with everyone having their own truths.
3537000	3544000	Plato, after the death of Socrates, the torch was passed on to one of his students who also wrote his teacher's philosophical ideas down.
3544000	3557000	Plato, who lived between 427 and 347 BCE, having witnessed his teacher executed by the democratic mobs, was an idealist, arguing that we all have a perfect idea of something.
3557000	3560000	But in reality, this does not exist.
3560000	3565000	It only exists in our mind as a perfect form of that thing.
3565000	3572000	There are chairs we see inside a room, but those are just models of a perfect chair that only exists in our mind.
3572000	3582000	In other words, the chairs that humans make are modeled on a perfect chair inside the human mind, who see a mere shadow of what reality is on the outside.
3582000	3593000	His famous thought experiment, Allegory of the Cave, illustrates that if you face away from the light source and see your own shadow inside a cave, that's how we perceive reality.
3593000	3597000	Not what it is, but it's shadow through our senses.
3597000	3602000	So for Plato, humans can pre-assemble with all knowledge.
3602000	3608000	In other words, we don't learn through our experiences or senses, but it's all inside.
3608000	3611000	It only comes out when we experience it.
3611000	3617000	Quote, what we call learning is only a process of recollection.
3617000	3620000	This makes Plato's philosophy somewhat counterintuitive.
3620000	3628000	We think what's on the outside is the real thing, and what we have on the inside in our mind is a mere representation of that real object.
3628000	3630000	Plato thinks the opposite.
3630000	3634000	What we see on the outside is the shadow of what's in our mind.
3634000	3643000	We have an innate knowledge of the world from birth, and what we learn is just re-remembering or recalling those things that are already stored inside us.
3643000	3648000	This is very similar to how the rationalists saw knowledge, which I'll discuss later on.
3648000	3654000	Plato's idea of knowledge coming from inside us can also be interpreted in terms of the subconscious,
3654000	3660000	or Jungian collective subconscious, deeply embedded in us from our evolutionary past.
3660000	3666000	For instance, the fear of a snake in us is not because we experience snake bites in our own life,
3666000	3673000	but because our ancestors experienced it in savannah, in the trees, or a jungle, or in the cave.
3673000	3680000	Despite us living in beautiful safe houses, we still have the inner experience of being in the dark cave.
3680000	3682000	Another example is horror movies.
3682000	3688000	Our desire to see horror movies is simply because we still want to experience the fear from time to time,
3688000	3693000	because that fear is inside us, and horror movies simply stimulate that fear.
3693000	3697000	Sigmund Freud's dream interpretations are another way to understand Plato.
3697000	3702000	In other words, dreams are our little window into the subconscious world inside us.
3702000	3709000	Friction writers, artists, and musicians often experience a trance-like state when they are immersed in their art,
3709000	3715000	tapping into their subconscious to bring out an art that is appreciated by many people,
3715000	3721000	simply because they reach a deeper well inside to drink from the collective subconscious knowledge.
3721000	3726000	Despite being the artistic uncle, Plato also had a strong opinion about politics.
3726000	3732000	Plato was a republican and saw democracy akin to a mob rule as it killed his teacher Socrates,
3732000	3737000	so he argued that philosophers were better suited to rule society as a republic.
3737000	3743000	Just like Nietzsche, he had a low opinion of general publicists unsuitable to rule a society,
3743000	3746000	while philosophers were better equipped to rule a society,
3746000	3753000	so he set up his academy where he wanted to cultivate the best minds of a generation, the elites of society.
3753000	3760000	Today's university is very much modeled on Plato's academy where the intellectuals lock horns to discuss ideas.
3760000	3764000	And one of those people was Aristotle, who graduated from his academy.
3764000	3771000	Plato is called the idealist philosopher, however his student Aristotle went a different route towards practical knowledge.
3771000	3777000	So to sum up, Plato's teacher, Mr. Socrates, questioned things to find the truth.
3777000	3784000	Plato said, truth or perfection only exists in the soul, in the mind, or in the world of ideas or forms,
3784000	3787000	and only their shadows are perceived through our senses.
3787000	3795000	So Socrates gave philosophy a method of finding the truth, while Plato offered a perfectionist vision of the truth inside the mind.
3795000	3801000	Now these two come together in Aristotle to provide a basis for modern Western philosophy,
3801000	3806000	a progressive perfectionist vision of truth-seeking, a single truth.
3808000	3809000	Aristotle
3809000	3815000	While Plato sat inside a cave saying that to find the truth reasoning was superior to real-world observation,
3815000	3825000	his student Aristotle, however, reversed this by getting his hands dirty and dissecting the frogs and gazing at stars to understand the real world.
3825000	3835000	Aristotle, who lived between 384 and 322 BCE, argued that truth is not inside us, but it's on the outside in the real world.
3835000	3838000	Truth, in other words, is in the world around us.
3838000	3843000	His method was evidence-based research akin to modern science.
3843000	3847000	He actually went to the fields to study animals and see creatures.
3847000	3855000	He questions Plato's ideal form, saying that if a man is the model of an ideal form, who is the ideal form model of?
3855000	3862000	It's the same argument if God created us, who created God and who created the God that created God, which goes to infinity.
3862000	3868000	Aristotle put human senses to work and argued that our observation of things is the best way to find the truth.
3868000	3874000	He said everything in the world can be categorized by their substance, quantity, place, time and so forth.
3874000	3880000	Today modern science classifies animals into species, earth into continents and oceans, rocks and murals.
3880000	3885000	These categorization helps humans to gain knowledge much faster and more effectively.
3885000	3888000	He famously said humans are rational animals.
3888000	3893000	Aristotle also said that everything has a purpose or a telos or an end goal.
3893000	3897000	The purpose of this video is to educate people about philosophy.
3897000	3906000	As a result, Aristotle's telos has become a bunch of philosophy called teleology that looks at things through their purpose, not their essence.
3906000	3912000	So when we look at a chair, we don't think of the wood and trees and forests, but we think of sitting on it.
3912000	3915000	A chair is to be sat on, not considered a piece of tree.
3915000	3919000	So Aristotle's telos put purpose before essence.
3919000	3928000	As a result, Western philosophy is a very purpose-driven way of thinking, which emphasizes something's utility or use before its essence.
3928000	3934000	As a result, Western culture values solution to problems, efficiency and pragmatism that make things better.
3934000	3939000	Today modern science develop useful technologies, so it's heavily utility based.
3939000	3944000	We like useful things. The purpose of science is to develop technology to make life easier.
3944000	3946000	What is the purpose of human civilization?
3946000	3950000	To reach perfection, which is a kind of a statillion teleology.
3950000	3960000	So Aristotle's telos coincided with the Christian view that we are heading towards an apocalypse or heaven, a perfectionist utopia where you're happy and blissful.
3960000	3964000	And science we're heading towards a perfect understanding of the universe and life.
3964000	3969000	So telos allows us to make plans, have goals and strive towards something.
3969000	3973000	Without an end goal, it is hard to motivate ourselves to do things.
3973000	3980000	Just like Plato, he also set up a school called Lyceum, where he gathered all the best minds of his generations to study.
3980000	3987000	One of his most famous students prior to the Lyceum was a man who took his teleological teaching to conquer the world.
3987000	3993000	It was of course Alexander the Great, who made it all the way to India in his attempt to conquer the world.
3993000	3999000	I should point out an important Greek philosopher who lived outside the rationality-dominated school.
3999000	4004000	It was Epicurus, whose philosophy centered on happiness, not rationality or truth.
4004000	4014000	So instead of an academy or school, he set up a hippie-style garden where he gathered his friends to talk philosophy while enjoying life in peace and tranquility.
4014000	4021000	Epicurus understood that the biggest enemy of happiness is also the main reason human invented philosophy.
4021000	4023000	What is it? The fear of death.
4023000	4027000	The entire foundation of human philosophy rests on this mystery.
4027000	4030000	Epicurus had a very clever answer.
4030000	4034000	He said the fear of death is irrational. It makes no sense.
4034000	4037000	Why? For the simple reason that we do not know death.
4037000	4040000	Not only that, we cannot know death.
4040000	4043000	Because nobody has returned from death to tell us what it is.
4043000	4045000	Death is just one way street.
4045000	4049000	Now that we know the fact that we do not and cannot know death, why fear it?
4049000	4052000	We are afraid of lions because we know they can eat us.
4052000	4055000	We are afraid of fire because we know the pain.
4055000	4057000	But we cannot and will not know death.
4057000	4060000	It's totally irrational to be afraid of it.
4060000	4068000	Instead of worrying about death, we should make the most of this life by living in and spreading peace and happiness among others.
4068000	4074000	Later, his philosophy was adapted into utilitarianism to maximize happiness for the majority of people.
4074000	4080000	But despite his philosophy of happiness, Epicurus remains an outsider in Western philosophy.
4080000	4086000	So to sum up, Socrates questioned people on the streets of Athens to critically examine things in life.
4086000	4095000	Plato sat inside a cave, not literally though, and asked himself about the ideal form that may have come from God or the human mind.
4095000	4101000	While Aristotle went to the field and got his hands dirty to understand the natural world.
4101000	4109000	Socrates placed virtue and knowledge in Russian truth while rejecting passion, emotions, or faith as dogmatic.
4109000	4115000	This was Nietzsche's biggest problem with Western philosophy, which he squarely blamed on Socrates.
4115000	4123000	Too much rationality ignores human passion and heavily relies on reason, which is rigid, inflexible, that turns us into machines.
4123000	4130000	Plato, however, retreated to himself and argued that perfectionism doesn't exist on the outside, but only on the inside in our head.
4130000	4138000	The world is a terrible place precisely because it's a skewed model of a perfect form that only exists in our mind.
4138000	4146000	Plato's ideas were closer to a religious idea of God, so later Christians and Muslims interpreted Plato's perfect form as God.
4146000	4151000	God is perfect while humans in the world are imperfect images of God.
4151000	4159000	Aristotle said, forget about the imperfect world, someone has to go to the field to study the bloody nature through observations and dissections.
4159000	4167000	So his method was empirical science, which became the base of medieval Islamic science and later 16th-century European science.
4167000	4174000	Next, I'll talk about the three horses of Eastern philosophy, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Confucius.
4177000	4183000	Previously, I discussed the Greek trio of Socrates played to an Aristotle who influenced Western philosophy.
4184000	4193000	The three most famous Eastern philosophers were Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, the Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and Confucius, the founder of Confucianism.
4193000	4200000	I'll mainly focus on their philosophies and less on their religious practices, which are quite different in different countries.
4200000	4209000	Eastern philosophical tradition is very rich and complex, so these three philosophers can help us shed lights on Eastern spirituality.
4210000	4212000	Lao Tzu
4212000	4217000	Lao Tzu or Lao Tzu lived in 6th century BCE in China.
4217000	4223000	It is said to be the author of the Tao Te Ching or Tao Te Ching, which is the foundational text of Taoism,
4223000	4227000	a philosophy that traces its origin to shamanism and hermeticism.
4227000	4235000	Taoism, which is also sometimes called Taoism, literally means the way or the enlightened path or nature's way,
4235000	4240000	which is spontaneous, eternal, and unnameable and undefinable.
4240000	4241000	Quote
4241000	4245000	Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.
4245000	4251000	It is simply the flow of the universe, such as gravity allowing rivers to flow downward without an effort.
4251000	4259000	The core idea of Taoism is the doctrine of Wu Wei, which can be translated as non-resistance or action through inaction.
4260000	4266000	Wei means purposeful and intentional, while Wu means there is no or lacking.
4266000	4269000	So literally it means there is no purposeful act.
4269000	4276000	A good metaphor for humans to live their lives by is river, which the Chinese civilizations relied on.
4276000	4278000	Rivers flow downward.
4278000	4282000	If hindered by a rock, instead of moving the rock, they flow around it.
4282000	4288000	This means we should live our lives in alignment or harmoniously with nature, not against nature.
4288000	4297000	Another important idea of Taoism is Yin and Yang, or good and evil, which live together inside everyone, as we all have the dark and light.
4297000	4299000	You cannot separate the two.
4299000	4306000	I think this fundamentally differs from a Western religion, so good and evil are thought to be separate entities.
4306000	4309000	However, according to Taoism, there are two sides of the same coin.
4309000	4314000	Everything is neither completely negative nor positive, but a bit of both.
4314000	4319000	In other words, saint has his sins and a sinner has his redeeming qualities.
4319000	4324000	In Taoism, humans are one manifestation of the Tao or the Wei.
4324000	4328000	You could say just one species among millions of other species.
4328000	4335000	Lao Tzu emphasized not to follow one's desires, goals or ambitions, but rather find your natural flow.
4335000	4343000	Zi Yan, which literally means naturally, is a Taoist value which emphasizes natural creativity and spontaneity.
4343000	4351000	As a result, Taoism is seen as the religion of the artists who live a more intuitive and spontaneous life that mimics nature's flow.
4351000	4359000	You could even make a connection between Carl Jung's psychology of the collective subconscious, deeply embedded memories of our species,
4359000	4365000	or those species before that artists tap into by finding the flow of nature.
4365000	4369000	This artistic flow is much more elaborated in another book titled Zhuang Zi.
4369000	4374000	Supposedly authored by another important figure in Taoism, a man called Zhuang Zi.
4374000	4381000	The book has many humorous stories, allegories and anecdotes, with the most famous one being the butterfly dream,
4381000	4386000	in which Zhuang Zhu wakes up one morning from a dream in which he turned into a butterfly.
4386000	4389000	Now he is perplexed and asks this mind-blowing question.
4389000	4394000	Was he dreaming of a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming Zhuang Zhu?
4394000	4398000	The answer is not important here, but the question itself is the main point.
4398000	4406000	We humans see clear answers and clarity, but nature doesn't care about separate entities or separation of different species.
4406000	4409000	Nature's one big perpetual flow.
4409000	4415000	From nature's perspective, a human and butterfly are simply two different manifestations of the same thing.
4415000	4423000	Even the state of being awake and dreaming are false distinctions or dichotomy because they are one and the same thing.
4423000	4429000	For example, artists, novelists, musicians often dream or daydream their best works
4429000	4433000	because they find the flow of nature's collective subconsciousness.
4433000	4438000	Lao Zi is said to have lived during the Zhu Dynasty, whose capital was close to the Yellow River.
4438000	4442000	Therefore, the river is often used as a metaphor for Taoism.
4442000	4448000	Later in life, Lao Zi is said to have traveled west where he rode Dao De Jing and some remote mountains
4448000	4455000	and then vanished into thin air, also a great metaphor in how to flow in life like a wind and river.
4455000	4462000	Today, Lao Zi's ideas are extremely important but also deeply embedded into the cultures of China, Korea and Japan.
4462000	4466000	To give you an example, people in Japan tend to be less confrontational, tend to avoid conflict,
4466000	4470000	which fits in with the Taoist idea of non-resistance.
4470000	4478000	So to sum up, Lao Zi or Taoism philosophy centers on the idea of not going against the natural flow but flowing with it.
4478000	4482000	Not resisting nature's way but going with it.
4484000	4485000	Buddha.
4485000	4494000	Siddhartha Gotama or the Buddha lived a luxurious life in a rich Northern Indian family between 563 and 483 BCE.
4494000	4500000	He wasn't happy, he learned that suffering was universal among the poor, rich, young and old men and women.
4500000	4502000	But why do we suffer?
4502000	4505000	The reason we suffer is because our desires for pleasure.
4505000	4507000	The more we get, the more we want.
4507000	4513000	If we have a big house, next time we will not be fulfilled if we don't get an even bigger house.
4513000	4518000	Bigger cars, more partners, more wealth, friends, subscribers, followers.
4518000	4522000	At no point in our life we can satisfactorily say it is enough.
4522000	4524000	A good example is addiction.
4524000	4531000	If a small dose makes you high today, but you need a larger dose to give you the same high a month later or a year later.
4531000	4535000	In other words, as you experience more, your desires also grow bigger.
4535000	4541000	So life is just an endless cycle of desire, fulfillment of that desire and more desires.
4541000	4543000	How do we solve this problem?
4543000	4550000	To ease suffering, according to Buddhism, we should nip our wants and the bad by detaching ourselves from our desires.
4551000	4555000	Don't chase things and be happy in the moment.
4555000	4557000	But it's easier said than done.
4557000	4561000	Everyone says it's a good idea to be content with what you have right now.
4561000	4563000	But curbing your desire is not an easy job.
4563000	4564000	Why is it so hard?
4564000	4568000	Here's when Buddhism gets really interesting and profoundly deep.
4568000	4570000	We all think we are who we are.
4570000	4573000	We have a sense of the self we call me and you.
4573000	4575000	We think it's somewhat solid entity.
4575000	4579000	And what's in religions, this self is imparted to us from God.
4579000	4580000	It's real.
4580000	4584000	This individual self is genuine and for the most part unchangeable.
4584000	4587000	According to Buddhism, however, you are wrong.
4587000	4588000	Why?
4588000	4590000	The self or ego is not real.
4590000	4595000	It's just an illusion or mirage or a temporary imposter attached to your body.
4595000	4598000	You could say like a parasite, it lives on you.
4598000	4600000	What does it do inside us?
4600000	4604000	This imposter self fuels our desires, ambitions and goals.
4604000	4608000	In other words, it uses us to go out in the world and achieve things.
4608000	4611000	But at the end of the day, we still don't feel fulfilled.
4611000	4614000	Especially when we achieve everything and death hits us.
4614000	4615000	We lose our shit.
4615000	4619000	Because we went through so much trouble acquiring our wealth, fame, power,
4619000	4622000	and now death is snatching all away from us.
4622000	4623000	It's a bad deal.
4623000	4625000	So what is the solution, Mr. Buddha?
4625000	4627000	His answer might shock you.
4627000	4630000	According to Buddhism, to be truly enlightened and blissful,
4630000	4633000	you have to achieve the Nirvana stage.
4633000	4636000	Which means we must kill the imposter self.
4636000	4640000	This thing we call the self or ego is the source of all our desires.
4640000	4643000	To not desire anything, we must remove the self.
4643000	4646000	According to Buddhism, our soul is the real thing,
4646000	4648000	and also very much universal,
4648000	4651000	while the self is a kind of picture we put in our head
4651000	4655000	every time we are born in our various reincarnations.
4655000	4658000	One way to understand this is perhaps through Mr. Plato,
4658000	4661000	who also said that the idea of things is the perfect form
4661000	4664000	and real things on the outside is a mere shadow of the real thing.
4664000	4667000	In Buddhism, your soul is genuine, eternal, and universal,
4667000	4670000	while your body or ego are temporary and fleeting.
4670000	4674000	We are not separate from the universe, but a tiny part of a big hole.
4674000	4676000	To become happy and one with the universe,
4676000	4679000	you must detach yourself from your desires and kill the self
4679000	4684000	through meditation, solitude, and rigorous physical and mental discipline.
4684000	4687000	A discipline mind brings happiness.
4687000	4690000	This is very similar to Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy
4690000	4694000	of the blind universal will, which is a force beyond our control,
4694000	4696000	yet it rules most of what we do in life.
4696000	4700000	There's a disagreement whether Schopenhauer reached the same conclusion
4700000	4702000	independent of Buddhism or Hinduism,
4702000	4705000	or he was influenced by these Indian philosophies.
4705000	4708000	I'll discuss Schopenhauer's philosophy in more detail later on.
4708000	4712000	So according to Buddhism, to be truly enlightened is to not see yourself
4712000	4716000	as a separate self, but part of a bigger whole, part of conscious universe.
4716000	4721000	So true inner peace comes not from outside, for example, by achieving your goals,
4721000	4724000	but from inside once you become enlightened.
4724000	4727000	Buddha's teachings through various forms of Buddhism
4727000	4730000	are incredibly important in most of East Asia.
4730000	4734000	Buddhism has also become one of the most influential philosophies in the West too,
4734000	4739000	as it emphasizes individual inner journey rather than collective prayers in a church.
4739000	4742000	So to sum up, Buddha was a rich, powerful prince,
4742000	4748000	but wasn't fulfilled in life and realized that all humans suffer because of our desires.
4748000	4751000	To ease suffering we should detach ourselves from our desires
4751000	4757000	and to be truly blissful we should eliminate the self or ego through meditation and mental discipline.
4759000	4760000	Confucius.
4760000	4766000	While both Lausi and the Buddha escaped society for some solitude and inner peace,
4766000	4770000	Confucius, who lived between 551 and 479 BCE,
4770000	4774000	however, tried to solve the practical socio-political questions
4774000	4778000	like how we can live politically and socially together in peace and harmony
4778000	4781000	or how to organize society in a way that is peaceful.
4781000	4786000	So his philosophy is less individualistic but more concerned about the collective existence,
4786000	4789000	especially in big cities and countries.
4789000	4793000	To find a great solution for socio-political coexistence,
4793000	4798000	Confucius looked at how nature organizes things, especially in the animal kingdom.
4798000	4803000	One of the biggest problems and the main source of wars and violence in human society
4803000	4810000	is when there is confusion as to who stands where, who gets what, who owns what, who is responsible for what.
4810000	4816000	He understood that the best method was the natural hierarchy or a pyramid social system.
4816000	4821000	Without an established system of hierarchy or authority, there is chaos and confusion.
4821000	4826000	And hierarchy allows everyone to know their place, so there is no confusion
4826000	4829000	or conflict as to which chair belongs to who.
4829000	4835000	Removing social confusion was Confucius' main task, pun intended.
4835000	4840000	Now, not only everyone knows their own place, they also know other people's places too.
4840000	4845000	So instead of a police watching everyone or patrolling the whole society,
4845000	4847000	now everyone can watch each other.
4847000	4852000	If someone sits in the wrong chair, other people can tell him it is not his seat.
4852000	4859000	So if everyone knows their place, everyone can watch, everyone, so nobody dares to disrupt the social harmony.
4859000	4864000	So kings at the top of the pyramid and everyone else take their place based on their ranks and age,
4864000	4866000	just like a game of chess.
4866000	4869000	Perhaps the most logical game humans have invented.
4869000	4876000	Confucius also realized that everything starts in the family, because it's the first line of defense against chaos.
4876000	4880000	A solid family structure means a solid foundation for society.
4880000	4885000	Inside the family, the man is at the top, then wife, then sons, and then daughters.
4885000	4890000	One of the most common criticism against Confucius is the possibility of tyranny.
4890000	4892000	Those in positions of power can abuse it.
4892000	4896000	Confucius also emphasized responsibility and duty.
4896000	4900000	Those at the top are responsible to protect those below them.
4900000	4907000	A king is responsible to keep people safe and a man in the family is responsible to protect and provide for his wife and children.
4907000	4912000	Those below in return are loyal and follow their superiors and do as asked.
4912000	4919000	To understand Confucianism, you should look things not just from an individual point of view, but from a collective perspective.
4919000	4925000	For example, if your body parts didn't function in alignment with the rest of your body, you are sick and needs treatment.
4925000	4926000	Society is the same.
4926000	4932000	If one or few members push things in the opposite direction, there's violence, which is a social illness.
4932000	4941000	You might think it's pretty outdated, but you would be surprised that this Confucian hierarchy is pretty efficient system, which is at work in modern companies.
4941000	4947000	Because we hear this cliche that no work is done by a committee, which is true in most situations.
4947000	4952000	Most corporate structures follow a strict and rigid hierarchy and a chain of command.
4952000	4956000	In the animal kingdom, a hierarchy is often achieved through violence.
4956000	4961000	But Confucian says, since it's natural, we might as well adopt it to reduce violence.
4961000	4965000	Of course, in the modern age, revolutions are a common occurrence.
4965000	4968000	Those at the bottom rebel against the establishment.
4968000	4972000	That's why Confucius emphasized duty and responsibility.
4972000	4975000	When a ruler becomes tyrannical, he fails his duty.
4975000	4979000	It all comes down to respecting your role in society.
4979000	4984000	Quote, without feelings of respect, what is there to distinguish men from beasts?
4984000	4997000	Today, China, Korea and Japan have adopted these Confucian methods in sorting out social situations where seniority and juniority plays a major role in schools, universities and companies.
4997000	5002000	Loyalty and respect are significant in Confucianism, but also meritocracy.
5002000	5008000	As a result, traditionally, China had a strict civil service examination for centuries,
5008000	5013000	and only the very bright and intelligent were recruited for high military and government jobs.
5013000	5017000	In the 20th century, however, Mao Zedong, the egalitarian socialist,
5017000	5021000	tried to dismantle the Confucian class hierarchy through the Cultural Revolution.
5021000	5024000	That caused great pain for a lot of people.
5024000	5030000	But of course, the Chinese Communist Party replaced the old class-based Confucian hierarchy with a political hierarchy.
5030000	5040000	Many economists attribute China's rapid economic development to this efficient hierarchical system as China was run like a company, the president being the CEO of China.
5040000	5045000	Things get done quickly, but of course, it also comes at a cost of many voices being suppressed.
5045000	5051000	Traditionally, the Chinese Communist Party used to distance itself from the archaic Confucius philosophy
5051000	5059000	because it contradicts the egalitarian philosophy of socialism in which everyone is equal and there is no hierarchy at least on paper.
5059000	5062000	But in reality, every human society has been hierarchical.
5062000	5066000	Even today, China is slowly moving towards a more Confucian philosophy.
5066000	5071000	As China is developing, not only it's utilizing a Confucian hierarchy for its efficiency,
5071000	5080000	but it's also cultivating a more robust culture of meritocracy and traditional masculinity which were centered on Confucian philosophy.
5080000	5087000	To sum up, Laozi's teaching is not to resist or destroy or go against nature, but to flow with nature.
5087000	5091000	As a result, he says we should be more intuitive and spontaneous.
5091000	5097000	In other words, humans are of nature, so it's time we forget our humanness and live in the flow of nature.
5097000	5103000	The Buddha taught that suffering is universal because of our goals, desires and ambitions.
5103000	5107000	To find true peace is to look inside, not outside material success.
5107000	5113000	And to be truly happy is to kill your ego or the self that has ambition and desires.
5113000	5122000	Confucius tackled the sociopolitical question of how to live a peaceful coexistence through a hierarchical system in which everyone knows the place and position in society.
5122000	5128000	While the Greeks were questioning truth, authority, poking holes at the natural world to understand its property,
5128000	5135000	those in the east were seeking a harmonious life with nature, not only with other humans, but with all creatures on earth.
5135000	5142000	The Greeks disagreed with each other while the Asians tried to find agreement, consents us, not only among humans,
5142000	5145000	but also between humans and the natural world.
5145000	5154000	The fact these three figures founded a religion of their own while the three Greeks did not show the fundamental difference between eastern and western philosophy.
5154000	5160000	And the east societies are generally more group centered, while in the west it's more individual centered.
5160000	5166000	But if you really think about it, the philosophies of these three eastern thinkers is highly individualized.
5166000	5171000	They put the emphasis on the individual to take charge of themselves.
5171000	5174000	Don't change the world, change yourself.
5174000	5184000	So while eastern social fabric is communitarian, the philosophies are individualistic as they put demand on the individual to take responsibility for changing themselves.
5184000	5187000	So they adapt to the society they live in.
5187000	5189000	Don't change others, but yourself.
5189000	5192000	Don't change nature, but yourself.
5192000	5197000	The Greeks however focused on how to change nature as quickly, efficiently as possible.
5197000	5203000	So in the west individuality is static, God-given or born, while social fabric is dynamic.
5203000	5210000	In other words, in western philosophy the individual is solid and the society and nature malleable and changeable.
5210000	5216000	In the east however, nature is as well as society's fabrics are static while the individual is changeable.
5216000	5221000	In other words, do not attempt to change others or nature because it's easier to change yourself.
5221000	5226000	If you cannot fit in with others, take a good look at yourself and find what's wrong with you.
5226000	5231000	People in the east are less likely to complain about the world instead try to adapt to the world.
5231000	5236000	Before you complain that I'm generalizing too much, sit back and relax and look at yourself in the mirror.
5236000	5238000	Don't worry, I'm kidding.
5238000	5241000	Next I'll discuss two distinct approaches to philosophy.
5241000	5247000	Animalism that sees humans as animals therefore needed to be herded to bring order.
5247000	5251000	And humanism that sees all humans as equal to one another.
5251000	5258000	In other words, elitism versus egalitarianism or carnivorous versus herbivorous philosophies.
5262000	5273000	Previously I discussed eastern philosophy versus western philosophy and how one employed rationality to tame nature while the other employed spirituality to tame the individual.
5273000	5279000	Today I'll look at two core philosophical schools, humanism versus animalism.
5279000	5284000	Humanism is a belief that humans are somewhat special either created by God or not.
5284000	5289000	Therefore the purpose of any society is to protect all humans equally.
5289000	5299000	Humanism is also called egalitarianism with a few babies of its own like socialism, feminism, liberalism and postmodernism.
5299000	5305000	Elitism or animalism on the other hand is a belief that some humans are more equal than others.
5305000	5311000	Especially the rulers, kings, elite class of people or the talented people as in meritocracy.
5311000	5315000	This is because hierarchy is very much part of the animal kingdom.
5315000	5317000	The strongest wins the race.
5317000	5323000	But as human civilization has progressed and we have become more efficient and taming nature,
5323000	5328000	the historical trend is moving towards a more egalitarian human society.
5328000	5334000	So here's the most important question, was Karl Marx right that the future is communism?
5334000	5339000	But first let me explain the history of these two divergent philosophical approaches.
5339000	5343000	And it used some of the most important philosophers on each side.
5343000	5347000	Humanism has its roots in religions and the West Christianity and Judaism
5347000	5352000	at its core believed that all humans beings were equal in the eye of God.
5352000	5357000	Augustine of Hippo believed all humans have free will to choose between good and evil.
5357000	5360000	He also said that one should love everyone equally.
5360000	5364000	Quote, the measure of love is to love without measure.
5364000	5370000	Thomas Aquinas, another Christian philosopher, argued that God created the world and all humans were equal,
5370000	5372000	especially in freedom.
5372000	5377000	Quote, by nature all men are equal in liberty but not in other endowments.
5377000	5383000	Outside the religious tradition the first true humanist might be Mosey who lived in the 4th century BC in China.
5383000	5386000	He advocated a kind of universal humanism.
5386000	5393000	At the time Confucianism was the dominant philosophy in China in which society was divided based on ranks and hierarchies.
5393000	5397000	So Mosey believed in universal reciprocation.
5397000	5401000	Quote, universal love is really the way of the sage kings.
5401000	5405000	It is what gives peace to the rulers and sustenance to the people.
5405000	5408000	This is an early form of humanism.
5408000	5415000	Another early figure was a 6th century Persian philosopher Mazdat who promoted economic equality among all people.
5415000	5420000	He even protested against the rich having many wives while the poor having no wife.
5420000	5425000	His idea became quite influential in the Persian Empire but soon fizzled out.
5425000	5432000	On the opposite of humanism we have the school of elitist philosophy which we can term as realism as called in politics.
5432000	5439000	The basic idea of realism is that humans are chaotic and erratic animals that need to be tamed and controlled and ruled,
5439000	5444000	not through honesty or fairness but through deception or brute force.
5446000	5454000	One of the earliest realist philosophers was San Tzu who lived in China between 544 and 496 BCE.
5454000	5464000	In his famous book The Art of War he employs nature's tactics such as camouflage, deception and even submission to survive or dominate others, especially in wars.
5464000	5467000	His philosophy was to win at all costs so to speak.
5467000	5474000	For him life is not about fairness or equality, it was about winning which is at the heart of evolutionary biology.
5474000	5479000	You only survive or thrive if you win nature's battle and overcome hurdles.
5479000	5484000	Some of his strategies in The Art of War are socially counterintuitive like this.
5484000	5491000	Like he says you must appear small when you're big and appear big when you're small in order to deceive your enemy.
5491000	5495000	In San Tzu's Art of War honesty is the worst policy.
5495000	5502000	Quote when the enemy is relaxed make them toil, when full starve them, when settled make them move.
5502000	5506000	In other words, stand tall when you're small and sit small when you're tall.
5506000	5513000	These are some basic survival tactics in the wild, for example in the battle between the carnivores and herbivores.
5513000	5518000	A gazelle jumps higher to show it's health so that cheetahs don't bother chasing them.
5518000	5527000	Some of the tactics are also to throw off your enemy like when negotiating ask for less when you want more, which is still in use in corporate capitalism.
5527000	5535000	The Art of War's basic rules are to know yourself, your enemy and your environment, time your attack and truths.
5535000	5539000	While at the same time make sure your enemy knows nothing truthful about you.
5539000	5543000	Be a peacock when small and be a mouse when big.
5543000	5549000	So this is the earliest form of political deception in order to prolong your rule over others.
5549000	5552000	The winners are those who lie the best.
5552000	5558000	So Sansu borrowed his philosophy from the animal kingdom where there is no morality, only winners.
5560000	5568000	Machiavelli who lived between 1469 and 1527 was an Italian thinker who is famous for his book The Prince,
5568000	5578000	in which he advises the rulers to use any methods available to them to achieve the goal of maximizing their power and domination over other humans.
5578000	5587000	In other words, the famous line that the end justifies the means which goes contrary to the humanist and religious morality of protecting life.
5587000	5591000	Put, it's better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.
5591000	5597000	He argued that a ruler must be like a savage lion when needed and a cunning fox when needed.
5597000	5603000	So brute force combined with cunning deceptions are needed in order to rule over society.
5603000	5613000	Why? Because humans are savages and they are waiting for your weakest moment to strike and take away your power like Hamlet's uncle and Shakespeare's play Hamlet.
5613000	5622000	Machiavelli lived a few centuries before Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, but he still understood the savage nature of human politics.
5622000	5627000	In other words, moralities for the weak and power and deception are for the strong.
5628000	5632000	Quote, he who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command.
5632000	5639000	In order to prevent a rebellion, a ruler must show terror and fear for its subject to behave well.
5639000	5646000	Those at the top of society have the most to lose so they can use any means available to them to make sure they keep their power and wealth.
5646000	5652000	They use the police, the legal system and whatever else so nobody can take those things away from them.
5652000	5656000	So, just like Sansu, Machiavelli based his philosophy on the animal kingdom.
5656000	5660000	It's not about equality or fairness, it's about winning and conquering.
5662000	5668000	Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher who lived between 1588 and 1679.
5668000	5676000	In his book, Leviathan, he argued that humans are savages and only a civilized state can protect humans from each other.
5676000	5681000	In other words, humans have established states to escape the brutality of nature.
5681000	5685000	According to him, humans are physical machines and nature.
5685000	5691000	But when entering society, they gave up their savage tendencies and power to live peacefully.
5691000	5698000	Quote, life in the state of nature is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.
5698000	5700000	Fear of violence is always there.
5700000	5706000	To escape it, humans have made a contract with their governing rulers and returned for their obedience and freedom.
5706000	5711000	The state provides them with peace, justice, protection for them and their property.
5711000	5716000	Just like Machiavelli, Hobbes believed in the use of force to tame people.
5716000	5721000	Quote, not believing in force is the same as not believing in gravitation.
5721000	5727000	Despite his argument for a civilized state, he understood that humans were an essence savage animal.
5727000	5732000	So, Sansu drew on the animal kingdom saying deception was better than honesty.
5732000	5739000	Machiavelli went even further saying that deception combined with brute force are justified to tame humans.
5739000	5744000	Hobbes argued a civilized state has every right to tame the unruly humans.
5744000	5750000	Now, let's look at a few philosophers who oppose this animalistic philosophy based on the natural world.
5750000	5754000	These philosophers saw human life as somewhat sacred.
5755000	5765000	Voltaire who lived between 1694 and 1777 was a French philosopher who believed in a kind of universal individual liberty.
5765000	5767000	Not tyranny as Machiavelli suggested.
5767000	5773000	Unlike Machiavelli's iron rule, he believed in open skepticism and freedom of expression for all
5773000	5779000	so anyone could criticize and even rebel against the dominant traditions and dogmas.
5779000	5784000	Quote, men are equal, it's not birth, but virtue that makes the difference.
5784000	5792000	In other words, he didn't support the idea that the rulers and kings had a birthright authority over truth or liberty.
5792000	5795000	The church or the state should not hold absolute power.
5795000	5802000	Instead, everyone, despite their socioeconomic status, deserves the right to have an education and access to knowledge.
5802000	5808000	Today, liberal democracies in the West follow the principles of free speech and individual autonomy.
5808000	5811000	Ideas that were promoted by Voltaire.
5811000	5815000	So he's often considered the father of liberal individualism.
5815000	5821000	Because he believed everyone, irrespective of their socioeconomic class, deserved to be equally free.
5821000	5829000	So nature works with hierarchy, but Voltaire argued that every human deserves equal freedom to express themselves.
5830000	5836000	Jean-Jacques Rousseau who lived between 1712 and 1778 was born in Geneva.
5836000	5841000	Unlike Thomas Hobbes who said man is born savage but tamed in society,
5841000	5848000	Rousseau believed that humans are naturally good but they are contaminated or tainted in society to act terrible.
5848000	5853000	He famously said, man is born free yet he is everywhere in chains.
5853000	5857000	This was especially true in big cities where people turned selfish.
5857000	5862000	He believed in the country people were naturally nicer, friendlier and fairer
5862000	5870000	but once people migrated to the cities instead of becoming more civilized, ironically they turned into selfish animals.
5870000	5875000	Unlike Hobbes' top-down approach, Rousseau believed in a bottom-up approach
5875000	5881000	arguing that the masses should be able to run the state, not some select individuals like kings and generals.
5881000	5887000	His famous book The Social Contract is said to have influenced the French Revolution in 1789
5887000	5893000	in which the anti-monarchy revolutionaries toppled the king and France became a republic.
5893000	5899000	Of course it didn't last very long but it sowed the seed of freedom, equality and brotherhood
5899000	5905000	which resulted in three major ideologies of socialism, liberalism and nationalism
5905000	5909000	which have dominated politics for centuries ever since.
5909000	5914000	So Rousseau's egalitarian approach had a huge influence in political history.
5915000	5922000	So to sum up, the humanists argued that since life is too short let's all be more equal, fairer and nicer to each other.
5922000	5928000	Mosey argued for an equal universal education, Rousseau for equal political participation
5928000	5932000	and Voltaire for equal freedom for everyone to express himself.
5932000	5937000	Political animalists or elitists on the other hand argued that since life is too short
5937000	5941000	it's all about winning, conquering and dominating others.
5941000	5945000	So they don't trust all humans therefore promoted a more robust political regime
5945000	5949000	that didn't allow people to be free to challenge the ruler or the state.
5949000	5957000	Sansou used deception, Machiavelli justified repression and Hobbes promoted its state as a tool to control human savages.
5957000	5964000	Now as a historical trend we are moving towards an egalitarian humanist future at least in principle.
5964000	5970000	Also this was Karl Marx's prediction that slowly we are heading towards a communist utopia.
5970000	5974000	In reality however all human societies are highly unequal and hierarchical
5974000	5978000	and it's unlikely that this will change for a foreseeable future.
5978000	5985000	Humanism invented by humans while elitism or animalism invented by nature and evolutionary biology
5985000	5991000	were all born unequal in beauty, talent, intellect and physical strength
5991000	5997000	which contribute to societies being dominated by those who are naturally blessed either with talent or beauty.
5997000	6001000	But despite nature not being helpful in producing us equally
6001000	6006000	there is a deep desire among humans for equality, fairness and justice.
6006000	6010000	You could say that humankind is called kind for a reason.
6010000	6015000	As human civilization has improved and the more we have tame nature
6015000	6019000	we have become more confident that a humanist utopia is possible.
6019000	6024000	So in recent centuries egalitarian philosophy has become more dominant
6024000	6028000	which a few centuries back must have been unthinkable.
6028000	6032000	Socialist experiments showed the failure of egalitarianism in Russia
6032000	6035000	but the idea is still pretty strong in the world.
6035000	6042000	Who knows in the future humans might produce human babies in labs who are identical in all attributes
6042000	6045000	to create a truly egalitarian utopia.
6045000	6051000	Once you produce baby outside the natural process equality is a lot easier to achieve.
6051000	6056000	Identical babies produce identical adults, a brave new world kind of world.
6056000	6058000	But will we be happy?
6058000	6063000	Next I'll discuss the battle between pursuing knowledge and pursuing happiness.
6063000	6066000	In other words those who pursue knowledge to gain power
6066000	6070000	and those who pursue happiness and peace to live a simpler life.
6074000	6078000	Previously I discussed the two philosophical approaches to organizing society
6078000	6081000	egalitarian humanism versus hierarchical elitism.
6081000	6084000	Here I'll discuss fundamental question about the meaning of life.
6084000	6087000	Are we here to know the world or be happy?
6087000	6090000	Are we here to seek knowledge or happiness?
6090000	6093000	So in this segment I'll look at a few important philosophers.
6093000	6099000	On the knowledge side I'll look at the philosophy of Francis Bacon, Martin Heidegger and Michel Foucault.
6099000	6105000	On the happiness side I'll look at the philosophy of Erasmus, Michel Montaigne and Bertrand Russell.
6105000	6109000	As I discussed earlier, philosophy is concerned mainly with two questions.
6109000	6114000	Ontology asks what is out there and epistemology asks how we know it.
6114000	6116000	So knowledge is fundamental to philosophy.
6116000	6122000	You could say we humans are hardwired to see, understand, analyze and interpret the world.
6122000	6129000	And in other words we are curious creatures so the development of modern science is just the byproduct of this curiosity.
6129000	6133000	And our thirst for knowledge drives innovation and social change.
6133000	6136000	But we are also creatures who seek happiness.
6136000	6140000	While knowledge can empower us, it doesn't make us happy.
6140000	6146000	While knowledge can transform our lives, it doesn't guarantee happiness or peace of mind.
6146000	6151000	As I discussed earlier, the first philosopher to methodically seek the truth was Socrates.
6151000	6157000	And later Aristotle improved it by giving the approach of scientific and empirical tinge to it.
6157000	6162000	But it wasn't until centuries later the scientific approach was perfected in Europe,
6162000	6169000	mainly in 15th and 16th centuries through the works of scientists such as Copernicus, Galileo and Newton.
6169000	6177000	During this period, the English philosopher and scientist and politician Francis Bacon, who lived between 1561 and 1626,
6177000	6180000	looked at knowledge from an empirical point of view.
6180000	6185000	He graduated from Cambridge University and is often considered the first empiricist.
6185000	6191000	A school of philosophy later developed by other British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume.
6191000	6196000	Bacon placed the source of knowledge in our experience through our senses.
6196000	6201000	At the time, the church held the view that knowledge came from God and science was challenging that.
6201000	6205000	Church relied on people not knowing and not questioning things.
6205000	6210000	When nobody knows things, the church could control information and become the source of knowledge.
6210000	6214000	Today you could say that big media companies have the same mindset.
6214000	6219000	But Francis Bacon understood the power of knowledge and wanted to educate everyone
6219000	6224000	because he believed that through knowledge you could empower the poor so they could live better lives.
6224000	6228000	This is an early idea of public education, which today we take for granted.
6228000	6232000	Bacon understood that humans are on the one hand knowledge seekers,
6232000	6240000	but on the other hand humans also have some blind spots like religious belief, tribal affiliations and love of many,
6240000	6242000	which prevent us from getting to the truth.
6242000	6248000	Another problem we have as humans is that we project our own limited experience to the world.
6248000	6255000	Bacon argued that science, however, doesn't look at an individual but looks at the majority to generalize.
6255000	6259000	It's through generalization that you get closer to the truth.
6259000	6264000	For instance, if one person experiences something, it's subjective and unreliable.
6264000	6272000	But if let's say 10, 20, 100 or more people experience the same thing, then you can generalize and make science out of it.
6272000	6276000	Understanding generality is an immense power according to Francis Bacon.
6276000	6282000	So knowledge not only opens the knower's mind, it also empowers them to change their lives for the better.
6282000	6286000	Of course, Bacon lived at a time when people had very little,
6286000	6290000	so education and knowledge could transform a person's life immeasurably.
6291000	6302000	Desiderius Erasmus, who lived between 1466 and 1536, was a Dutch philosopher who wrote a very influential book called In Praise of Folly.
6302000	6309000	Unlike Francis Bacon, Erasmus argued to be happy, naivety and ignorance are far more important than knowing.
6309000	6313000	For him, the purpose of life is not to gain power but to be content.
6313000	6319000	He was writing at a time when Europe was waking up to have a renaissance, a resurgence in scientific and rational pursuit,
6319000	6323000	which went against the teachings of the Church to have faith in God.
6323000	6328000	Erasmus, a Christian himself, while criticizing the corruption in the Catholic Church,
6328000	6333000	argued that to be happy, a little faith and ignorance were vitally important.
6333000	6338000	His philosophy was taken up by fiction writers such as Cervante, the author of Don Quixote,
6338000	6341000	and later the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky.
6341000	6345000	The goal of life is not to know everything but to lead a simple life.
6345000	6349000	Knowledge or power doesn't make you happy but simplicity and folly do.
6349000	6357000	It's the old adage that ignorance is bliss which goes completely counter to the age of the Enlightenment and rationality.
6357000	6362000	So Erasmus said that being an idiot was the surest way to be happy.
6364000	6371000	Michel de Monten, who lived between 1533 and 1592, was a French philosopher who had a very curious childhood.
6371000	6377000	Although born into a wealthy family, he spent his first three years of childhood in the house of a peasant,
6377000	6380000	so he could learn the life of the poor.
6380000	6383000	This must have had a profound influence on him later in life.
6383000	6387000	If Erasmus said folly was a good medicine for happiness,
6387000	6391000	Monten argued that to be happy one should have a simple life.
6391000	6396000	Instead of seeking the company of many people, one should try to live a more solitary life
6396000	6401000	because society can corrupt you, either morally or intellectually.
6401000	6406000	In today's social media world of chasing lives and online attention and validation,
6406000	6409000	his message resonates with a lot of people.
6409000	6413000	We always try to seek the validation of our peers like some addictive drug
6413000	6416000	to an extent that we are never satisfied.
6416000	6422000	Monten says to have a peaceful life, don't chase other people's approval or glory or fame,
6422000	6426000	which makes us pretentious and fake most of the time.
6426000	6429000	He argued that attention seekers are not original thinkers,
6429000	6433000	but rather suffers from herd mentality or tribalism,
6433000	6437000	which in the heat of the crowd or moment turns us into mobs.
6437000	6442000	We commit horrendous crimes and only later realize how stupid it was.
6442000	6448000	To prevent becoming a mob, Monten argued once you disentangle yourself from the group, crowd or mobs,
6448000	6452000	you develop a clarity of mind or inner tranquility.
6452000	6458000	It's not only good for your happiness, but it's also good for your intellectual and moral integrity
6458000	6461000	because solitude allows you to develop yourself.
6461000	6468000	To have a lasting name, writers and artists should not be bogged down to social, political and tribal issues of the day.
6468000	6472000	Monten's idea of solitude also inspired Frederick Nietzsche,
6472000	6477000	who was extremely critical of the masses or mobs or tribal thinking.
6477000	6479000	I'll discuss Nietzsche later on.
6479000	6485000	As modernity made mass education the norm and the crowded cities' habitat for the majority of people,
6485000	6489000	life's meaning became even more acute for the modern man.
6489000	6493000	Knowledge of the world wasn't enough to have a meaningful life.
6493000	6496000	We needed something else.
6496000	6501000	Martin Heidegger, who lived between 1889 and 1976,
6501000	6504000	was a German philosopher who turned the lens onto himself.
6505000	6509000	Francis Bacon, like Aristotle, was interested in knowing the outside world,
6509000	6514000	but Heidegger, like Diagonus of Sinop, wanted to know the human being itself.
6514000	6519000	In his famous book, Being in Time, instead of asking what human being is,
6519000	6522000	he asked how it is like to be human.
6522000	6524000	What is that experience like?
6524000	6525000	Why?
6525000	6530000	The simple answer is that we are scientists who happen to be also the subject of science.
6530000	6533000	When you study animals, we are outsiders.
6533000	6536000	But when we study human beings, we are insiders.
6536000	6539000	Heidegger didn't want to have an abstract answer,
6539000	6543000	instead he wanted to know to have a concrete answer to the question of being,
6543000	6547000	which is incidentally the root of the word ontology in Greek.
6547000	6549000	So what is his answer?
6549000	6552000	Heidegger measured life as a finite phenomena,
6552000	6555000	starting at birth, end, ending, and death,
6555000	6558000	just a line that has a beginning and an end.
6558000	6561000	Now, unlike other animals, we know death.
6561000	6563000	We even anticipate it.
6563000	6566000	The knowledge of death makes us anxious and fearful,
6566000	6570000	so to cope, we tend to not think about it on a daily basis.
6570000	6572000	It's either a coping mechanism,
6572000	6575000	or simply we do not have time to think about it every day,
6575000	6578000	as we are busy with work and life.
6578000	6581000	So we are the being who is aware of death,
6581000	6583000	but we also try not to think about it.
6583000	6585000	That's precisely Heidegger's answer.
6585000	6589000	Human beings, or being in general, is to be aware of death.
6589000	6592000	Instead of making us anxious or depressed,
6592000	6594000	he thinks it empowers us.
6594000	6598000	This knowledge of death gives our life authenticity and meaning.
6598000	6601000	So if Bacon said knowledge of the world empowers us
6601000	6603000	to better our life physically,
6603000	6605000	Heidegger says the knowledge of death
6605000	6610000	gives our life meaning and empowers us to live fully and authentically.
6611000	6615000	Bertrand Russell, who lived between 1872 and 1970,
6615000	6618000	was a British philosopher who was deeply steeped
6618000	6621000	in the logical and mathematical side of philosophy,
6621000	6624000	just like Ludwig Wittgenstein, whom he influenced.
6624000	6627000	He used a logical and rational approach to argue
6627000	6630000	that to be happy one should work less.
6630000	6632000	You could say he is responding to Marx,
6632000	6635000	who argued that workers are exploited by the rich.
6635000	6639000	But he is also responding to the Northern European work ethics,
6639000	6642000	which states that work is morally good in itself.
6642000	6645000	Therefore, this morality, according to some,
6645000	6648000	was responsible for the modern capitalism.
6648000	6651000	Russell, however, argued that seeing work as a morally good thing
6651000	6653000	was not only irrational,
6653000	6655000	but it also made a few people very rich,
6655000	6658000	while the majority very unhappy.
6658000	6661000	Why? Because not all kinds of work are the same.
6661000	6663000	Some are good and some are not good.
6663000	6665000	Some are meaningful and some are not.
6665000	6669000	To bundle all as a good thing is not logical.
6669000	6673000	He concluded that working less increases human happiness,
6673000	6675000	so instead of working yourself to death,
6675000	6677000	you should enjoy life more.
6677000	6678000	Do other activities.
6678000	6681000	Today, a lot of people are so busy working long hours
6681000	6684000	that they lose sight of their well-being and happiness.
6684000	6686000	This is especially true for men,
6686000	6688000	because we are so drawn to numbers,
6688000	6690000	just like Bertrand Russell was.
6690000	6693000	We watch growth graphs and become obsessed with it.
6693000	6696000	We work one day and then extrapolate that to a week,
6696000	6698000	a month, and then a year.
6698000	6700000	So if we work this many days,
6700000	6702000	we will have this much money,
6702000	6704000	or as a result, we'll lose sight of the fact
6704000	6706000	that life is meant to be lived, not work to death.
6706000	6709000	So Russell argued that to be happy, work less.
6709000	6712000	He lived to be 90 years old.
6712000	6716000	Michel Foucault, who lived between 1926 and 1984,
6716000	6718000	was a French philosopher.
6718000	6720000	Unlike Bacon and Heidegger,
6720000	6723000	he saw knowledge as a cynical tool of repression.
6723000	6726000	Foucault looked at modernity through the lens of Nietzsche,
6726000	6730000	saying that modern rationality wasn't liberating humans,
6730000	6733000	but creating a more robust change of controllers.
6733000	6736000	He famously studied the prison system
6736000	6738000	and how prisons are designed to control us,
6738000	6740000	either directly through imprisonment
6740000	6743000	or indirectly through the fear of it.
6743000	6746000	He argued that those who have access to science and knowledge
6746000	6749000	use it to discipline the rest of us.
6749000	6752000	Foucault argued that knowledge is a tool.
6752000	6753000	Science is a tool.
6753000	6755000	Rationality is a tool.
6755000	6757000	But mostly for the powerful elite
6757000	6759000	because they have access to all of them,
6759000	6762000	while the majority of us start subjects.
6762000	6765000	Michel Foucault was also inspired by Emmanuel Kahn,
6765000	6767000	whose epistemological revolution argued
6767000	6770000	that our knowledge of reality is not totally objective.
6770000	6773000	But rather, we see the world the way we see
6773000	6776000	because we impose our own mental structure on the world.
6776000	6779000	Foucault even argued that man or mankind itself
6779000	6782000	is a recent invention.
6782000	6784000	So to sum up, on the knowledge side,
6784000	6787000	Francis Bacon understood that our knowledge of the world
6787000	6789000	could empower us to better our lives.
6789000	6791000	Heidegger argued that our knowledge of death
6791000	6794000	can give our life more meaning and authenticity.
6794000	6797000	Foucault, however, said everything is invented.
6797000	6799000	There is nothing solid to understand.
6799000	6801000	Knowledge is just a tool for power
6801000	6804000	to manipulate nature and other humans.
6804000	6806000	So to sum up on the happiness side,
6806000	6809000	Erasmus argued that folly, ignorance, or naivety
6809000	6812000	is a good thing to have to lead a happier life.
6812000	6814000	We have all seen children.
6814000	6816000	When we grow older, we lose that naivety
6816000	6818000	and become a bit more miserable.
6818000	6820000	Monten argued that don't follow the crowd
6820000	6824000	and seek some solitude to cultivate your own inner peace.
6824000	6828000	Don't seek validation from others like a drug addict.
6828000	6832000	The higher you go, the more you seek to get high and higher.
6832000	6834000	New mountain is high enough.
6834000	6837000	So listen to Monten because he came down the mountain
6837000	6839000	to settle in a hut.
6839000	6842000	Even his name is Monten, so climb yourself and your ego,
6842000	6844000	not other people's validations.
6844000	6847000	Bertrand Russell argued that work is not morally good
6847000	6851000	or bad thing, so we should prioritize happiness over work.
6851000	6853000	Work to live or live to work.
6853000	6855000	I should really listen to this,
6855000	6857000	but I want to have more subscribers.
6857000	6859000	Monten, help.
6860000	6863000	So knowledge can make your physical life better
6863000	6865000	or make you more successful financially
6865000	6867000	or boost your social standing,
6867000	6870000	but it might decrease your overall happiness.
6870000	6872000	Knowing things also makes us human
6872000	6874000	very cynical about the world,
6874000	6876000	just like Foucault said that all knowledge is power
6876000	6878000	and all authorities won't suppress you.
6878000	6880000	Naivety, on the other hand,
6880000	6882000	might make your physical life harder
6882000	6884000	as you don't have everything figured out,
6884000	6887000	but it can also lead you to a more long-lasting happiness
6887000	6890000	as you trust other people and rely on other people,
6890000	6892000	which brings the level of sincerity in yourself
6892000	6894000	and those around you.
6894000	6896000	So knowledge makes you successful,
6896000	6898000	but it could also make you cynical.
6898000	6900000	While ignorance hinders your success,
6900000	6902000	it could also lead to a more blissful life.
6902000	6904000	What do you think?
6904000	6906000	Next, I'll discuss a battle between rationalists
6906000	6909000	and empiricists, leading to Immanuel Kant's
6909000	6912000	great breakthrough in philosophical knowledge.
6913000	6916000	Previously, I discussed the question
6916000	6918000	whether our life purpose is to seek knowledge
6918000	6920000	or seek happiness.
6920000	6922000	In this segment, I'll look at one of the biggest battles
6922000	6924000	in philosophy between the rationalists,
6924000	6926000	mostly mainland Europeans,
6926000	6929000	who argue that knowledge is somewhat innate inside us,
6929000	6931000	and empiricists, mainly British,
6931000	6934000	who argue that knowledge comes from experience.
6934000	6936000	Immanuel Kant brought the two together.
6936000	6938000	If Western philosophy was a two-sided funnel,
6938000	6940000	Kant would be the narrow part,
6940000	6943000	so everything before him is squeezed through him
6943000	6945000	and after him, Hegel and Schopenhauer
6945000	6948000	move philosophy in two different directions.
6948000	6950000	Hegel went historical and rational,
6950000	6953000	while Schopenhauer went psychological and subconscious.
6953000	6957000	I'll discuss these two philosophical approaches later on.
6957000	6959000	Rationalism is a school of philosophy
6959000	6962000	that relies on human reason to understand the world.
6962000	6965000	Reason itself is an innate human property.
6965000	6968000	In other words, we're born with the ability to reason,
6968000	6972000	early rationalists saw reason as God-given gift.
6972000	6974000	The father of rationalism is René Descartes,
6974000	6977000	who lived between 1596 and 1650.
6977000	6979000	He was a French philosopher and a scientist
6979000	6982000	who famously did his thought experiment.
6982000	6985000	He sat down in his armchair and asked the simple question,
6985000	6987000	what if everything we know is just a dream?
6987000	6989000	Nothing exists in reality.
6989000	6991000	In other words, to prove that he existed,
6991000	6993000	he did the opposite.
6993000	6995000	He doubted his own existence.
6995000	6997000	Then he said, if everything was a dream,
6997000	6999000	the dreamer has to be real,
6999000	7002000	otherwise there will be no dreaming without a dreamer
7002000	7004000	or doubt without a doubter.
7004000	7007000	So he said the most famous line in philosophy,
7007000	7009000	I think therefore I am.
7009000	7012000	Even if you doubt your own existence, this doubt is real.
7012000	7015000	According to Descartes, we get knowledge or ideas
7015000	7017000	in three different ways.
7017000	7020000	Some come from our experience, some drive from reason,
7020000	7023000	and some ideas are innate inside us,
7023000	7025000	presumably from God.
7025000	7027000	Scientists like René Descartes argue
7027000	7029000	that we have an innate knowledge of the world
7029000	7032000	and as we grow, we simply unfold that knowledge
7032000	7034000	to see things more clearly.
7034000	7036000	In a way, rationalists are like Plato
7036000	7039000	and saying that our knowledge of the world inside us
7039000	7042000	and learning is just recollection of that innate knowledge.
7042000	7045000	So the seed is inside us, not outside.
7045000	7048000	The other famous rationalist was Gottfried Leibniz,
7048000	7051000	who lived between 1646 and 1716.
7051000	7054000	Today we know him more because of the famous argument
7054000	7058000	he had with Isaac Newton over the invention of calculus.
7058000	7060000	Leibniz, however, was a great philosopher
7060000	7063000	who made a distinction between rational truth and factual truth.
7063000	7065000	In other words, our knowledge of the world
7065000	7069000	relies on our innate reason, but also on human experience.
7069000	7071000	The things we experience on the outside
7071000	7075000	builds on and solidifies our inner knowledge.
7075000	7078000	For Leibniz, the human mind is a small representation
7078000	7080000	of the entire universe.
7080000	7082000	In other words, the human mind contains everything
7082000	7084000	in the universe.
7084000	7086000	If the universe is rational, then the human mind
7086000	7088000	is a representation of that rationality.
7088000	7091000	However, he conceded that human rationality
7091000	7094000	is not always adequate to understand the world,
7094000	7098000	so we need human experience to complement our rational faculties.
7098000	7101000	One of the biggest problems for Leibniz was his belief in God,
7101000	7105000	so he attempted to reconcile scientific empiricism
7105000	7107000	with the idea of God, who knows it all.
7107000	7111000	In doing so, Leibniz argued for two different forms of truth.
7111000	7114000	The empirical truths we get through experiences
7114000	7118000	add to our rational truth, which we innately have or God given.
7118000	7121000	So to sum up, rationalists argue that humans are
7121000	7124000	naturally equipped to utilize reason to understand the world
7124000	7128000	with or without the need of observation or animal senses.
7128000	7131000	In other words, we don't need experiences to know the world.
7131000	7133000	We simply know it because, for the most part,
7133000	7136000	God has imparted us with innate knowledge
7136000	7138000	or ability of reasoning.
7138000	7141000	Empiricism, however, disagreed, saying that we understand the world
7141000	7144000	not innately, but through experience in empirical data
7144000	7147000	we gather from the world through our human senses.
7147000	7151000	Our mind is a blank slate without experience.
7152000	7156000	John Locke, who lived between 1632 and 1704, argued
7156000	7160000	around the same time as Leibniz was a pioneer of empiricism
7160000	7162000	who said that everything we know about the world
7162000	7164000	has come to us from our experience.
7164000	7167000	He gave the example of newborn babies to show
7167000	7170000	that we humans have not a single idea from birth.
7170000	7174000	We simply learn by observing and experiencing things.
7174000	7177000	Quote, if we attentively consider newborn children
7177000	7179000	we shall have little reason to think
7179000	7182000	that they bring many ideas into the world with them.
7182000	7186000	Locke understood that while we may not have innate ideas from birth
7186000	7190000	we do have the ability to learn a language, which may be innate.
7190000	7192000	This was later developed by Noam Chomsky
7192000	7195000	in his famous theory of universal grammar
7195000	7198000	that humans were a hardware to learn a language in its structure.
7198000	7201000	So John Locke concluded that all knowledge we gain
7201000	7204000	we gain through experience.
7206000	7210000	David Hume, who lived between 1711 and 1776
7210000	7213000	built on John Locke's idea of empirical experience
7213000	7216000	as a source of knowledge and further argued
7216000	7219000	that not only we understand the world through observation experiences
7219000	7223000	but we're also able to categorize things as a kind of customer habit
7223000	7225000	which guides us through life.
7225000	7229000	Hume argues that if you see a tree then another, then another
7229000	7232000	at some point you see a pattern or category.
7232000	7234000	This you call trees.
7234000	7236000	We have no notion of trees from birth.
7236000	7238000	We are like blank slits as babies
7238000	7241000	and only through encounters with the outside world
7241000	7244000	we begin to form knowledge of the outside world.
7244000	7246000	The same with night and day.
7246000	7248000	As you see the cycle being repeated
7248000	7251000	you begin to expect it as a kind of custom that night turns into day
7251000	7253000	and day turns into night
7253000	7255000	and the cycle becomes a customary knowledge.
7255000	7258000	This over time becomes ideas and beliefs.
7258000	7262000	Over time they turn into what is called innate knowledge.
7262000	7266000	Hume says there are nothing but old impressions or perceptions over time.
7266000	7269000	As knowledge is passed on from generation to generation
7269000	7273000	it may seem innate which is nothing but someone's experience.
7273000	7277000	So David Hume added custom as a kind of repeated experience
7277000	7279000	or common knowledge
7279000	7283000	and argued that we learn things from experience it is not innate.
7283000	7288000	So the rationalists believe we humans are equipped with some innate knowledge of the world at birth
7288000	7291000	while the empiricists argue that we are blank slits
7291000	7294000	and only through our experiences we gain knowledge of the world.
7294000	7298000	In other words, rationalists see knowledge flow from inside out
7298000	7301000	like a torch shedding light on the outside
7301000	7306000	while the empiricists see knowledge flow from outside like a window lighting a room.
7307000	7313000	Here comes the German giant Immanuel Kant who lived between 1724 and 1804.
7313000	7318000	Kant took up the challenge of reconciling these two divergent schools of philosophy.
7318000	7321000	To solve the problem between the rationalists and the empiricists
7321000	7325000	Kant devised a new theory that divided the world into two
7325000	7327000	phenomena and numina.
7327000	7329000	Phenomena is a world of experiences
7329000	7332000	how we understand the world through our bodily senses.
7332000	7336000	Things we see, hear, touch and smell in observing study.
7336000	7340000	Numina on the other hand is a world in itself which we can never truly know.
7340000	7343000	For example, we can touch and study a rock
7343000	7346000	but we cannot truly understand what it feels to be a rock.
7346000	7349000	As a result, our knowledge of the rock is not complete.
7349000	7351000	It's limited and partial.
7351000	7354000	Kant argued that when we are receiving information through experience
7354000	7356000	however we are not passive receivers
7356000	7360000	instead we humans also impose our own structures to the world.
7360000	7364000	We categorize things into rocks, trees, animals and what not.
7364000	7369000	The world we see is a reflection of a mental structure we put out to the world.
7369000	7372000	Rocks and trees may not have any notion of being such
7372000	7376000	but humans have imposed such categories onto them.
7376000	7379000	In other words, we are not passive knowledge receivers
7379000	7383000	but actively imposing our own structure on things.
7383000	7386000	Now Kant brings the rationalists and empiricists together.
7386000	7391000	Rationalists argue everything is inside us while empiricists say everything is outside us
7391000	7396000	and Kant says we are sort of on the threshold of outside and inside
7396000	7400000	like a kind of window glass in the middle of inside and outside.
7400000	7405000	Our inner mental structure shapes how we experience the world.
7405000	7407000	For example, a good analogy would be fishing.
7407000	7410000	To catch a fish, a fisherman throws a net.
7410000	7414000	If the holes in the net are too large, the fish escape
7414000	7418000	and if the net has no hole, it catches more water than fish.
7418000	7423000	So the fish is the outside world why the net we throw is our mental structure
7423000	7426000	we put out to capture the experience as knowledge.
7426000	7430000	We humans probe the world through our innate mental structure
7430000	7433000	which catches the outside experience based knowledge.
7433000	7437000	So for Kant reason and experience go hand in hand in understanding the world.
7437000	7439000	Without the net you cannot catch.
7439000	7443000	You need both reason and experience to understand the world.
7443000	7446000	This he called his Copernican Revolution.
7446000	7451000	Why? Because in the Middle Ages people believed the sun was orbiting the earth
7451000	7454000	and Copernicus said the earth is orbiting the sun.
7454000	7456000	Kant did the same.
7456000	7459000	Empiricists say knowledge comes from outside and Kant says yes
7459000	7462000	but not only we actively seek the outside knowledge
7462000	7468000	but it also goes through us so our mental structure determines reality on the outside.
7468000	7474000	In other words our human method puts a structure to the world that would not exist without humans.
7474000	7479000	And this structure makes it easy for us to understand and manipulate the world.
7479000	7484000	Imagine we're not human we might have a very different understanding of the world.
7484000	7488000	So to sum up the rationalist thing reason is more important than experience
7488000	7490000	in our pursuit of knowledge.
7490000	7494000	Our reason is like a torch that allows us to see things.
7494000	7499000	The empiricists however counter argue that experience is primary and reason is secondary.
7499000	7505000	Our senses act like a window that lets light in so we understand things.
7505000	7508000	Kant says we human are both a torch and a window
7508000	7514000	because our mental structure allows us to experience and understand the world better faster and more effectively.
7514000	7520000	Without a good method or an effective tool and structure our experiences are all over the place.
7520000	7522000	The debate is still not over though.
7522000	7526000	Despite Kant uniting the two epistemological approaches in philosophy
7526000	7529000	there are still people who think one way or another.
7529000	7532000	Our modern science is leaning more to the empiricist camp
7532000	7535000	while most psychologists lean more towards
7535000	7538000	not the rationalist but the irrational subconscious
7538000	7542000	or the unconscious in determining how we understand the world.
7542000	7547000	So the debate has shifted from reason to passion in some cases to intuition.
7547000	7551000	It is not rationality but intuition that allows us to understand the world.
7551000	7557000	Next I'll discuss what motivates human action by looking at two of Kant's famous successors
7557000	7559000	who went in different directions.
7559000	7563000	Schopenhauer went psychologically towards eastern philosophy
7563000	7566000	while Hegel built his philosophy on history.
7566000	7570000	On the one hand we have Hegel, Marx, Sartre and others
7570000	7573000	who explain human motivation through history and rationality
7573000	7576000	while on the other hand Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche
7576000	7581000	relied on individual psyche and human passion to explain human motivation.
7584000	7589000	Previously I discussed how Immanuel Kant bridged the two philosophical approaches
7589000	7592000	to epistemology, rationalism and empiricism.
7592000	7594000	So in western philosophy Kant is like a funnel.
7594000	7598000	He influenced another two branches of philosophy that came after him
7598000	7601000	which tried to answer some fundamental questions like
7601000	7605000	what makes us who we are, what motivates our actions.
7605000	7611000	Hegel's answer was history and rationality while his arch-rival Schopenhauer's answer was the subconscious will.
7611000	7616000	Hegel's philosophy went the sociological route basing human action on history and rationality
7616000	7621000	while Schopenhauer's philosophy went the psychological route basing human motivation
7621000	7624000	on the subconscious blind will or human passion.
7624000	7629000	In this segment I'll look at sociology and rationality by discussing philosophers
7629000	7632000	including Hegel, Marx, Sartre and Zezek
7632000	7636000	who argued that we are the product of history but they didn't stop there.
7636000	7641000	Since history makes us who we are it's also our job to make history
7641000	7645000	so we're not only molded and shaped by the historical era in which we live in
7645000	7648000	but also through our own life choices.
7648000	7652000	So social philosophy is built on the philosophy of progressive egalitarianism
7652000	7656000	stating that we are heading towards perfectionist utopia on the one hand
7656000	7663000	and materialism stating that the most important aspect of human life is material success on the other.
7663000	7665000	Of course not all of them agreed on this.
7665000	7670000	It's important to know that philosophers who came after Kant were in a sense responding to Kant
7670000	7674000	because his breakthrough in bringing the rationalists and imperialists together
7674000	7677000	was a huge moment in philosophy.
7678000	7684000	George Hegel who lived between 1770 and 1831 too responded to Kant.
7684000	7686000	Hegel had two problems with Kant.
7686000	7690000	First Kant argued that we humans only understand the phenomena
7690000	7694000	but we have no access to Númena or the thing itself.
7694000	7697000	We can touch a rock but we cannot fully understand it.
7697000	7703000	For Hegel this Númena world which we can never fully know looked like an empty abstraction
7703000	7706000	pure speculation based on Kant's own assumption.
7706000	7711000	In other words he just made it up by claiming that such a thing existed in the first place.
7711000	7715000	Hegel's second problem with Kant was that he argued that our innate structure
7715000	7719000	or categorization by which we interpret the world is fixed.
7719000	7724000	In other words we use a fishnet or framework by which we catch a fish or experience
7724000	7728000	but the net or the framework is always fixed and nobody can change it.
7728000	7735000	For the history buff Hegel everything including human consciousness was subject to change through time.
7735000	7740000	History has shown us that humans evolve so do our tools including the fishnet
7740000	7742000	or our ability to reason.
7742000	7747000	In other words everything has a history even rock has a history it changes through time
7747000	7751000	and humans are very much a product of historical era.
7751000	7755000	How do we change? Hegel says through dialectic processes.
7755000	7761000	When two opposites collide it makes a third thing that has a bit of both the original things
7761000	7764000	but it also has slightly different characters.
7764000	7770000	Hegel says every phenomena or idea or thesis as he called it contains a contradiction within itself
7770000	7772000	which he called antithesis.
7772000	7778000	In this conflict which is resolved in synthesis or a new idea which is an improvement
7778000	7781000	or different from the thesis in antithesis.
7781000	7785000	Like a child has a characteristic of both parents but also different from both.
7785000	7789000	This historical process continues in generating new thesis in antithesis
7789000	7792000	which lead to further synthesis and history continues.
7792000	7797000	So according to Hegel Kant was wrong in saying that human mental structure or reason does not change.
7797000	7800000	For Hegel everything is subject to change.
7800000	7804000	It's important to know that Kant was a lot firmer in his religious belief than Hegel
7804000	7810000	which explains that Kant sees reason as a static while Hegel sees it as malleable and changeable through time.
7810000	7814000	And that the reason was of course the French Revolution as well as the rise of Napoleon
7814000	7819000	which for the very first time in human history ordinary people took power from the king
7819000	7822000	and anyone could become Napoleon.
7822000	7823000	So nothing was fixed.
7823000	7830000	Kant being a much older man was fiercely against any kind of revolution that could destabilize the status quo.
7830000	7835000	For Hegel the world has a history and we are for the most part the product of historical era.
7835000	7839000	In other words reality is a historical process not constant.
7839000	7843000	However since we are the product of history we can also affect the course of history
7843000	7846000	through ideas that capture the spirit of an age.
7846000	7852000	For example Napoleon managed to influence history as he captured the spirit of 19th century Europe.
7852000	7856000	People didn't believe in the absolute power of kings or demanded change.
7856000	7862000	Hegel can be characterized as a perfectionist rationalist believing that history is moving towards perfection.
7862000	7868000	Now Hegel only interpreted history. His student wanted to change history.
7868000	7875000	Karl Marx who lived between 1818 and 1883 learned a great deal from Hegel.
7875000	7882000	He came to the conclusion that if we are the product of history our history must be the product of those who came before us.
7882000	7889000	Marx had a problem. Hegel was good at interpreting history even at recognizing the people who were capable of changing
7889000	7893000	but Marx was more concerned about changing things for the good
7893000	7898000	especially for the disadvantaged majority who were the real force behind economic production.
7898000	7900000	i.e. the working class.
7900000	7907000	Marx said the history of our existence has been nothing but a continuous class struggle between the haves and have nots
7907000	7913000	the powerful and the powerless with the powerful enjoying it all and the powerless having a tough time of it.
7913000	7921000	So Marx developed a philosophy of rational materialism arguing that material inequality was the truth of all evils.
7921000	7928000	He argued that humans are fundamentally motivated by material objects so we are rational because we want material things.
7928000	7932000	To solve this inequality he adopted egalitarianism.
7932000	7940000	For Marx the perfectionist future utopia was an egalitarian society where you only worked for the hours that provided you enough subsistence
7940000	7943000	and the rest of time you could relax on the beach.
7943000	7950000	You can also see traces of Christianity and Marxism the fight between good and evil culminating in the weak overthrowing the powerful
7950000	7957000	and turning the world into a utopian communist heaven where everyone lives equally and happily ever after.
7957000	7965000	But Marx was not religious so he based his philosophy on rational materialism in which all workers unite over through the exploitative class
7965000	7969000	and everyone lives in harmony and peace and nobody starves.
7969000	7978000	For Marx not only communism was desirable it was also historically inevitable because for him history was moving towards perfection
7978000	7983000	through incremental improvement or dialectical change as Hegel said.
7983000	7990000	For example feudalism was an improvement on hunter gatherer societies capitalism was an improvement on feudalism
7990000	7995000	socialism and improvement on capitalism and finally communism and improvement on socialism
7995000	7999000	and for Marx communism was the final phase of human history.
7999000	8005000	You couldn't make it any better just like heaven you cannot create a heaven that is better than another heaven
8005000	8011000	or maybe you could but generally heavens tend to mean perfection if they do exist of course.
8011000	8020000	Marxist class based analysis had deep communitarian roots or group based as a result it failed in a highly individualized Europe
8020000	8026000	despite many attempts for example in 1870s Paris had a socialist revolution but it didn't stick.
8026000	8032000	Marxism found fertile soil in countries with strong communitarian bond like Russia and China
8032000	8037000	so the 20th century witnessed many Marxist revolutions to move history in the right direction.
8037000	8042000	These attempts had partial success but ultimately failed to create a communist utopia.
8042000	8048000	So Hegel talked about history in motion Marx talked about how to speed up that historical motion
8048000	8052000	both Hegel and Marx saw things from a society's perspective.
8052000	8059000	Now I'll discuss how this history based philosophy applies to a person's own individual history from birth to death.
8059000	8063000	If a society has a history so does an individual.
8064000	8070000	Jean-Paul Sartre who lived between 1905 and 1980 was a French existentialist philosopher.
8070000	8076000	He was not a Marxist but was hugely influenced by Marx and other Marxists especially the Maoist movement in France.
8076000	8083000	Hegel and Marx both agreed that humans are not only the product of history we humans also serve the purpose of history.
8083000	8091000	Hegel explained reality through a godlike spirit or idea and Marx explained through a historical materialism in class struggle
8091000	8097000	in other words both argued that we individuals are there to serve the grander mission or purpose
8097000	8101000	be it God or history or class struggle or general society.
8101000	8104000	But what's the purpose of an individual human life?
8104000	8108000	Sartre's existentialist philosophy argued that human life has no purpose
8108000	8114000	because we are made neither by God nor by a blind force of history as Marx and Hegel outlined.
8114000	8118000	Instead we are made by our own history choices we make in our own life
8118000	8121000	in other words we have no essence or purpose from birth
8121000	8126000	we simply acquire it through our life often through our own free choices in actions.
8126000	8132000	Since we have no pre-ordained purpose set for us by some other power like God or society
8132000	8136000	we are free to make mistakes to find our own purpose.
8136000	8141000	Sartre even goes further by saying that we are condemned to be free and condemned to make mistakes
8141000	8144000	but this freedom comes with you guessed it.
8144000	8147000	As Uncle Ben said it comes with responsibility.
8147000	8152000	In other words we are our own makers we craft our own self-identity
8152000	8156000	therefore we have to live with what we make of ourselves.
8156000	8161000	Unlike Hegel and Marx Sartre liberates individuals from the constraints of God
8161000	8164000	history traditions class and even human nature.
8164000	8168000	So today a new trend among homo sapiens is transgenderism
8168000	8173000	the idea that you can define your own gender identity based on your own feelings.
8173000	8177000	People feel they are in the wrong body and they change their gender
8177000	8179000	and an attempt to correct the incorrect.
8179000	8182000	This might have been difficult in a pre-existentialist era
8182000	8186000	but now it's widely accepted in most of the developed world
8186000	8189000	you can decide what your identity is.
8189000	8193000	Instead of your biology, society's history, tradition or norms defining you
8193000	8198000	you have the full control to make yourself and find your own life's purpose.
8198000	8201000	As I said with this freedom comes responsibility.
8202000	8206000	If you make mistake you have to own those mistakes don't blame others.
8206000	8210000	In other words if you build a bridge and it collapses you are responsible
8210000	8214000	and the same way you build your own identity if something goes wrong
8214000	8216000	you cannot blame others for it.
8216000	8221000	So Jean Paul Sartre's existentialist philosophy gave the individual the full autonomy
8221000	8223000	to make something of themselves.
8223000	8227000	For him it wasn't social history but your own individual history
8227000	8230000	that makes you your own free choices.
8231000	8235000	Slavojecek was born in Slovenia in 1949.
8235000	8240000	Today he is the most important figure who subscribes to a history based philosophy.
8240000	8245000	He identifies himself as Hegelian who argues that Marxism has failed miserably
8245000	8249000	because most Marxists today live in the past, too attached to history.
8249000	8252000	Today's Marxists blame history for their failure.
8252000	8256000	In other words he says that Marxists today have lost touch with reality
8256000	8260000	and live in the past like an old man who has failed in his life projects.
8260000	8267000	This failure is most visible in his own style as he uses comedy to cope with that failure.
8267000	8270000	His philosophy is based on philosophical irony.
8270000	8273000	Marxists believe in history and historical struggle.
8273000	8276000	The very history that these philosophers based their ideas
8276000	8280000	failed their attempt to create a truly socialist society.
8280000	8285000	So history failed the philosophical tradition that based its core philosophy on history.
8285000	8289000	Now that's ironic and so on and so on and so on you get the point.
8290000	8294000	So to sum up Hegel said we are the product of history that keeps progressing
8294000	8302000	and Marx said let's not study history but let's speed it up to get our final destination, a communist utopia.
8302000	8308000	Sartre argues forget about class history we are the product of our own individual history
8308000	8310000	in which we'll also find our purpose.
8310000	8314000	And finally Zhecek says history has failed us all.
8314000	8316000	We have not progressed but regressed.
8316000	8320000	So our history is nothing but a history of failed intelligence or rationality.
8320000	8324000	Next I'll discuss the other strand of philosophy that came out of Kant
8324000	8326000	through Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche
8326000	8332000	which emphasizes not rationality or history or society but passion or will or human psyche
8332000	8336000	the mysterious subconscious world of psychological philosophy.
8340000	8345000	Previously I discussed a bunch of philosophy that put emphasis on historical and social changes
8345000	8348000	the main motivating factors for human actions.
8348000	8354000	For example philosophers like Hegel, Marx and Sartre argued that we are the product of history
8354000	8358000	either society's history or our own personal history.
8358000	8364000	In this segment I'll focus on the other branch of philosophy that is based on the individual human psyche
8364000	8367000	or the blind will that drives human actions.
8367000	8372000	In other words it's not the history or society but other mysterious forces inside us
8372000	8374000	like passion or the blind subconscious will.
8374000	8380000	The German philosopher Otto Schopenhauer who lived between 1788 and 1860
8380000	8383000	was firmly against Hegel's philosophy.
8383000	8388000	Schopenhauer took Kant's distinction between the noble world of phenomena
8388000	8393000	and the unknowable world of Númena to develop his own theory of will and representation.
8393000	8396000	Schopenhauer argued that there is no distinction between the two.
8396000	8400000	They are one in the same thing or two sides of the same coin.
8400000	8403000	He said there is one world which he called will.
8403000	8406000	But this will is mysterious and hard to understand.
8406000	8408000	It's built in inside us.
8408000	8412000	In other words all living beings and even non-living beings
8412000	8416000	come pre-assembled or pre-installed with this blind will.
8416000	8420000	Since it's built in inside each being we cannot fully know.
8420000	8425000	We can only know how it's represented or manifested to us but not the will itself.
8425000	8430000	The will itself is hidden from us all we see is its mere representation.
8430000	8434000	For Schopenhauer will is the blind driving force in the universe
8434000	8437000	and representation is our perception of that blind will.
8437000	8440000	In other words will is the essence of the universe
8440000	8444000	and we only see or understand its manifestation in us.
8444000	8447000	He called it will to life or passion for life
8447000	8452000	that we share with all living beings including animals and plants.
8452000	8456000	We all have an innate will to continue living.
8456000	8459000	Since the will itself is blind and universal
8459000	8463000	we each become its eye through which it looks out to the world.
8463000	8467000	Will is like a gigantic iceberg while our human intellect
8467000	8470000	or human perception of it is only the tip of that iceberg.
8470000	8475000	So Schopenhauer really went deeply psychological about human motivation.
8475000	8477000	Schopenhauer says it's impossible to know the will
8477000	8481000	because as soon as you observe it it becomes a representation of that will.
8481000	8484000	If you do not observe it then it is the will.
8484000	8487000	It's like in quantum mechanics your observation of a particle
8487000	8490000	changes the position of the particle.
8490000	8493000	In other words if you don't look it is there
8493000	8495000	but as soon as you look it changes position.
8495000	8498000	It's also a kind of catch-22.
8498000	8500000	To understand Schopenhauer's idea of will
8500000	8503000	is to imagine everything in the universe as one thing
8503000	8507000	let's say atoms that oscillates between everything that exists.
8507000	8511000	It appears to us as something that is not genuine thing
8511000	8513000	but a mere representation.
8513000	8515000	To fully understand Schopenhauer's will
8515000	8518000	it's important to mention the Buddhist idea of the self
8518000	8520000	as an illusion or mirage.
8520000	8523000	For the Buddhist soul is universal
8523000	8527000	but the self is a mere mirage we acquire in our lifetime.
8527000	8531000	In other words our essence is not the self we call me or I.
8531000	8535000	Schopenhauer too places the blind will at a much deeper place
8535000	8537000	than we understand or we can get to
8537000	8539000	and will only get a representation of it.
8539000	8543000	He also said that will is the cause of our human suffering.
8543000	8547000	Therefore Schopenhauer's often considered the father of pessimism.
8547000	8550000	Just like in Buddhism our ego desires things
8550000	8552000	and those desires makes us suffer
8552000	8555000	because we can never satisfy our desires fully.
8555000	8558000	Schopenhauer says since we have a body
8558000	8561000	we have a will that somehow controls us
8561000	8563000	and that causes us suffering.
8563000	8566000	So we are all at the mercy of this blind will
8566000	8568000	that urges us to do things.
8568000	8570000	The only way to cope with this suffering
8570000	8572000	is through intellect and art
8572000	8575000	which allows us to move to a state of non-existence
8575000	8577000	like in Buddhist Nirvana.
8577000	8579000	Artists while creating art
8579000	8582000	as well as us while enjoying that art
8582000	8585000	we all experience a moment of non-being
8585000	8587000	while in awe of its beauty.
8587000	8589000	When an art takes our breath away
8589000	8592000	we truly experience non-existence
8592000	8594000	a kind of blissful moment.
8594000	8597000	Schopenhauer influenced the German composer Richard Wagner
8597000	8600000	whose music represents Schopenhauer's philosophy.
8600000	8604000	For Schopenhauer music didn't represent the phenomenal world
8604000	8607000	therefore it was free from the will and urges
8607000	8609000	instead it fostered compassion.
8609000	8612000	Schopenhauer had a massive influence on novelists
8612000	8614000	and musicians of the 19th century.
8614000	8617000	He also influenced psychoanalysts
8617000	8619000	especially Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.
8619000	8622000	Schopenhauer also dismissed the idea of God
8622000	8624000	and replaced God with the blind will
8624000	8628000	and this had an influence on our next philosopher.
8630000	8632000	The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard
8632000	8635000	lived between 1813 and 1855.
8635000	8638000	He argued that our anxiety comes from our choices
8638000	8641000	or in other words our belief and complete freedom
8641000	8642000	to make choices.
8642000	8645000	In a world where everyone believes in God
8645000	8647000	where everything is caused by God
8647000	8650000	people accept it because there is no other choice.
8650000	8652000	In other words God tells you what to do
8652000	8653000	and what not to do.
8653000	8655000	You have no choice of your own.
8655000	8658000	But we live in a world where we no longer believe in God
8658000	8660000	so we have the freedom to choose
8660000	8663000	but this freedom comes at a massive psychological cost.
8663000	8666000	It makes us anxious about our choices
8666000	8668000	and the consequences of our choices.
8668000	8671000	When we are children we live a carefree life
8671000	8673000	because our parents take care of everything
8673000	8676000	and the same way a God fearing society
8676000	8678000	also lives in a kind of blissful ignorance.
8678000	8681000	Since God is dead or when parents die
8681000	8684000	we are responsible to make our own choices.
8684000	8688000	The psychological toll of making choices is immense on us.
8688000	8691000	For example, Hamlet agonizes over the question
8691000	8694000	of to be or not to be in Shakespeare's play.
8694000	8697000	Incidentally Hamlet was also a dain like Kierkegaard.
8697000	8700000	In the 19th century a hysteria was very prevalent
8700000	8702000	especially among women.
8702000	8705000	Today anxiety is more common among both men and women
8705000	8708000	so absolute freedom makes us anxious.
8708000	8711000	Kierkegaard himself never lost faith in God
8711000	8714000	but he saw freedom as good and bad.
8714000	8716000	While it makes us anxious and dizzy
8716000	8719000	it also allows us to make good moral choices.
8719000	8721000	His problem with Hegel's theory of history
8721000	8724000	was that it gave little room for individual freedom
8724000	8727000	because we were bound by the historical force.
8727000	8730000	In fact we suffer not because of the bigger forces in society
8730000	8733000	but we suffer through our own action
8733000	8736000	or choices we make as individuals.
8736000	8739000	So Schopenhauer said the blind will motivate us
8739000	8742000	while living us with minimum freedom of our own
8742000	8746000	and Kierkegaard said that little freedom induces anxiety in us.
8746000	8751000	Now these two philosophers come together in our next philosopher.
8753000	8755000	The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche
8755000	8758000	lived between 1844 and 1900.
8758000	8761000	He was a great admirer of Schopenhauer.
8761000	8764000	He accepted Schopenhauer's idea of the will
8764000	8768000	but he had a big problem how passive this will to life was.
8768000	8771000	Nietzsche argued that this will blinded maybe
8771000	8775000	can be harnessed and utilized for great purposes
8775000	8778000	artistic genius and philosophical flourishing.
8778000	8780000	He changed the passive will to life
8780000	8783000	into a proactive will to power.
8783000	8785000	In other words we are not here just to live
8785000	8788000	but we are here to grow, conquer and dominate.
8788000	8792000	Nature is based on competition not a state of blissfulness
8792000	8794000	or mere survival.
8794000	8796000	Nietzsche saw religion especially its morality
8796000	8799000	as the biggest obstacle for individuals to push boundaries
8799000	8801000	in order to achieve greatness.
8801000	8803000	Morality decides what's good what's bad
8803000	8807000	so society promotes certain values and restricts others.
8807000	8810000	Nietzsche saw this as a weak minded way of living
8810000	8812000	that promoted weak or slave mentality.
8812000	8815000	He instead proposed a more nature based approach
8815000	8818000	in which no morality can restrict innovation
8818000	8822000	probing artistic creativity and philosophical ideas.
8822000	8824000	Nietzsche wants to grow, dominate
8824000	8827000	while religions suppress and tame people.
8827000	8829000	Nietzsche proposed the idea of ubermensch
8829000	8833000	a being who has surpassed humanity into something else
8833000	8836000	a free-spread artist or a philosophical genius.
8836000	8839000	He is no longer bound by social values and norms
8839000	8842000	because he has shed his human qualities of weakness
8842000	8845000	and slave mentality and religious compassion.
8845000	8848000	He is released from all that into an enormous
8848000	8851000	creative energy and exuberance for life.
8851000	8854000	Nietzsche also saw western philosophy championing rationality
8854000	8857000	at the expense of passion and emotions.
8857000	8860000	For him, passion was as important as reason.
8860000	8863000	Reason is just a tool it provides us with technology
8863000	8866000	that makes life easier and more comfortable.
8866000	8868000	But reason cannot motivate us to do things
8868000	8870000	that are daring and courageous.
8870000	8873000	Instead rationality makes us risk averse.
8873000	8876000	This timidness leads us to a hiddenism
8876000	8879000	in which we only seek pleasure and avoid pain.
8879000	8882000	This is a kind of nihilistic self-indulgence
8882000	8885000	that makes you lazy and self-centered.
8885000	8888000	Human passion on the other hand motivates us to do things
8888000	8891000	conquer the world and topple mountains.
8891000	8893000	So Nietzsche's philosophy was based on human passion
8893000	8896000	or the will to power to surpass the current humans
8896000	8898000	into a great genius.
8898000	8900000	Nietzsche didn't believe in equality either
8900000	8903000	because only a handful of people could become
8903000	8906000	great artists and genius philosophers.
8906000	8909000	Not everyone has original ideas.
8909000	8912000	So to sum up, Schopenhauer placed human motivation
8912000	8915000	on the blind in a twill while Kierkegaard said
8915000	8918000	our anxiety comes from the little freedom we experience
8918000	8921000	and Nietzsche argued we're driven by will to power
8921000	8924000	or passion to push society forward and innovate.
8924000	8927000	Today's sociology and psychology have replaced
8927000	8930000	philosophy when it comes to human motivation.
8930000	8933000	One of the leading voices of psychology is
8933000	8936000	Jordan Peterson who was born in 1962
8936000	8939000	and has adopted YouTube as his platform.
8939000	8942000	Another contemporary voice is the Indian Yogi
8942000	8945000	Sadguru. Peterson believes in human passion
8945000	8948000	and faith telling young people to take individual
8948000	8951000	responsibility. Unlike Zezek, Peterson doesn't
8951000	8954000	see the world through group identity like class or gender
8954000	8957000	but through the lens of the individual. His idea
8957000	8960000	of perception is somewhat similar to Schopenhauer's will
8960000	8963000	and representation. Sadguru, an Indian Yogi Guru
8963000	8966000	on the other hand argues that today's world is shaped
8966000	8969000	by materialism and people have conflated
8969000	8972000	the desire for more with happiness. Our goal
8972000	8975000	is no longer happiness but to have more.
8975000	8978000	He argues it's time we reach a higher level of intelligence
8978000	8981000	so we are in charge of our body. Not
8981000	8984000	our bodily desires in charge of our mind.
8984000	8987000	He argues that modern society even science has
8987000	8990000	become a slave to human bodily desires to make us
8990000	8993000	more comfortable. As a result it has blinded us
8993000	8996000	from other possibilities of human intelligence
8996000	8999000	or human consciousness to reach higher places.
8999000	9002000	So to sum up Schopenhauer said we are driven
9002000	9005000	by universal will or passion for which we have
9005000	9008000	no control and this causes us to suffer
9008000	9011000	and art is our best cure for suffering.
9011000	9014000	Kierkegaard argued that our anxiety or suffering
9014000	9017000	is also caused by our freedom of choices in life
9017000	9020000	which kind of negates Schopenhauer's blind will.
9020000	9023000	Nietzsche said this human passion that causes a suffering
9023000	9026000	is also a great tool to do something.
9026000	9029000	Create something and become greater than ourselves.
9029000	9032000	Peterson says to ease suffering is to take responsibility
9032000	9035000	and make something of your individual life instead
9035000	9038000	of blaming others. Sattguru argues
9038000	9041000	for a new form of human consciousness that goes
9041000	9044000	beyond the material world.
9044000	9047000	So to sum up human philosophy in the last 2,500 years
9047000	9050000	has tried to answer many different questions.
9050000	9053000	Early Greeks tried empirical knowledge to explain
9053000	9056000	the world while early eastern philosophers
9056000	9059000	tried to psychologically cope with the problem of existence.
9059000	9062000	Then later philosophers tried to explain life's
9062000	9065000	purpose with the humanists focusing on the equality
9065000	9068000	among humans while the elitists or political realists
9068000	9071000	emphasized competition to push society forward.
9071000	9074000	Then Kant brought rationalism and empiricism together
9074000	9077000	and the next generation of Germans took him
9077000	9080000	in two separate directions. Hegel went historical
9080000	9083000	saying we are made by history while Schopenhauer
9083000	9086000	went deeper into human psyche saying we are made
9086000	9089000	by a blind will. Perhaps today we are moving towards
9089000	9092000	a new philosophy that is not based on reason but human
9092000	9095000	intuition.
9095000	9098000	To sum up this video in part 1 I discussed
9098000	9101000	how humans' knowledge of depth and the rise
9101000	9104000	of rational thinking gave rise to human philosophy
9104000	9107000	in an attempt to answer some of life's fundamental questions
9107000	9110000	like the meaning of life, the nature of reality
9110000	9113000	and the function of the human mind. Then over time
9113000	9116000	each of those topics became a discipline of its own
9116000	9119000	philosophy gave birth to physics, biology, psychology.
9119000	9122000	Physics focused on reality, biology on life
9122000	9125000	and psychology on the human mind. Later I looked
9125000	9128000	at the various branches of philosophy such as ontology,
9128000	9131000	epistemology, rationalism, empiricism, humanism,
9131000	9134000	utilitarianism, existentialism and postmodernism.
9134000	9137000	In part 2 I discussed how Eastern philosophy was based
9137000	9140000	around rivers and agriculture therefore spirituality
9140000	9143000	and fatalism became the dominant philosophical ideas.
9143000	9146000	Western philosophy on the other hand was based on oceans
9146000	9149000	and trade which focused more on rational thinking.
9149000	9152000	The fundamental difference is that Eastern philosophy
9152000	9155000	emphasizes changing oneself while Western philosophy
9155000	9158000	wants to change the world. I discussed how the Greek
9158000	9161000	giants of Socrates played to an Aristotle question
9161000	9164000	dogma in promoted rational thinking. While the
9164000	9167000	Eastern true of Buddha, Lao Tzu and Confucius showed
9167000	9170000	how not to change nature but become one with nature
9170000	9173000	by changing yourself. In part 3 I discussed
9173000	9176000	the purpose of human civilization and human life.
9176000	9179000	Elitism sees society as a competition ground
9179000	9182000	while egalitarianism promotes equality.
9182000	9185000	Philosophers such as Sun Tzu, Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes
9185000	9188000	saw humans as animals so they offered a
9188000	9191000	hierarchical social system to mimic nature where
9191000	9194000	the most adept survive. Philosophers such as
9194000	9197000	Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire promoted equality
9197000	9200000	instead. On the question of knowledge or happiness
9200000	9203000	the Rosmas, Montaigne, Bertrand Russell argued
9203000	9206000	one should prioritize happiness. While philosophers
9206000	9209000	such as Francis Bacon, Heidegger and Michel Foucault
9209000	9212000	prioritized knowledge to better one's life and understand
9212000	9215000	the nature of society. In part 4 I tackled the question
9215000	9218000	of knowledge by discussing rationalism and empiricism.
9218000	9221000	Rationalists see knowledge as innate inside us
9221000	9224000	while empiricists see knowledge only coming from
9224000	9227000	outside experience. Kant provided a middle ground
9227000	9230000	saying we have innate mental structure that we put out
9230000	9233000	to the world to give us a more structured understanding
9233000	9236000	of the world. And in other words we are not passive
9236000	9239000	receivers but active organizers of the world.
9239000	9242000	I also discussed what shapes us and motivates our action.
9242000	9245000	Hegel and Marx's history based philosophy argued
9245000	9248000	we are the product of history and Jean-Paul Sartre
9248000	9251000	who said we are the product of our own individual history.
9251000	9254000	On the psychological side we saw Schopenhauer who placed
9254000	9257000	human motivation in the subconscious blind will.
9257000	9260000	Kierkegaard focused on how freedom creates an anxiety.
9260000	9263000	Nietzsche said we can channel the blind will
9263000	9266000	and use anxiety to create art.
9266000	9269000	If you have made it to this point a huge kudos to you
9269000	9272000	I really appreciate it. So my question to you
9272000	9275000	which philosophy or philosopher resonated with you the most?
9275000	9278000	Or a more interesting question is
9278000	9281000	where do you see philosophy heading? As always
9281000	9284000	I really appreciate you accompanying me on this long journey.
9284000	9285000	Thank you.
