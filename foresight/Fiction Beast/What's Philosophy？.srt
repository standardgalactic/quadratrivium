00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Hi everyone, in this video I'll tell you the story of human philosophy encompassing an incredible 2500 years of philosophical history.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,800
By the end of this video you will know all the basic philosophical ideas, schools, approaches,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,000
as well as some of the most influential philosophers from around the world.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,300
The video has 4 major parts and each with 2-3 sections, just like chapters and books.

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:29,400
In part 1 I'll answer the most fundamental question, why are humans the only species that have invented philosophy?

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Or where does philosophy really come from?

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,300
Also, how has philosophy evolved in the past 2500 years?

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,600
And why philosophy has so many branches such as ontology, epistemology, rationalism,

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,800
periscism, humanism, utilitarianism, existentialism, postmodernism and more.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
In part 2 I'll look at the origin and differences between Eastern philosophy and Western philosophy.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,500
Why one emphasizes spirituality and changing yourself while the other emphasizes rationality and changing the world?

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:09,300
I'll look at the Greek giants of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, as well as the 3 giants of Eastern philosophy, the Buddha, Lao Tzu and Confucius.

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,000
In part 3 I'll look at the philosophy of life and human civilization.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Is the purpose of human civilization to promote equality or competition?

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Is the purpose of human life to seek knowledge or happiness?

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:34,100
I'll discuss philosophers such as Sanzu, Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, Erasmus, Michel de Montaigne, Francis Bacon, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault and Bertrand Russell.

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,000
In part 4 I'll tackle the question of knowledge and human motivation.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,900
How do we know reality?

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll discuss a school of European rationalism versus British empiricism and Kant's reconciliation of the two.

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,500
After Kant, two distinct schools of philosophy emerged to explain human motivation.

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,700
One sociological and one psychological.

22
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,900
Hegel's sociological philosophy argue we are motivated by historical forces.

23
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,900
While Schopenhauer's psychological philosophy argue we are motivated by a blind subconscious will.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:16,700
So get yourself a strong cup of coffee and some popcorn and let fiction beats take you on a journey of how homo sapiens huge brain terrify their tiny heart.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,800
As a result they invented all sorts of beasts from gods to demons to fairies in attempt to comfort themselves and explain the world.

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,000
But also invented philosophy to answer three deep existential questions.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Why am I here?

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Where have I come from and where am I going?

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,400
To answer your first question you are here because you are curious about philosophy so let's begin.

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,900
What is philosophy?

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,500
How did we come about it?

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
And why do we need it?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,100
And what has happened to philosophy today?

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,900
And what's the future of philosophy?

35
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Today I'll answer all these questions as I discuss the rise and fall of human philosophy.

36
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,900
We humans utilize three massive weapons to navigate the world around us and they're all built in inside us.

37
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,700
As a result we humans are the most sophisticated animal that has ever lived on earth which is incredible.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Next time someone complains about the world being unfair remind them of these amazing tools that every human has.

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,700
While other animals don't have all of them.

40
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
What are they?

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Like all animals the first and most important tool is instinct which most of the time subconsciously shapes our behavior.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,700
We have three basic instincts.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Food, sex, company.

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,900
Our first and most important instinct is survival.

45
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,200
We spend a minimum of eight hours or one third of a day working to earn bread.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,300
Imagine we didn't have this instinct.

47
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
How would you motivate yourself to work?

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,700
Or worse still how would you motivate others to work?

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,900
Our survival instinct goes beyond food.

50
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,000
We instinctively avoid danger and anything that threatens our life.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Do you think what happened to creatures who didn't have survival instinct?

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,700
They needed a self-help book to motivate themselves.

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:19,200
After working eight hours in the evenings we spend hours prowling our city center bars and restaurants in search of a mate or courting a mate.

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,700
This is the instinct to procreate.

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course nowadays we chase a mate for recreational purposes.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,700
The sexual urge is so strongly wired in us especially men that we do it despite the fact that most of us have no plan to have children.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:43,200
The giant panda is going extinct because they have become too lethargic to have sex so the Chinese government spends lots of money to make more pandas.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Imagine our ancestors didn't want to procreate.

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
We wouldn't be here.

60
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,400
Our third most basic instinct is seeking the company of other humans.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,600
While men have a stronger sexual urge, women have a stronger urge for company.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,400
Without this instinct we would all end up alone and perhaps would never have a civilization.

63
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:12,300
Basically our instincts tell us what to do most of the time so we don't have to really think about it or twist our brain to motivate ourselves to do these things.

64
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:21,500
We instinctively seek food, a partner and a company of other people which allow our conscious brain to save energy on something else.

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:33,500
The second weapon in how we navigate life is our emotions which fluctuates day to day and allows us to understand ourselves and those around us.

66
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Our emotions give us hints about our environment.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,500
Depending on the time and place we feel angry, sad, frightened, content, happy and ecstatic.

68
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:52,500
If instincts are like climate that remains stable long term, our emotions are like weather that regulates our daily life.

69
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Our instinctive urges push us to do things to achieve what we want but our environment says yes or no.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
For example, seeking a partner we want someone but that person wants someone else.

71
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Here comes our emotions to allow us to cope with this failure.

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Or worse still our survival is threatened, our emotions allow us to cope.

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,000
So emotions allow us to grow, change and adapt to a new place or a person somewhat quickly.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Our emotions are incredibly powerful and motivating us to do things right away.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Negative or positive emotions help us grow and move on and seek a better environment.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,500
In fact one of the reasons human conquer the world is because we are not happy where we are for a long time.

77
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Apart from seeking food and safety we are also motivated by boredom.

78
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
So our emotions give our conscious mind more free time to do other things.

79
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Instead our emotions do the job for us and motivating us to move, grow and change.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,500
Our third and perhaps the most sophisticated weapon we have is reason,

81
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,000
which is the basis of science and technology which allows civilizations to flourish.

82
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
This makes us different from other animals,

83
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,500
our ability to make rational decisions based on informed knowledge and calculated risk.

84
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Instinct and emotions are hardwired in us from birth

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,000
but rationality is mostly learned through direct experience of our own

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,500
as well as knowledge passed on from our parents and ancestors either orally or in writing.

87
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,000
In fact our rationality is so powerful that it can regulate our instinct and emotions.

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
For example our ability to delay gratification allows us to forgo our present pleasure for future and long term pleasure.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,500
Of course not all humans are born equal when it comes to delayed gratification.

90
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Some want their cake right away, some can wait a bit longer

91
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
but rationality is an incredible tool for us to look long term not just here and now.

92
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Today we live in a modern world or in the age of rationality.

93
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,000
All our modern technological conveniences are the result of rational science.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
To sum up humans are hardwired with three incredible tools, instincts, emotions and reason.

95
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But where does philosophy fit in this?

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The word philosophy in Greek means the love of wisdom.

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So the first true human science was philosophy.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In fact philosophers were the first rational thinkers who replaced the wise old men or women.

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
They were career thinkers meaning they were known for their thoughts and wisdoms.

100
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,500
So philosophy at its core is a structure rational thinking.

101
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
In other words its foundation is rationality.

102
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Why?

103
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,500
We humans developed a more sophisticated brain, perhaps the discovery of fire allowed us to cook our food.

104
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,500
So we could digest our food much quicker as a result we had more time to think.

105
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
When you're busy you have no time to think.

106
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,000
In fact I do my thinking while in the toilet because I don't have my smartphone with me.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But this brain good in many ways also came with a disadvantage.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It allows us to develop acute consciousness or self awareness.

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The more we understand our environment and our own existence,

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the more we start to brood and ask difficult questions.

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
One reason today we control our brain by keeping ourselves busy or hooked on something

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
like work or entertainment or smartphone.

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,500
With this thinking brain came the most devastating awareness of all death.

114
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Other animals might know death when it comes to them so they instinctively avoid danger.

115
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
But we human beasts know death from an early age.

116
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,500
As rational animals we learn from the past to anticipate the future.

117
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
In other words we anticipate death.

118
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Despite trying not to think about it we have this fear in the back of our mind.

119
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
So this brain of ours became powerful enough to ask important questions.

120
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
Why are we here?

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is reality and how we know it?

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Early humans couldn't explain the world, life, the things around them,

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,000
especially the sun, the light, seasons, thunder, fire, etc.

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,500
But the most important question was why death?

125
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
This is the main theme of the oldest surviving human story, the Epic of Galgamesh.

126
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Written three or four thousand years ago in which the hero is seeking immortality.

127
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
But unfortunately he fails.

128
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
So to console himself he builds a city so people could remember him.

129
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Other humans invented gods and religions as security blankets.

130
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,500
In fact the fear of death is so strong in humans that nearly every religion has extended life to afterlife.

131
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,000
So death couldn't scare us anymore.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You could say that human life is so short that we have to have an afterlife.

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
However today most people don't believe in afterlife.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Politically or practically early human societies were ruled by its strongest among them or a group of strong men.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then through the passage of time generations later myths, legends and stories about these strong people were created.

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
As time passed these legends and myths gave these early strong people titanic god-like roles.

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
As Italo Calvino once said, folktales are told and retold so many times that they become like pebbles.

138
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Smooth, shiny and perfect.

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course the earliest gods were usually known human phenomena such as the sun, thunder, light, dark, earth and so forth.

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But over time they took a semi-human form.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Later these ideas became more sophisticated in the form of religion that told sophisticated stories about the origin of life

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and also explained death through afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.

143
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But philosophers tried to explain without relying on gods and the supernatural.

144
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So they used reason to ask two important questions which became the two main pillars of philosophy.

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
One what's really out there and two how we know it.

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So ontology asks what's reality and what things exist or don't exist.

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And epistemology asks how we know the world.

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So philosophy became a rational tool for humans to understand the world, the meaning of life and how to navigate the world correctly.

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So early philosophers studied all sciences from stars to frogs and everything in between.

150
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But if you bolded down the three main subjects for philosophers were the physical world, the origin of life and the human mind.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In other words, what is the world and how does it work?

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What is life and how it works?

153
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And what is human mind and how does it work?

154
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So remember these three main topics also play philosophy's own downfall.

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
As time passed, philosophy became too big and too sophisticated so it gave birth to other disciplines.

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In 15th and 16th century Europe, the first baby was born.

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
For example Galileo, Copernicus and Newton were the pioneers of physics.

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So physicists took over the job of studying the world, the universe, stars, planets and matter as a whole.

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
A big load was off the philosophers' shoulders and now they focus more on metaphysics.

160
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
i.e. the meaning of life and the property of the human mind.

161
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Then in the 18th and 19th century however, another baby was born.

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Biology took over the job of studying life.

163
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Philosophers no longer needed to dissect, frog to understand the human body.

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,000
An important biologist was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionized everything we know about life and its origin.

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So philosophers were left only to focus on the human mind.

166
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But unfortunately they would snatch that away from philosophers too.

167
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, philosophy gave birth to its last baby.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We call it psychology that took over the job of studying the human mind.

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Two big names are Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, who both placed importance on the subconscious, the unconscious mind, as greater motivation in human behavior.

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So philosophers didn't have to diagnose a human mind anymore.

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Few first centuries philosophers were doing the jobs of four people, a physicist, a biologist, a psychologist, and a philosopher.

172
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now they could enjoy a bit more free time and just sit in their comfy chairs and be philosophers.

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
After all, everyone has to retire at some point.

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But retirement is a tough period in anyone's life.

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
With that things to do, you either face an existential crisis or become lazy and wrought away.

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So today philosophers have become a bit lazy on the whole.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But also they are a bit out of touch because physics, biology, and psychology have become too specialized.

178
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So philosophers don't have the time to rigorously study all three disciplines.

179
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Also they don't want to get their hands dirty dissecting frogs or spending hours staring at telescopes to study the stars or spend time with mentally ill patients.

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So the big question is, what is the purpose of philosophy today?

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Should it unify physics, biology, and psychology once again?

182
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Or should it find a new path for itself?

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Frederick Nietzsche, the first to fully diagnose the problem of Western philosophy, took philosophy back to the cave through his Zoro Tustra.

184
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Who instead of prophesizing for a single god and the divine tell us about the new type of human.

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ubermansch, who instead of following social values, create new ones through their artistic and philosophical works.

186
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like the early humans who went to the cave to gain wisdom.

187
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Nietzsche accrued science philosophy for being too rational, not passionate enough.

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Philosophy is an old man who has produced many amazing kids and now feels lost for a purpose.

189
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why? It's very simple. It lacks passion.

190
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Philosophy started as a rational tool, but it was also its downfall.

191
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:42,000
As we saw, science like physics, biology took over the rational side of philosophy and psychology took over the irrational side of philosophy, to put it very crudely.

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What is left? Not much.

193
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is philosophy completely doomed? Well, not quite, I have an answer.

194
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Earlier I mentioned the three big human weapons, instincts, emotions, and reason.

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Biology and psychology are taking care of the instinct and the unconscious.

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Literature takes care of the human emotions through storytelling, and science takes care of reason.

197
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So is philosophy without a channel? Not quite. My solution is human intuition.

198
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There you go. A new philosophy should be based on human intuition.

199
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What is intuition? In a nutshell, instincts are mostly unconscious. Reason is mostly conscious.

200
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And emotions are somewhere in the middle. Where does intuition fit in?

201
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It is somewhere between instinct, the hard rock foundation, and reason, the hard rock roof over your head.

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So intuition is fluid between two solid surfaces, and also right next to emotions, which is very volatile and even more fluid.

203
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Intuition is a layer deeper than rationality and a level above instinct.

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So the new philosophy should be based on intuition because it has direct access to instinct, but also reason.

205
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So in a way, it fits right between the unconscious psychology and the conscious rational sciences like physics and biology.

206
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Scientists don't utilize intuition, so it's a perfect tool for philosophy to understand and explain the world.

207
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why intuition? An intuition-based philosophy can equip us with a better weapon to cope with suffering.

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Rationality through sciences provides us with security, physical utility, and comfort through medicine and technology, like a traditional father would.

209
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Science builds your house, produces your food and clothes.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Emotions provide you with love and care like a traditional mother would, which is literature and stories.

211
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Intuition provides you with the ability to have insights, original ideas, inventiveness, and the ability to connect dots so you have a goal or mission in your life, or relevance in society.

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Intuition is fast, snappy, and in the moment insight, or genius that allows societies move forward.

213
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
In fact, most inventions and discoveries can be attributed to intuition, not rational thinking.

214
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Reason is slow, instinct is too rigid, and emotions cloud your judgment in the moment, but intuition is hit and miss.

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When it hits, it sparks a new light.

216
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So, is there a philosopher who bases his philosophy on intuition? I'm glad you asked, yes there is.

217
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, argued that intuition can vitalize life and give us a new spark.

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
As Nietzsche argued, reason-based philosophy has become too stale.

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
For Bergson, intuition is the closest thing to a direct experience of something.

220
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
For example, if you want to know a city, you can read all the maps and photographs of the buildings.

221
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But it cannot be as good as if you walk the streets of that city.

222
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
For example, you can never fully convey the taste of an apple to someone who has never eaten an apple.

223
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That intuitive experience is the closest we humans get to experiencing the taste of an apple.

224
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So, intuition takes us back to our nature, while reason is moving us away from nature.

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Of course, Bergson is famous for his philosophy of time, creativity, and humor.

226
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He thought intuition and life go together. We know reason tries to tame our natural instincts and emotions.

227
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Rightly so, but it can also go too far in taming us into a docile animal with no vitality.

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Bergson's philosophy is called vitalism because he wanted to liberate us from the chain of reason.

229
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So, philosophy started as a rational tool to understand the world, life, and the human mind.

230
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Then it gave away those roles to physicists, biologists, and psychologists.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Now it's almost become redundant, so we need a new intuitive philosophy.

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But to really understand philosophy and where it's done today, we need to know the history of philosophy.

233
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's various schools, approaches, eastern, western, humanists, animalists, rationalists, empiricists, social philosophy versus individual philosophy.

234
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So, in the following episodes, I'll go through human philosophy to give you an overview of the entire 2005-100 years of human philosophy.

235
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Next, I'll explain some of the common philosophical terms, like what is the difference between ontology and epistemology, physics and metaphysics,

236
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
rationalism versus empiricism, humanism versus utilitarianism, existentialism versus postmodernism and more.

237
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Stay tuned. Thank you for watching.

238
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Previously, I discussed that philosophy at its core deals with two fundamental questions, what is and how we know it.

239
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Those two questions in turn lead to other questions, like how we should live our lives.

240
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So, in this segment, I'll look at some important philosophical terms, questions, and various branches of philosophy.

241
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
For example, what are the differences between ontology and epistemology, or between reason and logic,

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
or between humanism and utilitarianism, or between existentialism and postmodernism.

243
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What is metaphysics? What is the difference between rationalism and empiricism, and what is phenomenology?

244
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And most importantly, why we grapple with the biggest question today between egalitarianism and elitism.

245
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ontology versus epistemology.

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Early philosophy was based on two main questions.

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What is reality, which became ontology, and how we know it, which is epistemology.

248
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So ontology asks what is and what is not.

249
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And epistemology asks how we know the thing that exists or does not exist.

250
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
For example, according to ontological philosophy, humans are either animals or not animals.

251
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
If not animals, therefore humans are sacred and fundamentally valuable.

252
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It is accepted as a foundation based on your beliefs, so murdering a human being is one of the most serious crimes.

253
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, thou shalt not kill is based on ontological notion that human life is sacred.

254
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So ontological philosophy gave birth to sciences in order to understand the world, nature, and human biology.

255
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Aristotle is usually considered the father of modern sciences.

256
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Epistemology, on the other hand, is about how we gather knowledge.

257
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
A good example is how we know where we know.

258
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Immanuel Kant said we can never know reality as it is, but we only know things on a limited level.

259
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Why? Because everything has to funnel through the human mind, which is a structure in a way that categorizes things in a certain way.

260
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
In other words, we humans put a structure onto the world based on how the human mind works.

261
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And the world in itself is unknowable to us because we cannot get out of our human mind.

262
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We can never know the thing in itself.

263
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Michel Foucault went a step further saying that knowledge is power, meaning those in position of science and technology have immense power over others.

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He said there is no impartial or power-free science.

265
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Knowledge is a tool in the hands of the powerful.

266
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll discuss these more later, so to sum up, ontology is the philosophy of existence, while epistemology is the philosophy of knowledge of that existence.

267
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Metaphysics vs Physics

268
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Physics was part of philosophical studies until a few centuries ago, before it became a separate discipline.

269
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Physics mainly studies matter, from the smallest particles to the biggest stars.

270
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Metaphysics, however, is the study of what is beyond the physical world, like ideas, forms, and soul, which is closer to the religious idea of God and the spirits.

271
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
A scientist might say human consciousness is rooted in matter and would not exist without brain cells.

272
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
A metaphysician, on the other hand, might say consciousness is independent of matter, either comes from the higher power or the universe itself is conscious.

273
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So, physics is the study of physical matter, while metaphysics is the study of non-physical entities.

274
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Reason vs Logic

275
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Logic has its origins in mathematics.

276
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
For example, 2 plus 2 equals 4 is logical, because it follows a very rigid rule that gives you one answer.

277
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But logic is also used as a language of philosophy in order to communicate philosophical ideas.

278
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So, logic is like a foundation on which philosophical debates take place.

279
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Without logic, it is very hard to talk to other people, because in order for a discussion to take place, there has to be some ground basic rules on which all philosophers agree.

280
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So, logic is a method of communication for philosophical arguments.

281
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
A good example is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who wanted to make communication as precise as possible.

282
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Also, Bertrand Russell applied mathematics to philosophy.

283
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Reason and logic often go hand in hand.

284
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Since logic is very rigid, like a computer or a game of chess, some argue it limits human ability to express things that go beyond logic, like human emotions and passion.

285
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So, reason or rationality is somewhat more subjective and less scientifically rigorous, like logic.

286
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So, reason is often used to persuade people, while logic is outcome is independent.

287
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
In other words, if someone uses logic, the outcome might not benefit the argument, while reason is a bit more selective.

288
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So, people use reason to support their argument.

289
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We often use rationalization as a negative form of reason used to persuade people.

290
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Logic is more mathematical, while reason is more linguistic.

291
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Rationalism versus empiricism.

292
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Rationalism is a school of philosophy that believes we understand the world based on our prior ability to reason.

293
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It places human beings as a special creature with the ability to know the world,

294
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
so it has its roots in religion that places human beings as an exception to the animal kingdom.

295
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
In other words, we are pre-assembled with reason as a tool.

296
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A good example of a rationalist is René Descartes, who famously said,

297
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I think therefore I am.

298
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
In other words, the ability to rationalize a thing was enough to know our existence.

299
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Leibniz was another famous rationalist.

300
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Empiricism, on the other hand, believes that we know the world through experience.

301
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Our thoughts come as a result of experience.

302
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We know the property of fire because we experience the heat.

303
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Babies have no fear of fire inside them from birth.

304
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We experience the pain, therefore we associate fire with pain.

305
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Empiricism is more British, while rationalism is more continental European, mainly French and German.

306
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Famous empiricists were John Locke and David Hume.

307
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Empiricism is also close to pragmatism, most associated with northern European cold climates,

308
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
which make you become more practical.

309
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Immanuel Kant combined rationalism and empiricism in his philosophy,

310
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
saying that experience is not enough to know the world.

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Our own mental structure imposes categories to the world.

312
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In other words, we are not passive, just receiving knowledge through experiences,

313
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
but we actively give the world a structure.

314
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He said we cannot know the world as it is, but we know it as our mind's structure.

315
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But our knowledge of the world is limited to the limit of the human mental structure.

316
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Kant's philosophy also gave rise to a phenomenology that studies an object relative to our own experience.

317
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Not the object in of itself.

318
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Kant made a distinction between phenomena, which is how we experience the world,

319
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and phenomena, which is the world in itself, which we can never know.

320
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll discuss this later.

321
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So, for rationalists, we know the world because we know.

322
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
While for empiricists, we know the world because we experience things.

323
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Political philosophy versus ethics.

324
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Ethics is a branch of philosophy that deals with morality, justice, and the legal system.

325
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Ethics is more practical and pragmatic, while political philosophy deals with how societies decide what is right and what is wrong,

326
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and how to live peacefully in a society, and how we punish those who break rules.

327
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
As a society evolves, so does its morality, so ethics change.

328
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Something that might be morally acceptable a few centuries ago is not acceptable today.

329
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It also depends on culture.

330
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Some actions are morally right in one culture, but not in another.

331
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Political philosophy is the study of ethics and how it changes.

332
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Egalitarianism versus elitism.

333
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:31,000
One of the most fundamental questions philosophy has grappled over centuries is the idea of equality versus quality.

334
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Egalitarian philosophy has its roots and religions, such as Christianity,

335
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that all humans have equal dignity and are equally sacred.

336
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But egalitarianism as a philosophy became prominent in Europe during the Enlightenment period of 18th and 19th centuries.

337
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Karl Marx is perhaps the most famous egalitarian philosopher who believed in a communist society where all the resources were shared equally among people.

338
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Elitism, on the other hand, believes that we should run society best in meritocracy, meaning not everyone gets a trophy.

339
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Some people deserve certain rights and privileges because they earn those things.

340
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Elitism has its roots and nature because the animal kingdom runs on a hierarchy, which is part of the evolutionary process.

341
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The most famous elitist philosopher was Friedrich Nietzsche, who incidentally lived around the same time as Marx.

342
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
For Nietzsche, great artists and philosophers are not the same as ordinary people, therefore should not be treated so.

343
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Today, the biggest debate in the West is these two schools of thought, equality for all or privileges for those who earn them.

344
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So, egalitarian philosophy believes in equality for all while elitist philosophy believes in merits.

345
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Humanism vs. Utilitarianism

346
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Humanism was born in Europe during the Enlightenment of 18th century, which replaced God with humans.

347
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Instead of the divine being in charge of this planet, we rational humans assumed the ownership of this planet.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Humanists believe in an egalitarian world where all humans are equal, which is rooted in religions and belief that humans are created equal.

349
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But in reality, that is not true. Not all humans are equal. Some are more equal than others, as Giorgio will famously say in Animal Farm.

350
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So, in philosophy, the big question is this. Which humans should determine our social, political and moral values?

351
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Here comes utilitarianism, a branch of humanism that believes in moral values that benefit the greatest number of people.

352
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Not all humans, but the largest majority of humans.

353
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The word utility focuses on how something benefits someone.

354
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Pre-enlightenment world was dominated by kings and aristocrats while the majority worked to benefit the minority.

355
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
With its roots in Machiavelli's philosophy of end justifies the means, utilitarianism turned it on its head.

356
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Instead of the minority, it focused on the majority.

357
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
All actions should be judged by the results that bring the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.

358
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Utilitarianism was big in England and the most famous one was Jeremy Bentham and later Stuart Mill.

359
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Today's democracy is a little like utilitarian majority rule, at least on paper.

360
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Humanism also gave birth to other isms such as socialism that divides the world based on class, feminism that divides the world based on gender,

361
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and nationalism that divides the world based on nationality or ethnicity or language.

362
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So, humanism puts human in charge of the planet and utilitarianism says the majority of humans.

363
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Postmodernism vs Existentialism

364
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Existentialism popularized after the philosophy of Nietzsche argues that everything starts with our existence, not God or some divine essence.

365
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There is no divine spark, but we just develop a sense of self during our life.

366
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Nothing is given to us prior to our birth.

367
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,000
A famous existentialist philosopher was Jean-Paul Sartre, who said that since we have no essence, we are responsible to make something of ourselves.

368
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He famously said that we are condemned to be free.

369
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
While existentialism is concerned with the individual, postmodernism popularized in France is more concerned with communities or cultural groups.

370
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Just like existentialism, it is also rooted in the philosophy of Nietzsche, specifically in his criticisms of a single truth within the Western philosophical tradition.

371
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
While existentialism focuses on the condition of the modern existence, postmodernism focuses on the idea of truth and social values.

372
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Western philosophy believed in a single truth, like the idea of a single God.

373
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So postmodernism questioned European modernity as a project to unify the whole world around European values of individualism, freedom and materialism.

374
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
According to postmodernists, all cultures are as valid as European culture.

375
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Therefore, the world doesn't have to become like Europe to be considered civilized.

376
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Postmodernism is a reaction to modernity, which includes the Enlightenment humanism on the one hand, but colonialism on the other.

377
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Postmodernists put emphasis on power relations, how the weak are forcefully pushed one side.

378
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:23,000
A famous postmodernist, Michel Foucault, analyzed how the modern state developed effective tools to control people through the prison system, surveillance, mass education and more.

379
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:34,000
He argued that even sexuality is a power dynamic, men oppressing women, which had a huge influence on the third wave feminism that some argue has become anti-men, anti-masculinity.

380
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Foucault even said all knowledge is tied to power, so there is no independent science.

381
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Therefore, science and technology are tools for the powerful to control the weak.

382
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So to sum up, the core philosophy includes ontology of existence and epistemology of knowledge and everything else is a branch of these two.

383
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Physics and metaphysics are part of ontology.

384
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Physics deals with matter, while metaphysics deals with non-material phenomena such as ideas, consciousness.

385
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Reason and logic, rationalism and empiricism are part of epistemology.

386
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Reason is a tool to persuade others, therefore more subjective, while logic is mathematical and impartial.

387
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Rationalism says knowledge comes from within, while empiricism says knowledge only comes from experience or outside.

388
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So outside ontology and epistemology is the philosophy of how to live.

389
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Political philosophy studies morality of good and bad, equality or meritocracy, majority, mass or minority elite.

390
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This is also tied to the meaning of life.

391
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Existentialism puts emphasis on the individual, while postmodernism puts emphasis on the group identity.

392
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Next, I'll look at the differences between Eastern and Western philosophies.

393
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Why one focuses on physical science while the other on mental well-being?

394
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Which should we prioritize, building rockets to conquer space or do yoga for a more peaceful mind on Earth?

395
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
In the 1930s, there was an interesting conversation between the greatest Indian poet and philosopher Tagore and the greatest German scientist Einstein.

396
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The conversation centered on the idea of reality, truth and beauty.

397
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Einstein believed in an objective reality outside the human.

398
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
While Tagore insisted on the subjective interpretation of reality.

399
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
To boil it down, Einstein believed in the old theory of physics, solid matter existing with or without humans.

400
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:38,000
While Tagore was alluding to the mysterious theory of quantum physics, that our perception or observation of matter is never really objective.

401
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The conversation illustrated the differences in Eastern and Western ways of thinking about reality.

402
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
One more pragmatic, while the other more spiritual.

403
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Now let's look at the typical hero in the East and West.

404
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
A Western hero wants to change the world to make it better for himself and those around him, while an Eastern hero wants to change himself.

405
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Western superheroes fight evil to restore justice, peace, correct the incorrect, while Asian heroes either accept their fate or retreat to a forest for some contemplation.

406
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Jesus perhaps the greatest Western hero confronted injustice and paid for it with his own life.

407
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
A sacrifice you can see manifests in Harry Potter as well.

408
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, however, went to the forest to change himself.

409
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, retreated the mountains.

410
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
In other words, Western philosophy is about change while Eastern philosophy is more about accepting your fate.

411
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
A great example of this in literature can be seen in the novels of the Japanese British Nobel Prize-winning author Kazuo Shiguro.

412
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
His characters obey their fate and rarely question their somewhat unfair circumstances.

413
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
However, a typical hero in the West would rebel against their circumstance to change the world.

414
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Accepting one's fate or putting up with an unfavorable environment is seen as a sign of weakness in the West, while those same traits are seen as a sign of strength in the East.

415
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
By the East, my focus is mainly Old India, China and Japan.

416
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So a Western hero wants to change the world while an Eastern hero wants to change himself to adapt.

417
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:17,000
In today's world, East and West have come together a lot because Western mode of production, i.e. capitalism, has taken over the world.

418
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But if you look closer, a bit deeper, you see a clear philosophical distinction.

419
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And if you go back in time, the distinction appears more clear.

420
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Why has Eastern philosophy's main focus been on mental well-being, happiness and spirituality and community,

421
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
while Western philosophy's main focus has been physical well-being, rational science, technology, materialism and individualism?

422
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Of course, there's a broad generalization, as there are so many philosophers on either side who are exceptions to the rule.

423
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But generally speaking, the main distinction is spiritualism versus materialism, community versus individualism.

424
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So in this video, I'll look at some of the answers, but also give more detail about the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy.

425
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Does the climate, terrain and the soil have anything to do with it?

426
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Are merchants more concerned with materialism and farmers more with spirituality?

427
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Western philosophy, as we know, has its roots in ancient Greece and later in Rome.

428
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The Greeks and Romans were influenced by other civilizations, such as the Egyptians and the Babylonians.

429
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But there are very little or no written records of an organized philosophy prior to the Greeks.

430
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Eastern philosophy has its roots in Indian civilization and the Chinese civilization.

431
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If you look at their geographies, Greece is made up of some islands, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.

432
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So large bodies of water sandwiching the land areas.

433
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So if you want to move around, all you need is a boat and you could hop from island to island.

434
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
This allows much smoother way to move things around.

435
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There's less friction on water than land.

436
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The ancient Greeks heavily relied on imported food due to its soil not being very fertile.

437
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
As a result, the Greeks relied on traits which brought goods from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Central Europe and more.

438
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But with this commodity trait also came ideas in knowledge.

439
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So the region was a hub of cultural, scientific and technological exchange.

440
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
This promoted a more rational discourse which allowed the Greeks to develop a more sophisticated science.

441
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,000
For example, Euclid's element is the oldest science book, which I'm sure was influenced by the Egyptians, the Babylonians and the Phoenicians.

442
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Pythagoras developed his mathematics. Aristotle studied all kinds of things including animals.

443
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:40,000
In fact, the first Greek philosopher Thales was an olive merchant himself who based his philosophy on water being the most important thing in the world.

444
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He famously predicted that good weather, i.e. lots of rain, produced lots of olives, so he got very rich.

445
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So the Greeks relied on traits which allowed the exchanges of ideas and practical sciences.

446
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Indian and Chinese civilizations, however, are more centered around rivers and mountains.

447
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
In other words, quite different from ancient Greece.

448
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
India and China were blessed by its many rivers that brought amazing soil from the Himalayas.

449
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So their agricultural economy could sustain a huge population in big cities, making China and India mostly self-sufficient.

450
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Trade with other peoples was a plus, but not essential.

451
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:29,000
China's Yellow and Yangtze rivers and ancient India's Indus and Ganges rivers are all starting the snowy mountains of Himalayas and traverse thousands of kilometers which bring the fertile soil.

452
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's no surprise that both India and China relied on a crop that is incredibly water-thirsty, rice.

453
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's also no surprise that Sadguru, the greatest Indian guru in the world today, has a simple message, save the soil.

454
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Because soil and farming ran really deep in Eastern philosophy.

455
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So Greece's geographical terrain allowed trade to flourish between various peoples and cultures, while ancient China and India relied on their rivers to bring good soil to them.

456
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The Greeks had to seek food from somewhere else while the Chinese and Indians waited for their rivers to bring food to them.

457
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,000
As a result, from a survival point of view, for the Greeks, merchants were the most important class of people, while in the East, farmers were the most important class of people.

458
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Since merchants are mobile while farmers are stationary because you cannot carry around your land, these allowed the Greeks to be more open-minded to new ideas, new technology, new sciences.

459
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Merchants are also less attached to their ways, therefore easily follow the market or commodity.

460
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Today you sell rice, tomorrow potato. Farmers, however, have a harder time to change and adapt quickly.

461
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So Western philosophy geared more towards pragmatic sciences while Eastern philosophy geared more towards spiritualism.

462
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
If merchants don't like something, they change, but if farmers don't get enough water, they wait for the following season or accept their fate.

463
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's harder to leave your land than migrate, so Western philosophy is more change-oriented while Eastern philosophy is more fatalistic.

464
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
In other words, you change yourself.

465
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Climate also plays a role. India and China tend to be warmer throughout there, so it makes sense to be in here and now, which Buddhism teaches.

466
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Also, seasons play a predictable pattern every year and people live a more cyclical life.

467
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Monsoon comes every year, rivers flood at specific time of the year. In a way, it was very similar to the Egyptian way of life around the River Nile.

468
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Of course, when you rely on a river, you also experience great famines, but they come every few years or decade.

469
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The Greeks navigated the seas where you are for the most part in control of where you are going.

470
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Meanwhile, Eastern civilizations were centered around rivers.

471
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
On rivers, your course is fixed. The river takes you where the river takes you.

472
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,000
As a result, Eastern philosophy is more fatalistic. The fate of humans, animals and plants are in the hands of the same rivers.

473
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It meant that they saw all living beings as part of one big family, so they didn't put humans as being outsiders or special or above everybody else.

474
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
In Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, we are not only from nature, we are nature, just like other living beings.

475
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The Greeks, however, experienced colder winters, so they had to source and accumulate food for colder days.

476
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Since they relied on trade, wars always disrupted trade routes, which meant you had to source your food from somewhere else.

477
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Merchants relied on peacetime to continue trade, but they also benefited from wars as certain commodities were more sought after.

478
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It is the old adage, war fuels the economy as money is moved around faster than peacetime.

479
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Since things are pretty unpredictable, the Greeks had to think long term and prepare not just for the cold winter, but for the future in case of warfare.

480
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Future became the most important time, not here now, but next month, next year.

481
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You couldn't afford to be here now like a Zen Buddhist, so this long term or linear perception of time became the dominant way of looking at the world among the Greeks.

482
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
A famous example is Aristotle's teleological philosophy that everything has a purpose, usually a single destination in the future.

483
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Western philosophy also, through an exchange with the Middle Eastern religions like Judaism, Christianity and later Islam, came to understand that humans were separate from the animal kingdom.

484
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
We are kicked out of the garden of Eden, punished for our mistakes.

485
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,000
As a result, you try to compensate for your past mistakes. You want to correct the incorrect. What do you do? You fight for causes.

486
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
If you look at literature, heroes are often people who have sinned or made terrible mistakes. To redeem themselves, they fight injustice.

487
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:44,000
One way to fight for injustice is to make other people's lives better, often materially. You study the world, you invent new technology to make life easier for others.

488
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Eastern philosophers were not looking for material comfort, but more for mental and spiritual comfort.

489
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Buddha and Lausi left the city in their spiritual quest and went to the mountains and forests.

490
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Solitude allows you to seek answers inside you, not on the outside.

491
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Even today, most Buddhist temples in India, Japan and China are located in the mountains and forests, away from the crowd, so people can get away from other people.

492
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The core doctrine of Buddhism is that material comfort doesn't make you happy in the long run.

493
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The Greeks, however, gathered in the city to debate and dialogue like Socrates, who would walk around on the streets of Athens, asking people questions.

494
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
While others established schools like Plato's Academy or Aristotle's Lyceum.

495
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Western philosophy relied on dialogue and exchange, like merchants do, to flourish, learn and improve.

496
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The West built universities, churches and schools in the middle of town and villages, so everyone could come, not some remote temples nobody could go to.

497
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
In Eastern philosophy, you don't force your will on nature to control or change it, but you try to flow with nature.

498
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Since both India and Chinese civilization were centered around rivers, often river flow is seen as a nature's way, in which you don't resist or remove obstacles in your way, but move around those obstacles.

499
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
In other words, you change yourself, not the outside world.

500
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
A good example is Indian traffic moves around an obstacle, be it a cow or an accident.

501
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
While in the West, a small accident on the road brings everything to a halt.

502
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So Eastern philosophy tells you to be more fluid, flexible like yoga and less rigid.

503
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But Western philosophy relies on manipulating nature through science and technology to make life easier for humans.

504
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
As a result, we live in a very comfortable period in history.

505
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Millions of people couldn't survive to adulthood, but today, child mortality is its lowest in history.

506
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
People live longer, healthier.

507
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But this also has negative consequences for other species on Earth, as the more comfortable we are,

508
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
the harder it becomes for some other species in some areas.

509
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Asians are on average physically smaller than Europeans, perhaps due to genetic mutation or sexual selection, or possibly due to eating less protein.

510
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
As farmers rely on rice, which is a staple diet in most of Asia.

511
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
How to cope with poor diet?

512
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Martial arts in China and New India are used to strengthen and discipline the body.

513
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Eastern philosophy center on the body as a vehicle to get to a higher place.

514
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And this also means Eastern philosophy is more about avoiding conflict rather than confronting others.

515
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Taoism and Buddhism and Hinduism promote non-violence.

516
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Vegetarianism, although trending in the West today, has been practiced in the East for thousands of years.

517
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Jainism is an Indian religion that promotes strict vegetarian diet, and Gandhi, a pacifist himself, admired Jainism for that.

518
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Unlike Asians, the Greeks ate a lot of bread, which is four times more protein-rich than rice.

519
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Since the Greek states were constantly fighting against one another, as well as the Persians, they developed the Olympic Games, which was to train soldiers for wars.

520
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It is no surprise that it was the Greeks who made it all the way to India through Alexander the Great.

521
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
While we have no records of invading armies from India or China going to Persia or the Middle East,

522
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it was the nomadic Mongols who made it to Europe, not the more sophisticated civilizations like the Chinese and Indians.

523
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
In fact, the Chinese built walls to shield themselves from the Mongols.

524
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And India was ravaged by a series of invasions by the Greeks, the Persians, the Muslims, the Mongols, and even the British.

525
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Why? Eastern philosophy is less centered on conquering the world, but conquering yourself.

526
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
For example, Buddhism is centered on the inner conflict of fighting or resisting your own desires.

527
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,000
If you focus on your inner conflict, you are less likely to engage in an external physical conflict, such as tribal or ideological.

528
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
In Hindu yogi teaching, your soul is the real you, while your physical body is acquired through food you put in your mouth.

529
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Not just that, you also acquire your ego or the sense of self through impressions and experiences with others.

530
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So your soul is permanent and your body and ego are temporary, fleeting, and acquired.

531
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Now, Einstein versus Tagore conversation on the nature of reality makes sense.

532
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Einstein sees an external world, while Tagore sees everything internal.

533
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
In other words, yogi philosophy is based on the pursuit of becoming one with the universe.

534
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Quantum physics has a similar theory that as soon as you observe something, you change it.

535
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
In other words, we are not separate from the world or universe, we are with the universe.

536
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The world is not outside us, but we are the universe, it's inside us.

537
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So yoga is one way to tap into or get closer to your universal soul by taming your body and ego and desires.

538
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The idea is to let your soul control you, not your body control your soul.

539
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Eastern philosophy is based on negation of self, while Western philosophy is firmly rooted in the idea of individual self.

540
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:46,000
As a result of this, the East tends to be more communitarian, where the individual is less important than the community or the universe, while the West tends to be more individualistic.

541
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Buddhism's core philosophy is to remove the self to ease suffering.

542
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Wanting or desiring is seen as negative because you are feeding the ego.

543
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The Greeks are more of a merchant's mentality to grow more profit and become wealthy and wealthier.

544
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Merchants are more focused on material success and less concerned with the spiritual side of life.

545
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
As a result, it was the Greeks who developed a more rational scientific method to understand the material world.

546
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
This scientific method allowed objectivity which meant that Greek scholars could disagree with their mentors.

547
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Even thinkers like Plato openly disagreed with his teacher Socrates, an Aristotle question Plato.

548
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
In the East, however, openly questioning your teacher was and still is a form of disrespect.

549
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Instead of finding flaws in those older than you, you're supposed to respect.

550
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This is especially important in Confucianism. Sensei is someone you do not challenge.

551
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Western philosophy makes a distinction between good and evil as almost separate entities and separate individuals or even groups.

552
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Often in warfare, the enemy is seen as evil to motivate your soldiers to die in defense of good.

553
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
This is true on both sides. So once you assign goodness with one way of seeing the world, the opposite of that is naturally bad or even evil.

554
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This spout of good against evil allows progress. Those victorious can claim goodness.

555
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And these, however, both good and bad are seen as more psychological and less ideological.

556
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So good and bad are one or two sides of the same coin.

557
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
The yin and yang in Taoism means every person has dark and light, good and evil built in them.

558
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Good and evil coexist so no matter how much society progresses, it doesn't change the core yin and yang existence.

559
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We as humans are neither good nor bad, but a bit of both.

560
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Our job is to understand this so we keep a good balance between the two forces.

561
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I think the most fundamental difference between Eastern and Western philosophy is the idea of linear progress.

562
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
In the West, versus a cyclical notion in the East, especially in Indian philosophy, the Greeks believed in progress.

563
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Socrates developed his questioning method of getting to the objective truth.

564
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Plato introduced the idea of perfection, and Aristotle came out with telos for purpose.

565
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So getting to Socratic truth, Platonic perfection and Aristotelian telos, or purpose,

566
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
gave birth to a Western progressive philosophy and science.

567
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So instead of focusing too much on the spiritual side of life,

568
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
the West focused on making the physical life easier by deploying a scientific method

569
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
to understand the world and invent technologies that made life easier.

570
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
As a result, most people today live a comfortable life thanks to Western civilization.

571
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
People live longer thanks to Western medicine and technology.

572
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
When survival is no longer an issue, people seek meaning and purpose.

573
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So Eastern philosophy plays a major role in bringing inner peace for millions of people in the East,

574
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
as well as in the West who seek meaning beyond material comfort.

575
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So to sum up, climate, terrain and food impacted how the East and West prioritized philosophical understanding of the world.

576
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
The Greeks relied on merchants and trades, so the priority went to practical sciences and rationality,

577
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
while in the East farming allowed big cities to flourish and people lived longer.

578
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
As a result, philosophers were seeking happiness, not physical comfort.

579
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Life expectancy also grew in the East, which allowed more reflection in old age.

580
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
When young, people seek success, but in old age, people search for meaning.

581
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Next, I'll discuss the Greek trio of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle

582
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
by looking at their similarities and differences.

583
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
In 399 BC, the Greek democracy condemned one of the greatest philosophers to death for spreading bad ideas among the youth.

584
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Today, he is considered the father of Western philosophy and possibly the father of Western civilization.

585
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
His tragic death sparked a new human philosophy that was based on rational thinking, not religious dogma.

586
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Who was this man? It was of course Mr. Socrates.

587
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Well, he lost his life, but rationality triumphed. He paid the price with his own life.

588
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's no surprise or exaggeration to tell you that Western philosophy originated in Greece, mainly in the city of Athens.

589
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Previously, I talked about the differences between Eastern and Western philosophies due to different terrains, food production, cultural exchanges and so on,

590
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that gave rise to its spiritualism in the East, while rationalism in the West.

591
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Eastern philosophy centered on farming and rivers became fatalistic, while the Greeks centered on trade and disease became rationalistic.

592
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So here I'll talk about the three of the most famous forefathers of Western rational philosophy, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

593
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Before I talk about the big three, let me mention a few who came before.

594
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
The first known Greek philosopher was Thalys of Miletus, who said that everything is made of water.

595
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Today we know that 60% of human body and 70% of our brain are made of water, so he was right.

596
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
He also used reason to predict how the weather affected olive harvest and made a lot of money as a result.

597
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:02,000
People at the time believed the good or bad harvest was in the hands of gods, so Thalys understood that it had nothing to do with it, but just good weather.

598
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So Western philosophy from the very earliest time emphasized rationality to understand and manipulate nature to benefit humans.

599
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And he was a businessman.

600
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Another notable philosopher was Pythagoras, famous for his theorem A squared B squared equals C squared.

601
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
He argued that the world is run by mathematical rules, which can be understood through numbers.

602
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Even musical harmony is ruled by geometrical rules.

603
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So Pythagoras based his ideas on mathematical logic, which is a step deeper and more rigid than rationality.

604
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Another logical philosopher was Parminides, who also used logical thinking, a reasoning to prove that human experience gives us false perception of the world, often contradicts with logical thinking.

605
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So early Greek philosophers paved the way for rationality to become the method of thinking.

606
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Socrates

607
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
If you have to name one person as the founder of Western philosophy, one name stands tall above everybody else.

608
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It is of course Mr Socrates, not the football legend from Brazil, but the ancient Greek dude who lived between 469 and 399 BCE.

609
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
He was the true father of Western philosophy because he developed a robust philosophical method to understand the meaning of life and to expose dogmas.

610
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Unlike everyone else, he did not accept things at face value.

611
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:37,000
His questioning or dialectical method of examining everything through a series of questions to get to the bottom of things or finding the truth became the basis of modern scientific method.

612
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
To understand something, you have to go through a series of questions like what, where, when, why and how.

613
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Once you go through all these questions, the answer you get tends to be the best answer out there.

614
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Today's science does the same thing. Scientific theories are tested through a series of experiments.

615
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Socrates also questioned the purpose of life itself.

616
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
For him, the purpose of life was to be virtuous.

617
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How can you be virtuous?

618
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Again, you have to examine your life critically.

619
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You cannot sit in your comfortable chair and live in ignorance.

620
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Uncomfortable truths are better than comforting lies.

621
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
He famously said, the unexamined life is not worth living.

622
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
In other words, ignorance wasn't bliss, just stupid and unworthy.

623
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
These had a massive psychological shift in how people saw the world and themselves.

624
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You couldn't just rely on gods or even the priests.

625
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You had the ability to rationally question things and get to the truth for yourself.

626
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:45,000
The Athenian democracy saw him as a threat, awakening the youth, so they forced him to sip hemlock poison which killed him in 399 BC, making him a true martyr of philosophy.

627
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Socrates was a street philosopher who walked around streets of Athens to question people and have a dialogue about life and philosophy.

628
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
He was like a modern day provocateur or a whistleblower. The authorities didn't like it.

629
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Socrates' philosophical legacy was to make truth the most important aim of philosophy.

630
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Philosophy wasn't to tell you comforting lies, but it was to challenge you into discomfort.

631
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And Western philosophy, Socrates narrowed its scope into one single truth, which is the basis of modern science today, searching for the ultimate theory that explains everything.

632
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Quote, there is only one good knowledge, one evil ignorance.

633
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This single truth became the cornerstone of Western philosophy for almost 2005 and 8 years, until the German Nietzsche questioned it, paving the way for postmodernism that believed in multiple truths.

634
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Socrates didn't leave any written records, because he was busy on the streets challenging strangers about their truths.

635
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I wonder if he was around today, how he would challenge people about my truth, your truth.

636
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
First people would think he's crazy, second he would go mad with everyone having their own truths.

637
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Plato, after the death of Socrates, the torch was passed on to one of his students who also wrote his teacher's philosophical ideas down.

638
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Plato, who lived between 427 and 347 BCE, having witnessed his teacher executed by the democratic mobs, was an idealist, arguing that we all have a perfect idea of something.

639
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
But in reality, this does not exist.

640
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It only exists in our mind as a perfect form of that thing.

641
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
There are chairs we see inside a room, but those are just models of a perfect chair that only exists in our mind.

642
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:42,000
In other words, the chairs that humans make are modeled on a perfect chair inside the human mind, who see a mere shadow of what reality is on the outside.

643
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:53,000
His famous thought experiment, Allegory of the Cave, illustrates that if you face away from the light source and see your own shadow inside a cave, that's how we perceive reality.

644
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Not what it is, but it's shadow through our senses.

645
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So for Plato, humans can pre-assemble with all knowledge.

646
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
In other words, we don't learn through our experiences or senses, but it's all inside.

647
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It only comes out when we experience it.

648
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Quote, what we call learning is only a process of recollection.

649
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
This makes Plato's philosophy somewhat counterintuitive.

650
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:28,000
We think what's on the outside is the real thing, and what we have on the inside in our mind is a mere representation of that real object.

651
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Plato thinks the opposite.

652
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
What we see on the outside is the shadow of what's in our mind.

653
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:43,000
We have an innate knowledge of the world from birth, and what we learn is just re-remembering or recalling those things that are already stored inside us.

654
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This is very similar to how the rationalists saw knowledge, which I'll discuss later on.

655
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Plato's idea of knowledge coming from inside us can also be interpreted in terms of the subconscious,

656
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,000
or Jungian collective subconscious, deeply embedded in us from our evolutionary past.

657
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
For instance, the fear of a snake in us is not because we experience snake bites in our own life,

658
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
but because our ancestors experienced it in savannah, in the trees, or a jungle, or in the cave.

659
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Despite us living in beautiful safe houses, we still have the inner experience of being in the dark cave.

660
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Another example is horror movies.

661
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Our desire to see horror movies is simply because we still want to experience the fear from time to time,

662
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
because that fear is inside us, and horror movies simply stimulate that fear.

663
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Sigmund Freud's dream interpretations are another way to understand Plato.

664
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
In other words, dreams are our little window into the subconscious world inside us.

665
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Friction writers, artists, and musicians often experience a trance-like state when they are immersed in their art,

666
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
tapping into their subconscious to bring out an art that is appreciated by many people,

667
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
simply because they reach a deeper well inside to drink from the collective subconscious knowledge.

668
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Despite being the artistic uncle, Plato also had a strong opinion about politics.

669
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Plato was a republican and saw democracy akin to a mob rule as it killed his teacher Socrates,

670
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
so he argued that philosophers were better suited to rule society as a republic.

671
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Just like Nietzsche, he had a low opinion of general publicists unsuitable to rule a society,

672
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
while philosophers were better equipped to rule a society,

673
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,000
so he set up his academy where he wanted to cultivate the best minds of a generation, the elites of society.

674
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Today's university is very much modeled on Plato's academy where the intellectuals lock horns to discuss ideas.

675
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And one of those people was Aristotle, who graduated from his academy.

676
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Plato is called the idealist philosopher, however his student Aristotle went a different route towards practical knowledge.

677
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So to sum up, Plato's teacher, Mr. Socrates, questioned things to find the truth.

678
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Plato said, truth or perfection only exists in the soul, in the mind, or in the world of ideas or forms,

679
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and only their shadows are perceived through our senses.

680
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So Socrates gave philosophy a method of finding the truth, while Plato offered a perfectionist vision of the truth inside the mind.

681
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Now these two come together in Aristotle to provide a basis for modern Western philosophy,

682
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
a progressive perfectionist vision of truth-seeking, a single truth.

683
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Aristotle

684
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
While Plato sat inside a cave saying that to find the truth reasoning was superior to real-world observation,

685
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:45,000
his student Aristotle, however, reversed this by getting his hands dirty and dissecting the frogs and gazing at stars to understand the real world.

686
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Aristotle, who lived between 384 and 322 BCE, argued that truth is not inside us, but it's on the outside in the real world.

687
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Truth, in other words, is in the world around us.

688
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
His method was evidence-based research akin to modern science.

689
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
He actually went to the fields to study animals and see creatures.

690
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:15,000
He questions Plato's ideal form, saying that if a man is the model of an ideal form, who is the ideal form model of?

691
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
It's the same argument if God created us, who created God and who created the God that created God, which goes to infinity.

692
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Aristotle put human senses to work and argued that our observation of things is the best way to find the truth.

693
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
He said everything in the world can be categorized by their substance, quantity, place, time and so forth.

694
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Today modern science classifies animals into species, earth into continents and oceans, rocks and murals.

695
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
These categorization helps humans to gain knowledge much faster and more effectively.

696
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
He famously said humans are rational animals.

697
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Aristotle also said that everything has a purpose or a telos or an end goal.

698
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
The purpose of this video is to educate people about philosophy.

699
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:06,000
As a result, Aristotle's telos has become a bunch of philosophy called teleology that looks at things through their purpose, not their essence.

700
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So when we look at a chair, we don't think of the wood and trees and forests, but we think of sitting on it.

701
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
A chair is to be sat on, not considered a piece of tree.

702
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So Aristotle's telos put purpose before essence.

703
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:28,000
As a result, Western philosophy is a very purpose-driven way of thinking, which emphasizes something's utility or use before its essence.

704
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
As a result, Western culture values solution to problems, efficiency and pragmatism that make things better.

705
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Today modern science develop useful technologies, so it's heavily utility based.

706
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
We like useful things. The purpose of science is to develop technology to make life easier.

707
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
What is the purpose of human civilization?

708
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
To reach perfection, which is a kind of a statillion teleology.

709
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So Aristotle's telos coincided with the Christian view that we are heading towards an apocalypse or heaven, a perfectionist utopia where you're happy and blissful.

710
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And science we're heading towards a perfect understanding of the universe and life.

711
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So telos allows us to make plans, have goals and strive towards something.

712
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Without an end goal, it is hard to motivate ourselves to do things.

713
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Just like Plato, he also set up a school called Lyceum, where he gathered all the best minds of his generations to study.

714
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,000
One of his most famous students prior to the Lyceum was a man who took his teleological teaching to conquer the world.

715
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It was of course Alexander the Great, who made it all the way to India in his attempt to conquer the world.

716
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I should point out an important Greek philosopher who lived outside the rationality-dominated school.

717
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It was Epicurus, whose philosophy centered on happiness, not rationality or truth.

718
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So instead of an academy or school, he set up a hippie-style garden where he gathered his friends to talk philosophy while enjoying life in peace and tranquility.

719
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Epicurus understood that the biggest enemy of happiness is also the main reason human invented philosophy.

720
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
What is it? The fear of death.

721
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
The entire foundation of human philosophy rests on this mystery.

722
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Epicurus had a very clever answer.

723
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
He said the fear of death is irrational. It makes no sense.

724
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Why? For the simple reason that we do not know death.

725
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Not only that, we cannot know death.

726
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Because nobody has returned from death to tell us what it is.

727
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Death is just one way street.

728
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Now that we know the fact that we do not and cannot know death, why fear it?

729
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We are afraid of lions because we know they can eat us.

730
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We are afraid of fire because we know the pain.

731
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But we cannot and will not know death.

732
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It's totally irrational to be afraid of it.

733
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Instead of worrying about death, we should make the most of this life by living in and spreading peace and happiness among others.

734
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Later, his philosophy was adapted into utilitarianism to maximize happiness for the majority of people.

735
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But despite his philosophy of happiness, Epicurus remains an outsider in Western philosophy.

736
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So to sum up, Socrates questioned people on the streets of Athens to critically examine things in life.

737
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Plato sat inside a cave, not literally though, and asked himself about the ideal form that may have come from God or the human mind.

738
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
While Aristotle went to the field and got his hands dirty to understand the natural world.

739
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Socrates placed virtue and knowledge in Russian truth while rejecting passion, emotions, or faith as dogmatic.

740
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
This was Nietzsche's biggest problem with Western philosophy, which he squarely blamed on Socrates.

741
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Too much rationality ignores human passion and heavily relies on reason, which is rigid, inflexible, that turns us into machines.

742
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Plato, however, retreated to himself and argued that perfectionism doesn't exist on the outside, but only on the inside in our head.

743
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The world is a terrible place precisely because it's a skewed model of a perfect form that only exists in our mind.

744
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Plato's ideas were closer to a religious idea of God, so later Christians and Muslims interpreted Plato's perfect form as God.

745
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
God is perfect while humans in the world are imperfect images of God.

746
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Aristotle said, forget about the imperfect world, someone has to go to the field to study the bloody nature through observations and dissections.

747
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So his method was empirical science, which became the base of medieval Islamic science and later 16th-century European science.

748
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Next, I'll talk about the three horses of Eastern philosophy, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Confucius.

749
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Previously, I discussed the Greek trio of Socrates played to an Aristotle who influenced Western philosophy.

750
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:53,000
The three most famous Eastern philosophers were Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, the Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and Confucius, the founder of Confucianism.

751
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I'll mainly focus on their philosophies and less on their religious practices, which are quite different in different countries.

752
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Eastern philosophical tradition is very rich and complex, so these three philosophers can help us shed lights on Eastern spirituality.

753
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Lao Tzu

754
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Lao Tzu or Lao Tzu lived in 6th century BCE in China.

755
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
It is said to be the author of the Tao Te Ching or Tao Te Ching, which is the foundational text of Taoism,

756
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
a philosophy that traces its origin to shamanism and hermeticism.

757
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Taoism, which is also sometimes called Taoism, literally means the way or the enlightened path or nature's way,

758
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
which is spontaneous, eternal, and unnameable and undefinable.

759
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Quote

760
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.

761
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It is simply the flow of the universe, such as gravity allowing rivers to flow downward without an effort.

762
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The core idea of Taoism is the doctrine of Wu Wei, which can be translated as non-resistance or action through inaction.

763
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Wei means purposeful and intentional, while Wu means there is no or lacking.

764
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So literally it means there is no purposeful act.

765
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
A good metaphor for humans to live their lives by is river, which the Chinese civilizations relied on.

766
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Rivers flow downward.

767
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
If hindered by a rock, instead of moving the rock, they flow around it.

768
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
This means we should live our lives in alignment or harmoniously with nature, not against nature.

769
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Another important idea of Taoism is Yin and Yang, or good and evil, which live together inside everyone, as we all have the dark and light.

770
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You cannot separate the two.

771
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I think this fundamentally differs from a Western religion, so good and evil are thought to be separate entities.

772
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
However, according to Taoism, there are two sides of the same coin.

773
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Everything is neither completely negative nor positive, but a bit of both.

774
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
In other words, saint has his sins and a sinner has his redeeming qualities.

775
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
In Taoism, humans are one manifestation of the Tao or the Wei.

776
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You could say just one species among millions of other species.

777
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Lao Tzu emphasized not to follow one's desires, goals or ambitions, but rather find your natural flow.

778
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Zi Yan, which literally means naturally, is a Taoist value which emphasizes natural creativity and spontaneity.

779
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:31,000
As a result, Taoism is seen as the religion of the artists who live a more intuitive and spontaneous life that mimics nature's flow.

780
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:39,000
You could even make a connection between Carl Jung's psychology of the collective subconscious, deeply embedded memories of our species,

781
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,000
or those species before that artists tap into by finding the flow of nature.

782
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
This artistic flow is much more elaborated in another book titled Zhuang Zi.

783
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Supposedly authored by another important figure in Taoism, a man called Zhuang Zi.

784
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,000
The book has many humorous stories, allegories and anecdotes, with the most famous one being the butterfly dream,

785
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
in which Zhuang Zhu wakes up one morning from a dream in which he turned into a butterfly.

786
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Now he is perplexed and asks this mind-blowing question.

787
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Was he dreaming of a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming Zhuang Zhu?

788
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
The answer is not important here, but the question itself is the main point.

789
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:26,000
We humans see clear answers and clarity, but nature doesn't care about separate entities or separation of different species.

790
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Nature's one big perpetual flow.

791
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
From nature's perspective, a human and butterfly are simply two different manifestations of the same thing.

792
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Even the state of being awake and dreaming are false distinctions or dichotomy because they are one and the same thing.

793
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
For example, artists, novelists, musicians often dream or daydream their best works

794
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
because they find the flow of nature's collective subconsciousness.

795
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Lao Zi is said to have lived during the Zhu Dynasty, whose capital was close to the Yellow River.

796
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Therefore, the river is often used as a metaphor for Taoism.

797
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Later in life, Lao Zi is said to have traveled west where he rode Dao De Jing and some remote mountains

798
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and then vanished into thin air, also a great metaphor in how to flow in life like a wind and river.

799
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Today, Lao Zi's ideas are extremely important but also deeply embedded into the cultures of China, Korea and Japan.

800
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
To give you an example, people in Japan tend to be less confrontational, tend to avoid conflict,

801
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
which fits in with the Taoist idea of non-resistance.

802
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So to sum up, Lao Zi or Taoism philosophy centers on the idea of not going against the natural flow but flowing with it.

803
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Not resisting nature's way but going with it.

804
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Buddha.

805
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Siddhartha Gotama or the Buddha lived a luxurious life in a rich Northern Indian family between 563 and 483 BCE.

806
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
He wasn't happy, he learned that suffering was universal among the poor, rich, young and old men and women.

807
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But why do we suffer?

808
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
The reason we suffer is because our desires for pleasure.

809
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
The more we get, the more we want.

810
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,000
If we have a big house, next time we will not be fulfilled if we don't get an even bigger house.

811
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Bigger cars, more partners, more wealth, friends, subscribers, followers.

812
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
At no point in our life we can satisfactorily say it is enough.

813
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
A good example is addiction.

814
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,000
If a small dose makes you high today, but you need a larger dose to give you the same high a month later or a year later.

815
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
In other words, as you experience more, your desires also grow bigger.

816
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So life is just an endless cycle of desire, fulfillment of that desire and more desires.

817
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
How do we solve this problem?

818
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
To ease suffering, according to Buddhism, we should nip our wants and the bad by detaching ourselves from our desires.

819
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Don't chase things and be happy in the moment.

820
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
But it's easier said than done.

821
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Everyone says it's a good idea to be content with what you have right now.

822
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But curbing your desire is not an easy job.

823
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Why is it so hard?

824
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Here's when Buddhism gets really interesting and profoundly deep.

825
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
We all think we are who we are.

826
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
We have a sense of the self we call me and you.

827
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
We think it's somewhat solid entity.

828
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And what's in religions, this self is imparted to us from God.

829
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It's real.

830
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
This individual self is genuine and for the most part unchangeable.

831
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
According to Buddhism, however, you are wrong.

832
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Why?

833
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
The self or ego is not real.

834
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
It's just an illusion or mirage or a temporary imposter attached to your body.

835
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You could say like a parasite, it lives on you.

836
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
What does it do inside us?

837
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
This imposter self fuels our desires, ambitions and goals.

838
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
In other words, it uses us to go out in the world and achieve things.

839
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
But at the end of the day, we still don't feel fulfilled.

840
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Especially when we achieve everything and death hits us.

841
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
We lose our shit.

842
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Because we went through so much trouble acquiring our wealth, fame, power,

843
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and now death is snatching all away from us.

844
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It's a bad deal.

845
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So what is the solution, Mr. Buddha?

846
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
His answer might shock you.

847
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
According to Buddhism, to be truly enlightened and blissful,

848
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
you have to achieve the Nirvana stage.

849
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Which means we must kill the imposter self.

850
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
This thing we call the self or ego is the source of all our desires.

851
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
To not desire anything, we must remove the self.

852
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
According to Buddhism, our soul is the real thing,

853
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
and also very much universal,

854
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
while the self is a kind of picture we put in our head

855
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
every time we are born in our various reincarnations.

856
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
One way to understand this is perhaps through Mr. Plato,

857
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
who also said that the idea of things is the perfect form

858
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and real things on the outside is a mere shadow of the real thing.

859
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
In Buddhism, your soul is genuine, eternal, and universal,

860
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
while your body or ego are temporary and fleeting.

861
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
We are not separate from the universe, but a tiny part of a big hole.

862
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
To become happy and one with the universe,

863
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
you must detach yourself from your desires and kill the self

864
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
through meditation, solitude, and rigorous physical and mental discipline.

865
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
A discipline mind brings happiness.

866
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
This is very similar to Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy

867
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
of the blind universal will, which is a force beyond our control,

868
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
yet it rules most of what we do in life.

869
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
There's a disagreement whether Schopenhauer reached the same conclusion

870
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
independent of Buddhism or Hinduism,

871
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
or he was influenced by these Indian philosophies.

872
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I'll discuss Schopenhauer's philosophy in more detail later on.

873
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So according to Buddhism, to be truly enlightened is to not see yourself

874
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
as a separate self, but part of a bigger whole, part of conscious universe.

875
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
So true inner peace comes not from outside, for example, by achieving your goals,

876
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
but from inside once you become enlightened.

877
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Buddha's teachings through various forms of Buddhism

878
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
are incredibly important in most of East Asia.

879
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Buddhism has also become one of the most influential philosophies in the West too,

880
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
as it emphasizes individual inner journey rather than collective prayers in a church.

881
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So to sum up, Buddha was a rich, powerful prince,

882
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,000
but wasn't fulfilled in life and realized that all humans suffer because of our desires.

883
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
To ease suffering we should detach ourselves from our desires

884
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
and to be truly blissful we should eliminate the self or ego through meditation and mental discipline.

885
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Confucius.

886
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
While both Lausi and the Buddha escaped society for some solitude and inner peace,

887
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Confucius, who lived between 551 and 479 BCE,

888
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
however, tried to solve the practical socio-political questions

889
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
like how we can live politically and socially together in peace and harmony

890
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
or how to organize society in a way that is peaceful.

891
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So his philosophy is less individualistic but more concerned about the collective existence,

892
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
especially in big cities and countries.

893
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
To find a great solution for socio-political coexistence,

894
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Confucius looked at how nature organizes things, especially in the animal kingdom.

895
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
One of the biggest problems and the main source of wars and violence in human society

896
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:10,000
is when there is confusion as to who stands where, who gets what, who owns what, who is responsible for what.

897
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,000
He understood that the best method was the natural hierarchy or a pyramid social system.

898
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Without an established system of hierarchy or authority, there is chaos and confusion.

899
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And hierarchy allows everyone to know their place, so there is no confusion

900
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
or conflict as to which chair belongs to who.

901
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Removing social confusion was Confucius' main task, pun intended.

902
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Now, not only everyone knows their own place, they also know other people's places too.

903
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So instead of a police watching everyone or patrolling the whole society,

904
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
now everyone can watch each other.

905
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
If someone sits in the wrong chair, other people can tell him it is not his seat.

906
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:59,000
So if everyone knows their place, everyone can watch, everyone, so nobody dares to disrupt the social harmony.

907
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So kings at the top of the pyramid and everyone else take their place based on their ranks and age,

908
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
just like a game of chess.

909
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Perhaps the most logical game humans have invented.

910
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Confucius also realized that everything starts in the family, because it's the first line of defense against chaos.

911
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
A solid family structure means a solid foundation for society.

912
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Inside the family, the man is at the top, then wife, then sons, and then daughters.

913
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
One of the most common criticism against Confucius is the possibility of tyranny.

914
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Those in positions of power can abuse it.

915
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Confucius also emphasized responsibility and duty.

916
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Those at the top are responsible to protect those below them.

917
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,000
A king is responsible to keep people safe and a man in the family is responsible to protect and provide for his wife and children.

918
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Those below in return are loyal and follow their superiors and do as asked.

919
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:59,000
To understand Confucianism, you should look things not just from an individual point of view, but from a collective perspective.

920
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
For example, if your body parts didn't function in alignment with the rest of your body, you are sick and needs treatment.

921
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Society is the same.

922
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
If one or few members push things in the opposite direction, there's violence, which is a social illness.

923
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You might think it's pretty outdated, but you would be surprised that this Confucian hierarchy is pretty efficient system, which is at work in modern companies.

924
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Because we hear this cliche that no work is done by a committee, which is true in most situations.

925
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Most corporate structures follow a strict and rigid hierarchy and a chain of command.

926
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
In the animal kingdom, a hierarchy is often achieved through violence.

927
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But Confucian says, since it's natural, we might as well adopt it to reduce violence.

928
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Of course, in the modern age, revolutions are a common occurrence.

929
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Those at the bottom rebel against the establishment.

930
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
That's why Confucius emphasized duty and responsibility.

931
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
When a ruler becomes tyrannical, he fails his duty.

932
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It all comes down to respecting your role in society.

933
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Quote, without feelings of respect, what is there to distinguish men from beasts?

934
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Today, China, Korea and Japan have adopted these Confucian methods in sorting out social situations where seniority and juniority plays a major role in schools, universities and companies.

935
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Loyalty and respect are significant in Confucianism, but also meritocracy.

936
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
As a result, traditionally, China had a strict civil service examination for centuries,

937
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
and only the very bright and intelligent were recruited for high military and government jobs.

938
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
In the 20th century, however, Mao Zedong, the egalitarian socialist,

939
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
tried to dismantle the Confucian class hierarchy through the Cultural Revolution.

940
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
That caused great pain for a lot of people.

941
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But of course, the Chinese Communist Party replaced the old class-based Confucian hierarchy with a political hierarchy.

942
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Many economists attribute China's rapid economic development to this efficient hierarchical system as China was run like a company, the president being the CEO of China.

943
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Things get done quickly, but of course, it also comes at a cost of many voices being suppressed.

944
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Traditionally, the Chinese Communist Party used to distance itself from the archaic Confucius philosophy

945
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:19,000
because it contradicts the egalitarian philosophy of socialism in which everyone is equal and there is no hierarchy at least on paper.

946
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But in reality, every human society has been hierarchical.

947
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Even today, China is slowly moving towards a more Confucian philosophy.

948
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
As China is developing, not only it's utilizing a Confucian hierarchy for its efficiency,

949
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:40,000
but it's also cultivating a more robust culture of meritocracy and traditional masculinity which were centered on Confucian philosophy.

950
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:47,000
To sum up, Laozi's teaching is not to resist or destroy or go against nature, but to flow with nature.

951
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
As a result, he says we should be more intuitive and spontaneous.

952
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
In other words, humans are of nature, so it's time we forget our humanness and live in the flow of nature.

953
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,000
The Buddha taught that suffering is universal because of our goals, desires and ambitions.

954
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
To find true peace is to look inside, not outside material success.

955
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And to be truly happy is to kill your ego or the self that has ambition and desires.

956
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Confucius tackled the sociopolitical question of how to live a peaceful coexistence through a hierarchical system in which everyone knows the place and position in society.

957
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
While the Greeks were questioning truth, authority, poking holes at the natural world to understand its property,

958
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:35,000
those in the east were seeking a harmonious life with nature, not only with other humans, but with all creatures on earth.

959
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:42,000
The Greeks disagreed with each other while the Asians tried to find agreement, consents us, not only among humans,

960
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
but also between humans and the natural world.

961
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:54,000
The fact these three figures founded a religion of their own while the three Greeks did not show the fundamental difference between eastern and western philosophy.

962
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And the east societies are generally more group centered, while in the west it's more individual centered.

963
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,000
But if you really think about it, the philosophies of these three eastern thinkers is highly individualized.

964
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
They put the emphasis on the individual to take charge of themselves.

965
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Don't change the world, change yourself.

966
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So while eastern social fabric is communitarian, the philosophies are individualistic as they put demand on the individual to take responsibility for changing themselves.

967
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So they adapt to the society they live in.

968
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Don't change others, but yourself.

969
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Don't change nature, but yourself.

970
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
The Greeks however focused on how to change nature as quickly, efficiently as possible.

971
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,000
So in the west individuality is static, God-given or born, while social fabric is dynamic.

972
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:50,000
In other words, in western philosophy the individual is solid and the society and nature malleable and changeable.

973
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,000
In the east however, nature is as well as society's fabrics are static while the individual is changeable.

974
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
In other words, do not attempt to change others or nature because it's easier to change yourself.

975
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
If you cannot fit in with others, take a good look at yourself and find what's wrong with you.

976
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
People in the east are less likely to complain about the world instead try to adapt to the world.

977
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Before you complain that I'm generalizing too much, sit back and relax and look at yourself in the mirror.

978
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Don't worry, I'm kidding.

979
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Next I'll discuss two distinct approaches to philosophy.

980
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Animalism that sees humans as animals therefore needed to be herded to bring order.

981
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And humanism that sees all humans as equal to one another.

982
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,000
In other words, elitism versus egalitarianism or carnivorous versus herbivorous philosophies.

983
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Previously I discussed eastern philosophy versus western philosophy and how one employed rationality to tame nature while the other employed spirituality to tame the individual.

984
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Today I'll look at two core philosophical schools, humanism versus animalism.

985
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Humanism is a belief that humans are somewhat special either created by God or not.

986
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Therefore the purpose of any society is to protect all humans equally.

987
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Humanism is also called egalitarianism with a few babies of its own like socialism, feminism, liberalism and postmodernism.

988
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Elitism or animalism on the other hand is a belief that some humans are more equal than others.

989
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Especially the rulers, kings, elite class of people or the talented people as in meritocracy.

990
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
This is because hierarchy is very much part of the animal kingdom.

991
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
The strongest wins the race.

992
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But as human civilization has progressed and we have become more efficient and taming nature,

993
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,000
the historical trend is moving towards a more egalitarian human society.

994
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:54,000
So here's the most important question, was Karl Marx right that the future is communism?

995
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But first let me explain the history of these two divergent philosophical approaches.

996
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And it used some of the most important philosophers on each side.

997
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Humanism has its roots in religions and the West Christianity and Judaism

998
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
at its core believed that all humans beings were equal in the eye of God.

999
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Augustine of Hippo believed all humans have free will to choose between good and evil.

1000
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
He also said that one should love everyone equally.

1001
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Quote, the measure of love is to love without measure.

1002
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Thomas Aquinas, another Christian philosopher, argued that God created the world and all humans were equal,

1003
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
especially in freedom.

1004
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Quote, by nature all men are equal in liberty but not in other endowments.

1005
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Outside the religious tradition the first true humanist might be Mosey who lived in the 4th century BC in China.

1006
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
He advocated a kind of universal humanism.

1007
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
At the time Confucianism was the dominant philosophy in China in which society was divided based on ranks and hierarchies.

1008
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So Mosey believed in universal reciprocation.

1009
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Quote, universal love is really the way of the sage kings.

1010
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
It is what gives peace to the rulers and sustenance to the people.

1011
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
This is an early form of humanism.

1012
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Another early figure was a 6th century Persian philosopher Mazdat who promoted economic equality among all people.

1013
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
He even protested against the rich having many wives while the poor having no wife.

1014
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
His idea became quite influential in the Persian Empire but soon fizzled out.

1015
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:32,000
On the opposite of humanism we have the school of elitist philosophy which we can term as realism as called in politics.

1016
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,000
The basic idea of realism is that humans are chaotic and erratic animals that need to be tamed and controlled and ruled,

1017
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
not through honesty or fairness but through deception or brute force.

1018
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:54,000
One of the earliest realist philosophers was San Tzu who lived in China between 544 and 496 BCE.

1019
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:04,000
In his famous book The Art of War he employs nature's tactics such as camouflage, deception and even submission to survive or dominate others, especially in wars.

1020
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
His philosophy was to win at all costs so to speak.

1021
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:14,000
For him life is not about fairness or equality, it was about winning which is at the heart of evolutionary biology.

1022
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You only survive or thrive if you win nature's battle and overcome hurdles.

1023
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Some of his strategies in The Art of War are socially counterintuitive like this.

1024
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Like he says you must appear small when you're big and appear big when you're small in order to deceive your enemy.

1025
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
In San Tzu's Art of War honesty is the worst policy.

1026
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Quote when the enemy is relaxed make them toil, when full starve them, when settled make them move.

1027
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
In other words, stand tall when you're small and sit small when you're tall.

1028
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:53,000
These are some basic survival tactics in the wild, for example in the battle between the carnivores and herbivores.

1029
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
A gazelle jumps higher to show it's health so that cheetahs don't bother chasing them.

1030
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Some of the tactics are also to throw off your enemy like when negotiating ask for less when you want more, which is still in use in corporate capitalism.

1031
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:15,000
The Art of War's basic rules are to know yourself, your enemy and your environment, time your attack and truths.

1032
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
While at the same time make sure your enemy knows nothing truthful about you.

1033
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Be a peacock when small and be a mouse when big.

1034
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
So this is the earliest form of political deception in order to prolong your rule over others.

1035
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
The winners are those who lie the best.

1036
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,000
So Sansu borrowed his philosophy from the animal kingdom where there is no morality, only winners.

1037
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Machiavelli who lived between 1469 and 1527 was an Italian thinker who is famous for his book The Prince,

1038
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:58,000
in which he advises the rulers to use any methods available to them to achieve the goal of maximizing their power and domination over other humans.

1039
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:07,000
In other words, the famous line that the end justifies the means which goes contrary to the humanist and religious morality of protecting life.

1040
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Put, it's better to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.

1041
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
He argued that a ruler must be like a savage lion when needed and a cunning fox when needed.

1042
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So brute force combined with cunning deceptions are needed in order to rule over society.

1043
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Why? Because humans are savages and they are waiting for your weakest moment to strike and take away your power like Hamlet's uncle and Shakespeare's play Hamlet.

1044
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Machiavelli lived a few centuries before Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, but he still understood the savage nature of human politics.

1045
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
In other words, moralities for the weak and power and deception are for the strong.

1046
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Quote, he who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command.

1047
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:59,000
In order to prevent a rebellion, a ruler must show terror and fear for its subject to behave well.

1048
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Those at the top of society have the most to lose so they can use any means available to them to make sure they keep their power and wealth.

1049
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
They use the police, the legal system and whatever else so nobody can take those things away from them.

1050
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So, just like Sansu, Machiavelli based his philosophy on the animal kingdom.

1051
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
It's not about equality or fairness, it's about winning and conquering.

1052
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher who lived between 1588 and 1679.

1053
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:36,000
In his book, Leviathan, he argued that humans are savages and only a civilized state can protect humans from each other.

1054
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,000
In other words, humans have established states to escape the brutality of nature.

1055
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
According to him, humans are physical machines and nature.

1056
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:51,000
But when entering society, they gave up their savage tendencies and power to live peacefully.

1057
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Quote, life in the state of nature is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

1058
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Fear of violence is always there.

1059
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,000
To escape it, humans have made a contract with their governing rulers and returned for their obedience and freedom.

1060
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
The state provides them with peace, justice, protection for them and their property.

1061
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Just like Machiavelli, Hobbes believed in the use of force to tame people.

1062
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Quote, not believing in force is the same as not believing in gravitation.

1063
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Despite his argument for a civilized state, he understood that humans were an essence savage animal.

1064
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
So, Sansu drew on the animal kingdom saying deception was better than honesty.

1065
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Machiavelli went even further saying that deception combined with brute force are justified to tame humans.

1066
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Hobbes argued a civilized state has every right to tame the unruly humans.

1067
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Now, let's look at a few philosophers who oppose this animalistic philosophy based on the natural world.

1068
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
These philosophers saw human life as somewhat sacred.

1069
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Voltaire who lived between 1694 and 1777 was a French philosopher who believed in a kind of universal individual liberty.

1070
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Not tyranny as Machiavelli suggested.

1071
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Unlike Machiavelli's iron rule, he believed in open skepticism and freedom of expression for all

1072
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:19,000
so anyone could criticize and even rebel against the dominant traditions and dogmas.

1073
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Quote, men are equal, it's not birth, but virtue that makes the difference.

1074
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:32,000
In other words, he didn't support the idea that the rulers and kings had a birthright authority over truth or liberty.

1075
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The church or the state should not hold absolute power.

1076
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Instead, everyone, despite their socioeconomic status, deserves the right to have an education and access to knowledge.

1077
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Today, liberal democracies in the West follow the principles of free speech and individual autonomy.

1078
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Ideas that were promoted by Voltaire.

1079
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
So he's often considered the father of liberal individualism.

1080
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Because he believed everyone, irrespective of their socioeconomic class, deserved to be equally free.

1081
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So nature works with hierarchy, but Voltaire argued that every human deserves equal freedom to express themselves.

1082
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Jean-Jacques Rousseau who lived between 1712 and 1778 was born in Geneva.

1083
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Unlike Thomas Hobbes who said man is born savage but tamed in society,

1084
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Rousseau believed that humans are naturally good but they are contaminated or tainted in society to act terrible.

1085
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
He famously said, man is born free yet he is everywhere in chains.

1086
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
This was especially true in big cities where people turned selfish.

1087
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
He believed in the country people were naturally nicer, friendlier and fairer

1088
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:50,000
but once people migrated to the cities instead of becoming more civilized, ironically they turned into selfish animals.

1089
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Unlike Hobbes' top-down approach, Rousseau believed in a bottom-up approach

1090
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,000
arguing that the masses should be able to run the state, not some select individuals like kings and generals.

1091
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:07,000
His famous book The Social Contract is said to have influenced the French Revolution in 1789

1092
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
in which the anti-monarchy revolutionaries toppled the king and France became a republic.

1093
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Of course it didn't last very long but it sowed the seed of freedom, equality and brotherhood

1094
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:25,000
which resulted in three major ideologies of socialism, liberalism and nationalism

1095
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
which have dominated politics for centuries ever since.

1096
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So Rousseau's egalitarian approach had a huge influence in political history.

1097
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So to sum up, the humanists argued that since life is too short let's all be more equal, fairer and nicer to each other.

1098
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Mosey argued for an equal universal education, Rousseau for equal political participation

1099
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
and Voltaire for equal freedom for everyone to express himself.

1100
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Political animalists or elitists on the other hand argued that since life is too short

1101
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
it's all about winning, conquering and dominating others.

1102
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So they don't trust all humans therefore promoted a more robust political regime

1103
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
that didn't allow people to be free to challenge the ruler or the state.

1104
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Sansou used deception, Machiavelli justified repression and Hobbes promoted its state as a tool to control human savages.

1105
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Now as a historical trend we are moving towards an egalitarian humanist future at least in principle.

1106
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Also this was Karl Marx's prediction that slowly we are heading towards a communist utopia.

1107
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
In reality however all human societies are highly unequal and hierarchical

1108
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
and it's unlikely that this will change for a foreseeable future.

1109
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Humanism invented by humans while elitism or animalism invented by nature and evolutionary biology

1110
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
were all born unequal in beauty, talent, intellect and physical strength

1111
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
which contribute to societies being dominated by those who are naturally blessed either with talent or beauty.

1112
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
But despite nature not being helpful in producing us equally

1113
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
there is a deep desire among humans for equality, fairness and justice.

1114
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
You could say that humankind is called kind for a reason.

1115
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
As human civilization has improved and the more we have tame nature

1116
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
we have become more confident that a humanist utopia is possible.

1117
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So in recent centuries egalitarian philosophy has become more dominant

1118
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
which a few centuries back must have been unthinkable.

1119
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Socialist experiments showed the failure of egalitarianism in Russia

1120
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
but the idea is still pretty strong in the world.

1121
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Who knows in the future humans might produce human babies in labs who are identical in all attributes

1122
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
to create a truly egalitarian utopia.

1123
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Once you produce baby outside the natural process equality is a lot easier to achieve.

1124
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Identical babies produce identical adults, a brave new world kind of world.

1125
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
But will we be happy?

1126
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Next I'll discuss the battle between pursuing knowledge and pursuing happiness.

1127
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
In other words those who pursue knowledge to gain power

1128
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
and those who pursue happiness and peace to live a simpler life.

1129
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Previously I discussed the two philosophical approaches to organizing society

1130
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
egalitarian humanism versus hierarchical elitism.

1131
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Here I'll discuss fundamental question about the meaning of life.

1132
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Are we here to know the world or be happy?

1133
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Are we here to seek knowledge or happiness?

1134
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So in this segment I'll look at a few important philosophers.

1135
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,000
On the knowledge side I'll look at the philosophy of Francis Bacon, Martin Heidegger and Michel Foucault.

1136
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:45,000
On the happiness side I'll look at the philosophy of Erasmus, Michel Montaigne and Bertrand Russell.

1137
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
As I discussed earlier, philosophy is concerned mainly with two questions.

1138
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Ontology asks what is out there and epistemology asks how we know it.

1139
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So knowledge is fundamental to philosophy.

1140
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:02,000
You could say we humans are hardwired to see, understand, analyze and interpret the world.

1141
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:09,000
And in other words we are curious creatures so the development of modern science is just the byproduct of this curiosity.

1142
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,000
And our thirst for knowledge drives innovation and social change.

1143
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But we are also creatures who seek happiness.

1144
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
While knowledge can empower us, it doesn't make us happy.

1145
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
While knowledge can transform our lives, it doesn't guarantee happiness or peace of mind.

1146
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,000
As I discussed earlier, the first philosopher to methodically seek the truth was Socrates.

1147
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And later Aristotle improved it by giving the approach of scientific and empirical tinge to it.

1148
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
But it wasn't until centuries later the scientific approach was perfected in Europe,

1149
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:49,000
mainly in 15th and 16th centuries through the works of scientists such as Copernicus, Galileo and Newton.

1150
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:57,000
During this period, the English philosopher and scientist and politician Francis Bacon, who lived between 1561 and 1626,

1151
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
looked at knowledge from an empirical point of view.

1152
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
He graduated from Cambridge University and is often considered the first empiricist.

1153
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
A school of philosophy later developed by other British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume.

1154
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Bacon placed the source of knowledge in our experience through our senses.

1155
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
At the time, the church held the view that knowledge came from God and science was challenging that.

1156
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Church relied on people not knowing and not questioning things.

1157
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
When nobody knows things, the church could control information and become the source of knowledge.

1158
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Today you could say that big media companies have the same mindset.

1159
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,000
But Francis Bacon understood the power of knowledge and wanted to educate everyone

1160
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,000
because he believed that through knowledge you could empower the poor so they could live better lives.

1161
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
This is an early idea of public education, which today we take for granted.

1162
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Bacon understood that humans are on the one hand knowledge seekers,

1163
01:43:52,000 --> 01:44:00,000
but on the other hand humans also have some blind spots like religious belief, tribal affiliations and love of many,

1164
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
which prevent us from getting to the truth.

1165
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Another problem we have as humans is that we project our own limited experience to the world.

1166
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Bacon argued that science, however, doesn't look at an individual but looks at the majority to generalize.

1167
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
It's through generalization that you get closer to the truth.

1168
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,000
For instance, if one person experiences something, it's subjective and unreliable.

1169
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But if let's say 10, 20, 100 or more people experience the same thing, then you can generalize and make science out of it.

1170
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Understanding generality is an immense power according to Francis Bacon.

1171
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:42,000
So knowledge not only opens the knower's mind, it also empowers them to change their lives for the better.

1172
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Of course, Bacon lived at a time when people had very little,

1173
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
so education and knowledge could transform a person's life immeasurably.

1174
01:44:51,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Desiderius Erasmus, who lived between 1466 and 1536, was a Dutch philosopher who wrote a very influential book called In Praise of Folly.

1175
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Unlike Francis Bacon, Erasmus argued to be happy, naivety and ignorance are far more important than knowing.

1176
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
For him, the purpose of life is not to gain power but to be content.

1177
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:19,000
He was writing at a time when Europe was waking up to have a renaissance, a resurgence in scientific and rational pursuit,

1178
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
which went against the teachings of the Church to have faith in God.

1179
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Erasmus, a Christian himself, while criticizing the corruption in the Catholic Church,

1180
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
argued that to be happy, a little faith and ignorance were vitally important.

1181
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
His philosophy was taken up by fiction writers such as Cervante, the author of Don Quixote,

1182
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
and later the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky.

1183
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
The goal of life is not to know everything but to lead a simple life.

1184
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Knowledge or power doesn't make you happy but simplicity and folly do.

1185
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It's the old adage that ignorance is bliss which goes completely counter to the age of the Enlightenment and rationality.

1186
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So Erasmus said that being an idiot was the surest way to be happy.

1187
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Michel de Monten, who lived between 1533 and 1592, was a French philosopher who had a very curious childhood.

1188
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Although born into a wealthy family, he spent his first three years of childhood in the house of a peasant,

1189
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
so he could learn the life of the poor.

1190
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
This must have had a profound influence on him later in life.

1191
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
If Erasmus said folly was a good medicine for happiness,

1192
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Monten argued that to be happy one should have a simple life.

1193
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Instead of seeking the company of many people, one should try to live a more solitary life

1194
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:41,000
because society can corrupt you, either morally or intellectually.

1195
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
In today's social media world of chasing lives and online attention and validation,

1196
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
his message resonates with a lot of people.

1197
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
We always try to seek the validation of our peers like some addictive drug

1198
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
to an extent that we are never satisfied.

1199
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Monten says to have a peaceful life, don't chase other people's approval or glory or fame,

1200
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
which makes us pretentious and fake most of the time.

1201
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
He argued that attention seekers are not original thinkers,

1202
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
but rather suffers from herd mentality or tribalism,

1203
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
which in the heat of the crowd or moment turns us into mobs.

1204
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
We commit horrendous crimes and only later realize how stupid it was.

1205
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,000
To prevent becoming a mob, Monten argued once you disentangle yourself from the group, crowd or mobs,

1206
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
you develop a clarity of mind or inner tranquility.

1207
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
It's not only good for your happiness, but it's also good for your intellectual and moral integrity

1208
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
because solitude allows you to develop yourself.

1209
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:48,000
To have a lasting name, writers and artists should not be bogged down to social, political and tribal issues of the day.

1210
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Monten's idea of solitude also inspired Frederick Nietzsche,

1211
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:57,000
who was extremely critical of the masses or mobs or tribal thinking.

1212
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I'll discuss Nietzsche later on.

1213
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:05,000
As modernity made mass education the norm and the crowded cities' habitat for the majority of people,

1214
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
life's meaning became even more acute for the modern man.

1215
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Knowledge of the world wasn't enough to have a meaningful life.

1216
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
We needed something else.

1217
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Martin Heidegger, who lived between 1889 and 1976,

1218
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
was a German philosopher who turned the lens onto himself.

1219
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Francis Bacon, like Aristotle, was interested in knowing the outside world,

1220
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,000
but Heidegger, like Diagonus of Sinop, wanted to know the human being itself.

1221
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
In his famous book, Being in Time, instead of asking what human being is,

1222
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
he asked how it is like to be human.

1223
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
What is that experience like?

1224
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Why?

1225
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,000
The simple answer is that we are scientists who happen to be also the subject of science.

1226
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
When you study animals, we are outsiders.

1227
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But when we study human beings, we are insiders.

1228
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Heidegger didn't want to have an abstract answer,

1229
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
instead he wanted to know to have a concrete answer to the question of being,

1230
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
which is incidentally the root of the word ontology in Greek.

1231
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
So what is his answer?

1232
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Heidegger measured life as a finite phenomena,

1233
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
starting at birth, end, ending, and death,

1234
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
just a line that has a beginning and an end.

1235
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Now, unlike other animals, we know death.

1236
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
We even anticipate it.

1237
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
The knowledge of death makes us anxious and fearful,

1238
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
so to cope, we tend to not think about it on a daily basis.

1239
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
It's either a coping mechanism,

1240
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
or simply we do not have time to think about it every day,

1241
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
as we are busy with work and life.

1242
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So we are the being who is aware of death,

1243
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
but we also try not to think about it.

1244
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
That's precisely Heidegger's answer.

1245
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Human beings, or being in general, is to be aware of death.

1246
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Instead of making us anxious or depressed,

1247
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
he thinks it empowers us.

1248
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
This knowledge of death gives our life authenticity and meaning.

1249
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
So if Bacon said knowledge of the world empowers us

1250
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
to better our life physically,

1251
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Heidegger says the knowledge of death

1252
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
gives our life meaning and empowers us to live fully and authentically.

1253
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Bertrand Russell, who lived between 1872 and 1970,

1254
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
was a British philosopher who was deeply steeped

1255
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
in the logical and mathematical side of philosophy,

1256
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
just like Ludwig Wittgenstein, whom he influenced.

1257
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
He used a logical and rational approach to argue

1258
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
that to be happy one should work less.

1259
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You could say he is responding to Marx,

1260
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
who argued that workers are exploited by the rich.

1261
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
But he is also responding to the Northern European work ethics,

1262
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
which states that work is morally good in itself.

1263
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Therefore, this morality, according to some,

1264
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
was responsible for the modern capitalism.

1265
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Russell, however, argued that seeing work as a morally good thing

1266
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
was not only irrational,

1267
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
but it also made a few people very rich,

1268
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
while the majority very unhappy.

1269
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Why? Because not all kinds of work are the same.

1270
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Some are good and some are not good.

1271
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Some are meaningful and some are not.

1272
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
To bundle all as a good thing is not logical.

1273
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,000
He concluded that working less increases human happiness,

1274
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
so instead of working yourself to death,

1275
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
you should enjoy life more.

1276
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Do other activities.

1277
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Today, a lot of people are so busy working long hours

1278
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
that they lose sight of their well-being and happiness.

1279
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
This is especially true for men,

1280
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
because we are so drawn to numbers,

1281
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
just like Bertrand Russell was.

1282
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
We watch growth graphs and become obsessed with it.

1283
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
We work one day and then extrapolate that to a week,

1284
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
a month, and then a year.

1285
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
So if we work this many days,

1286
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
we will have this much money,

1287
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
or as a result, we'll lose sight of the fact

1288
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
that life is meant to be lived, not work to death.

1289
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
So Russell argued that to be happy, work less.

1290
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
He lived to be 90 years old.

1291
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Michel Foucault, who lived between 1926 and 1984,

1292
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
was a French philosopher.

1293
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Unlike Bacon and Heidegger,

1294
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
he saw knowledge as a cynical tool of repression.

1295
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Foucault looked at modernity through the lens of Nietzsche,

1296
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
saying that modern rationality wasn't liberating humans,

1297
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
but creating a more robust change of controllers.

1298
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
He famously studied the prison system

1299
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
and how prisons are designed to control us,

1300
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
either directly through imprisonment

1301
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
or indirectly through the fear of it.

1302
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
He argued that those who have access to science and knowledge

1303
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
use it to discipline the rest of us.

1304
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Foucault argued that knowledge is a tool.

1305
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Science is a tool.

1306
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Rationality is a tool.

1307
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
But mostly for the powerful elite

1308
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
because they have access to all of them,

1309
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
while the majority of us start subjects.

1310
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Michel Foucault was also inspired by Emmanuel Kahn,

1311
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
whose epistemological revolution argued

1312
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
that our knowledge of reality is not totally objective.

1313
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
But rather, we see the world the way we see

1314
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
because we impose our own mental structure on the world.

1315
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Foucault even argued that man or mankind itself

1316
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
is a recent invention.

1317
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
So to sum up, on the knowledge side,

1318
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Francis Bacon understood that our knowledge of the world

1319
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
could empower us to better our lives.

1320
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Heidegger argued that our knowledge of death

1321
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
can give our life more meaning and authenticity.

1322
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Foucault, however, said everything is invented.

1323
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
There is nothing solid to understand.

1324
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Knowledge is just a tool for power

1325
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
to manipulate nature and other humans.

1326
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So to sum up on the happiness side,

1327
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Erasmus argued that folly, ignorance, or naivety

1328
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
is a good thing to have to lead a happier life.

1329
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
We have all seen children.

1330
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
When we grow older, we lose that naivety

1331
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
and become a bit more miserable.

1332
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Monten argued that don't follow the crowd

1333
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
and seek some solitude to cultivate your own inner peace.

1334
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Don't seek validation from others like a drug addict.

1335
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
The higher you go, the more you seek to get high and higher.

1336
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
New mountain is high enough.

1337
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
So listen to Monten because he came down the mountain

1338
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
to settle in a hut.

1339
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Even his name is Monten, so climb yourself and your ego,

1340
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
not other people's validations.

1341
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Bertrand Russell argued that work is not morally good

1342
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
or bad thing, so we should prioritize happiness over work.

1343
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Work to live or live to work.

1344
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
I should really listen to this,

1345
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
but I want to have more subscribers.

1346
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Monten, help.

1347
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
So knowledge can make your physical life better

1348
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
or make you more successful financially

1349
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
or boost your social standing,

1350
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
but it might decrease your overall happiness.

1351
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Knowing things also makes us human

1352
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
very cynical about the world,

1353
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
just like Foucault said that all knowledge is power

1354
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
and all authorities won't suppress you.

1355
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Naivety, on the other hand,

1356
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
might make your physical life harder

1357
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
as you don't have everything figured out,

1358
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
but it can also lead you to a more long-lasting happiness

1359
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
as you trust other people and rely on other people,

1360
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
which brings the level of sincerity in yourself

1361
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
and those around you.

1362
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
So knowledge makes you successful,

1363
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
but it could also make you cynical.

1364
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
While ignorance hinders your success,

1365
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
it could also lead to a more blissful life.

1366
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
What do you think?

1367
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Next, I'll discuss a battle between rationalists

1368
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
and empiricists, leading to Immanuel Kant's

1369
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
great breakthrough in philosophical knowledge.

1370
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Previously, I discussed the question

1371
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
whether our life purpose is to seek knowledge

1372
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
or seek happiness.

1373
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
In this segment, I'll look at one of the biggest battles

1374
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
in philosophy between the rationalists,

1375
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
mostly mainland Europeans,

1376
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
who argue that knowledge is somewhat innate inside us,

1377
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
and empiricists, mainly British,

1378
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
who argue that knowledge comes from experience.

1379
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Immanuel Kant brought the two together.

1380
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
If Western philosophy was a two-sided funnel,

1381
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Kant would be the narrow part,

1382
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
so everything before him is squeezed through him

1383
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
and after him, Hegel and Schopenhauer

1384
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
move philosophy in two different directions.

1385
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Hegel went historical and rational,

1386
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
while Schopenhauer went psychological and subconscious.

1387
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I'll discuss these two philosophical approaches later on.

1388
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Rationalism is a school of philosophy

1389
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
that relies on human reason to understand the world.

1390
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Reason itself is an innate human property.

1391
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
In other words, we're born with the ability to reason,

1392
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
early rationalists saw reason as God-given gift.

1393
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
The father of rationalism is René Descartes,

1394
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
who lived between 1596 and 1650.

1395
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
He was a French philosopher and a scientist

1396
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
who famously did his thought experiment.

1397
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
He sat down in his armchair and asked the simple question,

1398
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
what if everything we know is just a dream?

1399
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Nothing exists in reality.

1400
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
In other words, to prove that he existed,

1401
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
he did the opposite.

1402
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
He doubted his own existence.

1403
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Then he said, if everything was a dream,

1404
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
the dreamer has to be real,

1405
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
otherwise there will be no dreaming without a dreamer

1406
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
or doubt without a doubter.

1407
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
So he said the most famous line in philosophy,

1408
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I think therefore I am.

1409
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Even if you doubt your own existence, this doubt is real.

1410
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
According to Descartes, we get knowledge or ideas

1411
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
in three different ways.

1412
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Some come from our experience, some drive from reason,

1413
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
and some ideas are innate inside us,

1414
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
presumably from God.

1415
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Scientists like René Descartes argue

1416
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
that we have an innate knowledge of the world

1417
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
and as we grow, we simply unfold that knowledge

1418
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
to see things more clearly.

1419
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
In a way, rationalists are like Plato

1420
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,000
and saying that our knowledge of the world inside us

1421
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,000
and learning is just recollection of that innate knowledge.

1422
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
So the seed is inside us, not outside.

1423
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
The other famous rationalist was Gottfried Leibniz,

1424
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
who lived between 1646 and 1716.

1425
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Today we know him more because of the famous argument

1426
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
he had with Isaac Newton over the invention of calculus.

1427
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Leibniz, however, was a great philosopher

1428
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
who made a distinction between rational truth and factual truth.

1429
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
In other words, our knowledge of the world

1430
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
relies on our innate reason, but also on human experience.

1431
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
The things we experience on the outside

1432
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
builds on and solidifies our inner knowledge.

1433
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
For Leibniz, the human mind is a small representation

1434
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
of the entire universe.

1435
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
In other words, the human mind contains everything

1436
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
in the universe.

1437
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
If the universe is rational, then the human mind

1438
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
is a representation of that rationality.

1439
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
However, he conceded that human rationality

1440
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
is not always adequate to understand the world,

1441
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
so we need human experience to complement our rational faculties.

1442
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
One of the biggest problems for Leibniz was his belief in God,

1443
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
so he attempted to reconcile scientific empiricism

1444
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
with the idea of God, who knows it all.

1445
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
In doing so, Leibniz argued for two different forms of truth.

1446
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
The empirical truths we get through experiences

1447
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
add to our rational truth, which we innately have or God given.

1448
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,000
So to sum up, rationalists argue that humans are

1449
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
naturally equipped to utilize reason to understand the world

1450
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
with or without the need of observation or animal senses.

1451
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
In other words, we don't need experiences to know the world.

1452
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
We simply know it because, for the most part,

1453
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
God has imparted us with innate knowledge

1454
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
or ability of reasoning.

1455
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Empiricism, however, disagreed, saying that we understand the world

1456
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
not innately, but through experience in empirical data

1457
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
we gather from the world through our human senses.

1458
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Our mind is a blank slate without experience.

1459
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
John Locke, who lived between 1632 and 1704, argued

1460
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
around the same time as Leibniz was a pioneer of empiricism

1461
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
who said that everything we know about the world

1462
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
has come to us from our experience.

1463
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
He gave the example of newborn babies to show

1464
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
that we humans have not a single idea from birth.

1465
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,000
We simply learn by observing and experiencing things.

1466
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Quote, if we attentively consider newborn children

1467
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
we shall have little reason to think

1468
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
that they bring many ideas into the world with them.

1469
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Locke understood that while we may not have innate ideas from birth

1470
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
we do have the ability to learn a language, which may be innate.

1471
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
This was later developed by Noam Chomsky

1472
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
in his famous theory of universal grammar

1473
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
that humans were a hardware to learn a language in its structure.

1474
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
So John Locke concluded that all knowledge we gain

1475
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
we gain through experience.

1476
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
David Hume, who lived between 1711 and 1776

1477
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
built on John Locke's idea of empirical experience

1478
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
as a source of knowledge and further argued

1479
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
that not only we understand the world through observation experiences

1480
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
but we're also able to categorize things as a kind of customer habit

1481
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
which guides us through life.

1482
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Hume argues that if you see a tree then another, then another

1483
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
at some point you see a pattern or category.

1484
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
This you call trees.

1485
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
We have no notion of trees from birth.

1486
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
We are like blank slits as babies

1487
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
and only through encounters with the outside world

1488
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
we begin to form knowledge of the outside world.

1489
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
The same with night and day.

1490
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
As you see the cycle being repeated

1491
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
you begin to expect it as a kind of custom that night turns into day

1492
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
and day turns into night

1493
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
and the cycle becomes a customary knowledge.

1494
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
This over time becomes ideas and beliefs.

1495
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Over time they turn into what is called innate knowledge.

1496
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Hume says there are nothing but old impressions or perceptions over time.

1497
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
As knowledge is passed on from generation to generation

1498
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
it may seem innate which is nothing but someone's experience.

1499
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So David Hume added custom as a kind of repeated experience

1500
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
or common knowledge

1501
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,000
and argued that we learn things from experience it is not innate.

1502
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So the rationalists believe we humans are equipped with some innate knowledge of the world at birth

1503
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
while the empiricists argue that we are blank slits

1504
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
and only through our experiences we gain knowledge of the world.

1505
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,000
In other words, rationalists see knowledge flow from inside out

1506
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
like a torch shedding light on the outside

1507
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
while the empiricists see knowledge flow from outside like a window lighting a room.

1508
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Here comes the German giant Immanuel Kant who lived between 1724 and 1804.

1509
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Kant took up the challenge of reconciling these two divergent schools of philosophy.

1510
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
To solve the problem between the rationalists and the empiricists

1511
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Kant devised a new theory that divided the world into two

1512
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
phenomena and numina.

1513
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Phenomena is a world of experiences

1514
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
how we understand the world through our bodily senses.

1515
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Things we see, hear, touch and smell in observing study.

1516
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Numina on the other hand is a world in itself which we can never truly know.

1517
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
For example, we can touch and study a rock

1518
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
but we cannot truly understand what it feels to be a rock.

1519
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
As a result, our knowledge of the rock is not complete.

1520
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
It's limited and partial.

1521
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Kant argued that when we are receiving information through experience

1522
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
however we are not passive receivers

1523
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
instead we humans also impose our own structures to the world.

1524
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
We categorize things into rocks, trees, animals and what not.

1525
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
The world we see is a reflection of a mental structure we put out to the world.

1526
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Rocks and trees may not have any notion of being such

1527
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
but humans have imposed such categories onto them.

1528
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
In other words, we are not passive knowledge receivers

1529
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
but actively imposing our own structure on things.

1530
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Now Kant brings the rationalists and empiricists together.

1531
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Rationalists argue everything is inside us while empiricists say everything is outside us

1532
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:16,000
and Kant says we are sort of on the threshold of outside and inside

1533
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:20,000
like a kind of window glass in the middle of inside and outside.

1534
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Our inner mental structure shapes how we experience the world.

1535
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
For example, a good analogy would be fishing.

1536
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
To catch a fish, a fisherman throws a net.

1537
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
If the holes in the net are too large, the fish escape

1538
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,000
and if the net has no hole, it catches more water than fish.

1539
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,000
So the fish is the outside world why the net we throw is our mental structure

1540
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
we put out to capture the experience as knowledge.

1541
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
We humans probe the world through our innate mental structure

1542
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
which catches the outside experience based knowledge.

1543
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
So for Kant reason and experience go hand in hand in understanding the world.

1544
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Without the net you cannot catch.

1545
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
You need both reason and experience to understand the world.

1546
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
This he called his Copernican Revolution.

1547
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Why? Because in the Middle Ages people believed the sun was orbiting the earth

1548
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
and Copernicus said the earth is orbiting the sun.

1549
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Kant did the same.

1550
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Empiricists say knowledge comes from outside and Kant says yes

1551
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
but not only we actively seek the outside knowledge

1552
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,000
but it also goes through us so our mental structure determines reality on the outside.

1553
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:34,000
In other words our human method puts a structure to the world that would not exist without humans.

1554
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:39,000
And this structure makes it easy for us to understand and manipulate the world.

1555
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Imagine we're not human we might have a very different understanding of the world.

1556
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,000
So to sum up the rationalist thing reason is more important than experience

1557
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
in our pursuit of knowledge.

1558
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Our reason is like a torch that allows us to see things.

1559
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:59,000
The empiricists however counter argue that experience is primary and reason is secondary.

1560
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Our senses act like a window that lets light in so we understand things.

1561
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Kant says we human are both a torch and a window

1562
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:14,000
because our mental structure allows us to experience and understand the world better faster and more effectively.

1563
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Without a good method or an effective tool and structure our experiences are all over the place.

1564
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
The debate is still not over though.

1565
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Despite Kant uniting the two epistemological approaches in philosophy

1566
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
there are still people who think one way or another.

1567
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Our modern science is leaning more to the empiricist camp

1568
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
while most psychologists lean more towards

1569
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
not the rationalist but the irrational subconscious

1570
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
or the unconscious in determining how we understand the world.

1571
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:47,000
So the debate has shifted from reason to passion in some cases to intuition.

1572
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It is not rationality but intuition that allows us to understand the world.

1573
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Next I'll discuss what motivates human action by looking at two of Kant's famous successors

1574
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
who went in different directions.

1575
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Schopenhauer went psychologically towards eastern philosophy

1576
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
while Hegel built his philosophy on history.

1577
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
On the one hand we have Hegel, Marx, Sartre and others

1578
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
who explain human motivation through history and rationality

1579
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
while on the other hand Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche

1580
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:21,000
relied on individual psyche and human passion to explain human motivation.

1581
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Previously I discussed how Immanuel Kant bridged the two philosophical approaches

1582
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
to epistemology, rationalism and empiricism.

1583
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
So in western philosophy Kant is like a funnel.

1584
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
He influenced another two branches of philosophy that came after him

1585
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
which tried to answer some fundamental questions like

1586
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
what makes us who we are, what motivates our actions.

1587
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Hegel's answer was history and rationality while his arch-rival Schopenhauer's answer was the subconscious will.

1588
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Hegel's philosophy went the sociological route basing human action on history and rationality

1589
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:01,000
while Schopenhauer's philosophy went the psychological route basing human motivation

1590
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
on the subconscious blind will or human passion.

1591
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,000
In this segment I'll look at sociology and rationality by discussing philosophers

1592
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
including Hegel, Marx, Sartre and Zezek

1593
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
who argued that we are the product of history but they didn't stop there.

1594
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Since history makes us who we are it's also our job to make history

1595
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
so we're not only molded and shaped by the historical era in which we live in

1596
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
but also through our own life choices.

1597
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
So social philosophy is built on the philosophy of progressive egalitarianism

1598
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
stating that we are heading towards perfectionist utopia on the one hand

1599
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:43,000
and materialism stating that the most important aspect of human life is material success on the other.

1600
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Of course not all of them agreed on this.

1601
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It's important to know that philosophers who came after Kant were in a sense responding to Kant

1602
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,000
because his breakthrough in bringing the rationalists and imperialists together

1603
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
was a huge moment in philosophy.

1604
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,000
George Hegel who lived between 1770 and 1831 too responded to Kant.

1605
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Hegel had two problems with Kant.

1606
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,000
First Kant argued that we humans only understand the phenomena

1607
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,000
but we have no access to Númena or the thing itself.

1608
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
We can touch a rock but we cannot fully understand it.

1609
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,000
For Hegel this Númena world which we can never fully know looked like an empty abstraction

1610
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
pure speculation based on Kant's own assumption.

1611
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
In other words he just made it up by claiming that such a thing existed in the first place.

1612
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Hegel's second problem with Kant was that he argued that our innate structure

1613
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
or categorization by which we interpret the world is fixed.

1614
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,000
In other words we use a fishnet or framework by which we catch a fish or experience

1615
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
but the net or the framework is always fixed and nobody can change it.

1616
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:55,000
For the history buff Hegel everything including human consciousness was subject to change through time.

1617
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
History has shown us that humans evolve so do our tools including the fishnet

1618
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
or our ability to reason.

1619
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,000
In other words everything has a history even rock has a history it changes through time

1620
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
and humans are very much a product of historical era.

1621
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
How do we change? Hegel says through dialectic processes.

1622
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:21,000
When two opposites collide it makes a third thing that has a bit of both the original things

1623
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
but it also has slightly different characters.

1624
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Hegel says every phenomena or idea or thesis as he called it contains a contradiction within itself

1625
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
which he called antithesis.

1626
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,000
In this conflict which is resolved in synthesis or a new idea which is an improvement

1627
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
or different from the thesis in antithesis.

1628
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Like a child has a characteristic of both parents but also different from both.

1629
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
This historical process continues in generating new thesis in antithesis

1630
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
which lead to further synthesis and history continues.

1631
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:57,000
So according to Hegel Kant was wrong in saying that human mental structure or reason does not change.

1632
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
For Hegel everything is subject to change.

1633
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
It's important to know that Kant was a lot firmer in his religious belief than Hegel

1634
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:10,000
which explains that Kant sees reason as a static while Hegel sees it as malleable and changeable through time.

1635
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,000
And that the reason was of course the French Revolution as well as the rise of Napoleon

1636
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
which for the very first time in human history ordinary people took power from the king

1637
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
and anyone could become Napoleon.

1638
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
So nothing was fixed.

1639
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Kant being a much older man was fiercely against any kind of revolution that could destabilize the status quo.

1640
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,000
For Hegel the world has a history and we are for the most part the product of historical era.

1641
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
In other words reality is a historical process not constant.

1642
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,000
However since we are the product of history we can also affect the course of history

1643
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
through ideas that capture the spirit of an age.

1644
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:52,000
For example Napoleon managed to influence history as he captured the spirit of 19th century Europe.

1645
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
People didn't believe in the absolute power of kings or demanded change.

1646
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Hegel can be characterized as a perfectionist rationalist believing that history is moving towards perfection.

1647
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Now Hegel only interpreted history. His student wanted to change history.

1648
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Karl Marx who lived between 1818 and 1883 learned a great deal from Hegel.

1649
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:22,000
He came to the conclusion that if we are the product of history our history must be the product of those who came before us.

1650
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Marx had a problem. Hegel was good at interpreting history even at recognizing the people who were capable of changing

1651
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
but Marx was more concerned about changing things for the good

1652
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,000
especially for the disadvantaged majority who were the real force behind economic production.

1653
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
i.e. the working class.

1654
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Marx said the history of our existence has been nothing but a continuous class struggle between the haves and have nots

1655
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:53,000
the powerful and the powerless with the powerful enjoying it all and the powerless having a tough time of it.

1656
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So Marx developed a philosophy of rational materialism arguing that material inequality was the truth of all evils.

1657
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:08,000
He argued that humans are fundamentally motivated by material objects so we are rational because we want material things.

1658
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
To solve this inequality he adopted egalitarianism.

1659
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:20,000
For Marx the perfectionist future utopia was an egalitarian society where you only worked for the hours that provided you enough subsistence

1660
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
and the rest of time you could relax on the beach.

1661
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:30,000
You can also see traces of Christianity and Marxism the fight between good and evil culminating in the weak overthrowing the powerful

1662
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:37,000
and turning the world into a utopian communist heaven where everyone lives equally and happily ever after.

1663
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:45,000
But Marx was not religious so he based his philosophy on rational materialism in which all workers unite over through the exploitative class

1664
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
and everyone lives in harmony and peace and nobody starves.

1665
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:58,000
For Marx not only communism was desirable it was also historically inevitable because for him history was moving towards perfection

1666
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
through incremental improvement or dialectical change as Hegel said.

1667
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:10,000
For example feudalism was an improvement on hunter gatherer societies capitalism was an improvement on feudalism

1668
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,000
socialism and improvement on capitalism and finally communism and improvement on socialism

1669
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
and for Marx communism was the final phase of human history.

1670
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:25,000
You couldn't make it any better just like heaven you cannot create a heaven that is better than another heaven

1671
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:31,000
or maybe you could but generally heavens tend to mean perfection if they do exist of course.

1672
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Marxist class based analysis had deep communitarian roots or group based as a result it failed in a highly individualized Europe

1673
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:46,000
despite many attempts for example in 1870s Paris had a socialist revolution but it didn't stick.

1674
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Marxism found fertile soil in countries with strong communitarian bond like Russia and China

1675
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:57,000
so the 20th century witnessed many Marxist revolutions to move history in the right direction.

1676
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:02,000
These attempts had partial success but ultimately failed to create a communist utopia.

1677
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:08,000
So Hegel talked about history in motion Marx talked about how to speed up that historical motion

1678
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
both Hegel and Marx saw things from a society's perspective.

1679
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Now I'll discuss how this history based philosophy applies to a person's own individual history from birth to death.

1680
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
If a society has a history so does an individual.

1681
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Jean-Paul Sartre who lived between 1905 and 1980 was a French existentialist philosopher.

1682
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:36,000
He was not a Marxist but was hugely influenced by Marx and other Marxists especially the Maoist movement in France.

1683
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Hegel and Marx both agreed that humans are not only the product of history we humans also serve the purpose of history.

1684
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Hegel explained reality through a godlike spirit or idea and Marx explained through a historical materialism in class struggle

1685
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:57,000
in other words both argued that we individuals are there to serve the grander mission or purpose

1686
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,000
be it God or history or class struggle or general society.

1687
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
But what's the purpose of an individual human life?

1688
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Sartre's existentialist philosophy argued that human life has no purpose

1689
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:14,000
because we are made neither by God nor by a blind force of history as Marx and Hegel outlined.

1690
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Instead we are made by our own history choices we make in our own life

1691
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
in other words we have no essence or purpose from birth

1692
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:26,000
we simply acquire it through our life often through our own free choices in actions.

1693
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Since we have no pre-ordained purpose set for us by some other power like God or society

1694
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
we are free to make mistakes to find our own purpose.

1695
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Sartre even goes further by saying that we are condemned to be free and condemned to make mistakes

1696
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
but this freedom comes with you guessed it.

1697
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
As Uncle Ben said it comes with responsibility.

1698
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
In other words we are our own makers we craft our own self-identity

1699
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
therefore we have to live with what we make of ourselves.

1700
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Unlike Hegel and Marx Sartre liberates individuals from the constraints of God

1701
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
history traditions class and even human nature.

1702
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
So today a new trend among homo sapiens is transgenderism

1703
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,000
the idea that you can define your own gender identity based on your own feelings.

1704
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
People feel they are in the wrong body and they change their gender

1705
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
and an attempt to correct the incorrect.

1706
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
This might have been difficult in a pre-existentialist era

1707
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
but now it's widely accepted in most of the developed world

1708
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
you can decide what your identity is.

1709
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Instead of your biology, society's history, tradition or norms defining you

1710
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:38,000
you have the full control to make yourself and find your own life's purpose.

1711
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
As I said with this freedom comes responsibility.

1712
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,000
If you make mistake you have to own those mistakes don't blame others.

1713
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
In other words if you build a bridge and it collapses you are responsible

1714
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
and the same way you build your own identity if something goes wrong

1715
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
you cannot blame others for it.

1716
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
So Jean Paul Sartre's existentialist philosophy gave the individual the full autonomy

1717
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
to make something of themselves.

1718
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
For him it wasn't social history but your own individual history

1719
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
that makes you your own free choices.

1720
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Slavojecek was born in Slovenia in 1949.

1721
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Today he is the most important figure who subscribes to a history based philosophy.

1722
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
He identifies himself as Hegelian who argues that Marxism has failed miserably

1723
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
because most Marxists today live in the past, too attached to history.

1724
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Today's Marxists blame history for their failure.

1725
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,000
In other words he says that Marxists today have lost touch with reality

1726
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
and live in the past like an old man who has failed in his life projects.

1727
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:47,000
This failure is most visible in his own style as he uses comedy to cope with that failure.

1728
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
His philosophy is based on philosophical irony.

1729
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Marxists believe in history and historical struggle.

1730
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
The very history that these philosophers based their ideas

1731
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
failed their attempt to create a truly socialist society.

1732
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,000
So history failed the philosophical tradition that based its core philosophy on history.

1733
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Now that's ironic and so on and so on and so on you get the point.

1734
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
So to sum up Hegel said we are the product of history that keeps progressing

1735
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:22,000
and Marx said let's not study history but let's speed it up to get our final destination, a communist utopia.

1736
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Sartre argues forget about class history we are the product of our own individual history

1737
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
in which we'll also find our purpose.

1738
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,000
And finally Zhecek says history has failed us all.

1739
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
We have not progressed but regressed.

1740
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
So our history is nothing but a history of failed intelligence or rationality.

1741
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Next I'll discuss the other strand of philosophy that came out of Kant

1742
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
through Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche

1743
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:52,000
which emphasizes not rationality or history or society but passion or will or human psyche

1744
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
the mysterious subconscious world of psychological philosophy.

1745
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Previously I discussed a bunch of philosophy that put emphasis on historical and social changes

1746
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
the main motivating factors for human actions.

1747
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
For example philosophers like Hegel, Marx and Sartre argued that we are the product of history

1748
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
either society's history or our own personal history.

1749
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:24,000
In this segment I'll focus on the other branch of philosophy that is based on the individual human psyche

1750
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
or the blind will that drives human actions.

1751
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
In other words it's not the history or society but other mysterious forces inside us

1752
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
like passion or the blind subconscious will.

1753
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:40,000
The German philosopher Otto Schopenhauer who lived between 1788 and 1860

1754
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
was firmly against Hegel's philosophy.

1755
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Schopenhauer took Kant's distinction between the noble world of phenomena

1756
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:53,000
and the unknowable world of Númena to develop his own theory of will and representation.

1757
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Schopenhauer argued that there is no distinction between the two.

1758
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
They are one in the same thing or two sides of the same coin.

1759
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
He said there is one world which he called will.

1760
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
But this will is mysterious and hard to understand.

1761
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
It's built in inside us.

1762
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
In other words all living beings and even non-living beings

1763
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
come pre-assembled or pre-installed with this blind will.

1764
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Since it's built in inside each being we cannot fully know.

1765
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:25,000
We can only know how it's represented or manifested to us but not the will itself.

1766
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:30,000
The will itself is hidden from us all we see is its mere representation.

1767
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:34,000
For Schopenhauer will is the blind driving force in the universe

1768
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,000
and representation is our perception of that blind will.

1769
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
In other words will is the essence of the universe

1770
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
and we only see or understand its manifestation in us.

1771
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
He called it will to life or passion for life

1772
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,000
that we share with all living beings including animals and plants.

1773
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
We all have an innate will to continue living.

1774
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Since the will itself is blind and universal

1775
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
we each become its eye through which it looks out to the world.

1776
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Will is like a gigantic iceberg while our human intellect

1777
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
or human perception of it is only the tip of that iceberg.

1778
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
So Schopenhauer really went deeply psychological about human motivation.

1779
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Schopenhauer says it's impossible to know the will

1780
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
because as soon as you observe it it becomes a representation of that will.

1781
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
If you do not observe it then it is the will.

1782
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
It's like in quantum mechanics your observation of a particle

1783
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,000
changes the position of the particle.

1784
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
In other words if you don't look it is there

1785
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
but as soon as you look it changes position.

1786
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,000
It's also a kind of catch-22.

1787
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
To understand Schopenhauer's idea of will

1788
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
is to imagine everything in the universe as one thing

1789
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
let's say atoms that oscillates between everything that exists.

1790
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,000
It appears to us as something that is not genuine thing

1791
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
but a mere representation.

1792
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
To fully understand Schopenhauer's will

1793
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
it's important to mention the Buddhist idea of the self

1794
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
as an illusion or mirage.

1795
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
For the Buddhist soul is universal

1796
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:07,000
but the self is a mere mirage we acquire in our lifetime.

1797
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,000
In other words our essence is not the self we call me or I.

1798
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Schopenhauer too places the blind will at a much deeper place

1799
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
than we understand or we can get to

1800
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
and will only get a representation of it.

1801
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:23,000
He also said that will is the cause of our human suffering.

1802
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Therefore Schopenhauer's often considered the father of pessimism.

1803
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Just like in Buddhism our ego desires things

1804
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
and those desires makes us suffer

1805
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
because we can never satisfy our desires fully.

1806
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Schopenhauer says since we have a body

1807
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
we have a will that somehow controls us

1808
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
and that causes us suffering.

1809
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
So we are all at the mercy of this blind will

1810
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
that urges us to do things.

1811
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
The only way to cope with this suffering

1812
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
is through intellect and art

1813
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
which allows us to move to a state of non-existence

1814
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
like in Buddhist Nirvana.

1815
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Artists while creating art

1816
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
as well as us while enjoying that art

1817
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
we all experience a moment of non-being

1818
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
while in awe of its beauty.

1819
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
When an art takes our breath away

1820
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:12,000
we truly experience non-existence

1821
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
a kind of blissful moment.

1822
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Schopenhauer influenced the German composer Richard Wagner

1823
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
whose music represents Schopenhauer's philosophy.

1824
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:24,000
For Schopenhauer music didn't represent the phenomenal world

1825
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,000
therefore it was free from the will and urges

1826
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
instead it fostered compassion.

1827
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Schopenhauer had a massive influence on novelists

1828
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
and musicians of the 19th century.

1829
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,000
He also influenced psychoanalysts

1830
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
especially Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

1831
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Schopenhauer also dismissed the idea of God

1832
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
and replaced God with the blind will

1833
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,000
and this had an influence on our next philosopher.

1834
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard

1835
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
lived between 1813 and 1855.

1836
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
He argued that our anxiety comes from our choices

1837
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
or in other words our belief and complete freedom

1838
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
to make choices.

1839
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
In a world where everyone believes in God

1840
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
where everything is caused by God

1841
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
people accept it because there is no other choice.

1842
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
In other words God tells you what to do

1843
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
and what not to do.

1844
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
You have no choice of your own.

1845
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,000
But we live in a world where we no longer believe in God

1846
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
so we have the freedom to choose

1847
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,000
but this freedom comes at a massive psychological cost.

1848
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:26,000
It makes us anxious about our choices

1849
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
and the consequences of our choices.

1850
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,000
When we are children we live a carefree life

1851
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
because our parents take care of everything

1852
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
and the same way a God fearing society

1853
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
also lives in a kind of blissful ignorance.

1854
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Since God is dead or when parents die

1855
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
we are responsible to make our own choices.

1856
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:48,000
The psychological toll of making choices is immense on us.

1857
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
For example, Hamlet agonizes over the question

1858
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
of to be or not to be in Shakespeare's play.

1859
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Incidentally Hamlet was also a dain like Kierkegaard.

1860
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
In the 19th century a hysteria was very prevalent

1861
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
especially among women.

1862
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Today anxiety is more common among both men and women

1863
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,000
so absolute freedom makes us anxious.

1864
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Kierkegaard himself never lost faith in God

1865
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
but he saw freedom as good and bad.

1866
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
While it makes us anxious and dizzy

1867
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
it also allows us to make good moral choices.

1868
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
His problem with Hegel's theory of history

1869
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,000
was that it gave little room for individual freedom

1870
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,000
because we were bound by the historical force.

1871
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
In fact we suffer not because of the bigger forces in society

1872
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
but we suffer through our own action

1873
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,000
or choices we make as individuals.

1874
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,000
So Schopenhauer said the blind will motivate us

1875
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
while living us with minimum freedom of our own

1876
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
and Kierkegaard said that little freedom induces anxiety in us.

1877
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Now these two philosophers come together in our next philosopher.

1878
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche

1879
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
lived between 1844 and 1900.

1880
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
He was a great admirer of Schopenhauer.

1881
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
He accepted Schopenhauer's idea of the will

1882
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
but he had a big problem how passive this will to life was.

1883
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Nietzsche argued that this will blinded maybe

1884
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,000
can be harnessed and utilized for great purposes

1885
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:18,000
artistic genius and philosophical flourishing.

1886
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
He changed the passive will to life

1887
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,000
into a proactive will to power.

1888
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
In other words we are not here just to live

1889
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
but we are here to grow, conquer and dominate.

1890
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Nature is based on competition not a state of blissfulness

1891
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
or mere survival.

1892
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Nietzsche saw religion especially its morality

1893
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,000
as the biggest obstacle for individuals to push boundaries

1894
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
in order to achieve greatness.

1895
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Morality decides what's good what's bad

1896
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
so society promotes certain values and restricts others.

1897
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Nietzsche saw this as a weak minded way of living

1898
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
that promoted weak or slave mentality.

1899
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
He instead proposed a more nature based approach

1900
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
in which no morality can restrict innovation

1901
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
probing artistic creativity and philosophical ideas.

1902
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Nietzsche wants to grow, dominate

1903
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
while religions suppress and tame people.

1904
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Nietzsche proposed the idea of ubermensch

1905
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,000
a being who has surpassed humanity into something else

1906
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:16,000
a free-spread artist or a philosophical genius.

1907
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
He is no longer bound by social values and norms

1908
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,000
because he has shed his human qualities of weakness

1909
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,000
and slave mentality and religious compassion.

1910
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
He is released from all that into an enormous

1911
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
creative energy and exuberance for life.

1912
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Nietzsche also saw western philosophy championing rationality

1913
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,000
at the expense of passion and emotions.

1914
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
For him, passion was as important as reason.

1915
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Reason is just a tool it provides us with technology

1916
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
that makes life easier and more comfortable.

1917
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
But reason cannot motivate us to do things

1918
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
that are daring and courageous.

1919
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Instead rationality makes us risk averse.

1920
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
This timidness leads us to a hiddenism

1921
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,000
in which we only seek pleasure and avoid pain.

1922
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,000
This is a kind of nihilistic self-indulgence

1923
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,000
that makes you lazy and self-centered.

1924
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Human passion on the other hand motivates us to do things

1925
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,000
conquer the world and topple mountains.

1926
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
So Nietzsche's philosophy was based on human passion

1927
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
or the will to power to surpass the current humans

1928
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
into a great genius.

1929
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Nietzsche didn't believe in equality either

1930
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,000
because only a handful of people could become

1931
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
great artists and genius philosophers.

1932
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Not everyone has original ideas.

1933
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:32,000
So to sum up, Schopenhauer placed human motivation

1934
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,000
on the blind in a twill while Kierkegaard said

1935
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,000
our anxiety comes from the little freedom we experience

1936
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
and Nietzsche argued we're driven by will to power

1937
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
or passion to push society forward and innovate.

1938
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Today's sociology and psychology have replaced

1939
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,000
philosophy when it comes to human motivation.

1940
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,000
One of the leading voices of psychology is

1941
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Jordan Peterson who was born in 1962

1942
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,000
and has adopted YouTube as his platform.

1943
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Another contemporary voice is the Indian Yogi

1944
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Sadguru. Peterson believes in human passion

1945
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:08,000
and faith telling young people to take individual

1946
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,000
responsibility. Unlike Zezek, Peterson doesn't

1947
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:14,000
see the world through group identity like class or gender

1948
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
but through the lens of the individual. His idea

1949
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
of perception is somewhat similar to Schopenhauer's will

1950
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,000
and representation. Sadguru, an Indian Yogi Guru

1951
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
on the other hand argues that today's world is shaped

1952
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,000
by materialism and people have conflated

1953
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:32,000
the desire for more with happiness. Our goal

1954
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,000
is no longer happiness but to have more.

1955
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
He argues it's time we reach a higher level of intelligence

1956
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
so we are in charge of our body. Not

1957
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
our bodily desires in charge of our mind.

1958
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
He argues that modern society even science has

1959
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
become a slave to human bodily desires to make us

1960
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,000
more comfortable. As a result it has blinded us

1961
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,000
from other possibilities of human intelligence

1962
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,000
or human consciousness to reach higher places.

1963
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
So to sum up Schopenhauer said we are driven

1964
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,000
by universal will or passion for which we have

1965
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:08,000
no control and this causes us to suffer

1966
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,000
and art is our best cure for suffering.

1967
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Kierkegaard argued that our anxiety or suffering

1968
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,000
is also caused by our freedom of choices in life

1969
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:20,000
which kind of negates Schopenhauer's blind will.

1970
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Nietzsche said this human passion that causes a suffering

1971
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,000
is also a great tool to do something.

1972
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Create something and become greater than ourselves.

1973
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Peterson says to ease suffering is to take responsibility

1974
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,000
and make something of your individual life instead

1975
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:38,000
of blaming others. Sattguru argues

1976
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,000
for a new form of human consciousness that goes

1977
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
beyond the material world.

1978
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
So to sum up human philosophy in the last 2,500 years

1979
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,000
has tried to answer many different questions.

1980
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Early Greeks tried empirical knowledge to explain

1981
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,000
the world while early eastern philosophers

1982
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,000
tried to psychologically cope with the problem of existence.

1983
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Then later philosophers tried to explain life's

1984
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
purpose with the humanists focusing on the equality

1985
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
among humans while the elitists or political realists

1986
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,000
emphasized competition to push society forward.

1987
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Then Kant brought rationalism and empiricism together

1988
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:17,000
and the next generation of Germans took him

1989
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,000
in two separate directions. Hegel went historical

1990
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
saying we are made by history while Schopenhauer

1991
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,000
went deeper into human psyche saying we are made

1992
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
by a blind will. Perhaps today we are moving towards

1993
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,000
a new philosophy that is not based on reason but human

1994
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,000
intuition.

1995
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
To sum up this video in part 1 I discussed

1996
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:41,000
how humans' knowledge of depth and the rise

1997
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
of rational thinking gave rise to human philosophy

1998
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,000
in an attempt to answer some of life's fundamental questions

1999
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:50,000
like the meaning of life, the nature of reality

2000
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,000
and the function of the human mind. Then over time

2001
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
each of those topics became a discipline of its own

2002
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
philosophy gave birth to physics, biology, psychology.

2003
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Physics focused on reality, biology on life

2004
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
and psychology on the human mind. Later I looked

2005
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
at the various branches of philosophy such as ontology,

2006
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
epistemology, rationalism, empiricism, humanism,

2007
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
utilitarianism, existentialism and postmodernism.

2008
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:17,000
In part 2 I discussed how Eastern philosophy was based

2009
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,000
around rivers and agriculture therefore spirituality

2010
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,000
and fatalism became the dominant philosophical ideas.

2011
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Western philosophy on the other hand was based on oceans

2012
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
and trade which focused more on rational thinking.

2013
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
The fundamental difference is that Eastern philosophy

2014
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,000
emphasizes changing oneself while Western philosophy

2015
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
wants to change the world. I discussed how the Greek

2016
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
giants of Socrates played to an Aristotle question

2017
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:44,000
dogma in promoted rational thinking. While the

2018
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Eastern true of Buddha, Lao Tzu and Confucius showed

2019
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,000
how not to change nature but become one with nature

2020
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,000
by changing yourself. In part 3 I discussed

2021
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,000
the purpose of human civilization and human life.

2022
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Elitism sees society as a competition ground

2023
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
while egalitarianism promotes equality.

2024
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Philosophers such as Sun Tzu, Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes

2025
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
saw humans as animals so they offered a

2026
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,000
hierarchical social system to mimic nature where

2027
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
the most adept survive. Philosophers such as

2028
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire promoted equality

2029
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
instead. On the question of knowledge or happiness

2030
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,000
the Rosmas, Montaigne, Bertrand Russell argued

2031
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
one should prioritize happiness. While philosophers

2032
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
such as Francis Bacon, Heidegger and Michel Foucault

2033
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
prioritized knowledge to better one's life and understand

2034
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,000
the nature of society. In part 4 I tackled the question

2035
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:38,000
of knowledge by discussing rationalism and empiricism.

2036
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Rationalists see knowledge as innate inside us

2037
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:44,000
while empiricists see knowledge only coming from

2038
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,000
outside experience. Kant provided a middle ground

2039
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
saying we have innate mental structure that we put out

2040
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
to the world to give us a more structured understanding

2041
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
of the world. And in other words we are not passive

2042
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,000
receivers but active organizers of the world.

2043
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:02,000
I also discussed what shapes us and motivates our action.

2044
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Hegel and Marx's history based philosophy argued

2045
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:08,000
we are the product of history and Jean-Paul Sartre

2046
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
who said we are the product of our own individual history.

2047
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:14,000
On the psychological side we saw Schopenhauer who placed

2048
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,000
human motivation in the subconscious blind will.

2049
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Kierkegaard focused on how freedom creates an anxiety.

2050
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Nietzsche said we can channel the blind will

2051
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:26,000
and use anxiety to create art.

2052
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,000
If you have made it to this point a huge kudos to you

2053
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I really appreciate it. So my question to you

2054
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:35,000
which philosophy or philosopher resonated with you the most?

2055
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Or a more interesting question is

2056
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
where do you see philosophy heading? As always

2057
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I really appreciate you accompanying me on this long journey.

2058
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Thank you.
