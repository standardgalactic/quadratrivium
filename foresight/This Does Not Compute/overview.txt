Checking This Does Not Compute/PowerBook 3400c -- When the World's Fastest Laptop Was a Mac!.txt
 The Apple PowerBook G3 (3400) was released in 1997 and was one of the most powerful laptops of its time, featuring a 240 MHz PowerPC G3 processor, a 12-inch Active Matrix LCD screen, and up to 64 MB of RAM. Despite its high price tag of around $6,500 USD for the top-end model, it was considered a good value compared to similar PC laptops at that time. The design was inspired by Masamichi Udagawa, who left Apple after the project's completion but went on to have a successful career in product design.

The 3400 had several configurations, with the base model starting at an 180 MHz processor, 16 MB of RAM, and a 1.3 GB hard drive for about $5,000 USD. It also included a CD-ROM or optional combo Ethernet/modem card. The PowerBook G3 3400 was a significant product for Apple during a tumultuous period in the company's history, and it held the title as the world's fastest laptop until later that year when Intel released new mobile Pentium processors.

Today, the PowerBook G3 3400 is a sought-after vintage Mac for enthusiasts and collectors, often available on platforms like eBay for a few hundred dollars. It represents an interesting chapter in Apple's history, showcasing the company's resilience despite its internal struggles during the early to mid-1990s.
