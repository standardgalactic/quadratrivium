Thank you very much, Lisa. And thank you all for being here. I was going to say this evening,
but I realise it's not necessarily evening for all of you. So as you just heard, I'm
publishing a book. In fact, it's released today in the United Kingdom in a couple of weeks in
the United States with the same title as my talk, The Hidden Spring, A Journey to the Source of
Consciousness. Hopefully, when I've finished in an hour's time, what I'm going to present to you,
you will understand why the book has this title. The book is, of course, about consciousness.
And I'm quoting here what the physicist Paul Davies recently wrote about consciousness.
But I could have found a hundred scientists saying basically the same thing.
Davies says, among life's many baffling properties, the phenomenon of consciousness
sleeps out as especially striking. Its origin is arguably the hardest problem facing science today.
And the only one that remains almost impenetrable, even after two and a half millennia of deliberation.
Consciousness is the number one problem of science of existence even. So our topic tonight is not
a small one. It is widely regarded as the number one problem of science today. So my book is about
this problem. But this is a lecture. And of course, I can't begin to cover all the complexities
that require a book length treatment. So what I'm going to say tonight is a sort of
extracting things down to their essence. I'm going to simplify. And I'm going to simplify by
focusing on just one strand, although it is a sort of a red thread running through the book,
one strand of the argument. And I'll state that argument upfront. It is that we have made so little
progress in terms of solving the problem that Paul Davies identifies here, because we've been
looking in the wrong place. We've been looking for the explanation of how and why consciousness
arises in the cerebral cortex, the longstanding assumed seat of consciousness. And I'm going to
argue that we should be looking elsewhere. We should be looking in a far more primitive structure,
the brainstem, in particular, the reticular activating system at the core of the brainstem.
And not at these higher cognitive functions that are performed by the cortex and in particular
by the human cortex, but rather at far more basic functions of the kind that are performed in the
brainstem, specifically raw feelings. I'm going to argue that raw feelings are the fundamental
form of consciousness in all sorts of ways, and that if we've shifted our attention from higher
cognition to lower, as it were, feelings, the hard problem becomes less hard. In order to escape
the risk of overly abstract ideas, I thought I would tell my story via a series of cases,
some clinical case histories. I've lined up six for you, and I hope I get through all six of them,
because as I say, I have only an hour. So let's hope I get through them all, but at least it'll
give you some flavor of the lived experience of patients with disorders of consciousness
who have been so helpful to me over the years in terms of my efforts to unravel this problem.
But let's start in the obvious place. I'm going to read you now the formulation of the hard problem
by David Chalmers. In a paper in 1995, he coined that term, and this is what he wrote.
It is undeniable that some organisms are subject of experience, but the question of how it is that
these systems or subjects of experience is perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive
systems engage in visual and auditory information processing, we have visual or auditory experience,
the quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C. How can we explain there is something
it's like to an image or experience an emotion? It's widely agreed that experience arises from
a physical basis, but we have no good explanation of how and why it so arises. Now this is the
way that Chalmers formulated the hard problem, but of course this is not a new problem, as
David said, it's something we've been pondering for millennia. But in particular, I've emphasized
this phrase, something it is like, in order to make a link back to another philosopher,
Tom Nagel, who wrote in 1974, an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is
something that it is like to be that organism, something it's like for the organism.
And later in the paper, that same paper he wrote, if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind
must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently
available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done. So my aim this evening in
this brief talk is to give you a clue about how this could be done. I told you I'm going to,
well, let me first of all, sorry, I see what I have on the screen here, I've wanted to state
as succinctly as possible what this problem is that I'm addressing. And you can think as I go
along whether or not I am answering this question. This is the hard problem. Why and how is there
something it's like to be an organism, something it's like for the organism. Now what I started to
say is I told you I'm going to address this via a series of cases in order to not get too lost
in abstractions. Here's our first case. This is the case. He is in fact my brother. This
photograph was taken when he was two and a half or two short of three years old. And I as you can
see was a baby. We were born in a small village and for all sorts of reasons we were rather isolated.
So we were best of friends and we got on famously. One day four and a bit years after this photograph
was taken my parents were yachting and my brother climbed up onto the clubhouse roof while I was
wading in the in the waters of the of the lake below. And he tripped and he fell
three stories and landed on his head on the paving stones below fractured his skull
and sustained an intracerebral bleed. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Cape Town
called Khrutaskir to the neurosurgery department where amazingly but not entirely coincidentally
where I work today. That sort of hemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency but fortunately in
my brother's case the bleeding stopped and the hemorrhage the hematoma reabsorbed and
he survived and a few weeks later he was flown back home. He looked exactly the same as he had
before apart from the fact that he had to wear a helmet to protect his fractured skull but despite
the appearance being the same he was not the same. As a person he was utterly different
and you can imagine to me as a four-and-a-half-year-old how uncanny this is Lee. He looks like Lee but he
isn't Lee. It was of course a terrible tragedy for him and for my family. For me personally it was
extremely disturbing especially for in the way that I've just described. I couldn't get my head
around the the fact that he was so changed and so in this way I was confronted I think a little
earlier than most of us are with this fact that we ourselves our subjective beings our personalities
our minds are somehow also just a bodily organ and if that organ is damaged then we're changed
and by implication what happened to my brother could have happened to me could have happened to
any one of us if our brains were damaged in the way that his was the hematoma reabsorbed but it
leaves damage and also there's these things called external shearing from the kind of injury that he
had. If this were to happen to any one of us we would not be ourselves we would be somebody else
and by further implication you know when our brains die we literally disappear.
So this is the gravity of the problem that we are that we are talking about. It wasn't obviously at
the age of four I didn't decide okay in order to solve this problem I better become a neuroscientist
but I have no doubt that those early childhood experiences are what drove me to study neuroscience
and in particular to be interested in that branch of neuroscience that we call neuro psychology
in other words how mental functions relate to brain functions. When I went to university
which was in the to study this which was in the early 1980s I was however quickly
disabused of the idea that studying neuropsychology would would provide the answers I was looking for
as to how how does it happen this thing that Davis was talking about that Chalmers was talking
about how does it happen that out of how can it possibly be that a physical organ is me
how am I produced by these by these physiological processes in in in these anatomical structures
but the this is not what I was taught what I was taught rather was how the cortex and I emphasize
here cortex because in the 1980s neuropsychology basically was the study of higher cortical functions
and neurologists study the brain stem functions there's have to do with the body
neuropsychologists study cortical functions they have to do with the mind and I was taught how
visual information is processed in this part of the cortex and some matter sensory processes here
and auditory processes there but when I asked my lecturers where does all of this information you
know where am I in in the processing of all this information where's the subject that receives
the visual and auditory and somatosensory and what not information and I was kindly advised by
my professors not to ask questions like that those are not proper scientific questions and
they're bad for your career but I wasn't studying this because I was interested in
building a career I really needed to understand how this works and so when I was taught as I'm
showing in the slide on the screen at the moment how the how visual information processing occurs
in the visual cortex you know and and and how incredibly elaborate all these different component
processes are how we go from you know the the the initial image in v1 to these various processing
streams whereby in one of them you know you recognize color and movement and and faces
and another if you're a human being you're able to recognize letters and words and read
you know all of these things and how ultimately all of these this visual information is encoded
into the hippocampus you know into into long-term memory all of these functional mechanisms were
incredibly interesting but the question the problem for me was you know visual information
processing of this kind can be done by your mobile phone and in fact what I have on the screen for
you now is is not that different from a circuit diagram you know which which describes the sorts
of information processing that your mobile phone does performs your mobile phone can recognize
faces as you might have noticed when you when you're taking a photograph in the way that it
sifts through the stored images it classifies them these are faces these are places etc exactly
the same sort of thing um as uh as I was being taught about how our brains work but the sentient
subject who receives this information the the what it is like to see uh was not a respectable
question it wasn't addressed at all around that time I read this book uh by Oliver Sacks called
a leg to stand on it was before he became so famous with his book um the man who mistook
his wife for a hat in this book a leg to stand on in 1984 he wrote neuropsychology like classical
neurology aims to be entirely objective and its great power its advances come from just this
but a living creature and especially a human being is first and last active a subject not an object
it's precisely the subject the living eye which is being excluded neuropsychology is admirable
but it excludes the psyche it excludes the experiencing active living eye so that sentence
neuropsychology is admirable but it excludes the psyche captured exactly uh my dismay and
frustration uh with my field uh such was uh how things stood uh in the 1980s and I think that
this has a great deal to do with why David Chalmers formulated the hard problem in the
way that he did I'm now going to read you a further passage from his book in which he
clarifies that this hard problem pivots on the question of function uh on the function
of uh visual experience for example uh let me read it to you the easy problems are easy
precisely because they concern the explanation of cognitive abilities and functions to explain
a cognitive function we need only specify a mechanism that can perform the function the
methods of cognitive science are well suited for this sort of explanation and so are well
suited to the easy problems of consciousness by contrast the hard problem is hard precisely
because it is not a problem about the performance of functions the problem persists even when the
performance of all the relevant functions is explained what makes the hard problem hard and
almost unique is that it goes beyond problems about the performance of functions to see this
note that even when we've explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioral functions
in the vicinity of experience they may still remain a further unanswered question why is the
performance of these functions accompanied by experience a simple explanation of the functions
leaves this question open why doesn't all this information processing go on in the dark free
of any inner field just to make clear the gravity of the problem that charmers is identifying here
i want to tell you briefly about what another philosopher said on this point this was frank
Jackson in his in his celebrated knowledge argument the the the story revolves around
a visual neuroscientist named mary and i'm going to tell the story in a simplified form in the
interests of time mary knows everything that there is to know about the functional mechanisms of vision
but she's blind so although she knows exactly how light waves are transduced by the photosensitive
rods and cones of the retina and and transmitted to the lateral geniculate body and from there
to the visual cortex and how all those processing streams that i showed you in the earlier slide
further specialized modules process that information exactly what those neurons do
exactly what the functional mechanisms of the different processing streams are
despite all of that she she knows nothing about what it is like to see and then thank god one day
the gift of sight is bestowed upon her and for the first time in her life she actually experiences
that deep blue that charmers spoke of the the actual quality of visual experience redness
blueness movement form contour and so on and jackson's point is at that moment she learned
something utterly new about vision something which was not predicted not explained at all by
her functional her understanding of the physical mechanisms whereby visual information is processed
and the point is that because those mechanisms can be absolutely understood without there being any
not only any need to understand what what visual experience is like but also no bridge there's no
doesn't predict that they will have to be visual experience and so this new thing this new
qualitative experiential thing that mary becomes acquainted with is not at all
contained within the knowledge that's why it's called the knowledge argument that she had
of the functional mechanisms of vision and the alarming conclusion that people like jackson
and nagle and charmers come to in consequence is that conscious experience the actual
something it is likeness of seeing exists in some sort of parallel universe some other dimension
some some place other than the physical universe in which causal mechanisms explain
how how one thing produces another so this is what charmers is talking about when he says
why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience why doesn't all this
information processing go on in the dark free of any inner field the information processing accounts
the mechanistic functionalist accounts of visual processing in the cortex and i'm using vision
as my model example because that's what we do in cognitive neuroscience when it comes to
trying to understand the mechanisms of consciousness that's where we've been looking
on the assumption that if we can if we can isolate the mechanism of visual consciousness
then we can generalize from there to other forms of consciousness and explain consciousness as a whole
charmers this point is that Mary who knew everything there was to know
about the functional mechanisms of visual information processing knew nothing at all
about what it is like to see this seems to be an entirely different order of things
so how how are we to make sense of this by the 1990s
John Kilstrom was able to write an article with this title it's a review of the literature
on unconscious visual and other perceptual and other cognitive
cortical mechanisms the title says it all perception without awareness of what is perceived
learning without awareness of what is learned the literature the research literature reviewed
in this paper shows in a nutshell that you can perceive visually and in other ways you can
process this sort of information without knowing that you're doing so you don't seem to have to
know that you're doing so the cortex and the brain as a whole can process visual and other perceptual
stimuli and act upon those stimuli without any awareness that they've done so
the same applies to learning you can learn things and remember things and they will influence what
you do in the future without having any knowledge that you've learned those things and that you're
remembering things all of this can go on automatically to paraphrase charmers in the dark
just to give you some sense of the kinds of evidence that Kilstrom drew upon
in writing this review article and coming to the conclusions which are sort of
alluded to in in the title in one study research participants are shown in a in the
via a paradigm called an instrument called the tachistoscope which flashes visual information
so briefly for so few milliseconds that you don't even know you've seen anything at all
let alone what you've seen in this experiment the participants were shown two faces face a
under which was written the word rapist and face b under which was written the word philanthropist
now remember they didn't know they'd seen anything at all let alone that they'd seen
a face in red a word after the tachistoscopic phase of the experiment they're then shown super
limitedly those same two photographs and asked which of the two faces they prefer which of the two
people they prefer and the the with a very high degree of statistical significance the the research
participants choose face b when asked why are you choosing this face over the other they say I don't
know because of course they don't know consciously why they're doing so they say it's just no
intuition or my gut feeling I just prefer this chap and we know why they did it they did it because
of the words that were associated with those faces and that's precisely the point that this kind of
cognitive process this higher visual cortical because let me be clear that recognizing faces is a
uniquely cortical function and indeed reading with comprehension is a uniquely human cortical
function so these sorts of functions can go on perfectly well without awareness and this is the
essence in a manner of speaking of what charm is he saying he's saying you know these these things
can go on in the dark and that begs the question that charm is asks why doesn't it do so why do we
have to be aware of these things at all and the provisional conclusion that I now want to state
is that it's because they don't visual cortical processes and all cortical processes and cognitive
processes are not intrinsically conscious as Kilstrom's review shows therefore it's no surprise
that if we have focused our research efforts on trying to understand the brain basis of consciousness
the physical mechanisms of consciousness by looking at functions which are not inherently
intrinsically conscious which can work just as well without consciousness then we're looking in
the wrong place if you remember my introductory remarks this is the red thread that's going to
run through what I'm going to say to you tonight so let's move on to my next case I told you that
when I was a student and I was taught about how these different streams of information coming from
our sensory organs and projected onto our cortex produce visual consciousness auditory
consciousness etc and I asked my professors but where am I you know where is the subject who
receives all this information by the 1990s 10 years after I asked that silly question which
was considered silly it's a naive question but many of the most naive questions are the most
important questions by the 1990s neuro psychology was asking those questions itself and the answers
that it came to was that you know visual and auditory and somatosensory information the sort
of raw phenomenal consciousness is not the main thing about subjectivity it's where it all comes
together that question that I'd asked where does it all come together and one of the main answers
was it all comes together here in the prefrontal lobes so for example bernard bars and stanislav
kahan were saying that there's a global workspace a sort of integrating of all of these different
information streams here and this is where the subject of the mind is that remember consciousness
the global workspace in the sense of not just information processing streams coming from our
sensory end organs but rather the subject of the mind that receives them so I'm going to remember
I'm just giving you an impressionistic account in this brief lecture I'm going to ask you as
scientists or people who understand science if there's a theoretical claim that this is this
part of the brain is where consciousness is generated in the sense of a subjective sentient
being of the mind then if this part of the brain is damaged then that function should be lost so
somebody who has no prefrontal cortex should have no subjectivity in the sense that we are talking
about here no no person who receives all this information and knows this is my vision I am a
sentient being the sort of agent or I the act of me that Oliver sex was talking about damage to
this part of the brain complete damage to this part of the brain should should completely remove
the thing that we are looking for so I will now briefly describe to you a patient of mine
who I'm calling patient W who due to a complex pathology basically a subarachnoid hemorrhage
in the anterior communicating artery which needed to be operated on and the operation didn't go that
well and then there was sepsis and then it wasn't recognized early enough etc etc basically
after a series of operations he ended up like this with absolutely no prefrontal nerves so
there's the prefrontal nerves he doesn't have any here you see it again but fortunately he
has a little sliver of cortex here language cortex which enables him to describe his experience
so I explained to patient W that according to my colleagues he should lack a self he should
like this overarching sense of sentient being receiving this perceptual information and knowing
it's me who's seeing these things that me should be missing I asked him is missing he said no not
at all so I said well then bear with me I'm gonna ask you a series of questions whereby I can illustrate
demonstrate to my colleagues that they're wrong I said to him are you consciously aware of your
thoughts he said yes of course I am I said in order to confirm that I'm going to ask you to
solve a problem that will require you to consciously picture a situation in your mind he says okay
I say imagine that you have two dogs and one chicken he says okay I said do you see them in
your mind's eye he says yes so I say now tell me how many legs do you see in turtle you get the
point that if he's there looking at this visual information that he's conjured up in his mind's
eye he should be able to count two dogs four plus four one chicken two totals 10 and that would show
that there's somebody there looking at the visual information so I you can imagine my disappointment
when I say to him now tell me how many legs do you see in total and he said eight and I said eight
and then he said yes the dogs at the chicken now that's not the best joke in the world but it shows
that there's somebody at home there's Mr. W was there thinking looking at this information
and and and even been able to take this additional humorous step of imagining that the dogs had at
the chicken so the idea that as the sentient being of the mind resides in the prefrontal cortex
I don't believe it and of course it's not based only on this case I'm using that to illustrate
a point the other major theory in cognitive neuroscience as to where the subject of the mind
exists in the cortex is associated with the name of bud craig and he identifies the insular
as the critical part of the cortex and the insular is not like the prefrontal cortex where
all the different information processing streams converge from your various senses
leading to your capacity to make decisions about what are you going to do about it but rather it's
where the visceral internal information from the vegetative body is transmitted to the cortex
and integrated with this extraceptive information so very very mainstream theory that this is where
the self resides in the cortex so let's see what happens if this part of the cortex is damaged
as it was in this patient patient b a patient of demasias like I did with my patient w demasio
interviews his patient and asks him if he has a self because the prediction arising from craig's
theory is that he should lack such a thing demasias says do you have this this is a dialogue a
conversation which hasn't been published but an article on this case has been published do you
have a sense of self says demasio patient says yes I do what if I told you that you weren't here
right now patient says I'd say you've gone blind and deaf demasias says do you think that other
people can control your thoughts he says no so why do you think that's not possible he says you
control your own mind hopefully demasias so what if I were to tell you that your mind was the mind
of somebody else patient says when was the transplant I mean the brain transplant demasio
what if I were to tell you that I know you better than you know yourself
patient says I would think you're wrong demasias says what if I were to tell you that you're aware
that I'm aware he says I would say you're right demasio you're aware that I'm aware patient I'm
aware that you're aware that I'm aware please note all these references to I this is the very thing
that's supposed to be missing in such patients so clearly the sentient being of the mind is neither
in the prefrontal cortex nor in the insular cortex but these patients have some cortex left
what about a patient who has absolutely no cortex what if the cortex as a whole were to be removed
surely this would remove the the the the the sentient subjectivity that we are seeking to explain
with our cortical theory of consciousness well here's a patient three years old this one
with absolutely no cortex this is a condition called hydranencephaly where the patient is born
with a brain stem and a cerebellum which hangs off the back of the brain stem but no forebrain at all
is she conscious yes she is here she is she's awake she goes to sleep at night she wakes up in the
morning clearly she's conscious but much more importantly look at this this is her reaction
to her baby brother being placed on her lap she responds emotionally to this experience
so it's not only that she's awake it's not some sort of blank wakefulness but a reactive mind
with feelings and content it's not it cannot possibly be representational cognition of the
kind that the cortex performs because she doesn't have any cortex she has only a brain stem and
yet she's conscious and her consciousness has a particular quality and it doesn't have anything
to do with what's streaming in from the outside consciously because remember the brain stem
only processes sensory information unconsciously this has got to do with her subjective response
to that information even though she has no cognitive clue what that information is is actually
about it's a pure raw feeling and it's not just her most of these kids are like that she has another
patient tell tell me this patient isn't conscious and that there's nobody home
beyond maca wrote a review article about these patients who he studied a great many of them
and i'm not going to read you this long quotation but you can see the words that i've
that i've emphasized in yellow they have a wide range of emotions and most importantly of all
those emotional responses are situationally appropriate in other words the patient shows
laughter or irritability or fear in response to stimuli which which which would evoke those
same sort of feelings in you and me so this is a weighty piece of evidence that the cortical theory
is wrong the parts of the cortex that are supposed to be the the centers for consciousness the integrative
centers where a sentient self comes about even just this the little smatterings of evidence
that i've given you this evening show that this is that this is not the case and even in patients
in whom there is absolutely no cortex there's evidence that there is consciousness consciousness
not of the cognitive kind that we've been focusing on in our attempts to solve the hard problem but
rather consciousness of a far more rudimentary kind basic raw feelings of the type that you saw
these two little girls and other children like them with the same condition and able to express
but of course you know how do we know how do we know that that what what it's like to be such a
is there anything that's like to be such a child these are just behaviors we can't be sure what what
what they're experiencing but let's just let's just slow down although i'm anxious about the time
i keep on looking to my left which is where my clock is and i see that i'm that i must speed up
but but let's let's just make sure that i'm conveying this really essential point you can
remove the cortex the supposed seat of consciousness in its entirety and i say remove of course in
these children it's not removed experimentally in experimental animals it is removed and we find
exactly the same thing they are conscious they they're awake and they display a full range of
emotional and situationally appropriate emotional responses by contrast with that lesion evidence
now we look at the brainstem if there's damage in these structures these these tiny structures in
the primitive brainstem called the reticular activating system then the lights go out so the
lights do not go out if there's no cortex but if if if there's tiny lesions in the reticular
activating system of the brainstem as small as two cubic millimeters fissure and colleagues
recently published a article in which they studied numerous patients with brainstem strokes
and showed that a two cubic millimeter lesion in the peri-brakeal region is all that's required
to totally obliterate consciousness so what that shows is that cortical consciousness is dependent
upon brainstem consciousness what what's generated here in the reticular activating system is a
prerequisite for cortical consciousness and what is more remember that cortical consciousness is not
always present in other words the cortex is able to process information without consciousness
so what makes it conscious is activation by this reticular activating system now that's not
controversial what i've just said to you we're i'm making the argument we're looking in the wrong
place uh you know this is not intrinsically conscious this is the foundation of consciousness
why don't we look there um and i've showed you in those hydranincepallic girls uh that uh the
people who only have a brainstem have consciousness of a particular type and that is affective
consciousness uh so is this not this intrinsic prerequisite for all of the other forms of
consciousness there isn't this not the place that we should be looking if we're trying to find out
what the functional mechanism of consciousness is so let me now go to my case five and the
reason i'm doing this is because i'm very much aware that in the case of these kids with no cortex
you can't be sure that they have consciousness because they can't speak the one function which
certainly is cortical is language and my patient w was able to describe his mental states because
he had this sliver of frontal cortex which which enables us to produce language those children
didn't so we don't know they can't tell us what they're experiencing just like our pet dogs and
cats can't tell us what they're experiencing we we sense that they're conscious they respond
emotionally we have relationships with them but we can't know for sure so in science in such a
situation what we have to do is rely upon multiple lines of converging evidence we have to make
predictions uh on the hypothesis that the brainstem produces consciousness on the lesion studies
suggest that that's where the consciousness comes from and i'm saying it is a consciousness of a
particular type it's feeling it's affective consciousness then using another method for
example deep brain stimulation if we stimulate those structures those deep brainstem structures
in patients who do have intact cortex and can't tell us what they experience we might predict
that they would experience intense affects and that's exactly what happens if you stimulate the
substantia nigra which is which is a midbrain part of the reticular activating system this is
what happens in a patient um 65 year old patient with Parkinson's disease that's why the stimulator
was put into her brain but a patient who'd never had any psychiatric pathology in her life within
five seconds of the stimulator being switched on it had actually gone deeper than the intended site
the intended site was not in the brainstem it went a few millimeters too deep into the
reticular activating nucleus that i mentioned and she within five seconds she falls into a
depression i'm falling down in my head i no longer wish to live to see anything hear anything feel
anything when asked if she's in pain she says no i'm fed up with life i've had enough i don't
want to live anymore i'm disgusted with life everything is useless always feeling worthless
i'm scared in this world please notice i don't want to live anymore a suicidal depression
when asked why she's so sad she says i'm tired i want to hide in a corner i'm crying over myself
of course i'm hopeless why am i bothering you after the stimulation within 90 seconds the
depression disappears the patient very bravely or generously agreed to do a double blind trial
off to that uh we're blanched at stimulated either in the higher structure that he had aimed for
or in the reticulate structure that he had struck accidentally and without the patient knowing where
he was stimulating and every time that he stimulated in the in the reticulate nucleus
she fell into this deep despair so this is a second line of evidence you can actually stimulate
intense emotions by stimulating those deep brain stem structures here's a third line of evidence
functional imaging pet imaging in this case these are normal subjects with intense emotional states
they are feeling intensely sad angry happy or fearful the the pet imaging shows where in the
brain the the the activity is that's generating this mental state and in all of these cases it's
in the brain stem sadness anger happiness fear look at what's going on in the cortex next to nothing
so it's absolutely clear by this method too that the effects are generated in the brain stem
one last line of evidence is psychopharmacology
psychiatrists tinker with the neuromodulatory chemicals that are sourced in these very same
brain stem nuclei so antidepressants increase serotonin which is sourced in the rave nuclei
of the reticular activating system antipsychotics block dopamine which is sourced in the ventral
tegmental area of the reticular activating system some anti-anxiety drugs block noradrenaline which
is sourced in the locus ceruleus complex of the reticular activating system if all that this
system did was woke you up or sort of produced a sort of background level of consciousness
which is the standard view of what this part of the brain is doing this is why when you lesionate
you go into a coma then anesthetists might be interested in these brain structures and these
and these brain chemicals but no psychiatrists are psychiatrists doctors for feelings
treating emotional disorders the clearly these these these these neuromodulator
modulator sourced in the reticular activating system have have something fundamental to do
with feeling so let me just sum up i'm going to tell you about another one of these neuromodulators
in a few minutes if i if i get that far but let me just sum up what i'm saying i'm saying that
it's that the evidence is very strong that the source of consciousness remember the subtitle
of my book is this hidden spring deep in in the reticular brain stem or structures which
are prerequisite for consciousness to occur think of the the forebrain or the cortex as a
sort of a television set and think of this as the power supply the standard view is well of course
you know consciousness happens in the cortex like television program transmission happens
in the television set it has to have a power supply it has to be plugged in at the wall but
that doesn't mean that the source of television is the power supply but as you've just seen if you
tinker with this power supply you change the program you change the actual television content it's
not just a power supply it is literally the the the the font of consciousness and because it's
prerequisite for these cortical forms of consciousness you the the cortex isn't conscious unless it's
aroused by the brain stem and because i've as i've showed you the brain stem is generating
not some power supply but rather consciousness with a particular content and quality a particular
feel a particular something that it is likeness that means the foundational elemental basic form
of consciousness is feeling and feeling is prerequisite for all other forms of consciousness
sigman freud the discoverer of the unconscious even freud who was the person it taught us
that the bulk of our cognition is unconscious what we rediscovered a hundred years later
in cognitive science that the bulk of our cognition is unconscious even he said it's
surely of the essence of an emotion that we should be aware of it that it should become known to
consciousness thus the possibility of the attribute of unconsciousness would be completely excluded
as far as emotions feelings and effects are concerned now i've emphasized the word feelings
because the words affect an emotion mean different things to different people some people claim you
can have unconscious emotions they don't agree with freud so i want to be clear that i'm talking about
this thing feeling you cannot have a feeling that you do not feel and this is not just a linguistic
point you know as i've just showed you the brain stem mechanisms that generate raw feeling they
generate consciousness itself but i say again this this thing that i'm calling feeling cannot
be other than felt if you don't feel it it isn't a feeling and what i'm saying therefore is that
unlike cortex the processes of which the information processing of which is not intrinsically conscious
shouldn't we be looking to the brain stem the the the processes of which are intrinsically
conscious in fact are the source of all consciousness if you want to understand the function of consciousness
then surely we need to understand the function of feeling david charmers one more time
uh he says um this is not to say that experience has no function perhaps it'll turn out to play
an important cognitive role etc and he ends up saying there's no cognitive function such that
we can say in advance that explanation of that function will automatically explain experience
this is you can see a reiteration of what i said to you earlier but please note it's the word cognitive
if you change the word cognitive to affect it does it does his i mean would he even
even have said this there is no affective function such that we can say in advance that explanation
of that function will automatically explain experience i'm saying in advance that an explanation
of the function of feeling will automatically explain why it feels like something because
that is the function of feeling i hope you can see why this is an important red thread
in the argument of my book if we're wanting to understand consciousness we should be focusing
on its most basic form the form which is intrinsically conscious that is to say feeling
because feeling has to be felt unlike vision unlike hearing unlike memory unlike all forms
of cognition for the most part they're unconscious but feelings are always conscious and they are
prerequisite for the higher forms of consciousness so if we understand the function of feeling
then we understand the function of consciousness that's where we should be looking i say again
then there is every possibility that if if you can explain the function of feeling then you'll
know why you feel it so what is the function of feeling well it's an extended form of homeostasis
homeostasis as many of you might know is the basic mechanism that keeps us alive living
organisms unlike unlike inorganic matter don't they don't dissipate they don't just you know if
if the ambient temperature is is 10 degrees then we just sort of become 10 degrees ourselves if we
did we would die so we can't dissipate we can't equalize with our environments we can't allow
ourselves to obey the second law of thermodynamics which states that in any natural process entropy
will always increase homeostasis resists entropy we say no i can't equalize i have to maintain a
particular temperature range i have to stay between 36 and a half and 37 and a half degrees
Celsius and if i deviate from that it's a problem it's a demand for work and i have to perform work
to get myself back into the temperature range that is viable for for life and i speak here of
temperature range this applies across a wide range of physiological parameters so you have you know
blood glucose levels blood oxygen levels hydration levels sodium levels etc that you
have to remain within otherwise you die and you note the word prediction here that there are
algorithms built into our brains which say you know if you're getting too hot that's a problem so you
got to do something and what must you do the algorithm says well sweat that'll cool you down
pant that'll cool you down that's the work that you have to do to get yourself back into your
viable range so that's how homeostasis works and i said feeling is an extended form of homeostasis
and that extended form is that when you deviate from your expected states from your viable states
it feels bad the value system that underpins all life is that it is bad to die and good to survive
so if you're moving in the direction of death of a physiological state which is
which is incompatible with life it feels bad that is the function of unpleasant it's it that is the
meaning of unpleasant feelings it means this is bad for me and conversely performing the work
that gets you back into your viable state feels pleasurable and this is how you know that you're
heading in the right direction why is this important i told you that you have to have predictions here
algorithms built into the system that tell the system what to do you know demand for work i
know what i got to do got a pant got a perspire that's the work gets me back to my required
temperature range but the enormous adaptive advantage provided by feeling is that if you are
in a situation for which you do not have a predetermined prediction for which there is not a
phenotypic algorithm built into your brain then the feeling tells you here and now
whether you're heading in the right direction or wrong let me take let me give you an example
you're you're in a you're in a respiratory control is an automatic process you don't need to be aware
of of of your need for oxygen in order to breathe it just happens automatically but if you're in a
building that's on fire and carbon dioxide is filling the air then suddenly respiratory control
becomes conscious and you feel this demand for work in the form of an acutely unpleasant state of
mind called air hunger or suffocation along now you're in a situation you've never been in before
you can't possibly predict you've never been in the burning building let alone this particular one
and you can't possibly predict what to do so that's a state of uncertainty with with with no
predetermined predictions and the way in which you solve that problem is to feel your way through it
so if i go this way and my air hunger gets worse that's bad it feels bad that means it's bad
if i go the other way and my air hunger reduces that's good that means i must go that way so the
oxygenation in the air is felt without there being any pre-ordained solution to this particular
problem you feel your way through it so feeling tells you how you're doing within this basic
biological frame of values scale of values which is that it's it's good to survive and bad to die
and you feel what is increasing and decreasing your chances your probabilistic chances of surviving
by feeling the feelings so that enables you to make choices and this too i cannot emphasize enough
choices have to be grounded in a value system something has to be better and something has to
be worse otherwise you have no basis for making a choice and feelings provide the value system
which enables choice in unpredictable novel situations so you decide which way to go on the
basis of what feels good and what feels bad without any cognitive knowledge as to you know
that drives the cognition and and and you feel your way into your cognition so that what you're
perceiving and what you're thinking flavored colored driven by the feeling that determines
which which choices you make that is the function of feeling that is what feeling adds to basic
automatized hominostasis now i've just identified one of the two most essential properties of
apet that is valence it feels good or it feels bad but i must add that it also has a categorical
quality each affect feels so so air hunger feels different from sleepiness feels different from
the need to urinate feels different from fear feels different from separation distress feels
different from thirst each of these has a flavor categorical quality of their own because you need
to know what need is not is being met or not being met so the color coding or flavoring the
qualification of these different affective needs is is why consciousness has quality
so consciousness in its basic form is inherently evaluative and it's inherently qualitative
and it does something what does it do it enables you to survive in unpredicted situations
which is an enormous adaptive advantage over creatures who do not have this capacity so
we're coming i i i notice i i really have to end earlier than i would have liked but
we're coming to the crux of the matter which is that this is the function of feeling so remember
the question i was i was asking why and how is there something it's like to be an organism
something it's like for an organism well affect feeling explains why it's something
why it has to feel like something the feeling the quality of it and the category of it
is its very essence it's what it does is to bring to the awareness of the organism for the organism
how it's doing in terms of its literal potential to exist to continue existing its most basic
design principle the design principle that homeostasis embodies and this extended form of
homeostasis bringing to the level of awareness by the organism of its state as it's navigating
uncertain environments is the function of consciousness in its most basic form and going
back to charmes's claim that if you explain the function it doesn't explain why it feels like
something i'm saying that doesn't apply in the case of affect and affect is generated in the
brainstem which is the source of all consciousness all consciousness is contingent or dependent upon
brainstem consciousness now i'm going to end here so that there's time for questions i just want to
let you know that in my book i then go on based on work i did with colfriston to explain
how that mechanism works mechanistically homeostasis is not complicated it can be reduced to laws
and if affect feeling is an extended form of homeostasis it too can be reduced to laws
and and and these these laws are are explicated in the book and it explains how feeling governs
how how voluntary action and and learning from experience works in the brain i was going to
tell you this one lost case but i i don't have time so i'll just flick through and tell you
read my book please it's this is a complicated topic i can't i can't
begin to do it justice in a short talk like this
so why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience why doesn't all this
information processing go on in the dark free of any inner feel i hope you can see why i believe
that when it comes to feelings uh the the the they can't go on in the dark they can't go on
without any inner feel they're very function they're very causal contribution within the
physical economy bodily economy of the living organism um is to feel uh and and and and the
feeling is what has the the the the functional causal consequences that charmers felt was so
badly missing when it comes to perception and cognition although he didn't realize
that his argument applied only to perception and cognition i am sorry i've had to rush at the end
and i want to remind you in for that reason that i said at the beginning only that i was
going to give you a clue please read my book the hidden spring out today in britain and
in a couple of weeks in america thank you very much i look forward to your questions
you
