0	14560	So, hi everybody, as a guy gentleman just said, I'm the CEO of a consulting company
14560	19520	in London called Deep Learning Partnership and I'm going to talk to you today about
19520	24880	something I don't really do on my day-to-day job, it doesn't pay my rent, but it affords
24880	34800	me nice trips to exotic places. So, who here has heard of artificial general intelligence?
35840	43520	Yeah, so quite a few. And so, what we label today is AI, isn't really AI, it's matrix
43520	48240	multiplication. So, I'm going to talk to you today about how we might actually get to AGI
49120	54320	and it's more of a neuroscience based approach. It's how the brain works, it's how biology does it.
55040	59840	So, it's okay, everything that we've heard the speakers talk about so far,
61760	66160	which has been labeled AI, it's really deep learning or artificial neural networks
66160	71520	and the early creators of that said this is nothing to do with how the brain works, right?
71520	77600	It's just it kind of works to classify cats and dogs and that's about it. We do a lot more than
77600	83920	that. So, how do we get there? Is it even possible to build an artificial brain basically
83920	89840	how biology does it? And I'm here to tell you, yes it is, I'll just give it away,
90480	96320	you can go now, but if you're interested, I'll walk you through how that might look and how that
96320	102720	might be done. Okay, so here's a little book I wrote for Riley, it's a booklet. There's my
102720	108160	company website, there's my Twitter handle, you can follow me, I tweet a little bit about AGI and
108240	114320	sometimes quantum computing, my other hobby or interest. So, this is what we're going to
114320	120560	outline just briefly. We're going to look at physical systems, how biology does intelligence,
120560	127280	and where we are with the non-biological, I've kind of just explained that in a broad sense,
127280	134880	but we'll look at some of the, well, we'll go through the slides, deep learning recap and then
134880	141520	we'll look at how we might build AGI and some of the theories and in particular one called
141520	149760	active inference that I find particularly compelling to how the brain might work. Okay, so at that
149760	154560	point it's sort of theoretical neuroscience, so I hope I don't lose you. I try to keep this kind of
154560	159760	high level and not too much code or anything, although there is code and math for this stuff.
160400	168080	And then we'll wrap it up by saying is it possible, how long might it take? Okay, so why do we even
168080	176640	want to build AGI? Why don't we just stop here with the cats and dogs and TensorFlow? Well,
176640	181680	if we do, like DeepMind says, if we can solve intelligence and we can use it to solve everything
181680	187040	else. I mean, we're quite good at stuff, we've got here today, we've had Einstein's theory of
187040	194160	relativity, we've had quantum physics, we've had classical physics, Newton, all the big names,
194160	200880	why do we need any help? Well, clearly if we do manage to figure this out and build an artificially
200880	208160	general intelligent system, then we can accelerate progress, which is probably, we can all agree,
208160	214400	is a good thing. Although some people like Elon must say that, let's not build it because it will
214400	224560	straight away kill us all, right? Well, we don't know, but I don't think it will. Okay, so I'm
224560	230800	the anti-Elon Musk, okay? I'm the opposite. Okay, so I'm an optimist, he's a pessimist.
231440	237040	So he's a good entrepreneur anyway. So what about all of these things here? AlphaGo,
238000	245680	this is DeepMind in London, I'm sure we all saw on TV, AlphaGo beating the best go player in the
245680	256720	world, was that AI, was that AGI? AlphaStar, it's a new project to beat the world's best video game
256720	261920	players, a little bit more general one might argue than just playing a board game. DeepBlue,
261920	267680	IBM's DeepBlue and Chess, Landmark, and IBM Watson, that's actually natural language processing,
267680	272800	so that's quite clever, that's quite getting a little closer to AGI maybe, because it's having
272800	278160	to understand language, but was it just doing it statistically? Was it just a massive computer
279120	285680	hardware system that could crunch numbers really well and just do everything statistically? Is
285760	293200	it how we learn language and understand language? I would argue no. So actually, all of those are
293200	299920	just narrow AI, they're just statistical mathematical analysis of big data sets, okay? So it's not really
299920	307120	how the brain does anything. If it were, I mean we do all of that in that little three pound thing
307120	312880	above our sitting, above our shoulders, right? We don't need huge data centers, so clearly biology
312880	318480	is doing it in a slightly different way, okay? So how is it doing it and how is it different?
319200	323600	So first of all, to build something, we have to understand what we're building. What is
323600	328960	intelligence, general intelligence? Well, it's all these things, right? So we don't just classify
328960	335840	things, we do all of that. I won't read them out, because I've only got 30 minutes and sometimes
335840	340640	I give this talk, it's an hour, but there's basically nine types of intelligence there,
341360	346480	maybe even 10. And this guy at Harvard, Howard Gardner, just mapped it all out. See,
347040	356320	existential thinking language, we can do math using ANNs, but the rest of it is pretty much
356320	363360	music, creating art, spatial navigation, that's all. We can do all of that in three pound. We
363360	369200	don't need a huge data center, hardware cluster of GPUs. So what's different? What are we missing?
369280	374400	Okay. Well, first of all, how far have we come? Like I said, the mathematical part,
374400	378240	we're like 50%, we're pretty good, we're not bad, we're about halfway there, linguistic,
378240	385120	but it's only statistical analysis. Spatial navigation, self-driving cars, robots who can
385120	392480	navigate through systems. I'd say we're about something called SLAM. I'd say we're about 50%
392480	401440	there, that's the algorithm, simultaneous mapping and I forgot what the LAM stands for,
401440	411040	but don't worry. We're about 50% there. You've probably seen simultaneous localization and mapping.
411040	416560	You've probably seen the Atlas, you know, robot that do flips and run around outside and do good
416640	424880	stuff, busts and dynamics. So that's why I'm giving it a generous 50%. We do a lot more than that.
424880	430960	We can do gymnastics, we can run around, we learn stuff very quickly, we don't need millions of
430960	436400	datasets to train, but as we go through that list of nine types of intelligence, it gets really,
436400	444560	it just gets worse, right? Robots understanding each other or even algorithms running on a
444560	450160	computer virtual sort of intelligence. Intrapersonal understanding themselves and existential,
450960	456560	you know, show me an algorithm or a robot that kind of questions why it's there,
456560	462000	or even understands that it exists, it's kind of zero. So we haven't figured that intelligence
462000	470720	out at all. So the brain is pretty special, right? Biology is kind of special. We could argue chimpanzees,
470720	476720	self-aware, well, yes, right, a dog, cats, probably. And as you go, you know, snails,
476720	483440	maybe not, you know, bacteria, no. So there's clearly a continuum in what makes us a little
483440	488800	different is our neocortex, that sort of outer layer of the brain. So we kind of have to figure
488800	493200	out how that works, basically. But we've got all this other stuff in the brain like the amygdala
493200	498400	for emotional intelligence, you know, the reptilian brain and there's sort of layers, you can trace it.
498400	503200	In fact, you know, as babies are born and embryos develop over the nine months,
504640	508880	you can see, you know, evolution, it starts off, you know, with the, you know,
508880	516720	reptilian brain and it goes out monkey and then, you know, humans as we develop in the womb. So,
516720	522160	you know, it's all, all of that evolution is still captured, all that information is actually
522160	528960	captured by biology. It's just that last layer of the neocortex that makes us be able to come up
528960	535280	with, you know, science, special theory, relativity, whatever, you know, that, that. So what are we
535280	542960	missing? Why can't we do that yet in TensorFlow? Okay, why can't Google or DeepMind do that yet?
542960	548320	So how will we get there? Well, it takes a village to create a child and I'm going to argue it takes,
548320	551920	it's going to take a big community to create AGI. We're going to need computer scientists,
552800	556560	physicists to understand the physics of the brain, neuroscientists, clearly,
557600	562800	and also psychologists. So what I'm seeing really at the moment where these teams trying to build
563440	567840	AGI or AI are just computer scientists, you know, just computer scientists, you know,
567840	572560	you're clever people, they have PhDs and computer science, which involves a lot of math and
572560	578000	understanding hardware and algorithm, algorithmic complexity. But it's not really
578000	584240	understanding how much about biology at all. Okay, so we're going to need a whole bunch of people.
584800	589920	And so I'll speed up a little bit now. I've kind of laid the foundations for what we might need.
590720	596960	So this is basically what we've got in hardware. So this is how biology does it in hardware. So,
596960	603520	you know, like I mentioned, we have a continuum from bacteria. That's a simple, C elegance is the
603520	609760	simplest biological system with a central nervous system, it has, I think, about 300 neurons, then
609760	614880	the bumblebee, the humble bumblebee with about a million, a few million neurons, and then us with
614880	623200	about 80 billion or 100 billion neurons. Okay, so what, you know, what basically, maybe if we
623200	628160	start at the simple, the C elegance and then build a bumblebee, then maybe one day, you know, we'll
628160	635120	get to us. That's one sort of thought. The other, the other observation really is that nature is
635120	641280	very hierarchical. You know, we built neurons, built of, they're not magic, you know, the built
641280	647280	of atoms, molecules. And then if we just go up the different layers, we have synapses, neurons,
647280	653600	and collection of neurons as connectome. So these 80 billion neurons are organized into some kind of
653680	660000	structure. Maybe, you know, we should start there. So the question here is, you know, what level do
660000	665760	we start at? Do we have to start at molecules or can we start at neurons or should we start a little
665760	672080	more holistically at the connectome? You know, and on and on up until the central nervous system,
672080	678400	us, which is about a meter in dimensions. So we're going from 10 to the minus 10 up to a meter.
678400	682960	So it's a hard problem. It's kind of no wonder we haven't solved it yet. There's a lot of physics
682960	690640	in there. And so that's what it looks like. This is how nature has done it. It's complicated,
690640	696480	isn't it? You know, I mean, do we need all that little tiny microstructure? Probably not, I might
696480	703840	argue. So you know, this is how, you know, what do we for in a half billion years of evolution
703840	710880	on the earth, maybe a billion since the first sort of organisms, bacteria, whatever, the first,
710880	716400	you know, primitive life. So over that billion year, this is what this is what nature's ended
716400	722480	up with, right? This is what makes us intelligent, these things, right? You couldn't guess that.
722480	727520	You start with a blank piece of paper, but this is just the universe we live in, the laws of physics.
727520	733040	This is this is how we work. Okay. So there's no magic, but there's certainly a lot of
733040	739440	complication. It's a complicated looking thing. That's a neuron. Okay. And so the next level of
739440	744000	the hierarchy, we see that these neurons are kind of organized into some kind of structure
744000	751120	called cortical columns, which each have about two, two million neurons. So maybe this is a
751120	756160	good level to start. Maybe we don't have to go right down to all that complicated structure,
756160	760960	maybe here. So that's kind of an interesting thing that we know. And then up onto the connectome,
761600	765840	and then the central nervous system. If we want to build a robot, we need that those flips,
765840	770240	we'll probably need all of that connected to the brain at the top. Okay. So
770880	776400	and then we have societies where we're organized into societies. Bees are, you know,
776400	782480	in their swarms and humans in their villages, towns, cities, countries, and then the global
782480	788080	national community. So there's all these layers of hierarchy, which are intelligent, right? So,
788080	793760	you know, we have this kind of macro meta intelligence built into communities and systems
793760	798640	of communities, which has enabled us to, you know, survive reproduced into the next generation.
800080	805200	So, okay. So that's biology. That's how it works. That's how it does it. That's what we know,
805200	808000	plus a whole lot of other details, which I haven't really covered.
810160	817040	So what have we done? How far are we along the line with hardware? So basically, the talks
817040	824240	that we'll see here, you know, talking about CPUs, HGO, GPUs, that's what they use, sparkling water
824240	831600	all runs on these things. There's a new sort of endeavor to build ASICs, which are specialized
831600	837680	for deep learning. But again, it's just narrow AIS, it's matrix multiplication. But is it grok
837680	844480	and cerebrus, graph core, Intel, Nirvana, they're all coming out with these amazing things that
844480	850800	can do, you know, petaflops operations, which is more than the brain does. It's actually more
850800	856000	than biology does. But all they're doing is multiplying matrices, right? They're incredible
856000	860800	feats of micro engineering, incredible. These fabs cost, you know, billions of dollars to build.
861600	867760	They've already, you know, graph core just raised $200 million. And they're impressive things,
867760	875120	right? And that's what I look like that CPU GPU. There's a Google TPU, which is an ASIC,
875120	879920	and runs in their data centers, you can hire them, run them in the cloud. And then there's the graph
879920	885520	core IPU. And they all look the same, but you know, the micro architecture is a little different.
886240	891920	So that, you know, this is all digital classical. If you do a computer science, you'd understand,
891920	897360	you know, the details of how bits move around in there, how much energy it takes, how the memory
897360	905680	in the processor, you know, interact together. But they're not intelligent, right? They're just
905680	912800	very good mathematical processors. Okay, that's what a hundred petaflops looks like. And you can,
912800	918160	you know, log in today to these things. The Google data center, this is the most powerful,
918160	922720	you know, three exaflops, we're going to say that that's 1000 million, almost a million times more
922720	926640	powerful than the brain. But it says dumb as a brick, it's the sun, it's incredibly impressive
926720	933440	engineering, it takes up a football field, it's a data center size, but you can't do much except
933440	936880	for model plane numbers together, it's not intelligent. Okay, so clearly we're heading
936880	942880	into a dead end, if we just follow that computer science classical digital hardware route.
943680	948480	See the brain does all of that and all the other types of intelligence in that little three pound
949040	955600	mass. So clearly, it's not just about speed of compute, right? It's not just about horsepower.
955600	963440	So what is it about? Okay, so recently, some of you, who's heard of neuromorphic computing?
963440	969520	Who's heard of that? Yeah, maybe a few, right? A couple. So there's a project called Spinnaker
969520	977920	in the UK. There's, there's IBM True North, Intel, the OHE. There's, you know, a few different
977920	987040	projects that are trying to do mimic how biology in hardware, you know, does, does computation.
987040	995200	Okay, it's called neuromorphic computing. So it's based on the brain. And so there's Steve Furber,
995200	1003600	he's one of the guys who come up, invented, founded the ARM computer processor company.
1003600	1011760	And so he, 20 years ago, left ARM and started on this neuromorphic journey. He's based at
1011760	1019120	University of Manchester. And recently, the human brain project has folded. It's called Spinnaker
1019120	1025440	into itself because it's biopausable hardware. So they have lots of nice funding now, again,
1025440	1030960	as IBM True North and Intel. I mean, these companies have a lot of money too. So that's
1030960	1038000	what it looks like. So there's five racks there. That is about as powerful as the brain of a mouse.
1038960	1044320	So it's not human level yet, but it can do things that can go through a maze, it can solve Sudoku
1044320	1048240	and stuff like that, just like we do. So it's kind of getting there. And I would argue, you know,
1048240	1055760	to build intelligence, rather than just simulating it on classical digital hardware, this is a more
1055760	1061920	intelligent route to take. Okay. So, and there's a little bit of detail. So this is an important,
1061920	1068560	you know, technology and a new path that not many have heard of here, you know, which is very
1068560	1073680	interesting. It's probably like we were in the 50s with digital computing. You know, there's just a
1073680	1079440	few main frames in the world right now, a few of these devices, but they actually exist. And you
1079440	1083840	can actually log into Spinnaker. It's part of the human brain project. You can create an account,
1083840	1089760	log in and watch it do stuff in real time. So they're not these magical, mystical things in a
1089760	1099440	lab. They're kind of getting in real. And let's see. So that's okay. That's another initiative
1099440	1103920	from Heidelberg, the brain scales project, which is also part of the human brain project.
1103920	1110080	So the one on the left, I would argue, will get us to general intelligence. The one on the right,
1110080	1115040	no matter how impressive that looks, won't. Okay. So, and then there's quantum computing,
1115040	1120000	how about it? Is the brain quantum? No, it's warm, it's squidgy, nothing to do with quantum
1120720	1128720	at all. Okay. Although birds navigate and plants photosynthesize using quantum processes,
1128720	1135200	but it's not really generally how we do it. Okay. But the pictures look really nice. I decided
1135200	1139760	to include a couple and it is what a quantum circuit looks like. I also quite like quantum
1139760	1145200	computing because I have a physical background, but it's probably we don't need to worry about that
1145920	1151040	if we're building AGI. It might help some of the computations initially, but ultimately we're not
1151040	1157280	a quantum computer up here. It's a neuromorphic computer. Okay. So that's the sort of four different
1157280	1162320	types of hardware. And I'd argue the one on the top right, neuromorphic will get us there. And
1162320	1166960	that's how they look in a little bit more detail. And so, you know, it's not magic. It's just really
1166960	1171840	hard engineering, which is why we haven't built it yet. It's just hard. Okay. It's small. It's,
1171840	1176960	you know, and to understand it's difficult. Do we have a mathematical theory of the brain? Well,
1176960	1183680	I would argue sort of before I go there. So the data center of the future right now is just full
1183680	1191280	of those very clever chips we saw the graph core, the, you know, TPU GPU CPUs, very, you know,
1191360	1196000	amazing engineering, but soon we'll see them being filled up with neuromorphic and quantum as well.
1196000	1202800	So Google announced quantum supremacy last week, a couple of weeks ago, which means that a quantum
1202800	1208640	computer, it can do something faster than the biggest classical computer. So the data center
1208640	1213760	of future will look like this. Okay. So we're interesting. We're entering a very interesting
1213760	1218480	time in human history, I think, in terms of computation, because we haven't just got classical
1218480	1223520	computing, we have neuromorphic and quantum as well coming online. It's been 80 years, right,
1223520	1229280	since we first started doing a computation. So at a very interesting time, I think in
1229280	1234240	the history of computation with these other two major types of computation coming online.
1235520	1240640	So deep learning, I've argued that won't get us anywhere near intelligence. It will classify
1240640	1244880	stuff really well and do a little bit of statistical language processing, but it doesn't
1244880	1251280	do the nine types of intelligence. Okay. And so the most popular framework by far as TensorFlow,
1251280	1260160	PyTorch is kind of also increasing in the last little while, but you know,
1261520	1266960	general intelligence, how biology does it, it doesn't do matrix multiplication. So deep learning
1266960	1274320	is not AGI. So we won't talk about that, but we will talk about more neuroscience stuff. Okay.
1274960	1280160	Sorry to be so harsh, but you know, it's reality. All that clever stuff isn't actually AGI, but
1280160	1287600	it's good at certain things. Okay. So what do we do? I mean, where do we even start, right,
1288480	1292560	with the general theory of intelligence? Well, you know, the brain is a physical system, right?
1292560	1298400	It's just three pounds of physics, just, okay. So what do we know about physics? Well, we've
1298400	1303920	pretty much discovered all of the laws of physics. I think dark matter is kind of a new one. It's a
1303920	1310080	bit of a bold statement. I'm a physicist. I'm allowed to say that. So what are, I mean, what
1310080	1317360	out of there do we use? Okay. You know, probably thermodynamics and electromagnetism in a complex
1317360	1322480	system, right? So it's nothing magic. Now the underlying theory of all of this, all of that
1323120	1327120	can be described in something called the principle of least action, which is that, and it's just
1327120	1332640	been a book published last year. Surprisingly, it wasn't one before that sort of says, okay,
1332640	1338240	all of physics, that's, you know, classical quantum, everything can be, you know, derived
1338240	1345360	starting with this principle of least action. Now, if anyone's who's got a PhD in physics here,
1345360	1351520	yeah, a few people. And so we've all, this is what you get at grad school in physics, right? We do
1351520	1355360	Lagrangians and Hamiltonians and principles of least action. So everything we learn,
1355360	1360240	if equals ma and undergrad, we're told, yeah, that's very nice and quaint. But really, this is
1360240	1365440	the powerful machinery that's been developed. But we don't, you know, that we sort of, we get,
1365440	1370960	we get there, but I think we're not really taught that, you know, it's very unifying principle.
1372080	1377120	Okay, so I'm saying, okay, probably that's a nice place to start if we want to try to come
1377120	1381840	up with a general theory of intelligence. Okay, it's a big statement and bold statement, but,
1382400	1387040	you know, the brain is not doing anything that physical systems can't do, even though it feels
1387040	1392160	kind of, it is different, right? Because we have consciousness and, you know, that subjective
1392160	1396800	experience and self-awareness and that kind of stuff. But I'm going to argue it's all just physics.
1397600	1402720	There are people in the room and elsewhere who will say, no, there's something beyond physics,
1402720	1407680	metaphysics. I'm not one of those people. Okay, so I'm just going to keep it really simple.
1408400	1416080	So, you know, what can we do? Well, we can explain and understand what we see. We can imagine things,
1416080	1421200	you know, imagination, imagine that. Problem solving, planning actions to make these things
1421200	1426320	real, we can do all of that. That's what intelligence is really. And we can build new models as we
1426320	1436240	learn about the world. So, probably, okay, we've got five minutes. So, these are the sort of major,
1436240	1440400	some of the major theories of general intelligence, mathematical theory. These are all smart people
1441360	1445920	who have spent their whole lives dedicating to this. You can look them up later. There's
1445920	1451600	a guy called Carl Friston at UCL in London. And so, his theory of active inference is the one
1451600	1457040	that I think is particularly compelling. And I won't spend any time going through the details,
1457040	1460960	because it's pretty hard math, actually, but he uses something called a free energy principle.
1460960	1466000	It's based on physics and information theory. It's nothing kind of new and crazy. It's just
1466000	1470880	applying it to the brain. And he is a theoretical neuroscientist. And so, here he is.
1473680	1478560	And we don't have time to play it. So, the slides will be made available, I think,
1478560	1483520	so you can listen to him. And he's on YouTube, if you want to Google. And so, that's how he
1483520	1488800	sets it up. There's internal, there's us agents acting in an environment. That's the same if we're
1488800	1494160	bacteria, monkeys, birds, human beings. It's a system, right? A physical system. We act in our
1494160	1499600	environment. The environment acts back on us. So, there it is, bacteria to brains.
1500720	1505280	And the math gets really ugly, because it is statistical, probabilistic, and physical all
1505280	1513120	at the same time. It's complex information theory, essentially. But the ultimate question is,
1513840	1519280	can we build general intelligence? So, I would argue yes, because we have theories. We have very
1519360	1523040	compelling theories. All of those are, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds,
1523040	1527440	literally thousands of papers written deep mathematical theory, which keeps hundreds of
1527440	1532960	graduate students in PhDs. So, yes, we have the theory. We have candidate theories. We have the
1532960	1538560	algorithms and software. We have the hardware, neuromorphic in particular, and we have data
1538560	1545040	sets nowadays. So, yes. And I think we're kind of on our way with these projects like Spinnaker and
1545040	1551440	IBM True North. So, we're starting to build the hardware. It's just a sort of, it's always
1551440	1560480	just an engineering problem, right? Yeah. So, you know, what else? So, should we? That's an
1560480	1565120	ethics question. We won't go into that, because we could spend the rest of our lives arguing
1565120	1573600	should we do it or not. We're going to do it anyway. So, there are some projects. DeepMind is
1573600	1579280	trying to, although, you know, all the go and stuff isn't general. It's just specific. But
1579280	1585200	there's a whole bunch of AGI projects and all super interesting things. I definitely encourage
1585200	1591280	you to look and explore if you're interested in this subject at all on the internet. In conclusion,
1592160	1597760	so, it's obvious that deep learning is just statistical. It's not based on physics at all.
1597760	1601680	There's like zero physics in there. So, it's definitely not going to get us anywhere towards
1601680	1607600	general intelligence. But research groups are, many are looking into biopausable models. That's
1607600	1613440	both on the theoretical and the hardware side. We're sort of getting the glimpse of the very
1613440	1618160	first systems. We have the rat brain there with Spinnaker. So, we're sort of at the very
1618800	1624960	beginning of a steep exponential. So, maybe that will improve and in 10 years we'll have a human
1624960	1630880	level brain, which will be conscious and self-aware and subjective experience, which is kind of
1630880	1635840	spooky and creepy, right? There's nothing. I'm trying to argue there's nothing that mysterious
1635840	1642000	about the brain. It's just a complex system. And so, what do we do then? Well, we'll figure it out
1642000	1650080	as we go along, as we have done everything. And so, the future of AI, Jeff Hinton, he's the
1650080	1658400	godfather of AI. He's in Canada and he, let him have the final word, except there's no volume.
1658400	1665440	Okay. So, he's just basically saying that the brain is super, everything he's done in his whole
1665440	1673040	life. He's just clearly admits he wasn't working on general intelligence and to do, to figure out
1673040	1676480	how it works, we're going to have to look at neuroscience. That's pretty much his message.
1676480	1681440	And it's pretty much my message. And so, I hope you've enjoyed my talk. It's been a little bit
1681440	1685040	different from everyone else's, but thanks. Yeah. And we have questions, of course.
1685040	1698480	Okay. One interesting question is, could AGI be achieved without emulating human brain but
1698480	1706720	building a completely different model? No. That was a short one. You kind of answered this one,
1706720	1711920	but maybe you can elaborate a little bit more. When do you think AGI will arrive? And I can
1711920	1717600	follow with another one. As you said, you're at 50% of achieving AGI. What are the main
1717600	1722480	challenges you are facing to get to 100% what technology breakthroughs are needed?
1722480	1728880	Yeah. So, it's basically a hardware engineering problem. So, I did show the Spinnaker and there
1728880	1734000	are the hardware projects around the world doing this, like IBM and Intel. And so,
1734000	1738080	with that's the mouse brain right there. So, basically, it's a scaling problem now. I mean,
1738080	1745360	we started at one transistor at one point with classical computing and then companies like Intel
1745360	1751760	were formed and AMD and NVIDIA and the rest is history, right? It'll go on its own Moore's law.
1751760	1756640	So, right now, we're at the kind of like 10 transistor stage that we were with classical. So,
1756640	1762880	we'll just see that scale. I'm going to say something really bold. It's just a scaling
1762880	1767040	problem at this point in time. So, watch this space. So, what will you say?
1769360	1776720	Well, it'll go mouse and then it will go Bumblebee and then mouse and then monkey and then human.
1776720	1781760	So, we're on a curve. So, human in 10 years, that's my prediction.
1781760	1787120	They're too optimistic. I mean, in 1969, when people flew to moon, they thought that they
1787360	1792560	would be living on the moon by now. Okay. I'm an optimist. I'm saying 10. Yeah.
1793680	1798640	Okay. But I appreciate that. The last one, a comment about the Soul Machines Baby X project
1798640	1804480	and the potential to get closer to general AI. What's that? Say that again? Yeah. I haven't heard
1804480	1810560	about the Soul Machines Baby X project. Oh, yeah. I have. Yeah. Okay. Well, certainly. What was the
1810560	1817760	question? The Baby X? I mean, your comment about it and the potential to get closer to general AI.
1817760	1823200	Yeah. I didn't actually mention Baby X, but that's a nice project in New Zealand. And it's another
1824080	1830240	AGI project. But basically, it's going to come back to neuroscience. You know, we saw the mass,
1830240	1836240	we saw some of the mathematics involved. It's going to be people working at that level from a
1836240	1840560	theoretical point of view. And other people like Steve Furber and the Human Brain Project,
1841280	1845840	you know, brilliant engineers basically working on the hardware level, and these people talking
1845840	1851520	to each other. And I know Carl Friston and Steve Furber do talk to each other and building this
1851520	1856560	very complex system. Okay, Peter, thank you. Thank you. I will present you with a certificate.
1856560	1864560	Thank you, Peter. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
1864560	1868560	Thank you. We, we got to, we got to fill in with the certificate.
