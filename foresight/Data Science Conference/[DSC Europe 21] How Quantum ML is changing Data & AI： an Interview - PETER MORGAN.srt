00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Welcome back from lunch. Now we will hear how quantum machine learning is changing data

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,240
and artificial intelligence is presented by Peter Morgan who will join us online and later

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:25,000
we can ask some questions so get ready for that.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,360
Hello everyone, maybe you can see me at this position for the first time on this event,

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,360
a little bit virtual but we have a special occasion why we are doing like this. We are

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,760
having our distinguished keynote speaker from UK London who unfortunately wasn't being able

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,960
to join us this year in live but we are sure that Peter has a good friend of conference

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,160
and a member of our advisory board will be with us next year maybe even before the conference

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,520
in November hopefully especially if these corona measurements will let us do this much more live

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:14,360
events. Like I said we are going to have a keynote interview with our guest Peter Morgan

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,160
and it's going to be a kind of family interview which is going to tell us how quantum machine

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:28,600
learning is changing data and AI in every way, in ecosystem way, in sense of academic way,

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,120
in sense of how we are doing business. So without further ado I would like to start with the first

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,360
question and I would like maybe to give Peter a chance to present himself to our audience.

15
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Hi thanks for inviting me Alec to speak virtually, yeah it is sad I couldn't make it

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,120
with all the restrictions it's better that we do it this way. My background is I started

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,600
off in physics, quantum physics and I was doing a PhD actually in theoretical particle physics

18
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:13,800
in the US at Massachusetts there and I left and went into industry and I basically went into

19
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,600
computer networking and then the last eight years I have my own consulting company in machine

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,360
learning and artificial intelligence and about four years ago quantum computing came onto my

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:36,760
radar screen and I realized that I could combine you know my love of physics with my IT background

22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,640
so you know I haven't really looked back in the last four years in the quantum computing space

23
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,560
although it is very early days so I still earn money from machine learning as well.

24
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay I would like to ask you one question before on the beginning of interview and on the end of

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,840
interview just to see if your answer was changed so basically that question is

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,240
quantum computing the way how we can achieve artificial general intelligence?

27
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah that's a great question it may be a part of the solution I don't think it will be the whole

28
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,800
solution because the reason I say that Alec is because our brains are definitely classical

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,440
you know we walk around at room temperature we exist at room temperature. Quantum phenomenon has to

30
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,640
be without sort of interacting with the environment whatsoever like so it needs to be usually that

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,680
means it has to be called right down so it actually may be a different type of intelligence

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,280
but it won't be like biological intelligence. This sounds very interesting okay I would like

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,800
also to go to ask you how would you explain a quantum computing for data and air audience

34
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,360
in terms what's the difference between regular computing and quantum computing

35
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,040
and maybe in what stage of quantum development we are right now?

36
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,800
Yeah a couple of great questions so classical computing is what we're all familiar with it's

37
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,600
kind of hard to explain something that's so ubiquitous right we've all grown up with it and

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,880
it's you know it's in our hands with the iPhone the Android we have laptops you know classical

39
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:24,680
computing is done using classical transistors gates and logic circuits classical logic and it

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,360
obeys the laws of classical physics and you know we've got what you know 100 billion processors

41
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,480
on a single sorry transistors on a single processor today so they're extremely the most

42
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,760
complex things that humankind is built okay so they're classical but they're extremely complex

43
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,600
quantum computing on the other hand uses the laws of quantum physics so they have quantum

44
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:57,320
gates they have quantum logic they have quantum yeah quantum transistors basically so these things

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:05,640
just behave so differently from a classical gate or a classical processor CPU GPU

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,920
you know there's no comparison at all between them they just use different laws of physics

47
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,520
now the way that quantum computing the reason that people are interested in quantum computing

48
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,480
and making a qpu for example is that the laws of quantum physics means to say we can do everything

49
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,600
in parallel in something called Hilbert space which is the space that quantum physics occupies it's

50
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,840
just the way the universe is built from the big bang outwards it came endowed with this Hilbert

51
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,720
space which means things can be done in parallel which gives it the incredible power and so we

52
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,520
haven't actually built anything that can do anything commercially useful today Alec but

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:57,640
we can certainly prove that they're doing quantum calculations and we're up to about 100 qubits

54
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,600
IBM announced a few days ago 127 qubit processor and so really we needed like millions of qubits

55
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,240
so we were at the very early beginning days of quantum computing which makes it quite exciting

56
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,680
too it's like the 1950s in classical computing that sounds very interesting so basically what

57
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:23,320
we are saying right now that quantum whatever we can end engineers researchers computers

58
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,120
like developers basically they are some kind of pioneers you can understand correctly is it right

59
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,000
yeah pioneers definitely it feels like being a pioneer right now which is a great place to be

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,600
yeah it really is yeah it must have felt like it did with in the 50s with classical computing for

61
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:47,400
sure you know you know even pre-intel and Bell Labs making the first transistor the kind of it

62
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,480
that that's point right now yeah it's pretty pretty interesting and exciting but again no commercial

63
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,480
applications just yet so business people are not getting maybe as excited about it as as the

64
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:07,480
scientists for example okay so with this being said I would like to go to maybe okay we are

65
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,440
talking about the new answer like qubit power that we need to utilize the full power quantum

66
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,560
computing with millions of qubits in what span do you think that it is realistic to have this

67
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,960
million of qubits yeah so we're scaling up it's on its own Moore's law the number of qubit seems

68
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,520
to be doubling every year so we've come from you know two to four to eight or 15 now we're at 127

69
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,400
so IBM and Google have actually and iNQ these quantum computing companies who are building

70
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,520
quantum computers have all produced roadmaps out to 2030 which shows the number of qubits doubling

71
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,120
every year so we are on a Moore's law there so it doesn't take it's exponential so it's not going

72
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,880
to take a hundred years to get to a million probably more like 10 15 years now it's not the

73
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:03,080
number of qubits isn't the only factor we need them to be not noisy and we need them to be well

74
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,880
connected to each other and so these engineering challenges that need to be overcome it's not

75
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,320
a physics thing it's more of an engineering challenge so a lot of work to do to build a

76
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,240
million qubits for sure but we're on the road okay maybe this being said I would like to ask you

77
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,760
uh we started a little bit with uh we started with the quantum computing as a whole and now

78
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,240
let's move to quantum machine learning what is the difference between a quantum machine learning

79
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,120
and regular machine learning yeah so regular machine learning maybe most of the audience

80
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,480
at this conference data science conference are familiar with machine learning so um basically

81
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,680
what quantum computing okay so that's machine learning done on classical computers CPUs GPUs

82
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,040
for example um ASICs etc now where quantum comes in with machine learning is you can

83
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,880
offload a part of that calculation almost like a co-process co-processor situation where you have

84
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,360
some of the calculation machine learning calculations done on the CPU or GPU and the bits that um

85
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,040
will be sped up using quantum are then passed over to the qpu the quantum processing and then back

86
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,400
again back and forth iteratively and so the whole thing won't be done on a qpu it'll be a

87
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,760
co-processor situation so it will be like a classical quantum hybrid so we'll always need

88
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,480
classical computing for machine learning so basically what you're saying and that will be

89
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,640
the second question but first if I understand correctly and it correct me if I'm wrong uh

90
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,960
when we are talking about quantum machine learning we are not talking about classical

91
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,400
turns only quantum machine learning we are talking about the hybrid between uh machine

92
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,720
learning or AI and quantum machine learning yes absolutely alec yeah maybe one day in the far

93
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,040
far distant future everything will be quantum like you sort of need to load quantum data we

94
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,240
haven't got quantum memory yet that seems like a long long way out so basically for this foreseeable

95
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,080
future next 10 to 20 years it will be a classical quantum hybrid system this is this is this is as

96
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,080
excellent question and this is something that that maybe we can uh can be we can uh maybe it's a

97
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,000
cool thing to say so basically uh what is the role of quantum machine learning engineer and

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,360
quantum machine learning researcher is there any kind of difference in these roles or they are still

99
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,680
the same but yeah that this yeah that's a good question because really it's fundamentally comes

100
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,280
back to where we are in the quantum computing development um life cycle and because we're at

101
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:48,120
very early stage um a lot of it is quantum computing research uh at the moment and engineering

102
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,880
a little bit so kind of like a 90-10 percent split we can see that as we progress and build

103
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,880
more powerful processors say with a thousand qubits and start putting them um well they're on the

104
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,680
cloud now but actually they'll be be able to be used for very small commercial applications

105
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,920
we'll need a lot more engineers at that point Alex so that will be to actually um build the

106
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,120
commercial applications that's the point we'll need more engineering okay this is this is this

107
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,880
sounds very interesting so basically just to to to let's say before we go to the the the next

108
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,720
question is so basically right now we are all researchers some of our are in uh developers

109
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,520
but what we'll need like very very fast is somebody who's going to be engineer if I understand

110
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,720
correctly yeah it will ramp up quite quickly again it's on that exponential curve at the very

111
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,560
beginning yes okay we've been saying that can you give us some examples of where quantum machine

112
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,120
learning is already applied is there any kind of right right yeah that's a great no not yet not in

113
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,080
commercial applications so all of this is kind of test um in in uh you know companies it's not just

114
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,680
in the lab and university labs it's in quantum uh it's in companies who are wanting to become

115
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:10,040
quantum ready like uh big investment banks uh big pharma companies material science companies

116
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:16,360
we're talking we're thinking um black so smith Klein Bosch um you know goldman sacks these have

117
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,440
all got quantum computing departments with 20 or so researchers and engineers and developers

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,080
working on these algorithms today whether that's machine learning optimization you know pharma

119
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,160
material science simulation so yeah quantum machine learning is a part of the whole picture

120
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,320
but there are other elements too like simulation and optimization as well as machine learning

121
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,520
but so like I say there are companies hiring but I think at this point you know you sort of need

122
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,840
a phd in you know quantum science or quantum information um it's it's a little too early for

123
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,760
them to be employing just just a developer with no quantum knowledge so we have time to skill up

124
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,880
okay and one let's say one personal question for you in which uh industry you would like to

125
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,120
be part of quantum machine learning project yeah so I'm focusing that is most let's say

126
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,760
compelling to you to try quantum machine learning you personally yeah yeah personally I'm

127
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:23,400
focusing focused on the simulation aspect so that's material science um semiconductors photovoltaic

128
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:31,400
cells so you know um directly addressing climate change with uh you know also battery physics um

129
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,360
so yeah I mean it's it's it's um a huge very ambitious sort of project and we're just starting

130
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,160
but uh once these quantum computers become bigger we'll be able to simulate battery physics we

131
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,240
able to simulate semiconductors and a lot of photovoltaic cells are made out of semiconductors

132
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,800
for example uh as well as something called perovskite basically it's simulating nature at the um

133
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:03,240
molecular level um which was Feynman said in 1981 we can simulate physics with a quantum computer

134
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,120
and by golly uh it it looks like a great problem because it doesn't look so easy and 40 years later

135
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,760
where we're just at the very beginning of doing that so it is exciting this sounds very interesting

136
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,040
and basically what is this this important thing to uh to understand not only for data and AI uh

137
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,760
experts and uh leaders but also for software engineers and IT industry as whole because

138
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,240
in the end there you can we can talk about okay we will just add uh unbelievable number of I didn't

139
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:38,680
know uh computer computational power but in the end computational like hard disks uh processor

140
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,400
they have limitation of physical world without developing further quantum realm and development

141
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,840
in the quantum realm whatever we can we can follow like this we are we are we are we are bounded by

142
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,720
the limitation right now like I don't know if you heard about that this project they are trying to

143
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,840
to to to close a bigger close of the gap between uh between the two two semiconductors but the

144
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,800
basic and the chips because it's very hard not to have like electricity when it's closer to some

145
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,120
kind of nanometers but like I said yeah it can be done but so like I said yeah limited in one part

146
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,600
no that's right so classical computers um we we have to make so many approximations when we try to

147
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,400
model a semiconductor or any kind of battery physics or any physics at the any kind of

148
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,480
molecular dynamics including drugs drug discovery molecular docking um so many approximate because

149
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,280
basically we're solving the Schrodinger equation many body Schrodinger equation for all of these

150
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,160
systems which are quantum systems and we cannot do that directly on a classical computer we we're

151
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,600
using approximations so we're so limited so in that respect if quantum and if and when

152
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,520
quantum computers come along we can simulate these systems directly um it'll be no contest um it'll

153
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,760
be amazing progress will be amazing and fast and swift and meaningful and impactful we're talking

154
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,840
drug discovery solar panels batteries a lot of problems are just waiting a lot of low hanging

155
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:13,480
fruit we're just waiting on the hardware only that that's the only like yeah the most expensive

156
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,680
parties all the time yeah yeah what we we are like uh we are we are low on okay yeah uh what

157
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,280
i would like to also ask is the one part this is the future with quantum like because uh what

158
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,120
i what i'm like personally and what we are seeing like as a as a society that uh we are witnessing

159
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,160
that ai is basically changed the very fabric of our society on every level and people cannot

160
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,640
realize because it's day to day but when you make comparison like five years ago and now

161
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,280
basically we made a progress that is unmatchable it's not only like because of the covid crisis

162
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,840
we needed to adopt the digitalization etc but because you have adopted analytics

163
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,760
data science and ai so the fair question would be what changes to the society's quantum bringing

164
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,160
yeah though i mean i've worked in the machine learning area you know i haven't i saw my day

165
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,840
job as is a is a machine learning and i've totally agree with you about the exponential increase in

166
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,080
you know processing power and and data and you know just just algorithmic advancement and it's

167
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:26,280
been astonishing if we see a similar type of um progress in quantum computing we can we can expect

168
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:37,800
to see um as impactful if not more impactful um advancements to society for sure um i mentioned

169
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,520
you know uh attacking the climate change problem through material science if we can model all

170
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,280
these materials and build more efficient materials that's huge if we get a 10 percent gain even 100

171
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,280
percent gain in efficiency in a solar panel i mean that that's a trillion dollar industry no doubt

172
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,440
about it um yeah maybe more same with batteries with electric cars yeah i mean another trillion

173
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,200
dollar industry um semiconductors you know another trillion dollar industry i mean it's just

174
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,360
basically what you're saying is that that's all i need to develop quantum computers so they can be

175
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,280
yeah yeah we're definitely waiting on the hardware alec but there are there are several

176
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,040
kind of thrusts there's iron traps there's superconducting there's photonics there's um

177
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:30,840
cold atoms and there's topological so we don't really know who's going to win in the end with

178
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,880
the hardware i mean microsoft is working on topological google are doing an ibm are doing

179
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:44,040
superconducting um i and q and honeywell are doing iron traps um so again that's quite exciting to

180
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,640
to wonder and you know who nobody knows who the eventual winner will be maybe there'll be a few

181
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,080
winners um different applications for different types of hardware um but it's just going to take

182
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,960
a little bit of time alec we just have to be a little bit patient okay but also i would like to

183
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,840
to come back closer to my question so basically uh once again uh what do you think like for the

184
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:13,080
like like a regular regular person how much uh dear or her or his uh life will be impacted by

185
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,480
the quantum technology like five or ten years from now what is your expectation basically from the

186
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,760
from the point of one single person yeah i would say in ten years we're going to start to see a lot

187
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,480
five years will still be a little bit r and d phase these things will live in the cloud we won't

188
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,920
have them in our hands like you know the phone so they'll be at a distance so it'll be more

189
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,240
in the background we'll notice solar panels solar cells solar electricity becoming more

190
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,440
prominent and efficient and cheaper so perhaps the average person like you and i will notice

191
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,240
the cost of electricity coming down uh a speed up in process of power um you know better batteries

192
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,600
in our electric cars when everybody's buying them because it is policy now isn't it with the climate

193
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:03,080
change um conference the other week um you know governments are getting serious about moving to

194
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,920
all electric cars and moving to solar energy so that's i think where the average person will notice

195
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,680
it more possibly in drug discovery but we're looking ten years out i don't want to get anybody's hopes

196
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,160
up this is going to happen next year yeah it's going to be a little way away i know that and we

197
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,880
had a keynote the other day before and it's about uh yeah we are going to find heat the

198
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,720
his talk was basically uh that they already have implemented in modeling like together hybrid model

199
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,960
together with the AI of quantum machine learning some banking so like i said i think that some of

200
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,520
the things will be will be but like you said the full power of it like so the the regular person

201
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,160
uh can can see that that that's like i totally be five or ten years i would like to be five years

202
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,360
but you're the expert in these sizes this matters so i need to to to believe in your word that it's

203
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,160
going to take ten years but still it's going to be uh not only uh people need to have said it's not

204
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,680
going to be ten ten years like just if you not do anything there is a lot of the road ahead of us

205
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,480
so basically my question is our company is ready basically to embrace the quantum machine learning

206
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,280
in day-to-day operation and if yes or not what is needed to get into quantum and have for example

207
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,400
five years from now quantum machine learning departments yeah well i encourage people if

208
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,800
they're interested in moving into this field um maybe they're data scientists today software

209
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,480
developers machine learning engineers to start learning about quantum physics if you're very young

210
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,360
you know going to university doing an undergraduate or even a graduate uh degree um you know physics

211
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,840
isn't isn't a bad option today you know um before it was computer science machine learning today

212
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,360
there's going to be because it's quantum computing there'll still be a computing computer science

213
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,840
element software engineering element but there's going to be a little bit of physics as well

214
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,400
so it's a little bit of a hybrid and it's unclear whether people are going to really be able to

215
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:04,920
join the two together in a single person um maybe we'll just you know it's it's tough because normally

216
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,280
people love physics or they love computer science and there's a little bit of a there's not a whole

217
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,040
bunch of crossover quantum physics is quantum physics software engineering isn't quantum physics so

218
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,360
you know can a software engineer or do they even want to become a physicist does a physicist

219
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,080
want to become a computer scientist it's it's a little bit you know we're going to have to

220
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,680
wait to see how this plays out but education is key alec okay and being said that uh how do you see

221
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,880
a cooperation between academia and the business sector in the quantum field because it seems that

222
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,280
like uh big tech uh companies uh and there are indeed departments at a bit in front of academic

223
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,600
circles uh this can say to be a true statement and what are your thoughts on this subject do you

224
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,600
think that it's enough or it need to be better if so how it can be better yeah well i've already

225
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,880
seen we're already starting to see companies like google and amazon and microsoft hiring away from

226
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,400
university so it's a little bit uh concerning in a way but we did see the same thing happening with

227
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,080
machine learning um all of the big companies like google just hired everybody from university and and

228
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,840
you know it it saves sort of i've noticed they've sort of gone back to university part time so but

229
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,320
initially there'll be this huge brain drain i think from university because it's very limited

230
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,960
there's a few professors a couple of postdocs um and you know they need it we need a lot more

231
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,280
phds and you know quantum engineering and quantum computing um these these degrees didn't exist five

232
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:44,120
years ago so you know we're at the very beginning um and so we i am seeing if you go to amazon uh

233
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:50,520
website and look at quantum computing careers you will see you know they're looking for postdoc

234
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,680
level people today they can't hire enough same as google same as ibm they just simply cannot get

235
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,320
enough people with the right skill set this is interesting what what just for our audience

236
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,960
that can get a bit better of you what what the amount of people we are talking right now

237
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,760
to have like what what the amount of people do you think that one amazon one google need to have

238
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,400
like just to make it with what they would like to have as a progress in the quantum field right

239
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,640
well i think ibm is a little further ahead they probably have the biggest conan uh engineering

240
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,800
team um but i noticed uh google and amazon have about a hundred people now between 100 and 200

241
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,760
they've scaled up in the last two or three years yeah to 100 200 they probably want to double that

242
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,120
over the next two or three years as well and eventually end up with about a thousand plus

243
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,040
so we need it'll ramp up exponentially so the number of people required will probably always

244
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,560
lag the demand um as we go forward because it does take three or four years to train somebody

245
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,480
you know to become a good machine learning engineer a good quantum computing guy

246
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,720
or girl i mean it does take four or five years it doesn't happen overnight so

247
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,120
there's going to be a little bit of a ramp up yeah and basically uh what and this is like

248
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,760
one of the questions i want to ask this because uh i want to just to share with our audience that

249
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,720
basically what we are saying that right now in the world there is just a couple of hundred maybe

250
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,880
a couple of thousand at most like i think it's too much to say a couple of thousand of people who

251
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,240
are doing the for doing machine learning it's not that much yeah but no no no maybe the whole

252
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,680
quantum computing what would be a couple of thousand but quantum machine learning maybe 200 yeah yeah

253
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,240
yeah that's right and uh basically what what can be a good thing like basically if you're thinking

254
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,520
about uh about doing quantum it's not that easy like to switch to quantum because you need to

255
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,320
understand quantum mechanics on the first yeah it is somebody who studied that i can i can tell you

256
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,120
people if you if you saw Brilliant Minds and you didn't or some film about Einstein you didn't

257
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,840
understand the the something that's written on the backboard that's really true what is written

258
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,440
and that's quantum mechanics most probably but what would be your advice to someone who would like

259
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,240
to start the quantum career in terms of like students and in terms of somebody who'd like to

260
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,240
get the pre-qualification or yeah maybe this advice yeah well i think we're seeing physicists

261
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,960
already become computational physicists and in the classical sense so they'll just be able to become

262
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:27,560
quantum computing at the end of the day quantum computing will be just another type of computer

263
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,400
in the cloud co-located in the data center along with the classical computers maybe there'll be

264
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,880
neuromorphic computing as well it's just another form of computing and it's only for a very specific

265
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,680
type of problem it's not won't solve every problem websites will still run on classical

266
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:52,120
computers so to train to get there you you sort of there's two ways of getting there one is to

267
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,320
start with the physics background and move into quantum and move into computer science the other

268
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,920
is to start with the computer science background and learn the quantum and you know that might be a

269
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,920
little harder i think than a physicist to learn computer i i'm thinking because it's just a very

270
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:16,120
specific skill set is you know it's just i mean i did physics and i know it's not for everybody

271
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,400
it's a lot of math okay there's a lot of math yeah that's like that that's a good output that that's

272
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,120
what i'm talking about there's a lot of people in the science field for doing very good because they

273
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,200
understand they are they are mathematical uh basically aperture before this to talk about

274
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,360
math it's very very hard it's very very on some other level but uh okay my last question before

275
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:46,040
we go to your final remark is what would be uh the first problem you would like to see solve

276
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:53,560
with quantum machine learning oh man the first problem yeah i was going one computing yeah if

277
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,080
it's kind of computing i'd say i want to simulate materials and you know build better solar cells

278
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,360
and better semiconductor and better batteries if it's quantum machine learning i think like

279
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,400
i said earlier it's always going to be a hybrid classical quantum situation so it can be used

280
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,800
for simulating material science it can be sim it can be used for optimization problems it can be

281
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:24,760
used for um you know anything that machine learning classical machine learning which is

282
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,960
basically good at you know pattern recognition and it will accelerate that process so i mean it's

283
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,040
it's almost any any field you can think of that machine learning is already used in so you know

284
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:44,760
you can work in a bank optimization of optimizing portfolios you can work in a transport company

285
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,880
optimizing traffic routes with quantum machine learning you know you can um yeah maybe in medicine

286
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,240
you know alpha fold the deep mind protein folding i would love to see them using quantum

287
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,760
computing to speed that up as well as it as with everybody so any machine learning problem can be

288
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,040
you know given a little boost with these quantum computers from my point of view what i would like

289
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,400
to see is to try uh quantum machine learning and what you'll get in combination with quantum

290
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,440
computing it's in relation of black holes for example yeah that'd be great that'd be amazing

291
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,120
i think that there's something that we can learn a lot of it from from the very fabric of the universe

292
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,000
and maybe get from that question we can move on to to the maybe the the the ultimate question of

293
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,080
them all are we alone in this universe maybe yeah yeah that can be a second thing like

294
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,280
doing after that like i don't know i'm i'm i'm coming back to the roots of my astrophysics

295
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,600
so yeah no a lot of people would like that i mean you might not even we might need even

296
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,440
not even the machine learning there i mean um quantum computers are just um perfectly made to

297
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,920
simulate black holes and the big bang because those are 100 quantum systems yeah so so you

298
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,760
you're you're you're so spot on there that yeah black holes will be a early application when we

299
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,640
make them for sure yeah i was still i think that we need like 10 years but still in 10 yeah we can

300
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,560
simulate black hole people you cannot understand what we can learn from that that's that's something

301
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,440
that that i think it will change not very fabric of our society very fabric of how we are

302
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,760
receiving life like basically and that that's something that it will it will it'll have an

303
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,440
enormous change like on everything but okay that's 10 years from now what i would like to ask you

304
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,360
right now would you like to say anything else to our audience right now as a closing remarks before

305
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,920
we can start with the q and a yeah sure um no not really but if you're interested in quantum

306
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,240
computing don't be put off by the physics just just you know there's a lot of computer science

307
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,840
in there as well a lot of algorithmic theory i mean there's so many different branches uh

308
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,720
in within quantum computing umbrella there's machine learning there's algorithmic complexity

309
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,280
theory there's information theory there's software there's hardware you know there's control systems

310
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,960
so this is a place for everybody so just dive in but i would say to people you know don't be

311
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,840
don't be put off by the quantum physics but there's a lot of work to be done okay Peter thank you so

312
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,440
much for this lovely chat it's all it's always very very pleasant to talk with you and right now

313
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,360
what we are going to do we are going to start with q and a and Peter will join us live to answer

314
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,760
your question hopefully there are going to be a lot of questions okay sure thanks Alec nice to nice

315
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:50,840
to speak to you again hello everyone hello Peter so you can see me now live okay so basically the

316
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,440
first thing is do we have any question from the audience don't be shy you can raise your hand

317
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,040
there is yes no okay there's two okay let's go here i'll be the one

318
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:15,320
hi nice to see you again at this conference and shame that you couldn't come to do a live presentation

319
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,080
even so it was great still one of the thing i would like to ask for for somebody who is

320
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,920
devoted to education is how to popularize physics to young generations

321
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,000
yeah that's a good question so i've been doing a little bit of work on this

322
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,720
for various companies it is all about the education at this point because you know there's

323
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,240
this kind of massive ramp up going to be occurring over the next two years a little bit like we saw

324
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,680
with machine learning right so you know a lot of professors leaving academia to be

325
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:59,400
going to industry we're already seeing that was quantum computing you know physics departments

326
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:08,360
becoming a little bit depleted already but so but in terms of educating younger folk or people who

327
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,240
want to you know move into this area there are a lot there are actually companies now

328
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,720
creating courses so you don't have to go back to university just like with data science you know

329
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,560
you can do online courses or three month boot camps they're starting to happen IBM have got some

330
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,240
good training material on their website if you just google IBM quiz kit or IBM quantum

331
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:40,920
and similarly with Microsoft so we're starting to see some of these educational materials appear

332
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,880
online so i would just you know start googling and over the next couple of years we'll see more and

333
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:52,600
more of this online information and also we'll see universities starting to offer undergraduate

334
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,240
degrees and quantum information science and quantum quantum engineering which are degrees

335
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,920
that don't actually exist at the moment so yeah you know people are addressing it it'll be a little

336
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:14,120
bit of a slow ramp up over the next few years thank you Peter just another question are you also a

337
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:22,520
bit afraid that humankind might misuse quantum computing yeah maybe there's always a safety

338
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,240
aspect in any technology right any new technology you know nuclear weapons and you know machine

339
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:37,160
learning you know AI taking over the world and now rightly so people are considering what could

340
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:45,960
possibly go wrong with quantum so it's a good question to think about don't stay away too late

341
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,800
at night thinking about it i think you know like any technology it can be used for good or bad right

342
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,440
it does have national strategic importance though so you know governments are probably

343
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,680
doing stuff behind closed doors that will never see the light of day really to be honest

344
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,920
but most of the research has been done at universities and big companies and even startups

345
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,320
nowadays and so you know the hope is you know people will use AI for good good things and

346
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,400
same as similarly with quantum computing we'll be using it to simulate new materials and and

347
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,160
drug discovery you know helping us with quantum machine learning optimization problems and so

348
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,280
those are all good things for humanity but yeah there'll be an arms race you know China Russia

349
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:41,640
the usual suspects in the west you know it's uh we can't seem to get over that so we can expect

350
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,680
that i mean in some ways it's healthy competition in other ways it's kind of annoying because you

351
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,320
know people start worrying about how you know bad actors are going to use it so you know it's one

352
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,720
of these perennial problems that will never go away we'll never get rid of so we just have to

353
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,320
you know treat it with the respect that it deserves maybe some regulations and legislation

354
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,440
will see happening and but at the end of the day you know there's only so much we can do to limit

355
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:14,360
bad actors okay do we have any additional question okay i have one question for you it's going to

356
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:20,120
are you going to put you on the spot here on the light uh so basically Peter who will you

357
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:28,440
help us to bring at this stage live next year as a quantum keynote speaker i'm sure Alex i'd love

358
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,960
to come back uh to val braid yeah i mean i really enjoyed it last year so sure you and who who

359
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,040
else from which company google or something like that yeah i mean we'll try and get everybody from

360
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,160
the big guys and the startups as well who don't really super interesting stuff so you know the

361
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,440
usual suspects would be google microsoft and ibm and even amazon have a quantum computing

362
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,880
research department now so they're actually making hardware not just putting other companies

363
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,160
can quantum computers on the cloud which you can go and log into now it's called amazon bracket

364
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,720
b r a k e t and you can log into about three different vendors today if you wanted to so we

365
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,200
could get them along so that's four and then we could get maybe four startups okay thanks a lot

366
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,080
okay basically uh if you don't have any additional questions i would like peter once again to thank

367
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,880
you like tatina said i'm looking forward to see you again here in belgium live when the corona

368
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,400
hopefully next year will be it will give us a little bit of slack uh we are moving forward with

369
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,120
the program i think that we are having like a small break or something like that but i will let

370
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:44,120
zonan he know better than me it's okay people like to watch you uh we have like five minutes

371
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,280
before we uh are joined by simon boyden who is going to follow with his presentation it's going

372
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:01,000
to be a very interesting one about about wimbledon tennis championship so be sure to be here in five

373
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:11,000
minutes because we are starting a sharp time because he's joining us virtually thank you
