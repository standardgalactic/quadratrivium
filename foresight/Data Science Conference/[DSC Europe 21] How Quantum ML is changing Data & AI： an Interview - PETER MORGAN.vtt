00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
Welcome back from lunch. Now we will hear how quantum machine learning is changing data

00:08.480 --> 00:15.240
and artificial intelligence is presented by Peter Morgan who will join us online and later

00:15.240 --> 00:25.000
we can ask some questions so get ready for that.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.360
Hello everyone, maybe you can see me at this position for the first time on this event,

00:32.360 --> 00:38.360
a little bit virtual but we have a special occasion why we are doing like this. We are

00:38.360 --> 00:44.760
having our distinguished keynote speaker from UK London who unfortunately wasn't being able

00:44.760 --> 00:49.960
to join us this year in live but we are sure that Peter has a good friend of conference

00:49.960 --> 00:57.160
and a member of our advisory board will be with us next year maybe even before the conference

00:57.160 --> 01:04.520
in November hopefully especially if these corona measurements will let us do this much more live

01:04.520 --> 01:14.360
events. Like I said we are going to have a keynote interview with our guest Peter Morgan

01:14.360 --> 01:21.160
and it's going to be a kind of family interview which is going to tell us how quantum machine

01:21.160 --> 01:28.600
learning is changing data and AI in every way, in ecosystem way, in sense of academic way,

01:28.600 --> 01:34.120
in sense of how we are doing business. So without further ado I would like to start with the first

01:34.120 --> 01:40.360
question and I would like maybe to give Peter a chance to present himself to our audience.

01:40.680 --> 01:47.480
Hi thanks for inviting me Alec to speak virtually, yeah it is sad I couldn't make it

01:48.440 --> 01:56.120
with all the restrictions it's better that we do it this way. My background is I started

01:56.120 --> 02:02.600
off in physics, quantum physics and I was doing a PhD actually in theoretical particle physics

02:03.320 --> 02:13.800
in the US at Massachusetts there and I left and went into industry and I basically went into

02:15.720 --> 02:22.600
computer networking and then the last eight years I have my own consulting company in machine

02:22.600 --> 02:28.360
learning and artificial intelligence and about four years ago quantum computing came onto my

02:28.360 --> 02:36.760
radar screen and I realized that I could combine you know my love of physics with my IT background

02:36.760 --> 02:41.640
so you know I haven't really looked back in the last four years in the quantum computing space

02:41.640 --> 02:45.560
although it is very early days so I still earn money from machine learning as well.

02:46.920 --> 02:51.000
Okay I would like to ask you one question before on the beginning of interview and on the end of

02:51.000 --> 02:56.840
interview just to see if your answer was changed so basically that question is

02:57.800 --> 03:03.240
quantum computing the way how we can achieve artificial general intelligence?

03:04.200 --> 03:08.840
Yeah that's a great question it may be a part of the solution I don't think it will be the whole

03:08.840 --> 03:13.800
solution because the reason I say that Alec is because our brains are definitely classical

03:14.600 --> 03:20.440
you know we walk around at room temperature we exist at room temperature. Quantum phenomenon has to

03:20.440 --> 03:27.640
be without sort of interacting with the environment whatsoever like so it needs to be usually that

03:27.640 --> 03:32.680
means it has to be called right down so it actually may be a different type of intelligence

03:32.680 --> 03:38.280
but it won't be like biological intelligence. This sounds very interesting okay I would like

03:38.280 --> 03:45.800
also to go to ask you how would you explain a quantum computing for data and air audience

03:45.880 --> 03:50.360
in terms what's the difference between regular computing and quantum computing

03:50.360 --> 03:54.040
and maybe in what stage of quantum development we are right now?

03:54.680 --> 04:01.800
Yeah a couple of great questions so classical computing is what we're all familiar with it's

04:01.800 --> 04:06.600
kind of hard to explain something that's so ubiquitous right we've all grown up with it and

04:06.600 --> 04:13.880
it's you know it's in our hands with the iPhone the Android we have laptops you know classical

04:13.880 --> 04:24.680
computing is done using classical transistors gates and logic circuits classical logic and it

04:24.680 --> 04:32.360
obeys the laws of classical physics and you know we've got what you know 100 billion processors

04:32.360 --> 04:37.480
on a single sorry transistors on a single processor today so they're extremely the most

04:37.480 --> 04:44.760
complex things that humankind is built okay so they're classical but they're extremely complex

04:44.760 --> 04:48.600
quantum computing on the other hand uses the laws of quantum physics so they have quantum

04:48.600 --> 04:57.320
gates they have quantum logic they have quantum yeah quantum transistors basically so these things

04:57.400 --> 05:05.640
just behave so differently from a classical gate or a classical processor CPU GPU

05:07.480 --> 05:12.920
you know there's no comparison at all between them they just use different laws of physics

05:12.920 --> 05:18.520
now the way that quantum computing the reason that people are interested in quantum computing

05:18.520 --> 05:25.480
and making a qpu for example is that the laws of quantum physics means to say we can do everything

05:25.480 --> 05:30.600
in parallel in something called Hilbert space which is the space that quantum physics occupies it's

05:30.600 --> 05:36.840
just the way the universe is built from the big bang outwards it came endowed with this Hilbert

05:36.840 --> 05:43.720
space which means things can be done in parallel which gives it the incredible power and so we

05:43.720 --> 05:48.520
haven't actually built anything that can do anything commercially useful today Alec but

05:49.480 --> 05:57.640
we can certainly prove that they're doing quantum calculations and we're up to about 100 qubits

05:57.640 --> 06:04.600
IBM announced a few days ago 127 qubit processor and so really we needed like millions of qubits

06:04.600 --> 06:09.240
so we were at the very early beginning days of quantum computing which makes it quite exciting

06:09.240 --> 06:14.680
too it's like the 1950s in classical computing that sounds very interesting so basically what

06:14.760 --> 06:23.320
we are saying right now that quantum whatever we can end engineers researchers computers

06:23.320 --> 06:28.120
like developers basically they are some kind of pioneers you can understand correctly is it right

06:29.080 --> 06:35.000
yeah pioneers definitely it feels like being a pioneer right now which is a great place to be

06:35.000 --> 06:40.600
yeah it really is yeah it must have felt like it did with in the 50s with classical computing for

06:40.600 --> 06:47.400
sure you know you know even pre-intel and Bell Labs making the first transistor the kind of it

06:47.400 --> 06:53.480
that that's point right now yeah it's pretty pretty interesting and exciting but again no commercial

06:53.480 --> 06:59.480
applications just yet so business people are not getting maybe as excited about it as as the

06:59.480 --> 07:07.480
scientists for example okay so with this being said I would like to go to maybe okay we are

07:07.480 --> 07:12.440
talking about the new answer like qubit power that we need to utilize the full power quantum

07:12.440 --> 07:17.560
computing with millions of qubits in what span do you think that it is realistic to have this

07:17.560 --> 07:23.960
million of qubits yeah so we're scaling up it's on its own Moore's law the number of qubit seems

07:23.960 --> 07:32.520
to be doubling every year so we've come from you know two to four to eight or 15 now we're at 127

07:32.520 --> 07:37.400
so IBM and Google have actually and iNQ these quantum computing companies who are building

07:37.400 --> 07:42.520
quantum computers have all produced roadmaps out to 2030 which shows the number of qubits doubling

07:42.520 --> 07:48.120
every year so we are on a Moore's law there so it doesn't take it's exponential so it's not going

07:48.120 --> 07:53.880
to take a hundred years to get to a million probably more like 10 15 years now it's not the

07:53.880 --> 08:03.080
number of qubits isn't the only factor we need them to be not noisy and we need them to be well

08:03.080 --> 08:09.880
connected to each other and so these engineering challenges that need to be overcome it's not

08:09.880 --> 08:15.320
a physics thing it's more of an engineering challenge so a lot of work to do to build a

08:15.320 --> 08:21.240
million qubits for sure but we're on the road okay maybe this being said I would like to ask you

08:21.960 --> 08:26.760
uh we started a little bit with uh we started with the quantum computing as a whole and now

08:26.760 --> 08:31.240
let's move to quantum machine learning what is the difference between a quantum machine learning

08:31.240 --> 08:38.120
and regular machine learning yeah so regular machine learning maybe most of the audience

08:38.120 --> 08:43.480
at this conference data science conference are familiar with machine learning so um basically

08:43.480 --> 08:48.680
what quantum computing okay so that's machine learning done on classical computers CPUs GPUs

08:49.240 --> 08:56.040
for example um ASICs etc now where quantum comes in with machine learning is you can

08:56.040 --> 09:01.880
offload a part of that calculation almost like a co-process co-processor situation where you have

09:01.880 --> 09:08.360
some of the calculation machine learning calculations done on the CPU or GPU and the bits that um

09:08.360 --> 09:14.040
will be sped up using quantum are then passed over to the qpu the quantum processing and then back

09:14.040 --> 09:19.400
again back and forth iteratively and so the whole thing won't be done on a qpu it'll be a

09:19.400 --> 09:24.760
co-processor situation so it will be like a classical quantum hybrid so we'll always need

09:24.760 --> 09:31.480
classical computing for machine learning so basically what you're saying and that will be

09:31.480 --> 09:35.640
the second question but first if I understand correctly and it correct me if I'm wrong uh

09:35.640 --> 09:39.960
when we are talking about quantum machine learning we are not talking about classical

09:39.960 --> 09:45.400
turns only quantum machine learning we are talking about the hybrid between uh machine

09:45.400 --> 09:51.720
learning or AI and quantum machine learning yes absolutely alec yeah maybe one day in the far

09:51.720 --> 09:58.040
far distant future everything will be quantum like you sort of need to load quantum data we

09:58.040 --> 10:03.240
haven't got quantum memory yet that seems like a long long way out so basically for this foreseeable

10:03.240 --> 10:09.080
future next 10 to 20 years it will be a classical quantum hybrid system this is this is this is as

10:09.080 --> 10:15.080
excellent question and this is something that that maybe we can uh can be we can uh maybe it's a

10:15.080 --> 10:21.000
cool thing to say so basically uh what is the role of quantum machine learning engineer and

10:21.000 --> 10:26.360
quantum machine learning researcher is there any kind of difference in these roles or they are still

10:26.360 --> 10:32.680
the same but yeah that this yeah that's a good question because really it's fundamentally comes

10:32.680 --> 10:38.280
back to where we are in the quantum computing development um life cycle and because we're at

10:38.280 --> 10:48.120
very early stage um a lot of it is quantum computing research uh at the moment and engineering

10:48.120 --> 10:53.880
a little bit so kind of like a 90-10 percent split we can see that as we progress and build

10:53.880 --> 10:59.880
more powerful processors say with a thousand qubits and start putting them um well they're on the

10:59.880 --> 11:04.680
cloud now but actually they'll be be able to be used for very small commercial applications

11:04.680 --> 11:10.920
we'll need a lot more engineers at that point Alex so that will be to actually um build the

11:10.920 --> 11:16.120
commercial applications that's the point we'll need more engineering okay this is this is this

11:16.120 --> 11:21.880
sounds very interesting so basically just to to to let's say before we go to the the the next

11:21.880 --> 11:27.720
question is so basically right now we are all researchers some of our are in uh developers

11:27.720 --> 11:32.520
but what we'll need like very very fast is somebody who's going to be engineer if I understand

11:32.520 --> 11:37.720
correctly yeah it will ramp up quite quickly again it's on that exponential curve at the very

11:37.720 --> 11:43.560
beginning yes okay we've been saying that can you give us some examples of where quantum machine

11:43.560 --> 11:50.120
learning is already applied is there any kind of right right yeah that's a great no not yet not in

11:50.120 --> 11:57.080
commercial applications so all of this is kind of test um in in uh you know companies it's not just

11:57.080 --> 12:02.680
in the lab and university labs it's in quantum uh it's in companies who are wanting to become

12:02.680 --> 12:10.040
quantum ready like uh big investment banks uh big pharma companies material science companies

12:10.040 --> 12:16.360
we're talking we're thinking um black so smith Klein Bosch um you know goldman sacks these have

12:16.360 --> 12:22.440
all got quantum computing departments with 20 or so researchers and engineers and developers

12:23.000 --> 12:29.080
working on these algorithms today whether that's machine learning optimization you know pharma

12:29.080 --> 12:35.160
material science simulation so yeah quantum machine learning is a part of the whole picture

12:35.160 --> 12:41.320
but there are other elements too like simulation and optimization as well as machine learning

12:41.320 --> 12:46.520
but so like I say there are companies hiring but I think at this point you know you sort of need

12:46.520 --> 12:52.840
a phd in you know quantum science or quantum information um it's it's a little too early for

12:52.840 --> 12:58.760
them to be employing just just a developer with no quantum knowledge so we have time to skill up

12:58.760 --> 13:05.880
okay and one let's say one personal question for you in which uh industry you would like to

13:05.880 --> 13:12.120
be part of quantum machine learning project yeah so I'm focusing that is most let's say

13:12.120 --> 13:16.760
compelling to you to try quantum machine learning you personally yeah yeah personally I'm

13:16.760 --> 13:23.400
focusing focused on the simulation aspect so that's material science um semiconductors photovoltaic

13:23.400 --> 13:31.400
cells so you know um directly addressing climate change with uh you know also battery physics um

13:31.400 --> 13:38.360
so yeah I mean it's it's it's um a huge very ambitious sort of project and we're just starting

13:38.360 --> 13:43.160
but uh once these quantum computers become bigger we'll be able to simulate battery physics we

13:43.160 --> 13:49.240
able to simulate semiconductors and a lot of photovoltaic cells are made out of semiconductors

13:49.240 --> 13:55.800
for example uh as well as something called perovskite basically it's simulating nature at the um

13:55.800 --> 14:03.240
molecular level um which was Feynman said in 1981 we can simulate physics with a quantum computer

14:03.240 --> 14:10.120
and by golly uh it it looks like a great problem because it doesn't look so easy and 40 years later

14:10.120 --> 14:14.760
where we're just at the very beginning of doing that so it is exciting this sounds very interesting

14:14.760 --> 14:20.040
and basically what is this this important thing to uh to understand not only for data and AI uh

14:20.040 --> 14:24.760
experts and uh leaders but also for software engineers and IT industry as whole because

14:24.760 --> 14:31.240
in the end there you can we can talk about okay we will just add uh unbelievable number of I didn't

14:31.240 --> 14:38.680
know uh computer computational power but in the end computational like hard disks uh processor

14:38.680 --> 14:45.400
they have limitation of physical world without developing further quantum realm and development

14:45.400 --> 14:50.840
in the quantum realm whatever we can we can follow like this we are we are we are we are bounded by

14:50.840 --> 14:55.720
the limitation right now like I don't know if you heard about that this project they are trying to

14:55.720 --> 15:02.840
to to to close a bigger close of the gap between uh between the two two semiconductors but the

15:02.840 --> 15:07.800
basic and the chips because it's very hard not to have like electricity when it's closer to some

15:07.800 --> 15:14.120
kind of nanometers but like I said yeah it can be done but so like I said yeah limited in one part

15:14.120 --> 15:20.600
no that's right so classical computers um we we have to make so many approximations when we try to

15:20.600 --> 15:25.400
model a semiconductor or any kind of battery physics or any physics at the any kind of

15:25.400 --> 15:31.480
molecular dynamics including drugs drug discovery molecular docking um so many approximate because

15:31.480 --> 15:36.280
basically we're solving the Schrodinger equation many body Schrodinger equation for all of these

15:36.280 --> 15:41.160
systems which are quantum systems and we cannot do that directly on a classical computer we we're

15:41.160 --> 15:46.600
using approximations so we're so limited so in that respect if quantum and if and when

15:46.600 --> 15:52.520
quantum computers come along we can simulate these systems directly um it'll be no contest um it'll

15:52.520 --> 15:58.760
be amazing progress will be amazing and fast and swift and meaningful and impactful we're talking

15:58.760 --> 16:04.840
drug discovery solar panels batteries a lot of problems are just waiting a lot of low hanging

16:04.840 --> 16:13.480
fruit we're just waiting on the hardware only that that's the only like yeah the most expensive

16:13.480 --> 16:20.680
parties all the time yeah yeah what we we are like uh we are we are low on okay yeah uh what

16:20.680 --> 16:26.280
i would like to also ask is the one part this is the future with quantum like because uh what

16:26.280 --> 16:32.120
i what i'm like personally and what we are seeing like as a as a society that uh we are witnessing

16:32.120 --> 16:37.160
that ai is basically changed the very fabric of our society on every level and people cannot

16:37.160 --> 16:41.640
realize because it's day to day but when you make comparison like five years ago and now

16:41.640 --> 16:46.280
basically we made a progress that is unmatchable it's not only like because of the covid crisis

16:46.280 --> 16:52.840
we needed to adopt the digitalization etc but because you have adopted analytics

16:52.840 --> 16:58.760
data science and ai so the fair question would be what changes to the society's quantum bringing

16:59.960 --> 17:05.160
yeah though i mean i've worked in the machine learning area you know i haven't i saw my day

17:05.160 --> 17:10.840
job as is a is a machine learning and i've totally agree with you about the exponential increase in

17:11.640 --> 17:19.080
you know processing power and and data and you know just just algorithmic advancement and it's

17:19.080 --> 17:26.280
been astonishing if we see a similar type of um progress in quantum computing we can we can expect

17:26.280 --> 17:37.800
to see um as impactful if not more impactful um advancements to society for sure um i mentioned

17:38.680 --> 17:44.520
you know uh attacking the climate change problem through material science if we can model all

17:44.520 --> 17:50.280
these materials and build more efficient materials that's huge if we get a 10 percent gain even 100

17:50.280 --> 17:56.280
percent gain in efficiency in a solar panel i mean that that's a trillion dollar industry no doubt

17:56.280 --> 18:02.440
about it um yeah maybe more same with batteries with electric cars yeah i mean another trillion

18:02.680 --> 18:08.200
dollar industry um semiconductors you know another trillion dollar industry i mean it's just

18:08.200 --> 18:12.360
basically what you're saying is that that's all i need to develop quantum computers so they can be

18:13.320 --> 18:18.280
yeah yeah we're definitely waiting on the hardware alec but there are there are several

18:18.280 --> 18:24.040
kind of thrusts there's iron traps there's superconducting there's photonics there's um

18:24.920 --> 18:30.840
cold atoms and there's topological so we don't really know who's going to win in the end with

18:30.840 --> 18:35.880
the hardware i mean microsoft is working on topological google are doing an ibm are doing

18:35.880 --> 18:44.040
superconducting um i and q and honeywell are doing iron traps um so again that's quite exciting to

18:44.040 --> 18:49.640
to wonder and you know who nobody knows who the eventual winner will be maybe there'll be a few

18:49.640 --> 18:55.080
winners um different applications for different types of hardware um but it's just going to take

18:55.080 --> 18:59.960
a little bit of time alec we just have to be a little bit patient okay but also i would like to

18:59.960 --> 19:04.840
to come back closer to my question so basically uh once again uh what do you think like for the

19:04.840 --> 19:13.080
like like a regular regular person how much uh dear or her or his uh life will be impacted by

19:13.080 --> 19:17.480
the quantum technology like five or ten years from now what is your expectation basically from the

19:17.480 --> 19:22.760
from the point of one single person yeah i would say in ten years we're going to start to see a lot

19:22.760 --> 19:27.480
five years will still be a little bit r and d phase these things will live in the cloud we won't

19:27.480 --> 19:32.920
have them in our hands like you know the phone so they'll be at a distance so it'll be more

19:33.480 --> 19:39.240
in the background we'll notice solar panels solar cells solar electricity becoming more

19:39.240 --> 19:44.440
prominent and efficient and cheaper so perhaps the average person like you and i will notice

19:44.440 --> 19:51.240
the cost of electricity coming down uh a speed up in process of power um you know better batteries

19:51.240 --> 19:56.600
in our electric cars when everybody's buying them because it is policy now isn't it with the climate

19:56.600 --> 20:03.080
change um conference the other week um you know governments are getting serious about moving to

20:03.080 --> 20:08.920
all electric cars and moving to solar energy so that's i think where the average person will notice

20:08.920 --> 20:14.680
it more possibly in drug discovery but we're looking ten years out i don't want to get anybody's hopes

20:14.680 --> 20:19.160
up this is going to happen next year yeah it's going to be a little way away i know that and we

20:19.160 --> 20:25.880
had a keynote the other day before and it's about uh yeah we are going to find heat the

20:26.440 --> 20:31.720
his talk was basically uh that they already have implemented in modeling like together hybrid model

20:31.720 --> 20:35.960
together with the AI of quantum machine learning some banking so like i said i think that some of

20:35.960 --> 20:40.520
the things will be will be but like you said the full power of it like so the the regular person

20:41.000 --> 20:47.160
uh can can see that that that's like i totally be five or ten years i would like to be five years

20:47.160 --> 20:52.360
but you're the expert in these sizes this matters so i need to to to believe in your word that it's

20:52.360 --> 20:57.160
going to take ten years but still it's going to be uh not only uh people need to have said it's not

20:57.160 --> 21:02.680
going to be ten ten years like just if you not do anything there is a lot of the road ahead of us

21:02.680 --> 21:07.480
so basically my question is our company is ready basically to embrace the quantum machine learning

21:07.480 --> 21:14.280
in day-to-day operation and if yes or not what is needed to get into quantum and have for example

21:14.280 --> 21:19.400
five years from now quantum machine learning departments yeah well i encourage people if

21:19.400 --> 21:23.800
they're interested in moving into this field um maybe they're data scientists today software

21:23.800 --> 21:29.480
developers machine learning engineers to start learning about quantum physics if you're very young

21:29.480 --> 21:36.360
you know going to university doing an undergraduate or even a graduate uh degree um you know physics

21:36.360 --> 21:42.840
isn't isn't a bad option today you know um before it was computer science machine learning today

21:42.840 --> 21:46.360
there's going to be because it's quantum computing there'll still be a computing computer science

21:46.360 --> 21:50.840
element software engineering element but there's going to be a little bit of physics as well

21:50.840 --> 21:57.400
so it's a little bit of a hybrid and it's unclear whether people are going to really be able to

21:57.400 --> 22:04.920
join the two together in a single person um maybe we'll just you know it's it's tough because normally

22:04.920 --> 22:10.280
people love physics or they love computer science and there's a little bit of a there's not a whole

22:10.280 --> 22:16.040
bunch of crossover quantum physics is quantum physics software engineering isn't quantum physics so

22:17.000 --> 22:22.360
you know can a software engineer or do they even want to become a physicist does a physicist

22:22.920 --> 22:27.080
want to become a computer scientist it's it's a little bit you know we're going to have to

22:27.080 --> 22:32.680
wait to see how this plays out but education is key alec okay and being said that uh how do you see

22:32.680 --> 22:37.880
a cooperation between academia and the business sector in the quantum field because it seems that

22:37.880 --> 22:44.280
like uh big tech uh companies uh and there are indeed departments at a bit in front of academic

22:44.280 --> 22:50.600
circles uh this can say to be a true statement and what are your thoughts on this subject do you

22:50.600 --> 22:56.600
think that it's enough or it need to be better if so how it can be better yeah well i've already

22:56.600 --> 23:01.880
seen we're already starting to see companies like google and amazon and microsoft hiring away from

23:01.880 --> 23:07.400
university so it's a little bit uh concerning in a way but we did see the same thing happening with

23:07.400 --> 23:13.080
machine learning um all of the big companies like google just hired everybody from university and and

23:13.080 --> 23:18.840
you know it it saves sort of i've noticed they've sort of gone back to university part time so but

23:18.840 --> 23:23.320
initially there'll be this huge brain drain i think from university because it's very limited

23:23.320 --> 23:29.960
there's a few professors a couple of postdocs um and you know they need it we need a lot more

23:29.960 --> 23:36.280
phds and you know quantum engineering and quantum computing um these these degrees didn't exist five

23:36.280 --> 23:44.120
years ago so you know we're at the very beginning um and so we i am seeing if you go to amazon uh

23:44.120 --> 23:50.520
website and look at quantum computing careers you will see you know they're looking for postdoc

23:50.520 --> 23:56.680
level people today they can't hire enough same as google same as ibm they just simply cannot get

23:56.680 --> 24:03.320
enough people with the right skill set this is interesting what what just for our audience

24:03.400 --> 24:07.960
that can get a bit better of you what what the amount of people we are talking right now

24:07.960 --> 24:12.760
to have like what what the amount of people do you think that one amazon one google need to have

24:12.760 --> 24:19.400
like just to make it with what they would like to have as a progress in the quantum field right

24:19.400 --> 24:23.640
well i think ibm is a little further ahead they probably have the biggest conan uh engineering

24:23.640 --> 24:29.800
team um but i noticed uh google and amazon have about a hundred people now between 100 and 200

24:29.800 --> 24:34.760
they've scaled up in the last two or three years yeah to 100 200 they probably want to double that

24:34.760 --> 24:40.120
over the next two or three years as well and eventually end up with about a thousand plus

24:40.120 --> 24:46.040
so we need it'll ramp up exponentially so the number of people required will probably always

24:46.040 --> 24:51.560
lag the demand um as we go forward because it does take three or four years to train somebody

24:51.560 --> 24:55.480
you know to become a good machine learning engineer a good quantum computing guy

24:55.560 --> 24:59.720
or girl i mean it does take four or five years it doesn't happen overnight so

24:59.720 --> 25:04.120
there's going to be a little bit of a ramp up yeah and basically uh what and this is like

25:05.480 --> 25:10.760
one of the questions i want to ask this because uh i want to just to share with our audience that

25:10.760 --> 25:15.720
basically what we are saying that right now in the world there is just a couple of hundred maybe

25:15.720 --> 25:21.880
a couple of thousand at most like i think it's too much to say a couple of thousand of people who

25:21.880 --> 25:27.240
are doing the for doing machine learning it's not that much yeah but no no no maybe the whole

25:27.240 --> 25:32.680
quantum computing what would be a couple of thousand but quantum machine learning maybe 200 yeah yeah

25:32.680 --> 25:37.240
yeah that's right and uh basically what what can be a good thing like basically if you're thinking

25:37.240 --> 25:42.520
about uh about doing quantum it's not that easy like to switch to quantum because you need to

25:42.520 --> 25:47.320
understand quantum mechanics on the first yeah it is somebody who studied that i can i can tell you

25:47.320 --> 25:52.120
people if you if you saw Brilliant Minds and you didn't or some film about Einstein you didn't

25:52.120 --> 25:56.840
understand the the something that's written on the backboard that's really true what is written

25:56.840 --> 26:02.440
and that's quantum mechanics most probably but what would be your advice to someone who would like

26:02.440 --> 26:07.240
to start the quantum career in terms of like students and in terms of somebody who'd like to

26:07.240 --> 26:13.240
get the pre-qualification or yeah maybe this advice yeah well i think we're seeing physicists

26:13.240 --> 26:19.960
already become computational physicists and in the classical sense so they'll just be able to become

26:19.960 --> 26:27.560
quantum computing at the end of the day quantum computing will be just another type of computer

26:27.560 --> 26:33.400
in the cloud co-located in the data center along with the classical computers maybe there'll be

26:33.400 --> 26:39.880
neuromorphic computing as well it's just another form of computing and it's only for a very specific

26:39.880 --> 26:44.680
type of problem it's not won't solve every problem websites will still run on classical

26:44.680 --> 26:52.120
computers so to train to get there you you sort of there's two ways of getting there one is to

26:52.120 --> 26:57.320
start with the physics background and move into quantum and move into computer science the other

26:57.320 --> 27:02.920
is to start with the computer science background and learn the quantum and you know that might be a

27:02.920 --> 27:08.920
little harder i think than a physicist to learn computer i i'm thinking because it's just a very

27:08.920 --> 27:16.120
specific skill set is you know it's just i mean i did physics and i know it's not for everybody

27:16.120 --> 27:21.400
it's a lot of math okay there's a lot of math yeah that's like that that's a good output that that's

27:21.400 --> 27:26.120
what i'm talking about there's a lot of people in the science field for doing very good because they

27:26.120 --> 27:32.200
understand they are they are mathematical uh basically aperture before this to talk about

27:32.440 --> 27:38.360
math it's very very hard it's very very on some other level but uh okay my last question before

27:38.360 --> 27:46.040
we go to your final remark is what would be uh the first problem you would like to see solve

27:46.040 --> 27:53.560
with quantum machine learning oh man the first problem yeah i was going one computing yeah if

27:53.560 --> 27:59.080
it's kind of computing i'd say i want to simulate materials and you know build better solar cells

27:59.640 --> 28:04.360
and better semiconductor and better batteries if it's quantum machine learning i think like

28:04.360 --> 28:11.400
i said earlier it's always going to be a hybrid classical quantum situation so it can be used

28:11.400 --> 28:17.800
for simulating material science it can be sim it can be used for optimization problems it can be

28:17.800 --> 28:24.760
used for um you know anything that machine learning classical machine learning which is

28:24.840 --> 28:31.960
basically good at you know pattern recognition and it will accelerate that process so i mean it's

28:31.960 --> 28:38.040
it's almost any any field you can think of that machine learning is already used in so you know

28:38.040 --> 28:44.760
you can work in a bank optimization of optimizing portfolios you can work in a transport company

28:44.760 --> 28:51.880
optimizing traffic routes with quantum machine learning you know you can um yeah maybe in medicine

28:51.880 --> 28:57.240
you know alpha fold the deep mind protein folding i would love to see them using quantum

28:57.240 --> 29:02.760
computing to speed that up as well as it as with everybody so any machine learning problem can be

29:02.760 --> 29:08.040
you know given a little boost with these quantum computers from my point of view what i would like

29:08.040 --> 29:13.400
to see is to try uh quantum machine learning and what you'll get in combination with quantum

29:13.400 --> 29:18.440
computing it's in relation of black holes for example yeah that'd be great that'd be amazing

29:19.160 --> 29:24.120
i think that there's something that we can learn a lot of it from from the very fabric of the universe

29:24.120 --> 29:31.000
and maybe get from that question we can move on to to the maybe the the the ultimate question of

29:31.000 --> 29:37.080
them all are we alone in this universe maybe yeah yeah that can be a second thing like

29:37.080 --> 29:42.280
doing after that like i don't know i'm i'm i'm coming back to the roots of my astrophysics

29:43.080 --> 29:48.600
so yeah no a lot of people would like that i mean you might not even we might need even

29:48.600 --> 29:54.440
not even the machine learning there i mean um quantum computers are just um perfectly made to

29:54.440 --> 30:00.920
simulate black holes and the big bang because those are 100 quantum systems yeah so so you

30:00.920 --> 30:06.760
you're you're you're so spot on there that yeah black holes will be a early application when we

30:06.760 --> 30:11.640
make them for sure yeah i was still i think that we need like 10 years but still in 10 yeah we can

30:11.640 --> 30:15.560
simulate black hole people you cannot understand what we can learn from that that's that's something

30:15.560 --> 30:20.440
that that i think it will change not very fabric of our society very fabric of how we are

30:20.440 --> 30:24.760
receiving life like basically and that that's something that it will it will it'll have an

30:24.760 --> 30:30.440
enormous change like on everything but okay that's 10 years from now what i would like to ask you

30:30.440 --> 30:36.360
right now would you like to say anything else to our audience right now as a closing remarks before

30:36.360 --> 30:42.920
we can start with the q and a yeah sure um no not really but if you're interested in quantum

30:42.920 --> 30:47.240
computing don't be put off by the physics just just you know there's a lot of computer science

30:47.240 --> 30:52.840
in there as well a lot of algorithmic theory i mean there's so many different branches uh

30:52.840 --> 30:57.720
in within quantum computing umbrella there's machine learning there's algorithmic complexity

30:57.720 --> 31:04.280
theory there's information theory there's software there's hardware you know there's control systems

31:05.160 --> 31:11.960
so this is a place for everybody so just dive in but i would say to people you know don't be

31:11.960 --> 31:18.840
don't be put off by the quantum physics but there's a lot of work to be done okay Peter thank you so

31:18.840 --> 31:26.440
much for this lovely chat it's all it's always very very pleasant to talk with you and right now

31:26.440 --> 31:32.360
what we are going to do we are going to start with q and a and Peter will join us live to answer

31:32.360 --> 31:38.760
your question hopefully there are going to be a lot of questions okay sure thanks Alec nice to nice

31:38.760 --> 31:50.840
to speak to you again hello everyone hello Peter so you can see me now live okay so basically the

31:50.840 --> 31:56.440
first thing is do we have any question from the audience don't be shy you can raise your hand

31:57.000 --> 32:06.040
there is yes no okay there's two okay let's go here i'll be the one

32:07.960 --> 32:15.320
hi nice to see you again at this conference and shame that you couldn't come to do a live presentation

32:15.320 --> 32:21.080
even so it was great still one of the thing i would like to ask for for somebody who is

32:21.800 --> 32:26.920
devoted to education is how to popularize physics to young generations

32:29.240 --> 32:33.000
yeah that's a good question so i've been doing a little bit of work on this

32:34.200 --> 32:39.720
for various companies it is all about the education at this point because you know there's

32:39.720 --> 32:45.240
this kind of massive ramp up going to be occurring over the next two years a little bit like we saw

32:45.240 --> 32:52.680
with machine learning right so you know a lot of professors leaving academia to be

32:52.680 --> 32:59.400
going to industry we're already seeing that was quantum computing you know physics departments

32:59.400 --> 33:08.360
becoming a little bit depleted already but so but in terms of educating younger folk or people who

33:08.360 --> 33:13.240
want to you know move into this area there are a lot there are actually companies now

33:13.800 --> 33:19.720
creating courses so you don't have to go back to university just like with data science you know

33:19.720 --> 33:25.560
you can do online courses or three month boot camps they're starting to happen IBM have got some

33:25.560 --> 33:31.240
good training material on their website if you just google IBM quiz kit or IBM quantum

33:31.960 --> 33:40.920
and similarly with Microsoft so we're starting to see some of these educational materials appear

33:40.920 --> 33:45.880
online so i would just you know start googling and over the next couple of years we'll see more and

33:45.880 --> 33:52.600
more of this online information and also we'll see universities starting to offer undergraduate

33:52.600 --> 33:57.240
degrees and quantum information science and quantum quantum engineering which are degrees

33:57.240 --> 34:02.920
that don't actually exist at the moment so yeah you know people are addressing it it'll be a little

34:02.920 --> 34:14.120
bit of a slow ramp up over the next few years thank you Peter just another question are you also a

34:14.120 --> 34:22.520
bit afraid that humankind might misuse quantum computing yeah maybe there's always a safety

34:22.520 --> 34:29.240
aspect in any technology right any new technology you know nuclear weapons and you know machine

34:29.240 --> 34:37.160
learning you know AI taking over the world and now rightly so people are considering what could

34:37.160 --> 34:45.960
possibly go wrong with quantum so it's a good question to think about don't stay away too late

34:45.960 --> 34:51.800
at night thinking about it i think you know like any technology it can be used for good or bad right

34:52.280 --> 34:56.440
it does have national strategic importance though so you know governments are probably

34:56.440 --> 35:00.680
doing stuff behind closed doors that will never see the light of day really to be honest

35:01.880 --> 35:06.920
but most of the research has been done at universities and big companies and even startups

35:06.920 --> 35:13.320
nowadays and so you know the hope is you know people will use AI for good good things and

35:13.320 --> 35:19.400
same as similarly with quantum computing we'll be using it to simulate new materials and and

35:20.360 --> 35:27.160
drug discovery you know helping us with quantum machine learning optimization problems and so

35:27.160 --> 35:34.280
those are all good things for humanity but yeah there'll be an arms race you know China Russia

35:34.280 --> 35:41.640
the usual suspects in the west you know it's uh we can't seem to get over that so we can expect

35:41.640 --> 35:46.680
that i mean in some ways it's healthy competition in other ways it's kind of annoying because you

35:46.680 --> 35:51.320
know people start worrying about how you know bad actors are going to use it so you know it's one

35:51.320 --> 35:55.720
of these perennial problems that will never go away we'll never get rid of so we just have to

35:55.720 --> 36:01.320
you know treat it with the respect that it deserves maybe some regulations and legislation

36:01.320 --> 36:06.440
will see happening and but at the end of the day you know there's only so much we can do to limit

36:06.440 --> 36:14.360
bad actors okay do we have any additional question okay i have one question for you it's going to

36:14.360 --> 36:20.120
are you going to put you on the spot here on the light uh so basically Peter who will you

36:20.120 --> 36:28.440
help us to bring at this stage live next year as a quantum keynote speaker i'm sure Alex i'd love

36:28.440 --> 36:35.960
to come back uh to val braid yeah i mean i really enjoyed it last year so sure you and who who

36:35.960 --> 36:42.040
else from which company google or something like that yeah i mean we'll try and get everybody from

36:42.040 --> 36:47.160
the big guys and the startups as well who don't really super interesting stuff so you know the

36:47.160 --> 36:52.440
usual suspects would be google microsoft and ibm and even amazon have a quantum computing

36:53.480 --> 36:59.880
research department now so they're actually making hardware not just putting other companies

36:59.880 --> 37:05.160
can quantum computers on the cloud which you can go and log into now it's called amazon bracket

37:06.040 --> 37:11.720
b r a k e t and you can log into about three different vendors today if you wanted to so we

37:11.720 --> 37:18.200
could get them along so that's four and then we could get maybe four startups okay thanks a lot

37:18.200 --> 37:23.080
okay basically uh if you don't have any additional questions i would like peter once again to thank
