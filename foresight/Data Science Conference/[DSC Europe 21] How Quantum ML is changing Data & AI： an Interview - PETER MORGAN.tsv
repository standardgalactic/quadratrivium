0	8480	Welcome back from lunch. Now we will hear how quantum machine learning is changing data
8480	15240	and artificial intelligence is presented by Peter Morgan who will join us online and later
15240	25000	we can ask some questions so get ready for that.
25000	32360	Hello everyone, maybe you can see me at this position for the first time on this event,
32360	38360	a little bit virtual but we have a special occasion why we are doing like this. We are
38360	44760	having our distinguished keynote speaker from UK London who unfortunately wasn't being able
44760	49960	to join us this year in live but we are sure that Peter has a good friend of conference
49960	57160	and a member of our advisory board will be with us next year maybe even before the conference
57160	64520	in November hopefully especially if these corona measurements will let us do this much more live
64520	74360	events. Like I said we are going to have a keynote interview with our guest Peter Morgan
74360	81160	and it's going to be a kind of family interview which is going to tell us how quantum machine
81160	88600	learning is changing data and AI in every way, in ecosystem way, in sense of academic way,
88600	94120	in sense of how we are doing business. So without further ado I would like to start with the first
94120	100360	question and I would like maybe to give Peter a chance to present himself to our audience.
100680	107480	Hi thanks for inviting me Alec to speak virtually, yeah it is sad I couldn't make it
108440	116120	with all the restrictions it's better that we do it this way. My background is I started
116120	122600	off in physics, quantum physics and I was doing a PhD actually in theoretical particle physics
123320	133800	in the US at Massachusetts there and I left and went into industry and I basically went into
135720	142600	computer networking and then the last eight years I have my own consulting company in machine
142600	148360	learning and artificial intelligence and about four years ago quantum computing came onto my
148360	156760	radar screen and I realized that I could combine you know my love of physics with my IT background
156760	161640	so you know I haven't really looked back in the last four years in the quantum computing space
161640	165560	although it is very early days so I still earn money from machine learning as well.
166920	171000	Okay I would like to ask you one question before on the beginning of interview and on the end of
171000	176840	interview just to see if your answer was changed so basically that question is
177800	183240	quantum computing the way how we can achieve artificial general intelligence?
184200	188840	Yeah that's a great question it may be a part of the solution I don't think it will be the whole
188840	193800	solution because the reason I say that Alec is because our brains are definitely classical
194600	200440	you know we walk around at room temperature we exist at room temperature. Quantum phenomenon has to
200440	207640	be without sort of interacting with the environment whatsoever like so it needs to be usually that
207640	212680	means it has to be called right down so it actually may be a different type of intelligence
212680	218280	but it won't be like biological intelligence. This sounds very interesting okay I would like
218280	225800	also to go to ask you how would you explain a quantum computing for data and air audience
225880	230360	in terms what's the difference between regular computing and quantum computing
230360	234040	and maybe in what stage of quantum development we are right now?
234680	241800	Yeah a couple of great questions so classical computing is what we're all familiar with it's
241800	246600	kind of hard to explain something that's so ubiquitous right we've all grown up with it and
246600	253880	it's you know it's in our hands with the iPhone the Android we have laptops you know classical
253880	264680	computing is done using classical transistors gates and logic circuits classical logic and it
264680	272360	obeys the laws of classical physics and you know we've got what you know 100 billion processors
272360	277480	on a single sorry transistors on a single processor today so they're extremely the most
277480	284760	complex things that humankind is built okay so they're classical but they're extremely complex
284760	288600	quantum computing on the other hand uses the laws of quantum physics so they have quantum
288600	297320	gates they have quantum logic they have quantum yeah quantum transistors basically so these things
297400	305640	just behave so differently from a classical gate or a classical processor CPU GPU
307480	312920	you know there's no comparison at all between them they just use different laws of physics
312920	318520	now the way that quantum computing the reason that people are interested in quantum computing
318520	325480	and making a qpu for example is that the laws of quantum physics means to say we can do everything
325480	330600	in parallel in something called Hilbert space which is the space that quantum physics occupies it's
330600	336840	just the way the universe is built from the big bang outwards it came endowed with this Hilbert
336840	343720	space which means things can be done in parallel which gives it the incredible power and so we
343720	348520	haven't actually built anything that can do anything commercially useful today Alec but
349480	357640	we can certainly prove that they're doing quantum calculations and we're up to about 100 qubits
357640	364600	IBM announced a few days ago 127 qubit processor and so really we needed like millions of qubits
364600	369240	so we were at the very early beginning days of quantum computing which makes it quite exciting
369240	374680	too it's like the 1950s in classical computing that sounds very interesting so basically what
374760	383320	we are saying right now that quantum whatever we can end engineers researchers computers
383320	388120	like developers basically they are some kind of pioneers you can understand correctly is it right
389080	395000	yeah pioneers definitely it feels like being a pioneer right now which is a great place to be
395000	400600	yeah it really is yeah it must have felt like it did with in the 50s with classical computing for
400600	407400	sure you know you know even pre-intel and Bell Labs making the first transistor the kind of it
407400	413480	that that's point right now yeah it's pretty pretty interesting and exciting but again no commercial
413480	419480	applications just yet so business people are not getting maybe as excited about it as as the
419480	427480	scientists for example okay so with this being said I would like to go to maybe okay we are
427480	432440	talking about the new answer like qubit power that we need to utilize the full power quantum
432440	437560	computing with millions of qubits in what span do you think that it is realistic to have this
437560	443960	million of qubits yeah so we're scaling up it's on its own Moore's law the number of qubit seems
443960	452520	to be doubling every year so we've come from you know two to four to eight or 15 now we're at 127
452520	457400	so IBM and Google have actually and iNQ these quantum computing companies who are building
457400	462520	quantum computers have all produced roadmaps out to 2030 which shows the number of qubits doubling
462520	468120	every year so we are on a Moore's law there so it doesn't take it's exponential so it's not going
468120	473880	to take a hundred years to get to a million probably more like 10 15 years now it's not the
473880	483080	number of qubits isn't the only factor we need them to be not noisy and we need them to be well
483080	489880	connected to each other and so these engineering challenges that need to be overcome it's not
489880	495320	a physics thing it's more of an engineering challenge so a lot of work to do to build a
495320	501240	million qubits for sure but we're on the road okay maybe this being said I would like to ask you
501960	506760	uh we started a little bit with uh we started with the quantum computing as a whole and now
506760	511240	let's move to quantum machine learning what is the difference between a quantum machine learning
511240	518120	and regular machine learning yeah so regular machine learning maybe most of the audience
518120	523480	at this conference data science conference are familiar with machine learning so um basically
523480	528680	what quantum computing okay so that's machine learning done on classical computers CPUs GPUs
529240	536040	for example um ASICs etc now where quantum comes in with machine learning is you can
536040	541880	offload a part of that calculation almost like a co-process co-processor situation where you have
541880	548360	some of the calculation machine learning calculations done on the CPU or GPU and the bits that um
548360	554040	will be sped up using quantum are then passed over to the qpu the quantum processing and then back
554040	559400	again back and forth iteratively and so the whole thing won't be done on a qpu it'll be a
559400	564760	co-processor situation so it will be like a classical quantum hybrid so we'll always need
564760	571480	classical computing for machine learning so basically what you're saying and that will be
571480	575640	the second question but first if I understand correctly and it correct me if I'm wrong uh
575640	579960	when we are talking about quantum machine learning we are not talking about classical
579960	585400	turns only quantum machine learning we are talking about the hybrid between uh machine
585400	591720	learning or AI and quantum machine learning yes absolutely alec yeah maybe one day in the far
591720	598040	far distant future everything will be quantum like you sort of need to load quantum data we
598040	603240	haven't got quantum memory yet that seems like a long long way out so basically for this foreseeable
603240	609080	future next 10 to 20 years it will be a classical quantum hybrid system this is this is this is as
609080	615080	excellent question and this is something that that maybe we can uh can be we can uh maybe it's a
615080	621000	cool thing to say so basically uh what is the role of quantum machine learning engineer and
621000	626360	quantum machine learning researcher is there any kind of difference in these roles or they are still
626360	632680	the same but yeah that this yeah that's a good question because really it's fundamentally comes
632680	638280	back to where we are in the quantum computing development um life cycle and because we're at
638280	648120	very early stage um a lot of it is quantum computing research uh at the moment and engineering
648120	653880	a little bit so kind of like a 90-10 percent split we can see that as we progress and build
653880	659880	more powerful processors say with a thousand qubits and start putting them um well they're on the
659880	664680	cloud now but actually they'll be be able to be used for very small commercial applications
664680	670920	we'll need a lot more engineers at that point Alex so that will be to actually um build the
670920	676120	commercial applications that's the point we'll need more engineering okay this is this is this
676120	681880	sounds very interesting so basically just to to to let's say before we go to the the the next
681880	687720	question is so basically right now we are all researchers some of our are in uh developers
687720	692520	but what we'll need like very very fast is somebody who's going to be engineer if I understand
692520	697720	correctly yeah it will ramp up quite quickly again it's on that exponential curve at the very
697720	703560	beginning yes okay we've been saying that can you give us some examples of where quantum machine
703560	710120	learning is already applied is there any kind of right right yeah that's a great no not yet not in
710120	717080	commercial applications so all of this is kind of test um in in uh you know companies it's not just
717080	722680	in the lab and university labs it's in quantum uh it's in companies who are wanting to become
722680	730040	quantum ready like uh big investment banks uh big pharma companies material science companies
730040	736360	we're talking we're thinking um black so smith Klein Bosch um you know goldman sacks these have
736360	742440	all got quantum computing departments with 20 or so researchers and engineers and developers
743000	749080	working on these algorithms today whether that's machine learning optimization you know pharma
749080	755160	material science simulation so yeah quantum machine learning is a part of the whole picture
755160	761320	but there are other elements too like simulation and optimization as well as machine learning
761320	766520	but so like I say there are companies hiring but I think at this point you know you sort of need
766520	772840	a phd in you know quantum science or quantum information um it's it's a little too early for
772840	778760	them to be employing just just a developer with no quantum knowledge so we have time to skill up
778760	785880	okay and one let's say one personal question for you in which uh industry you would like to
785880	792120	be part of quantum machine learning project yeah so I'm focusing that is most let's say
792120	796760	compelling to you to try quantum machine learning you personally yeah yeah personally I'm
796760	803400	focusing focused on the simulation aspect so that's material science um semiconductors photovoltaic
803400	811400	cells so you know um directly addressing climate change with uh you know also battery physics um
811400	818360	so yeah I mean it's it's it's um a huge very ambitious sort of project and we're just starting
818360	823160	but uh once these quantum computers become bigger we'll be able to simulate battery physics we
823160	829240	able to simulate semiconductors and a lot of photovoltaic cells are made out of semiconductors
829240	835800	for example uh as well as something called perovskite basically it's simulating nature at the um
835800	843240	molecular level um which was Feynman said in 1981 we can simulate physics with a quantum computer
843240	850120	and by golly uh it it looks like a great problem because it doesn't look so easy and 40 years later
850120	854760	where we're just at the very beginning of doing that so it is exciting this sounds very interesting
854760	860040	and basically what is this this important thing to uh to understand not only for data and AI uh
860040	864760	experts and uh leaders but also for software engineers and IT industry as whole because
864760	871240	in the end there you can we can talk about okay we will just add uh unbelievable number of I didn't
871240	878680	know uh computer computational power but in the end computational like hard disks uh processor
878680	885400	they have limitation of physical world without developing further quantum realm and development
885400	890840	in the quantum realm whatever we can we can follow like this we are we are we are we are bounded by
890840	895720	the limitation right now like I don't know if you heard about that this project they are trying to
895720	902840	to to to close a bigger close of the gap between uh between the two two semiconductors but the
902840	907800	basic and the chips because it's very hard not to have like electricity when it's closer to some
907800	914120	kind of nanometers but like I said yeah it can be done but so like I said yeah limited in one part
914120	920600	no that's right so classical computers um we we have to make so many approximations when we try to
920600	925400	model a semiconductor or any kind of battery physics or any physics at the any kind of
925400	931480	molecular dynamics including drugs drug discovery molecular docking um so many approximate because
931480	936280	basically we're solving the Schrodinger equation many body Schrodinger equation for all of these
936280	941160	systems which are quantum systems and we cannot do that directly on a classical computer we we're
941160	946600	using approximations so we're so limited so in that respect if quantum and if and when
946600	952520	quantum computers come along we can simulate these systems directly um it'll be no contest um it'll
952520	958760	be amazing progress will be amazing and fast and swift and meaningful and impactful we're talking
958760	964840	drug discovery solar panels batteries a lot of problems are just waiting a lot of low hanging
964840	973480	fruit we're just waiting on the hardware only that that's the only like yeah the most expensive
973480	980680	parties all the time yeah yeah what we we are like uh we are we are low on okay yeah uh what
980680	986280	i would like to also ask is the one part this is the future with quantum like because uh what
986280	992120	i what i'm like personally and what we are seeing like as a as a society that uh we are witnessing
992120	997160	that ai is basically changed the very fabric of our society on every level and people cannot
997160	1001640	realize because it's day to day but when you make comparison like five years ago and now
1001640	1006280	basically we made a progress that is unmatchable it's not only like because of the covid crisis
1006280	1012840	we needed to adopt the digitalization etc but because you have adopted analytics
1012840	1018760	data science and ai so the fair question would be what changes to the society's quantum bringing
1019960	1025160	yeah though i mean i've worked in the machine learning area you know i haven't i saw my day
1025160	1030840	job as is a is a machine learning and i've totally agree with you about the exponential increase in
1031640	1039080	you know processing power and and data and you know just just algorithmic advancement and it's
1039080	1046280	been astonishing if we see a similar type of um progress in quantum computing we can we can expect
1046280	1057800	to see um as impactful if not more impactful um advancements to society for sure um i mentioned
1058680	1064520	you know uh attacking the climate change problem through material science if we can model all
1064520	1070280	these materials and build more efficient materials that's huge if we get a 10 percent gain even 100
1070280	1076280	percent gain in efficiency in a solar panel i mean that that's a trillion dollar industry no doubt
1076280	1082440	about it um yeah maybe more same with batteries with electric cars yeah i mean another trillion
1082680	1088200	dollar industry um semiconductors you know another trillion dollar industry i mean it's just
1088200	1092360	basically what you're saying is that that's all i need to develop quantum computers so they can be
1093320	1098280	yeah yeah we're definitely waiting on the hardware alec but there are there are several
1098280	1104040	kind of thrusts there's iron traps there's superconducting there's photonics there's um
1104920	1110840	cold atoms and there's topological so we don't really know who's going to win in the end with
1110840	1115880	the hardware i mean microsoft is working on topological google are doing an ibm are doing
1115880	1124040	superconducting um i and q and honeywell are doing iron traps um so again that's quite exciting to
1124040	1129640	to wonder and you know who nobody knows who the eventual winner will be maybe there'll be a few
1129640	1135080	winners um different applications for different types of hardware um but it's just going to take
1135080	1139960	a little bit of time alec we just have to be a little bit patient okay but also i would like to
1139960	1144840	to come back closer to my question so basically uh once again uh what do you think like for the
1144840	1153080	like like a regular regular person how much uh dear or her or his uh life will be impacted by
1153080	1157480	the quantum technology like five or ten years from now what is your expectation basically from the
1157480	1162760	from the point of one single person yeah i would say in ten years we're going to start to see a lot
1162760	1167480	five years will still be a little bit r and d phase these things will live in the cloud we won't
1167480	1172920	have them in our hands like you know the phone so they'll be at a distance so it'll be more
1173480	1179240	in the background we'll notice solar panels solar cells solar electricity becoming more
1179240	1184440	prominent and efficient and cheaper so perhaps the average person like you and i will notice
1184440	1191240	the cost of electricity coming down uh a speed up in process of power um you know better batteries
1191240	1196600	in our electric cars when everybody's buying them because it is policy now isn't it with the climate
1196600	1203080	change um conference the other week um you know governments are getting serious about moving to
1203080	1208920	all electric cars and moving to solar energy so that's i think where the average person will notice
1208920	1214680	it more possibly in drug discovery but we're looking ten years out i don't want to get anybody's hopes
1214680	1219160	up this is going to happen next year yeah it's going to be a little way away i know that and we
1219160	1225880	had a keynote the other day before and it's about uh yeah we are going to find heat the
1226440	1231720	his talk was basically uh that they already have implemented in modeling like together hybrid model
1231720	1235960	together with the AI of quantum machine learning some banking so like i said i think that some of
1235960	1240520	the things will be will be but like you said the full power of it like so the the regular person
1241000	1247160	uh can can see that that that's like i totally be five or ten years i would like to be five years
1247160	1252360	but you're the expert in these sizes this matters so i need to to to believe in your word that it's
1252360	1257160	going to take ten years but still it's going to be uh not only uh people need to have said it's not
1257160	1262680	going to be ten ten years like just if you not do anything there is a lot of the road ahead of us
1262680	1267480	so basically my question is our company is ready basically to embrace the quantum machine learning
1267480	1274280	in day-to-day operation and if yes or not what is needed to get into quantum and have for example
1274280	1279400	five years from now quantum machine learning departments yeah well i encourage people if
1279400	1283800	they're interested in moving into this field um maybe they're data scientists today software
1283800	1289480	developers machine learning engineers to start learning about quantum physics if you're very young
1289480	1296360	you know going to university doing an undergraduate or even a graduate uh degree um you know physics
1296360	1302840	isn't isn't a bad option today you know um before it was computer science machine learning today
1302840	1306360	there's going to be because it's quantum computing there'll still be a computing computer science
1306360	1310840	element software engineering element but there's going to be a little bit of physics as well
1310840	1317400	so it's a little bit of a hybrid and it's unclear whether people are going to really be able to
1317400	1324920	join the two together in a single person um maybe we'll just you know it's it's tough because normally
1324920	1330280	people love physics or they love computer science and there's a little bit of a there's not a whole
1330280	1336040	bunch of crossover quantum physics is quantum physics software engineering isn't quantum physics so
1337000	1342360	you know can a software engineer or do they even want to become a physicist does a physicist
1342920	1347080	want to become a computer scientist it's it's a little bit you know we're going to have to
1347080	1352680	wait to see how this plays out but education is key alec okay and being said that uh how do you see
1352680	1357880	a cooperation between academia and the business sector in the quantum field because it seems that
1357880	1364280	like uh big tech uh companies uh and there are indeed departments at a bit in front of academic
1364280	1370600	circles uh this can say to be a true statement and what are your thoughts on this subject do you
1370600	1376600	think that it's enough or it need to be better if so how it can be better yeah well i've already
1376600	1381880	seen we're already starting to see companies like google and amazon and microsoft hiring away from
1381880	1387400	university so it's a little bit uh concerning in a way but we did see the same thing happening with
1387400	1393080	machine learning um all of the big companies like google just hired everybody from university and and
1393080	1398840	you know it it saves sort of i've noticed they've sort of gone back to university part time so but
1398840	1403320	initially there'll be this huge brain drain i think from university because it's very limited
1403320	1409960	there's a few professors a couple of postdocs um and you know they need it we need a lot more
1409960	1416280	phds and you know quantum engineering and quantum computing um these these degrees didn't exist five
1416280	1424120	years ago so you know we're at the very beginning um and so we i am seeing if you go to amazon uh
1424120	1430520	website and look at quantum computing careers you will see you know they're looking for postdoc
1430520	1436680	level people today they can't hire enough same as google same as ibm they just simply cannot get
1436680	1443320	enough people with the right skill set this is interesting what what just for our audience
1443400	1447960	that can get a bit better of you what what the amount of people we are talking right now
1447960	1452760	to have like what what the amount of people do you think that one amazon one google need to have
1452760	1459400	like just to make it with what they would like to have as a progress in the quantum field right
1459400	1463640	well i think ibm is a little further ahead they probably have the biggest conan uh engineering
1463640	1469800	team um but i noticed uh google and amazon have about a hundred people now between 100 and 200
1469800	1474760	they've scaled up in the last two or three years yeah to 100 200 they probably want to double that
1474760	1480120	over the next two or three years as well and eventually end up with about a thousand plus
1480120	1486040	so we need it'll ramp up exponentially so the number of people required will probably always
1486040	1491560	lag the demand um as we go forward because it does take three or four years to train somebody
1491560	1495480	you know to become a good machine learning engineer a good quantum computing guy
1495560	1499720	or girl i mean it does take four or five years it doesn't happen overnight so
1499720	1504120	there's going to be a little bit of a ramp up yeah and basically uh what and this is like
1505480	1510760	one of the questions i want to ask this because uh i want to just to share with our audience that
1510760	1515720	basically what we are saying that right now in the world there is just a couple of hundred maybe
1515720	1521880	a couple of thousand at most like i think it's too much to say a couple of thousand of people who
1521880	1527240	are doing the for doing machine learning it's not that much yeah but no no no maybe the whole
1527240	1532680	quantum computing what would be a couple of thousand but quantum machine learning maybe 200 yeah yeah
1532680	1537240	yeah that's right and uh basically what what can be a good thing like basically if you're thinking
1537240	1542520	about uh about doing quantum it's not that easy like to switch to quantum because you need to
1542520	1547320	understand quantum mechanics on the first yeah it is somebody who studied that i can i can tell you
1547320	1552120	people if you if you saw Brilliant Minds and you didn't or some film about Einstein you didn't
1552120	1556840	understand the the something that's written on the backboard that's really true what is written
1556840	1562440	and that's quantum mechanics most probably but what would be your advice to someone who would like
1562440	1567240	to start the quantum career in terms of like students and in terms of somebody who'd like to
1567240	1573240	get the pre-qualification or yeah maybe this advice yeah well i think we're seeing physicists
1573240	1579960	already become computational physicists and in the classical sense so they'll just be able to become
1579960	1587560	quantum computing at the end of the day quantum computing will be just another type of computer
1587560	1593400	in the cloud co-located in the data center along with the classical computers maybe there'll be
1593400	1599880	neuromorphic computing as well it's just another form of computing and it's only for a very specific
1599880	1604680	type of problem it's not won't solve every problem websites will still run on classical
1604680	1612120	computers so to train to get there you you sort of there's two ways of getting there one is to
1612120	1617320	start with the physics background and move into quantum and move into computer science the other
1617320	1622920	is to start with the computer science background and learn the quantum and you know that might be a
1622920	1628920	little harder i think than a physicist to learn computer i i'm thinking because it's just a very
1628920	1636120	specific skill set is you know it's just i mean i did physics and i know it's not for everybody
1636120	1641400	it's a lot of math okay there's a lot of math yeah that's like that that's a good output that that's
1641400	1646120	what i'm talking about there's a lot of people in the science field for doing very good because they
1646120	1652200	understand they are they are mathematical uh basically aperture before this to talk about
1652440	1658360	math it's very very hard it's very very on some other level but uh okay my last question before
1658360	1666040	we go to your final remark is what would be uh the first problem you would like to see solve
1666040	1673560	with quantum machine learning oh man the first problem yeah i was going one computing yeah if
1673560	1679080	it's kind of computing i'd say i want to simulate materials and you know build better solar cells
1679640	1684360	and better semiconductor and better batteries if it's quantum machine learning i think like
1684360	1691400	i said earlier it's always going to be a hybrid classical quantum situation so it can be used
1691400	1697800	for simulating material science it can be sim it can be used for optimization problems it can be
1697800	1704760	used for um you know anything that machine learning classical machine learning which is
1704840	1711960	basically good at you know pattern recognition and it will accelerate that process so i mean it's
1711960	1718040	it's almost any any field you can think of that machine learning is already used in so you know
1718040	1724760	you can work in a bank optimization of optimizing portfolios you can work in a transport company
1724760	1731880	optimizing traffic routes with quantum machine learning you know you can um yeah maybe in medicine
1731880	1737240	you know alpha fold the deep mind protein folding i would love to see them using quantum
1737240	1742760	computing to speed that up as well as it as with everybody so any machine learning problem can be
1742760	1748040	you know given a little boost with these quantum computers from my point of view what i would like
1748040	1753400	to see is to try uh quantum machine learning and what you'll get in combination with quantum
1753400	1758440	computing it's in relation of black holes for example yeah that'd be great that'd be amazing
1759160	1764120	i think that there's something that we can learn a lot of it from from the very fabric of the universe
1764120	1771000	and maybe get from that question we can move on to to the maybe the the the ultimate question of
1771000	1777080	them all are we alone in this universe maybe yeah yeah that can be a second thing like
1777080	1782280	doing after that like i don't know i'm i'm i'm coming back to the roots of my astrophysics
1783080	1788600	so yeah no a lot of people would like that i mean you might not even we might need even
1788600	1794440	not even the machine learning there i mean um quantum computers are just um perfectly made to
1794440	1800920	simulate black holes and the big bang because those are 100 quantum systems yeah so so you
1800920	1806760	you're you're you're so spot on there that yeah black holes will be a early application when we
1806760	1811640	make them for sure yeah i was still i think that we need like 10 years but still in 10 yeah we can
1811640	1815560	simulate black hole people you cannot understand what we can learn from that that's that's something
1815560	1820440	that that i think it will change not very fabric of our society very fabric of how we are
1820440	1824760	receiving life like basically and that that's something that it will it will it'll have an
1824760	1830440	enormous change like on everything but okay that's 10 years from now what i would like to ask you
1830440	1836360	right now would you like to say anything else to our audience right now as a closing remarks before
1836360	1842920	we can start with the q and a yeah sure um no not really but if you're interested in quantum
1842920	1847240	computing don't be put off by the physics just just you know there's a lot of computer science
1847240	1852840	in there as well a lot of algorithmic theory i mean there's so many different branches uh
1852840	1857720	in within quantum computing umbrella there's machine learning there's algorithmic complexity
1857720	1864280	theory there's information theory there's software there's hardware you know there's control systems
1865160	1871960	so this is a place for everybody so just dive in but i would say to people you know don't be
1871960	1878840	don't be put off by the quantum physics but there's a lot of work to be done okay Peter thank you so
1878840	1886440	much for this lovely chat it's all it's always very very pleasant to talk with you and right now
1886440	1892360	what we are going to do we are going to start with q and a and Peter will join us live to answer
1892360	1898760	your question hopefully there are going to be a lot of questions okay sure thanks Alec nice to nice
1898760	1910840	to speak to you again hello everyone hello Peter so you can see me now live okay so basically the
1910840	1916440	first thing is do we have any question from the audience don't be shy you can raise your hand
1917000	1926040	there is yes no okay there's two okay let's go here i'll be the one
1927960	1935320	hi nice to see you again at this conference and shame that you couldn't come to do a live presentation
1935320	1941080	even so it was great still one of the thing i would like to ask for for somebody who is
1941800	1946920	devoted to education is how to popularize physics to young generations
1949240	1953000	yeah that's a good question so i've been doing a little bit of work on this
1954200	1959720	for various companies it is all about the education at this point because you know there's
1959720	1965240	this kind of massive ramp up going to be occurring over the next two years a little bit like we saw
1965240	1972680	with machine learning right so you know a lot of professors leaving academia to be
1972680	1979400	going to industry we're already seeing that was quantum computing you know physics departments
1979400	1988360	becoming a little bit depleted already but so but in terms of educating younger folk or people who
1988360	1993240	want to you know move into this area there are a lot there are actually companies now
1993800	1999720	creating courses so you don't have to go back to university just like with data science you know
1999720	2005560	you can do online courses or three month boot camps they're starting to happen IBM have got some
2005560	2011240	good training material on their website if you just google IBM quiz kit or IBM quantum
2011960	2020920	and similarly with Microsoft so we're starting to see some of these educational materials appear
2020920	2025880	online so i would just you know start googling and over the next couple of years we'll see more and
2025880	2032600	more of this online information and also we'll see universities starting to offer undergraduate
2032600	2037240	degrees and quantum information science and quantum quantum engineering which are degrees
2037240	2042920	that don't actually exist at the moment so yeah you know people are addressing it it'll be a little
2042920	2054120	bit of a slow ramp up over the next few years thank you Peter just another question are you also a
2054120	2062520	bit afraid that humankind might misuse quantum computing yeah maybe there's always a safety
2062520	2069240	aspect in any technology right any new technology you know nuclear weapons and you know machine
2069240	2077160	learning you know AI taking over the world and now rightly so people are considering what could
2077160	2085960	possibly go wrong with quantum so it's a good question to think about don't stay away too late
2085960	2091800	at night thinking about it i think you know like any technology it can be used for good or bad right
2092280	2096440	it does have national strategic importance though so you know governments are probably
2096440	2100680	doing stuff behind closed doors that will never see the light of day really to be honest
2101880	2106920	but most of the research has been done at universities and big companies and even startups
2106920	2113320	nowadays and so you know the hope is you know people will use AI for good good things and
2113320	2119400	same as similarly with quantum computing we'll be using it to simulate new materials and and
2120360	2127160	drug discovery you know helping us with quantum machine learning optimization problems and so
2127160	2134280	those are all good things for humanity but yeah there'll be an arms race you know China Russia
2134280	2141640	the usual suspects in the west you know it's uh we can't seem to get over that so we can expect
2141640	2146680	that i mean in some ways it's healthy competition in other ways it's kind of annoying because you
2146680	2151320	know people start worrying about how you know bad actors are going to use it so you know it's one
2151320	2155720	of these perennial problems that will never go away we'll never get rid of so we just have to
2155720	2161320	you know treat it with the respect that it deserves maybe some regulations and legislation
2161320	2166440	will see happening and but at the end of the day you know there's only so much we can do to limit
2166440	2174360	bad actors okay do we have any additional question okay i have one question for you it's going to
2174360	2180120	are you going to put you on the spot here on the light uh so basically Peter who will you
2180120	2188440	help us to bring at this stage live next year as a quantum keynote speaker i'm sure Alex i'd love
2188440	2195960	to come back uh to val braid yeah i mean i really enjoyed it last year so sure you and who who
2195960	2202040	else from which company google or something like that yeah i mean we'll try and get everybody from
2202040	2207160	the big guys and the startups as well who don't really super interesting stuff so you know the
2207160	2212440	usual suspects would be google microsoft and ibm and even amazon have a quantum computing
2213480	2219880	research department now so they're actually making hardware not just putting other companies
2219880	2225160	can quantum computers on the cloud which you can go and log into now it's called amazon bracket
2226040	2231720	b r a k e t and you can log into about three different vendors today if you wanted to so we
2231720	2238200	could get them along so that's four and then we could get maybe four startups okay thanks a lot
2238200	2243080	okay basically uh if you don't have any additional questions i would like peter once again to thank
2243080	2247880	you like tatina said i'm looking forward to see you again here in belgium live when the corona
2247880	2253400	hopefully next year will be it will give us a little bit of slack uh we are moving forward with
2253400	2258120	the program i think that we are having like a small break or something like that but i will let
2258120	2264120	zonan he know better than me it's okay people like to watch you uh we have like five minutes
2265000	2272280	before we uh are joined by simon boyden who is going to follow with his presentation it's going
2272280	2281000	to be a very interesting one about about wimbledon tennis championship so be sure to be here in five
2281000	2291000	minutes because we are starting a sharp time because he's joining us virtually thank you
