1. The ability to digest lactose as adults is beneficial in societies where milk is a common food source, providing more energy from the same amount of milk compared to those who cannot digest lactose as adults.
   
2. Lactose tolerance likely spread among human populations due to its advantages, especially among pastoralist groups who relied heavily on milk from domesticated animals like cows, sheep, goats, and horses.

3. The Indo-European expansion is thought to be partly facilitated by their lactose tolerance, which allowed them to extract more nutrients from milk, giving them a significant biological advantage over other populations.

4. This biological advantage was not something that could be stolen or copied by the invaded; it was an intrinsic trait of the Indo-Europeans that contributed to their success in spreading across continents.

5. The ability to drink mare's milk, which is high in fat and protein but lower in lactose compared to cow's milk, further emphasizes the importance of lactose tolerance for pastoralist groups.

6. Even in populations without lactose tolerance, such as the Bantu-speaking Herrero women in southern Africa who consume large amounts of milk, the body adapts to avoid being poisoned by the undigested lactose.

7. The spread of lactose tolerance across human populations is an example of how a genetic mutation can confer a significant survival and reproductive advantage, leading to widespread distribution due to its benefits.
