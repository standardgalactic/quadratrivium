1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
The special speaker that we have today is Professor Ahmed

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,600
Al-Gamal.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,540
He's a professor in the Department of Computer Science

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,560
at Rutgers University and also the founder of the Art

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,200
and Artificial Intelligence Lab at Rutgers.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,920
So let us ask Professor Al-Gamal to be a little more

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,040
introduce themselves and give us a little background

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,480
and talk.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,040
One thing that I wanted to mention

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,840
is that his talk is today is about the shape of the art

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,240
history in the eyes of the machine.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,320
And I think that he has done many interesting work

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,680
in the realm of understanding the patterns and evolution

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,920
of art through the history.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,680
Please go ahead.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,640
Thank you.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,320
Thank you very much.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,680
Thank you for inviting me and thank everybody who is here.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,280
I'll start by answering a question you asked earlier

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
about why I'm doing this.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,640
And I think it will be more also clear during the talk.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,960
Basically, during my high school years,

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,440
I mean, I was raised up in Alexandria, Egypt.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,280
And when you raise up in the country,

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,400
it all has to be like that.

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,840
You see a lot of archaeology and history and art.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,640
And I really wanted to study archaeology and art history.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,200
That was really my passion.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,240
But at the same time, computer science

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,920
was something totally new at that time around the 1990s.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,520
And I was fascinated by it.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
I had to choose a major.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,320
So everybody would tell me, if you go to archaeology,

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,560
art history, you'll have no career and make no money.

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,320
And I went to study computer science.

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,920
And for the last 25 years, I've been doing AI.

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,000
But I find that actually my passion is really in art.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Every time I go to the division conference,

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,440
I escape 90% of the conference.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,800
And I go to galleries and museums rather than

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,720
attending the sessions.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,280
And I realize I have to do something about it.

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,320
And it will be clear in the talk basically

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,720
how I moved into doing that and why I moved to do that.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
So let me just start right away by sharing my screen.

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
So basically, as an AI researcher,

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,120
or when I look at images like that,

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,440
I mean, we'll be very happy if the machine will recognize

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,920
there's a man, there's a woman, there's fruits, there's trees.

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,440
There are trees and things like that.

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,120
That's what we do in vision.

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,080
And that's what I've been doing for a long time also.

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
However, basically, we realize that art, when you look at art,

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
is much more than that.

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,120
There are layers and layers of historical context,

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,880
social context, understanding.

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,960
There are emotions that happens.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,080
I mean, art is not about object recognition or anything like that.

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
We see it as recognition.

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,600
It's much more.

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,440
And since the ultimate goal of AI research

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
is to make the machine, make machine

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
that have perceptual, cognitive, and intellectual abilities

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,240
similar to those of humans, I find

65
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,280
that analysis of paintings, whatever analysis means,

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,400
involve actually all these tasks, perception, cognition,

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
and intellectual abilities.

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,160
And that's why I think it's very important to advance AI

69
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,360
to look at art and try to understand art the same way human does.

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,120
So basically, I find that the ability to understand and generate

71
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,440
human-level creative products, such as poetry, stories,

72
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,880
jokes, music, paintings, is fundamental

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,160
to show that artificial intelligence algorithm

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
are actually intelligence.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
And the first question that always

76
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,840
being asked when I give talks, especially in humanities,

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,720
with audience from humanities, is how to combine art and AI.

78
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,080
Basically, art is a judgment, which is subjective,

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
and science is objective.

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,760
How can this be combined?

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,120
And that's a very important question.

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,440
And actually, it's rooted in Western philosophy.

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,320
Basically, Western philosophy has blazed aesthetic comprehension

84
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,120
in the realm of subjectivity.

85
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,760
And we can trace that back to Immanuel Kant in 18th century

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,240
when in his book about critique of the judgment,

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,240
when he basically argued that the judgment of taste

88
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,080
is not cognitive judgment, it's not logical,

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,520
but aesthetic, which means that it's

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,600
one whose determinant ground cannot be other than subjective.

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
And that actually shaped the separation between art and science

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
in the last two centuries.

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
So another quote here from Colin Martindale,

94
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
who is a psychology professor at University of Maine,

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
who has a totally different, opposite point of view.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,600
As a scientist, I feel that if everything in the universe

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,680
is governed by laws, then art history must be as well.

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,040
So totally scientific approach, basically nothing is subjective.

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,840
And another viewpoint from Eric Kindle,

100
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,200
who's a neuroscientist and winner of Nobel Prize,

101
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,240
by examining perception of art as an interpretation of science

102
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
we experience, scientific eyes can, in principle,

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,680
describe how the brain perceives and responds to art.

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,160
And let me go into basically saying, can any aspect of art,

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,760
which is creative and subjective experience,

106
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,600
be studied objectively?

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
And finally, a quote from an art historian,

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,240
which is very unusual art historian.

109
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,280
His name is George Kubler from his book, The Shape of Time,

110
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,520
which I'm going to talk about in the talk a little bit later.

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
He's saying basically that art history could

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,320
move to contain unexpected potentiality

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
as a predictive science.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,800
This is very uncommon view in art history.

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,200
So my goal is really to understand

116
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
what art the implication of looking at art

117
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,360
through the eyes of the machine.

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
And by that I mean AI in particular.

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,200
That's why I started the AI lab about maybe eight years ago

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,640
at Rutgers, really focusing on advancing AI by looking at art

121
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,880
and also seeing what can we do about art if we do AI.

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,120
And here are some of my collaborators from art history,

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,400
from fine art, and have been blessed to work

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,000
with many students from Rutgers and from other universities

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,480
as well.

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,760
And these are some of the activities

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,480
that have been done through the years, many others.

128
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,040
And these are some things I'm going to talk about today.

129
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,720
Building models to understand art style, genre,

130
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,280
doing art specification, try to understand influences

131
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,400
between artists, try to understand creativity,

132
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,240
how to quantify creativity, how to generate art,

133
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,720
how to understand the evolution of art history.

134
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,640
Many things have been done during these years.

135
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,560
But let me start by the basics, basically.

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
So how artists talk about art.

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,360
So if you look at an artwork like this amazing Renoir

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,560
painting, basically artists doesn't look at this

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,040
and tell you there are multiple people

140
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,080
or people are eating food or things like that.

141
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Basically talk about artists talk about elements of art,

142
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,840
the space, the texture, the form, the shape, the color,

143
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,160
things like that, principles of art, the movement, the unity,

144
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,520
the harmony, balance, contrast.

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,920
Other topics like subject matter, brushstrokes,

146
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,200
meaning, historical context, social context.

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
All these things are basically what artists talk about when

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,640
talk about art.

149
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,320
Their least concern is things like object or scene

150
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,240
classification and things like that or genre caption.

151
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,120
So our goal really was in the last few years

152
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,680
is trying to quantify each of these elements.

153
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,360
And we have done a lot of work on quantifying each of these

154
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,240
elements.

155
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,560
How to do visual encoding of the image

156
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,520
in order to be able to quantify these elements

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
and principles of art.

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,760
And in particular, one of the very, very important things

159
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,000
in art is the topic of style.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
So what is style?

161
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,640
So basically here, this is a depiction of the last suburb.

162
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,800
So basically the famous painting by DaVinci.

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,560
But DaVinci's painting here is just one of them.

164
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,960
This is much earlier to a version,

165
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,320
a mini version by many artists, to 20th century versions.

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,920
And really in here, you can see what

167
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,120
is the meaning of style in one slide like that.

168
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,040
We're basically depicting the subject matter

169
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,400
in two different ways, depending on historical point

170
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,120
in what happened in art history that

171
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,840
specify how the artist will depict the scene.

172
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,800
And here's the fair thing.

173
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,640
I mean, if you look at this and what artists mean by style

174
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,000
and compare that to what we in computer vision or AI do

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,520
when you do things like style transfer and things like that,

176
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
to theorize, basically, it's a joke that the way we do

177
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,200
style transfer in machine learning and computer vision,

178
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
which is mainly basically meaning taking the ballot

179
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
from one image to another or a texture from one image

180
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
to another has nothing to do with the concept of style

181
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,040
in reality, because the concept of style

182
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,560
is much more deeper than just these simple things.

183
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,880
So the question really is what characterizes the sequence

184
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
and evolution of art style change over time?

185
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
How can we characterize these changes?

186
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,920
And actually what factors drive these changes

187
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,760
of style over time?

188
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,200
Why even artists change style over time?

189
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,120
When that happened, what triggers it

190
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,880
and how to characterize it when it happens?

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,400
Can we build conventional models

192
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,880
that can help answer these questions?

193
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,720
So we started very early with a very simple thing,

194
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,560
which is painting style classification.

195
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,360
You have a bunch of images and you have style labels on them.

196
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,600
So it's really a simple supervised machine learning

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
problem and you wanna classify the painting to think classes

198
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,080
like Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism, Cubism,

199
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,600
abstract things like that.

200
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
So very simple problem.

201
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,920
And we take a painting, we have visual encoding

202
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,720
using different pictures, trying to capture

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,000
the low-level, mid-level, semantic-level picture,

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,440
which are parallel to different concept art, as I mentioned,

205
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,160
and trying different machine learning techniques on them

206
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
and doing supervised learning to classify style.

207
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
And basically this is so progress over the years

208
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,840
from the year 2012, maybe three years ago,

209
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,760
where we have been really trying any new things

210
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,520
that have happened in machine learning and see what it adds.

211
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,200
Things from the time of the bag of words and classmates

212
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,960
and HOGs, if you really remember that,

213
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,280
till the time of CNNs and deep learning.

214
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,160
The number of style classes that have been basically

215
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,840
increasing the number of classes over time,

216
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
trying to get deeper.

217
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,000
But basically how to monitor the progress

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,360
is how to convey to random guess

219
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
how much better you can do than the random guess,

220
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
starting from four times random guess

221
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
to 12 times random guess.

222
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,880
So, okay, and can do better than that.

223
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,360
All right, so we do classification.

224
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,600
The machine can classify style at the level

225
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,360
of maybe a first-year art history students.

226
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,560
If you give it an artwork, it can tell you this is Cubism,

227
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,400
this is Impressionism, this is Renaissance.

228
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,440
Good, the machine can do that.

229
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,800
So what, why that's even important?

230
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,960
So when I talk to Arthur Historian

231
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
about machine classifying style,

232
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,640
he asked me, so what, why that's even important?

233
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,040
And here's why I think it's important.

234
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
Classifying style by the machine

235
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
is not what Arthur Historian,

236
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,680
but actually instead what the important is,

237
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,960
what are that tell us about the characteristics of style

238
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,200
and what drives style changes?

239
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,880
And we know that if the machine can classify style successfully

240
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,240
that implies that the machine has learned

241
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,360
some internal representation that encodes some features,

242
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,480
some discriminative features

243
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,160
through its visual analysis of these art.

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,080
However, we also know that the machine uses visual feature

245
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,560
that's always very hard to interpret by humans.

246
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
So especially if you're doing learning,

247
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,720
so we have to interpret these visual features.

248
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,160
So it's very hard to understand

249
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,400
how the machine did the execution of style

250
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,120
to start with to get something useful.

251
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,600
So we went into studying basically

252
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,240
how the machine identify style

253
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
and if there are a relation between the way

254
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,200
the machine internally represents style

255
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,160
and the way Arthur Historian think about style.

256
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,520
And for that is very important to look at

257
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,400
what, how Arthur Historian look at style.

258
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,240
Here, this is Henrich Wolblin,

259
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,800
one of the founding father of art history, modern art history.

260
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,960
And he basically have a theory about style.

261
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,480
In particular, he looked at how style,

262
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,280
how to separate the study of subject matter

263
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,960
from the study of the visual form, which is style.

264
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,640
And in his book, basically he really studied

265
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,160
the difference between Renaissance and Baroque.

266
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,240
So in the top here is Renaissance artwork

267
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,120
and in the bottom is a Baroque artwork.

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,640
And he suggested basically some visual schema

269
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,000
that you can tell the difference

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,440
between Renaissance art and Baroque art.

271
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Basically, he mentioned five bears of elements.

272
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,960
For example, linear versus binterly.

273
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,320
In Renaissance art, if you look at the contours,

274
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,320
they are very sharp and while in Baroque,

275
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
it's very fuzzy contours.

276
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
That was it linear versus binterly.

277
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
In Renaissance, if all the subjects are in one plane,

278
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,360
while in Baroque, there are depth in the scene.

279
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,680
So this is Blainer versus Recessional.

280
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,680
In Renaissance, everything seemed to be within canvas

281
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,800
while in Baroque, basically you see like a cropped image

282
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
from a bigger scene.

283
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,920
So this is called closed form versus open form.

284
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,640
In Baroque, in Renaissance,

285
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,000
basically every subject by himself or by herself.

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,600
So this multiplicity versus in Baroque, this unity here,

287
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,240
you can see the old subject are part of one unit.

288
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,400
In Renaissance, everything has absolute clarity.

289
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,840
All the scene, everything's in focus

290
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,200
while in Baroque, artists start to have relative clarity.

291
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,920
There are depth, there are things that are in focus,

292
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
things that are out of focus,

293
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,880
depending on what the artist is trying to do.

294
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,640
So he suggested that these five bears

295
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,520
is really what make the difference

296
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,640
between Renaissance and Baroque.

297
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,880
And he even went to say that basically these five bears

298
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,160
are the kind of feature that can classify any style.

299
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,600
So any style variation really goes along these elements.

300
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,760
However, this is very interesting.

301
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,080
However, this is a theory in art history,

302
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,720
which is what we call in math or science,

303
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,960
basically a congestion, not a theory,

304
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,760
because there is no proof of that.

305
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,160
How can we even prove these theories,

306
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,520
especially if you want to generalize it to old styles?

307
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,320
So what we did is really is we're trying to look

308
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,440
at this internal representation of how the machine

309
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,600
classifies style and draw the parallel

310
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,080
to what Wolverine suggested.

311
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,520
So what we did is basically we trained several models,

312
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,560
several CNN models, and we keep doing that.

313
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,520
So things like AlexNet, when they appeared,

314
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,520
VGGNet, ResNet, every CNN model that comes around,

315
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,280
we try that as well.

316
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,240
And the goal is basically to train the machine

317
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,040
to do a style classification in a supervised manner.

318
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,400
But the goal is really is not classification,

319
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,560
the goal is to look at what has been learned here.

320
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,840
So analyze the internal representation

321
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,880
and do some statistical analysis

322
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
and some visualization on top of that.

323
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,880
So after the machine learned style with acceptable accuracy,

324
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,320
we kind of start adding layers in the middle here

325
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,880
to increase the interpretability of the representation.

326
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,160
Basically go down to as small as number

327
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,000
of internal nodes as possible here

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,200
to have more interpretable representation,

329
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,720
doing things like principle component analysis

330
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,720
on the activation, source separation, ICA,

331
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,640
understand looking at the manifolds of activations,

332
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,520
doing correlation with time, correlation with Wolverine,

333
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,800
there's all these kinds of analysis we have done

334
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,120
to understand the representation

335
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,360
and basically some of the results that we found.

336
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,680
So this is the first thing that's very interesting.

337
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,760
We used either B-trained model on ImageNet

338
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,480
that we fine-tuned on Art Collection,

339
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,200
we use WikiArt Collection,

340
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,120
about 70,000 images in our studies.

341
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,400
And by doing that, we reach a accuracy of classification

342
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,600
is about 60% more or less by all these networks.

343
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,480
If you use a data from scratch,

344
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,720
you can actually get 10% less, 50%,

345
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,360
only in 77,000 images out,

346
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,680
they need to be trained on a million ImageNet.

347
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,120
All right, so that's interesting

348
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,440
so we can get reasonable results

349
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,320
even without any pre-training.

350
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,200
But the interesting thing is this,

351
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,800
looking at the filters that the machine learned

352
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,040
if you trained from scratch on style,

353
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,160
you look very different from the filter

354
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,840
that you typically see in object recognition CNNs.

355
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,240
You know in object recognition CNNs,

356
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,800
you always get these Gabor filters

357
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,800
and this edge-like, oriented edge-like filters.

358
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,880
If you look at how the machine look at style only,

359
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,480
look at style construction only, nothing like that.

360
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,080
We don't see almost any edges,

361
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,520
maybe only one filter looks like a horizontal horizon

362
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,680
or something like that.

363
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,960
But other than that,

364
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
it's very hard to interpret these filters,

365
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
but definitely they are not edge-like filters.

366
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,920
We should tell you if you wanna classify style,

367
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,360
there's nothing about object or composition that matters.

368
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,120
There's something else, but what is it?

369
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,680
We don't know.

370
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,720
So this is one thing to keep in mind.

371
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,240
The most important finding is that

372
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,920
looking at activation of the internal layers,

373
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,120
we find that a small number of factors

374
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,560
can explain most of the variants

375
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,400
in all art history that we studied.

376
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,520
We look at many at Western art history

377
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,760
or last 500 years, just to be clear.

378
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
We didn't include any Asian art

379
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,360
or African art or other cultures.

380
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,080
So between six and 10 factors

381
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,640
can explain 95% of the variants in the data.

382
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,840
And actually the first two modes of variations

383
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,640
explain about 75% of the variants,

384
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,240
depending on the network.

385
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,440
And this is common in all the networks we have tried,

386
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
whether it's Alexnest or complex networks like Resnet.

387
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,280
You can see that 75% of variants up to 75% of variants

388
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,880
can only explain in the first two modes of variations.

389
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
So what are these?

390
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,120
So here, for example, we visualize a small set

391
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,320
of maybe 1700 images.

392
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,960
Every image is a dot in this graph

393
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
and is the first two modes of variation

394
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,040
of the activation of the layers before the final layer.

395
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,360
And here we color code them

396
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,240
based on the time of the artwork.

397
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,240
And so what you see here is Renaissance art is here

398
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,040
and then Baroque art comes here

399
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,840
and then all the way 19th century

400
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,480
and all the way till the impressionism here.

401
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,040
And then you can see what's happening in 20th century

402
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,800
coming here, pubism and abstraction

403
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,640
and what art and things like that.

404
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,600
That's amazing.

405
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,920
Why that's amazing?

406
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,480
Basically the machine put art in an arrangement

407
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,920
in a chronological arrangement by itself.

408
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,320
Although we never tell the machine anything about

409
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,440
when the art was made.

410
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,840
The only information the machine sees

411
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,400
is the image and the style label.

412
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,320
You don't tell the machine that Renaissance happened

413
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,440
before Baroque or Baroque happened before impressionism

414
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
or anything like that.

415
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,760
But the machine to learn to classify style

416
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,920
by itself has to make the arrangements

417
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,760
that correct historical arrangement of artworks.

418
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,760
So we find that basically there is 0.7 correlation

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
coefficient with time if you go clockwise in this graph here.

420
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,320
And each of these axes

421
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,240
there is also a high correlation with time as well.

422
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,080
So that's very interesting.

423
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,160
So the machine basically, why that's important?

424
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Because that actually was one of Wolblin theories

425
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,120
which he said basically that style change

426
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,400
in a smooth way over time

427
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,200
exactly like a rock rolling down a hill.

428
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,720
That's basically his metaphor.

429
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,960
And that's what we see here that the machine

430
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,520
find out that in order to understand this concept of style

431
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,640
it had to put the art in order historically

432
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,920
although we didn't get any historical context

433
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,200
but it really find that by itself.

434
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,360
So that's really confirmed that styles are not just bends

435
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,360
that are classification classes that are isolated.

436
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
It's smooth transition between them

437
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,120
is one of the very important things.

438
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,000
And this common and old representation

439
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
if you look at any of the network that we look at

440
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,640
whether it's be trained or trained from scratch

441
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,720
can find this high correlation with time in the representation.

442
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,560
And as I mentioned basically this is a confirmed

443
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,840
by Henry Wolblin congestion about that.

444
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,840
So the question now is what are these two factors

445
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,640
that explain 75% of what happened in art history?

446
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,000
So if you look at this and try to interpret it

447
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
it's very hard to really find one interpretation

448
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,040
people can have different interpretations.

449
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
But we look at basically how these axes

450
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,320
correlate with the five pairs that I mentioned by Wolblin

451
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Binterley versus linear recession versus Blainer

452
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,880
things like that.

453
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,240
And we find that all the time the first mode of variation

454
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,560
the most important mode of variation

455
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,080
is being recessional versus Blainer.

456
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,920
And the second all the time the second most important

457
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,120
mode of variation is correlated the most ways

458
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,040
linear versus Binterley.

459
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,440
And then give us a very nice way to look at what happened

460
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,640
in art history over the last 500 years.

461
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,360
So basically what happened is here at Renaissance time

462
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,880
art was totally Blainer and basically linear

463
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,160
every all the contour was linear and sharp

464
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,240
and came Renaissance came Baroque

465
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,480
and things start to be recessional depth

466
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,480
and art becomes Binterley and the contour become fuzzy.

467
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,840
All the way till impressionism

468
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,960
where that's the ultimate Binterley experience

469
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,880
in impressionism all the strokes are just fuzzy

470
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,080
and we don't see any contours.

471
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
So this is the ultimate Binterley experience

472
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,880
but you can see that you still have depth artists

473
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,760
looking at scenes and things are still recessional.

474
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,920
And then came Cezanne and came 20th century art

475
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,480
where basically things become flat

476
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,200
artists start flattening the canvas again

477
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,480
and becoming to be Blainer again like Renaissance.

478
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,080
And basically most of 20th century is in the Blainer side

479
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,640
of things but coming to be linear again.

480
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,640
So if you look at Bob art like Warhol or abstract art

481
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,440
you can find that arts become linear again in the contours.

482
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,160
So basically art history went into a full 360 degree cycle

483
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,040
over the last 500 years in Western civilization

484
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,680
which really captured by this one diagram

485
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,400
that really came from the representation

486
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
the machine learned from looking at art style.

487
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,120
And again, some other interesting things

488
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,760
that we found in this representation

489
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,880
if you look at two of the modes of variation

490
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
I think these are the fifth and sixth

491
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,920
or maybe fourth and fifth modes of variation

492
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,640
and he's the one that correlates more

493
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,080
with the discrimination between Renaissance and Baroque.

494
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,680
So you can see Baroque in the top here

495
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,920
and Renaissance in the bottom here.

496
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,920
And you can see that basically these two factors

497
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,480
are created the most with the bears of Wolverine.

498
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
So basically Wolverine was correct in suggesting

499
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,000
that these bears are a good way

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
to discriminate between Renaissance and Baroque.

501
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
However, we also found that he's not correct

502
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
when he said that this can tell the difference

503
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,320
between all other styles.

504
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,320
All other styles basically are spanned by these five factors

505
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,360
because we find that we cannot tell the difference

506
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,080
between the inversionism and most inversionism

507
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,520
by looking at any of these factors.

508
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,280
There is none of them correlate with this discrimination.

509
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,440
Another very interesting thing that we find is

510
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,440
when we look at the activation manifolds

511
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,520
of these networks, in terms of representation

512
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
of these networks, we look at the activation manifolds.

513
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,200
And again here we're visualizing different artworks

514
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,040
based on the time of creation from 1400 to 2000.

515
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,320
You can see also the movement of art history

516
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,760
and how things have changed

517
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,320
and you can find interesting connections.

518
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,280
So you can see basically Renaissance here

519
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,160
moving into Baroque,

520
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,320
moving into a new classicism in 19th century,

521
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
moving into realism,

522
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,240
and then moving into inversionism here.

523
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,560
And from inversionism basically,

524
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,080
both the inversionism went in two direction,

525
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,760
one direction that go to exhibitionism

526
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,160
and one direction went to abstraction.

527
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,920
So you can see Cubism and abstraction here.

528
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,840
So that really tell us much about what happened in art history

529
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,480
and we find very interesting things when we look at this.

530
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,560
For example, if you look at this figure here,

531
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,280
look at this connection between inversionism

532
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,600
and what happened after.

533
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,520
And if you look carefully here,

534
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,120
we find that this connection is mainly Cézanne's work.

535
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,400
So all the circled artwork here are work by Cézanne.

536
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,800
So at the bottom here you can find the inversionism

537
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,640
and that's Cézanne and that connect to abstraction

538
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
and Cubism.

539
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,640
So that's interesting.

540
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,680
So you can see here Cubism and abstraction

541
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,360
in the early 20th century happening after Cézanne.

542
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,520
Here's another representation where really here are,

543
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,960
here is Cézanne work and this is inversionism

544
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,160
and basically this is Cubism, Picasso and Grace

545
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,640
and other Cubists.

546
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,120
And you can see how Cézanne's connection here,

547
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,200
by making the connection between inversionism

548
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,880
moving into 20th century and how special his artwork.

549
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,760
And you can see that in the data, you can even touch it.

550
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,880
You can see how Cézanne is a bridge here.

551
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,880
And the interesting thing is that obviously being

552
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,800
a naive person when it comes to art history,

553
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,280
I always go to Wikipedia when I learned about something.

554
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,800
When I go to Wikipedia, I'm learning more about Cézanne.

555
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,840
I found this in this encode.

556
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,960
Cézanne is said to have formed the bridge

557
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,440
between 19th century inversionism

558
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,440
and 20th century's artistic inquiries in Cubism

559
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,520
and both Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked Cézanne

560
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,320
as their father, basically.

561
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,560
And that's very interesting

562
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,440
because this is not only a metaphor,

563
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,800
like a bridge here is not a metaphor like in art history,

564
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,240
but actually it's something that you can almost touch

565
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,040
in the data, in the visualization.

566
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,320
You can see how Cézanne is really connecting this.

567
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,760
Not only that, but I mean, another interesting thing here,

568
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,080
if you look at this manifold representation,

569
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,960
you can see many artworks here are renaissance artworks

570
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,920
that are built away from the Renaissance crowd

571
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,120
because the way manifold learning work,

572
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,800
manifold learning, you're building a graph,

573
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,120
connecting all nodes and you do embedding of that graph.

574
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,760
So you see here that these renaissance paintings

575
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,200
are embedded away from Renaissance.

576
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,480
When you look carefully about this,

577
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,400
you find that basically these are particular artists

578
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,880
that keep appearing again and again here.

579
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,880
In particular, we find El Greco and Durer,

580
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,640
the German artist.

581
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,760
So it's clearly that El Greco and Durer

582
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,160
has influenced modern art

583
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,160
and many modern artists have really influenced by them.

584
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,920
And that's very clear in the case of El Greco

585
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,440
because of the way he draw in a very deformed way,

586
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,280
which really affected exhibitionism and even cubism.

587
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
And that's very clear here,

588
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,520
why I see El Greco work built away from Renaissance

589
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
close to modernity, modern art.

590
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,320
In Durer, it's very hard to understand really

591
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
how Durer influenced modern art history,

592
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,720
but also Durer is very well known

593
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,800
that he's influenced art history in the 20th century,

594
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,880
but not clearly exactly how.

595
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,320
So that's very interesting.

596
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,320
All these tell us about how to characterize style changes,

597
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,920
but let's dig deeper into that.

598
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,040
And our work that I'm gonna talk about now,

599
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,080
back from 2014, six years ago,

600
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,800
was about confine creativity in art networks.

601
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,760
How can we quantify creativity in art?

602
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,640
And you will understand a little bit

603
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,800
how that relates to style changes,

604
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,200
how that characterize style changes as well.

605
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,000
So basically you wanted to develop algorithm

606
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,160
that assess creativity of a painting

607
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,200
given its context and art history.

608
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
That might seem to be silly question for some people,

609
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
but I think it's very important

610
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,040
because if you wanna build creative agents,

611
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,280
that's able, it has to have its ability

612
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,800
to assess creativity by itself.

613
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
Because at this point, at this point,

614
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,600
when a machine create art or music,

615
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,560
it's always the human that assess creativity of this machine.

616
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,160
You do human subject studies,

617
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,280
we give it to judges, things like that.

618
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,040
But can the machine on one day

619
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,640
be able to assess its own creativity?

620
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,480
And for that, we need to develop this algorithm

621
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
to quantify creativity.

622
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
But that did us the question,

623
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,600
what's creativity to start with?

624
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,760
How can we define creativity

625
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,880
in a way that's this quantifiable?

626
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,640
So there is a historically long and ongoing debate

627
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,400
on how to define creativity.

628
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,920
We can describe a person to be creative,

629
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,120
like Mozart is creative or Warhol is creative.

630
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,720
Or we can describe a product to be creative.

631
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,160
So we can say, for example,

632
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,240
the Mona Lisa was a creative artwork.

633
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,160
Or some people refer to characterize

634
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,280
the mental process to be creative.

635
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,080
So there are different ways to describe creativity.

636
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,760
We focus on novelty of a product in particular,

637
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,680
whether something is creative or not.

638
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,240
So how can we do that in an objective way?

639
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,240
So it seems to be the two main condition

640
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,480
for some product to be called creative.

641
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,200
This product has to be novel compared to prior work,

642
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,320
but also has to be of some value.

643
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,080
So we will take note of it and become influential.

644
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,880
Which exactly what happens in scientific community

645
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,800
when you write a paper, right?

646
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,760
I mean, you have to be novel

647
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,240
compared to prior research.

648
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,760
And it doesn't make a difference

649
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,200
if nobody cites your work.

650
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,960
So basically that tells us it's not influential

651
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,000
and not that creative.

652
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,520
This is a quote from a very good book,

653
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,040
which is a collection of essays about creativity,

654
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,080
which basically concluded that

655
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,840
although there are different ways to define creativity,

656
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,520
these are the most common essence of what creativity is.

657
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,440
And that actually relates back to Kant philosophy.

658
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
If you go to Kant philosophy,

659
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,280
he defined five elements of what he called artistic genius.

660
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,920
And the very first two of them is originality.

661
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,280
The originality must be its primary characteristic

662
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,960
and influence.

663
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Its product must at the same time be modeled or exemplary.

664
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,200
So other artists would start to get influenced by that.

665
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,720
So these are the two fundamental reasons

666
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,280
behind what he called artistic genius or creativity.

667
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,560
Let's move forward to the 20th century.

668
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,360
One person in the audience asked a question

669
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,080
referring to Margaret Bowden.

670
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,680
So Margaret Bowden suggested basically

671
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,360
two distinct notion of creativity,

672
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,000
the psychological creativity or be creativity,

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,080
which assists the novelty of idea

674
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,240
with respect to its creator.

675
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,200
Versus historical creativity,

676
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,760
which is assessing the novelty

677
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,280
with respect to the whole human history

678
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,320
is what I'm creating valuable and novel

679
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,520
compared to all what happened in history.

680
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,920
So this is the objective measure.

681
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,640
The psychological creativity is more of a subjective measure.

682
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,120
But historical creativity is a objective measure.

683
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
So basically that's what we're trying to do.

684
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,760
We're trying to align ourselves

685
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,000
with historical creativity of product

686
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,120
and try to define an algorithm to do that.

687
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,680
So we propose an algorithm to assess creativity

688
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,040
that's basically unsupervised,

689
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,440
meaning that we don't have any creativity labels.

690
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,880
We just have a bunch of artworks.

691
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,240
And the only information we're gonna have

692
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,160
is the date that artwork was done.

693
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,200
So these are two information,

694
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,720
the image and the date, nothing else.

695
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,680
And we're trying to infer from that

696
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,040
something about creativity.

697
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,280
Some fundamental issues we have to think about

698
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,080
before even we start deriving any algorithm about creativity

699
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,880
because these are common problems.

700
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,320
These are common problems that will face

701
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,000
any algorithm that will look at creativity.

702
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,640
So we have an algorithm that assess creativity.

703
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,480
That algorithm looking at an artwork

704
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,760
and try to judge whether it's creative or not.

705
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,120
Obviously that cannot be done in a vacuum.

706
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,400
The algorithm has to look at the context

707
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,800
of that art history to judge, right?

708
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,680
So this one limitation that the algorithm

709
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,240
only see a part of art history,

710
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,280
that whatever digitized, whatever reached us

711
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,880
and digitized and available as a dataset, right?

712
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,960
So that's one problem.

713
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,440
So these are closed,

714
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,280
what I call the closed world limitation.

715
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,240
And then the algorithm look at the art

716
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,000
through some visual encoding, which also add limitation.

717
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,440
So there are some concepts and elements

718
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,440
that are being quantified here through these visual features.

719
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,080
And there are others that might not.

720
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,280
So that's basically another limitation,

721
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,000
which I call the artistic concept quantification limitation.

722
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,320
And then any algorithm has parameters

723
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,880
and this parameter will influence the output.

724
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,480
So we can get different results

725
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,440
by changing the parameters.

726
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,200
So how can we make use of that?

727
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,840
So, however, these are all limitation should not stop us

728
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,000
because first the closed world limitation

729
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
will always go away.

730
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,520
We have more and more art being digitized

731
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,200
and more data we can get.

732
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,120
So this will go away.

733
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,160
We have advances every day in visual encoding

734
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,800
and become less blind and have better encoding.

735
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,760
And the parameters actually are not a limitation

736
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,400
because the parameter actually,

737
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,320
we can really give creativity scores

738
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,400
and understand exactly how the parameters affect the scores

739
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,720
in a way to understand what we are measuring.

740
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
Are we measuring creativity based on certain settings

741
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,280
related to composition or are you measuring

742
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,320
visibility to brush stroke work or color?

743
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,320
So all that allow us to reach way to understand K-division.

744
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,480
So the bottom line is we wanna derive an algorithm

745
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
that look at art pieces, images and their timestamp

746
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,280
and give us a score.

747
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,840
So that's basically the input and output.

748
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,560
And what we do is that we start creating a directed graph

749
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,800
between all paintings in our collection,

750
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,440
where there is an edge between each two paintings

751
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,800
with a weight reflecting the visual similarity

752
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,600
according to the visual encoding that we are using,

753
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,840
how similar these two paintings are.

754
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,160
And it's directed based on the time basically

755
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,480
if BI comes before BJ, so it's directed in that way.

756
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,320
And now let's think about assemble inference we can do.

757
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,840
Suppose you look at these two arts,

758
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,120
Caravaggio from 1602 and a less known artist from 1800,

759
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,160
almost 200 years later.

760
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,160
If you look at these two artworks side by side,

761
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,480
you can realize basically that this second artwork

762
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,800
is very close to that in terms of body bowls,

763
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,320
in terms of light, in terms of composition,

764
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,000
subject matter, everything's basically, right?

765
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,400
So it's clear that that work is a derivative of Caravaggio.

766
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,800
So in one sense that artwork is not as novel

767
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,600
compared to Caravaggio.

768
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,840
And in another sense, Caravaggio has an influence

769
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,160
in that way to that artist.

770
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,000
So high similarity between two artworks in the network

771
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,360
imply that creativity of the earlier work has to go up

772
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,480
and creativity of the later artwork has to go down.

773
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,880
These go down because it's derivative

774
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,400
and these go up because it's influential,

775
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,760
at least on these two bears.

776
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,640
Compared to another case like that,

777
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,600
these are precisely from 1883

778
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,600
and this Picasso from maybe 20 years later from 1907,

779
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
they are very different,

780
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,280
had nothing to do with each other,

781
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,520
different ways of using color, composition,

782
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,200
totally different, right?

783
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,680
So very little similarity between them,

784
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,960
of course, depending on the future you are looking for,

785
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,480
but still very low similarity.

786
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,080
And that imply that Cicely was not influential

787
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
on Picasso, at least in a direct way.

788
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,320
And Picasso was basically novel in making that art

789
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,520
compared to this work.

790
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,520
So that low similarity implies lower creativity

791
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,120
for that artwork by Cicely

792
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,120
and higher creativity for that work by Picasso.

793
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,600
So if you take these two elements of influence

794
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,800
and start building a formulation for creativity,

795
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,440
what you can do, we can write down a formulation like that,

796
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,040
where the creativity of any node can be described

797
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,720
as the creativity of all nodes connected to it.

798
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,480
In this formula here, alpha is a factor

799
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
that indicate the probability that the similarity

800
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,720
between painting can be just a coincidence.

801
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,640
And the way to interpret this formula is like that.

802
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,040
Any node in the graph collect influence

803
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,960
from all its outgoing connection

804
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,920
in this submission here.

805
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,800
And for any node in the graph,

806
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,560
it distributes its creativity tokens

807
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,880
among all incoming connections.

808
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,240
So you reach this formula that you can write

809
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,640
where this formula actually, if you look at it,

810
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,680
it's basically an instance

811
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,840
of what's called network centrality problems.

812
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,440
So you can see how many other algorithms

813
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,640
are special cases for this,

814
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
or at least a special case for others.

815
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
So you can think of this as a random work

816
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,840
in a Markov chain.

817
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,160
If you set alpha to be one, this term will vanish

818
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,800
and you have this term only,

819
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,000
which is called basically eigenvector centrality.

820
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,680
You can think of it as a weighted variant

821
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,480
of Hubel centrality.

822
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,000
If you're familiar with this body of work,

823
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,920
basically network centrality.

824
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,040
But basically, network centrality is very fundamental

825
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,160
in studying social networks in the days,

826
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,800
in studying pandemics, propagation, things like that.

827
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,240
Even in the Bej rank algorithm,

828
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,600
by Google is basically a network centrality problem.

829
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,360
And you can think of this formulation

830
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,480
as basically inverted weighted variants of Bej rank.

831
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,160
So we can even extend this in a way

832
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,240
to separate originality from influence.

833
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,360
So we can see that basically originality

834
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,800
can be controlled by another parameter,

835
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,960
is we can measure originality

836
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,600
or can measure influence in particular.

837
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,760
So the question is, how can you even evaluate that?

838
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,120
If everything is so unsupervised here,

839
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,640
you don't have any creativity labels,

840
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,280
you can show results to 10 art history

841
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,080
and everybody will have different opinions.

842
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,360
So how can we even evaluate this algorithm?

843
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,760
So we worked on different datasets,

844
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,640
the wiki art datasets

845
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,640
and something called archive datasets much older.

846
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,520
And at that time, we did this work on 7.14.

847
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,640
And at that time, this is the art in the vision

848
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,720
was mainly things like jest and bag of words

849
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,560
and things like that.

850
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,400
And that was really excellent

851
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,520
because we really wanted to use features

852
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,360
that are not trained on art at all.

853
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,800
So these are of the shelf features.

854
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,240
Class me, it was a feature

855
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,240
that basically encode object representation in images.

856
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,840
So it's a very good way to encode subject matter

857
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,840
in particular, just come from MIT,

858
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,160
basically comes from MIT,

859
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,720
which encode texture and other things

860
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,200
to object and scene classification.

861
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,920
So we thought that these two features are very useful.

862
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,960
They are not trained on art,

863
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,160
they are generic,

864
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,840
the capture things that we can relate to in art

865
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,840
with a subject matter or brushstrokes or scene composition.

866
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
So let's use them

867
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,840
and try to make sense of those based on that.

868
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,480
So here's one chart that show basically time

869
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,520
of x axis from 1400 till 2000.

870
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,720
And every artwork here is blotted with its creativity score.

871
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,840
So the higher the score,

872
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,880
the y axis is the creativity score.

873
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,040
And you have to remember that the formulation

874
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,960
is a zero one game,

875
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,000
meaning that if some artwork,

876
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,960
if you give it a set of artworks,

877
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,840
the sum has to be a constant.

878
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,680
So for some artwork to score high,

879
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,840
another has to score low.

880
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,960
Everything that we give to the algorithm

881
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,680
are master pieces of artwork anyway.

882
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,560
So nothing here is really scrambled

883
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,480
by somebody in the street.

884
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,880
All these are master pieces.

885
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,000
But the way to look and interpret this,

886
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,880
we essentially are using in particular class me

887
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,400
and just we are really trying to look at creativity

888
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,640
with this subject matter,

889
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,360
how creative were artists in depicting

890
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,680
the subject matter over time.

891
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,240
So we can see, for example,

892
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,160
what scores low in 19th centuries

893
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,120
is art by the amazing artist,

894
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,560
Prince of Hungary.

895
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,360
Why this score low?

896
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,440
Because basically according to subject matter,

897
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,920
there's nothing really innovative

898
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,480
about having a portrait of a woman in 19th century

899
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,640
because this has been done a lot in Renaissance

900
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,480
and broke all the time.

901
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,800
So subject matter was not re novel.

902
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,000
While in the same time what scored very high

903
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,440
was things like a monk,

904
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,320
the scream or money,

905
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,240
haystack, very early version of that and others.

906
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,240
So when we look carefully on the 100 years

907
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,600
from 1850 to 1950,

908
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,760
when we have a lot of data digitized

909
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,480
and a lot of artwork,

910
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,720
we can find that the machine makes sense

911
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,240
a lot about what happened in art history in that time.

912
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,560
So you can see the machine identifying things like

913
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,720
mink, the scream, giving very high score,

914
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,160
climp booster,

915
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,840
things like cubism and things like that.

916
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,920
So that makes sense.

917
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,160
I hear deeper into that.

918
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,040
If you look at the first 10 years of 20th century,

919
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,920
the first 10 years of 20th century,

920
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,560
the highest scoring artwork, for example,

921
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,960
is Picasso, Ladies of Abinon.

922
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,520
I didn't know much about that artwork other than I like it,

923
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,200
but I didn't know much about its history at the time.

924
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,160
But when I look at its history,

925
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,880
I find that art history now agrees

926
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,160
that basically artwork was the beginning of cubism.

927
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,440
Very early, even before cubism become a thing.

928
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,080
And what you see in this graph here,

929
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,240
the machine give this a very high score

930
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,240
and what's stopping that in 1912 is actually cubism itself.

931
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,920
So these are artworks when basically

932
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,560
in the very early cubism exhibitions

933
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,560
by Picasso and Brock.

934
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
And you can see here that before that,

935
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,440
that was the high scoring one.

936
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,040
And this is stopping that.

937
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,840
What's stopping that even more in 1915,

938
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,800
artwork by Malevich,

939
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,640
what's called supremist art movement,

940
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,640
which is totally abstraction in 1915.

941
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,040
That's stopping even cubism.

942
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,920
Okay, anyway, all that's nice,

943
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,920
but how can we even say that it works or not?

944
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,160
It's all in total evidence, right?

945
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,840
I mean, here is what's something very interesting.

946
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,320
What was that artwork

947
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,840
that giving very high score in that short here?

948
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,080
And when you look at curfew at that artwork in particular,

949
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,480
you find it's an artwork by Mondrian

950
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,680
that was dated in our dataset to be in 1910.

951
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,760
And that was very interesting.

952
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,560
Obviously, when you find something that you have to look at

953
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,040
and see why this is scoring very high.

954
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,680
And I find something very interesting

955
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,560
that basically Mondrian didn't bend this in 1910.

956
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,400
Mondrian bent this in 1932, I guess, I don't remember.

957
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,040
So that was a mistake in the dataset.

958
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,840
So the dataset itself has something wrong

959
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,840
that would say basically Mondrian went into that in 1910.

960
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,120
And if Mondrian would have painted that in 1910,

961
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,800
that would have been even before cubism,

962
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,640
before abstraction

963
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,360
and would have been the most creative artist in his time.

964
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,160
But obviously that's not.

965
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,680
But that mistake actually give us a very interesting idea

966
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,520
about how to even evaluate this.

967
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,480
So there are many results here, I'm gonna skip that.

968
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,480
And the way we evaluate this is what's called art time machine.

969
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,400
So the idea is this very, very simple idea

970
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,200
that come from this mistaken, the dating of that artwork.

971
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,400
So what happened if you take an artwork from Barak

972
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,000
or Renaissance and move it forward in time

973
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,240
and change its date to, let's say, 19th century

974
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,280
or 20th century, what do you expect?

975
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,560
Give the algorithm work that the creativity of score

976
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,960
for that artwork has to go down

977
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,800
because if you create an Renaissance artwork

978
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,200
in 19th century, you are not creative.

979
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,080
In the same time, you take an artwork from 19th century

980
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,320
or 20th century and move it back to 1400 or 1500,

981
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,520
you expect its creative score to be going very up

982
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,160
because it would have been very different

983
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,720
from what happened in the time

984
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,400
and very early influence to what happened much later.

985
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,240
So we expect its creativity score to go up.

986
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,160
And that's what we did.

987
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,920
So what we did is basically many experiments

988
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,240
where we take only 10 artworks, change their timestamp

989
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,560
randomly, either moving them backward to 1600

990
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,560
from modern schools or moving forward to 1900

991
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,680
for Renaissance and Barak.

992
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,600
Or basically as a baseline, just to move them

993
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,400
around 1600 randomly.

994
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,480
We basically find that that's interesting,

995
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,840
but if you move forward, Renaissance and Barak artwork

996
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,880
to 19th century, you can see consistent drop

997
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,080
of creativity by eight to 10%.

998
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,000
So it's consistent when we did these experiments.

999
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,640
If you move modern artwork from 19th and 20th century

1000
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,240
back to 1600, you can see that the creativity score increase.

1001
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,200
However, with varying degrees depending on the art movement

1002
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,640
and that makes a lot of sense.

1003
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,000
For example, if you're looking at exhibitionism

1004
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,160
or cubism or post-embranches,

1005
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,400
we can find a huge increase in creativity

1006
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,080
if you move them back to 1600, compared to a new class system.

1007
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,080
A new class system basically is a reinvention

1008
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,360
of Renaissance in 19th century.

1009
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,480
So if you move it back to 1600, you have only a 5% increase

1010
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,240
compared to 16% increase for post-embranches.

1011
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,080
So that's right.

1012
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,080
How we tell us basically the algorithm

1013
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,800
is really doing something making sense

1014
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,520
in terms of quantifying creativity

1015
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
and giving us a score that really captured

1016
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,720
the novelty and influence that we're looking for.

1017
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,040
When I showed these results to my art historian collaborator,

1018
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Maria Mazzoni at the College of Charleston,

1019
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,280
she was interested in the result

1020
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,560
and gave me this book, basically,

1021
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,760
Shev's Art History, which I quoted from in the beginning

1022
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,080
by George Kubler, who's an art historian.

1023
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,600
And in this book, basically, Kubler had a theory

1024
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,560
about how art history evolved.

1025
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,320
So basically saying that artists copy ideas

1026
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,680
from each other all the time.

1027
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,400
That's what happened all the time, within a style.

1028
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,320
Until, basically, some artists come

1029
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,320
and makes some artwork that is really different for some reason.

1030
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,720
And that's what he called primary objects,

1031
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,320
really give birth to a new style.

1032
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,480
And if other artists start to take a note of that

1033
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,880
and start replicating this new style,

1034
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,840
that becomes a new style.

1035
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,160
So, basically, he focused on this concept of prime objects,

1036
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,000
which are iconic artwork, and replica mass,

1037
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
as opposed to that really drive style moving forward,

1038
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,920
within a style.

1039
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,680
And I even find very interesting quotes in his book

1040
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,080
that say, basically, primary objects here.

1041
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,880
Prime objects resemble prime numbers of mathematics,

1042
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,320
because no conclusive rules is known

1043
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,600
to govern the appearance of either,

1044
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,240
although such a rule may be found.

1045
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,080
So, basically, this is a very amazing analogy.

1046
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,800
You make the analogy between these prime objects

1047
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,360
in art history and prime numbers.

1048
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,080
The prime numbers cannot be divided by a number before them,

1049
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,640
but they divide many numbers that comes after them.

1050
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,640
And that analogy really gives me thinking about

1051
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,880
the algorithm that describes the graph inference algorithm.

1052
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,080
If we can start with this graph,

1053
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,760
and the nodes are numbers,

1054
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,560
and the arrows are divisibility,

1055
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,520
the algorithm, basically, will give you a high score

1056
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,960
to prime numbers by definition.

1057
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,680
By construction, you find that that algorithm

1058
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,440
will give high score to prime numbers.

1059
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,080
So, really, he's very, very correct in this analogy

1060
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,760
that prime object is actually very similar

1061
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,840
to the concept of prime numbers.

1062
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,720
And what you're actually doing in this network

1063
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,400
by giving creative score,

1064
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,960
we are identifying what are the prime objects

1065
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,800
in art history, things like Montesquim,

1066
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,760
or Picasso, ladies have been on.

1067
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,400
So, when art historians tell us that this artwork is major,

1068
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,480
or basically the population think of Montesquim,

1069
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,520
or Monet, his tag as really a masterpiece,

1070
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,600
this is totally not subjective.

1071
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,280
There is some unconscious reasons for that.

1072
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,440
And this can be quantified by this kind of networks.

1073
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,520
And they are really a changing moment in history

1074
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,320
where something totally different happened

1075
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,200
and artists start taking notice.

1076
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,640
So, because of the time,

1077
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,800
I just wanna go very fast toward the next topic,

1078
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,760
which I'll try to finish in two minutes,

1079
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,840
which is basically how can we actually use AI

1080
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
to generate art?

1081
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,560
And if the machine generate images,

1082
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,880
would that be considered art or not?

1083
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,880
These are very big topic.

1084
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,440
And I know that other speakers in this series

1085
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,520
will talk about that in detail.

1086
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,480
Aaron is gonna be speaking,

1087
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,160
or maybe has been already in this series.

1088
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,320
But basically our work from three years ago,

1089
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,280
called Creative Adversarial Network,

1090
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,840
can, which basically we try to make a variant of GAN

1091
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,400
that was new at that time to really generate a novel art.

1092
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,120
We call it generating art by deviating from style known,

1093
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,360
by learning about style and being from style known.

1094
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,480
These are some of the art that this network is generating.

1095
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,000
So, basically wanna, here's the story.

1096
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,560
Obviously, the audience here know deep learning

1097
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,280
and know GANs and know how they work.

1098
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,680
I don't have to go through that.

1099
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,640
And for example, GANs have been very successful

1100
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,120
in generating these images of bedrooms

1101
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,960
and other assets, very interesting things like that.

1102
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,560
So, one question would be,

1103
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,840
what happened if you train GANs on art images?

1104
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,960
Suppose you give it art history images

1105
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,040
and you train GANs on that, would it generate art?

1106
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,040
And actually there was some trials in the early days of GANs

1107
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,000
where people trained it on board trays

1108
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,320
and still lifes and things like that.

1109
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,460
However, this fundamental problem,

1110
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,000
the generator in GAN is trained to generate samples

1111
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,640
that pulls the discriminator to believe

1112
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,720
they're coming from the same distribution as the inputs.

1113
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,640
So, that's basically,

1114
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,120
we can think about Chinese room problem here.

1115
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,120
Imagine the generator have access to actual images

1116
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,640
and can sheet.

1117
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,280
So, you can take actual images of art

1118
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,880
and just generate it right away

1119
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,320
and give it to the discriminator.

1120
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,160
So, actually, the discriminator this way

1121
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,360
can be pulled right away

1122
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,160
that thinking and generating these art works.

1123
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,880
However, this is basically the Chinese room problem.

1124
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,920
So, there is no motivation for the generator

1125
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,640
actually to generate anything that's creative.

1126
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,080
The generator is just trying to generate something

1127
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,680
from the same distribution.

1128
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,720
The only creativity it can do

1129
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,520
is just to generate something

1130
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,000
that was not generated before from the distribution.

1131
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But it's basically, if you give it artworks of board trays,

1132
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,720
it will generate some different board tray,

1133
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,720
but still a board tray that's very similar to what it sees.

1134
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,840
There's no force, the bush, again, to be creative.

1135
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,000
How can you change that?

1136
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,120
There's some background here

1137
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,320
that I have to go very fast over

1138
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:31,080
from coming from the field of aesthetic evolution

1139
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:31,920
and psychology.

1140
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,480
Basically, these three in one slide

1141
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,480
say that artists keep making the same kind of art all the time.

1142
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,200
Like, if artists in Renaissance

1143
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,800
keep doing the same kind of Renaissance all the time,

1144
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,200
because of habituation,

1145
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,880
we get bored of that as the viewer get bored of that.

1146
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,800
And that become not exciting for the artist,

1147
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,800
not exciting for the critic,

1148
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,720
not exciting for the viewer anymore.

1149
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,000
So, artist has to innovate all the time

1150
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,080
to go to bush against habituation.

1151
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,280
However, if artists innovate too much,

1152
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,400
if artists imagine because I did that in Renaissance time,

1153
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,520
or even when he did that in 20th century,

1154
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,680
that's too shocking.

1155
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,680
That people will not like that.

1156
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,760
And people actually didn't like that.

1157
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,800
Most people till now didn't like that.

1158
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,960
Because basically according to what's called

1159
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,600
one curve in psychology,

1160
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,480
too much arousal relates to negative hedonics.

1161
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,880
Basically, people start to unlike what they see.

1162
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,400
So, in one sense, artists have to bush against habituation

1163
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,800
in what's called basically least efforts.

1164
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,120
So, artists really have to really bush the envelope

1165
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,480
with the least minimum amount

1166
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,480
to bush against habituation

1167
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,080
without falling into the negative part of that curve.

1168
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,120
So, that basically the concept that we're trying to bush,

1169
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,840
how can we bush the network to be innovative,

1170
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,280
but keep it within the distribution,

1171
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,480
bush the boundary basically.

1172
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,080
So, the way we did it is basically,

1173
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,320
in particular, we're trying to go out of style

1174
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,240
by appealing style ambiguity.

1175
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,120
So, the network here is again,

1176
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,840
we still have the real false, real fake loss,

1177
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,560
which is in that case, art or not art

1178
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,720
because you're training on art.

1179
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,560
Then the network has a style classification.

1180
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,560
The discriminator also learn about style

1181
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,360
and try to classify styles.

1182
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,040
We give it style labels.

1183
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,520
And we added style ambiguity loss,

1184
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,960
which basically mean that the discriminator

1185
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,680
trying to see if the art as a generator fits within styles

1186
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,960
or ambiguous in terms of satisfying style.

1187
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,240
And we're trying to basically maximize style ambiguity

1188
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,920
at the same time minimizing the typical loss

1189
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,920
in real fake formulation.

1190
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,040
So, basically, this is the loss

1191
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,720
and we have art or not art.

1192
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,760
We have style classification loss

1193
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,440
and we have this style ambiguity,

1194
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,520
which I think is very essential

1195
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,520
because this style ambiguity bushes against art, not art.

1196
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,280
Art, not art loss, typical gun loss,

1197
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,440
will try to boost things into the distribution.

1198
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,640
And style ambiguity will try to boost things

1199
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,480
away from distribution,

1200
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,800
but keeping that will put it back.

1201
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,080
So, the dilemma between this almost objective

1202
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,720
really boost the machine to try to explore the boundary.

1203
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,400
And that's why we started getting

1204
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,400
this very interesting artwork

1205
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,520
that have very nice composition.

1206
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,360
Here we train the machine on art history

1207
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,600
from the last 500 years of art history,

1208
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,640
all subject matter, all style, we didn't do any curation.

1209
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,720
The goal is if the machine see all that art,

1210
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,800
what will it generate?

1211
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,240
Will it generate similar artworks or something novel?

1212
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,080
And the interesting thing,

1213
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,520
most of the things I'm machine generate

1214
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,120
actually abstract artwork.

1215
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,680
It didn't give us much board trace

1216
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,400
or landscape mainly abstract.

1217
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,840
And that was very interesting question.

1218
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,840
If we remove the style ambiguity loss,

1219
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,360
these what kind of things you can get,

1220
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,240
which are basically things that looks like

1221
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,760
mainly repetition of art history.

1222
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,000
The machine here again is just basically trying to

1223
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,440
generate things that looks like the distribution.

1224
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,880
Adding style ambiguity to the different results.

1225
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,640
Trying to, you can see it keep the aesthetic,

1226
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,240
it learned the aesthetics trying to keep it to be

1227
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,160
in the distribution of what's appealing,

1228
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,120
but trying to come up with new compositions

1229
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,040
and new combination of colors, new interesting things.

1230
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,000
And we did a lot of experiments.

1231
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,520
There's much time to go over them in details,

1232
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,240
but here is the conclusion.

1233
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,640
When we show these two human subjects

1234
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,000
combined with artwork from Art Basel 2016,

1235
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
which is a flagship art fair in contemporary artists

1236
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:06,080
and also combined with another set of abstract exhibitions,

1237
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,600
famous artworks as a baseline.

1238
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,880
And to our surprise,

1239
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,680
basically human subject thought art done by Cannes,

1240
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,520
the machine basically has done by human 75% of the time

1241
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,000
compared to 85% of the time for the case of abstract.

1242
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And only 48% of the time for art from the Art Basel.

1243
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,960
Collection.

1244
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,120
This doesn't take anything about creativity of the art.

1245
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,280
It's basically a touring test to tell whether a human

1246
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,120
can tell what art is made by a human or by a Gann.

1247
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,080
And at that time, basically most art that is done by Gann

1248
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,400
has this uncanny look that right away you can tell it's a Gann.

1249
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,600
It's the format for trace,

1250
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,040
the format so you can tell it's a machine,

1251
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,240
but for Cannes work, you cannot tell the difference.

1252
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,560
It's given these high scores.

1253
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:04,560
And moreover, they give it described by words like intentional,

1254
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,560
has a composition, rules, has communication inspirational.

1255
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,320
Give it high score in all these as with the same as art made

1256
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,160
by human.

1257
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,120
One last thing is why it works?

1258
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,640
Why style ambiguity work?

1259
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,400
And that connects to what I talked about earlier.

1260
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,080
It is not biased with the data,

1261
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,960
because maybe you have less abstract art work in your collection

1262
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,880
and that's why it's generating abstracts.

1263
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,840
And it is not because all the schools here

1264
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,360
we combine them into bins to make them uniform.

1265
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,880
So according to our laws, if these are the solution

1266
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,600
and these are the styles,

1267
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,080
those are a plenty of room in between to create something

1268
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,240
that belongs to art and doesn't belong to styles.

1269
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,160
The machine tried to find out these spaces.

1270
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,680
However, if you look at this figure from before,

1271
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,920
that's renaissance, Baroque,

1272
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,640
impressionism, realism and things like that.

1273
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,880
You can see that there's no relation art history.

1274
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,080
Everything has been moving smoothly.

1275
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,560
And if you want to move forward,

1276
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,160
obviously this two-dimension block here,

1277
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,920
but the space is much bigger.

1278
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,440
If we really move forward,

1279
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,040
you cannot really get something just between renaissance

1280
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,880
and Baroque.

1281
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,200
You have really a budget trajectory forward,

1282
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,480
not insert something in between.

1283
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,480
And that's exactly why it works.

1284
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,920
So, and that's why it tends to generate more abstract

1285
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,120
than more uncanny repetition of the best

1286
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,960
because it's figured out basically in the 19th century,

1287
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,160
things are moving in that direction

1288
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,920
and there are more space to make creating abstract art works

1289
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,360
and studio art works without having to go

1290
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,440
and creating board trays and battle field

1291
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,280
and landscapes that the students can tell right away.

1292
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,200
It's renaissance and Baroque.

1293
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,000
So that's at least my understanding of this board.

1294
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,680
Anyway, I'll have to stop here

1295
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,440
because I went over time and I'm very sorry about that.

1296
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,840
The conclusion is we just sketched the surface.

1297
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,400
These are not to be discovered in art history

1298
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,400
by looking at art at a macro level using the science and AI.

1299
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,120
And also they are to be discovered

1300
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,040
by trying to boost the AI to be created.

1301
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
Thank you very much.

1302
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,600
Thank you very much, Professor Elgamal.

1303
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,600
It was very interesting discussion and analysis

1304
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,240
over history of art.

1305
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
I really appreciate that.

1306
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,240
I think that if anyone has any question,

1307
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,240
otherwise excellent.

1308
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,240
I think it was very interesting.

1309
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,240
It was very interesting.

1310
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,960
I liked hearing about all of the art history

1311
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,160
and then relating it to the computer science aspects.

1312
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,200
Thank you.

1313
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,760
I hope it wasn't boring from the perspective.

1314
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,960
It was very interesting, especially trying

1315
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,280
to quantify creativity was interesting

1316
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,840
and kind of related to the previous talk as well.

1317
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,960
I also find it very important that there is a separation

1318
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,240
between science and humanities.

1319
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,280
What we are doing in computer vision

1320
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,880
and if you talk about being creative

1321
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,000
and doing machine creativity

1322
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,000
and you are disconnected from what's happening

1323
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,600
in art history or rural art history,

1324
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,160
we are making a big mistake.

1325
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,600
As I said, I mean, for example,

1326
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,160
the concept of style transfer in vision

1327
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,200
and machine learning, totally nonsense.

1328
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,920
When it comes to artists and it comes to art history

1329
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,040
and we still keep doing that.

1330
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,120
We find like hundreds and hundreds of people

1331
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,800
come every year about style transfer.

1332
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,520
We should keep doing the same thing.

1333
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,400
It was totally nonsense to me

1334
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,360
because that's not style

1335
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,320
and that's not what interests artists

1336
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,640
and what interests art history.

1337
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,360
So this connect is really not good.

1338
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,680
Thank you so much for sharing your interest with us.

1339
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:09,560
I think that this is very intriguing for anyone

1340
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,520
in the class who wants to believe myself,

1341
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,280
who wants to explore more in this direction.

1342
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,480
So I appreciate your time and talk.

1343
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
Thank you so much.

1344
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,960
Okay, I think that we can stop you eating your nap.

1345
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,120
Thank you.

1346
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,680
Okay, have a good time.

1347
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,520
You too.

1348
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,360
Thank you very much.
