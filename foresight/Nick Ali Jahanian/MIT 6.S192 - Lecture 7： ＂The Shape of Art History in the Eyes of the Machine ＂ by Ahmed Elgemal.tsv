0	4160	The special speaker that we have today is Professor Ahmed
4160	5600	Al-Gamal.
5600	9540	He's a professor in the Department of Computer Science
9540	14560	at Rutgers University and also the founder of the Art
14560	19200	and Artificial Intelligence Lab at Rutgers.
19200	26920	So let us ask Professor Al-Gamal to be a little more
26920	30040	introduce themselves and give us a little background
30040	31480	and talk.
31480	33040	One thing that I wanted to mention
33040	37840	is that his talk is today is about the shape of the art
37840	41240	history in the eyes of the machine.
41240	44320	And I think that he has done many interesting work
44320	50680	in the realm of understanding the patterns and evolution
50680	53920	of art through the history.
53920	54680	Please go ahead.
54680	55640	Thank you.
55640	56320	Thank you very much.
56320	60680	Thank you for inviting me and thank everybody who is here.
60680	63280	I'll start by answering a question you asked earlier
63280	65360	about why I'm doing this.
65360	69640	And I think it will be more also clear during the talk.
69640	73960	Basically, during my high school years,
73960	76440	I mean, I was raised up in Alexandria, Egypt.
76440	78280	And when you raise up in the country,
78280	79400	it all has to be like that.
79400	82840	You see a lot of archaeology and history and art.
82840	86640	And I really wanted to study archaeology and art history.
86640	88200	That was really my passion.
88200	90240	But at the same time, computer science
90240	94920	was something totally new at that time around the 1990s.
94920	96520	And I was fascinated by it.
96520	98080	I had to choose a major.
98080	100320	So everybody would tell me, if you go to archaeology,
100320	103560	art history, you'll have no career and make no money.
103560	106320	And I went to study computer science.
106320	109920	And for the last 25 years, I've been doing AI.
109960	113000	But I find that actually my passion is really in art.
113000	116120	Every time I go to the division conference,
116120	118440	I escape 90% of the conference.
118440	120800	And I go to galleries and museums rather than
120800	121720	attending the sessions.
121720	124280	And I realize I have to do something about it.
124280	127320	And it will be clear in the talk basically
127320	130720	how I moved into doing that and why I moved to do that.
130720	134560	So let me just start right away by sharing my screen.
134560	137120	So basically, as an AI researcher,
137120	142120	or when I look at images like that,
142120	145440	I mean, we'll be very happy if the machine will recognize
145440	148920	there's a man, there's a woman, there's fruits, there's trees.
148920	151440	There are trees and things like that.
151440	154120	That's what we do in vision.
154120	156080	And that's what I've been doing for a long time also.
156080	159840	However, basically, we realize that art, when you look at art,
159840	160640	is much more than that.
160640	165120	There are layers and layers of historical context,
165120	167880	social context, understanding.
167880	169960	There are emotions that happens.
169960	173080	I mean, art is not about object recognition or anything like that.
173080	173920	We see it as recognition.
173920	175600	It's much more.
175600	177440	And since the ultimate goal of AI research
177440	180080	is to make the machine, make machine
180080	183440	that have perceptual, cognitive, and intellectual abilities
183440	186240	similar to those of humans, I find
186240	190280	that analysis of paintings, whatever analysis means,
190280	194400	involve actually all these tasks, perception, cognition,
194400	196240	and intellectual abilities.
196240	200160	And that's why I think it's very important to advance AI
200160	207360	to look at art and try to understand art the same way human does.
207360	213120	So basically, I find that the ability to understand and generate
213120	216440	human-level creative products, such as poetry, stories,
216440	218880	jokes, music, paintings, is fundamental
218880	223160	to show that artificial intelligence algorithm
223200	225440	are actually intelligence.
225440	227680	And the first question that always
227680	231840	being asked when I give talks, especially in humanities,
231840	235720	with audience from humanities, is how to combine art and AI.
235720	240080	Basically, art is a judgment, which is subjective,
240080	241400	and science is objective.
241400	243760	How can this be combined?
243760	245120	And that's a very important question.
245120	249440	And actually, it's rooted in Western philosophy.
249440	254320	Basically, Western philosophy has blazed aesthetic comprehension
254320	256120	in the realm of subjectivity.
256120	262760	And we can trace that back to Immanuel Kant in 18th century
262760	267240	when in his book about critique of the judgment,
267240	271240	when he basically argued that the judgment of taste
271240	275080	is not cognitive judgment, it's not logical,
275080	278520	but aesthetic, which means that it's
278520	282600	one whose determinant ground cannot be other than subjective.
282600	285720	And that actually shaped the separation between art and science
285720	287040	in the last two centuries.
287040	290320	So another quote here from Colin Martindale,
290320	293600	who is a psychology professor at University of Maine,
293600	296880	who has a totally different, opposite point of view.
296880	300600	As a scientist, I feel that if everything in the universe
300600	303680	is governed by laws, then art history must be as well.
303680	309040	So totally scientific approach, basically nothing is subjective.
309040	311840	And another viewpoint from Eric Kindle,
311840	316200	who's a neuroscientist and winner of Nobel Prize,
316200	320240	by examining perception of art as an interpretation of science
320240	323840	we experience, scientific eyes can, in principle,
323840	326680	describe how the brain perceives and responds to art.
326680	330160	And let me go into basically saying, can any aspect of art,
330160	333760	which is creative and subjective experience,
333760	336600	be studied objectively?
336600	339000	And finally, a quote from an art historian,
339000	341240	which is very unusual art historian.
341240	346280	His name is George Kubler from his book, The Shape of Time,
346280	349520	which I'm going to talk about in the talk a little bit later.
349520	350960	He's saying basically that art history could
350960	353320	move to contain unexpected potentiality
353320	355000	as a predictive science.
355000	358800	This is very uncommon view in art history.
358800	361200	So my goal is really to understand
361200	363280	what art the implication of looking at art
363280	365360	through the eyes of the machine.
365360	368800	And by that I mean AI in particular.
368800	372200	That's why I started the AI lab about maybe eight years ago
372200	375640	at Rutgers, really focusing on advancing AI by looking at art
375640	380880	and also seeing what can we do about art if we do AI.
380880	384120	And here are some of my collaborators from art history,
384120	388400	from fine art, and have been blessed to work
388400	391000	with many students from Rutgers and from other universities
391000	392480	as well.
392480	394760	And these are some of the activities
394760	397480	that have been done through the years, many others.
397480	400040	And these are some things I'm going to talk about today.
400040	404720	Building models to understand art style, genre,
404720	408280	doing art specification, try to understand influences
408280	412400	between artists, try to understand creativity,
412400	417240	how to quantify creativity, how to generate art,
417240	419720	how to understand the evolution of art history.
419720	423640	Many things have been done during these years.
423640	426560	But let me start by the basics, basically.
426560	428720	So how artists talk about art.
428720	432360	So if you look at an artwork like this amazing Renoir
432360	435560	painting, basically artists doesn't look at this
435560	439040	and tell you there are multiple people
439040	441080	or people are eating food or things like that.
441080	444400	Basically talk about artists talk about elements of art,
444400	446840	the space, the texture, the form, the shape, the color,
446840	450160	things like that, principles of art, the movement, the unity,
450160	453520	the harmony, balance, contrast.
453520	455920	Other topics like subject matter, brushstrokes,
455920	459200	meaning, historical context, social context.
459200	461600	All these things are basically what artists talk about when
461600	462640	talk about art.
462640	465320	Their least concern is things like object or scene
465320	469240	classification and things like that or genre caption.
469240	473120	So our goal really was in the last few years
473120	474680	is trying to quantify each of these elements.
474680	477360	And we have done a lot of work on quantifying each of these
477360	479240	elements.
479240	483560	How to do visual encoding of the image
483560	486520	in order to be able to quantify these elements
486520	488520	and principles of art.
488520	490760	And in particular, one of the very, very important things
490760	494000	in art is the topic of style.
494000	495120	So what is style?
495120	500640	So basically here, this is a depiction of the last suburb.
500640	502800	So basically the famous painting by DaVinci.
502800	505560	But DaVinci's painting here is just one of them.
505560	508960	This is much earlier to a version,
508960	513320	a mini version by many artists, to 20th century versions.
513320	515920	And really in here, you can see what
515920	518120	is the meaning of style in one slide like that.
518120	522040	We're basically depicting the subject matter
522040	526400	in two different ways, depending on historical point
526400	530120	in what happened in art history that
530160	534840	specify how the artist will depict the scene.
534840	535800	And here's the fair thing.
535800	539640	I mean, if you look at this and what artists mean by style
539640	545000	and compare that to what we in computer vision or AI do
545000	547520	when you do things like style transfer and things like that,
547520	550400	to theorize, basically, it's a joke that the way we do
550400	553200	style transfer in machine learning and computer vision,
553200	555440	which is mainly basically meaning taking the ballot
555440	557760	from one image to another or a texture from one image
557760	560240	to another has nothing to do with the concept of style
560240	562040	in reality, because the concept of style
562040	565560	is much more deeper than just these simple things.
566520	570880	So the question really is what characterizes the sequence
570880	574160	and evolution of art style change over time?
574160	576080	How can we characterize these changes?
576080	578920	And actually what factors drive these changes
578920	579760	of style over time?
579760	582200	Why even artists change style over time?
582200	585120	When that happened, what triggers it
585120	587880	and how to characterize it when it happens?
587880	589400	Can we build conventional models
589400	591880	that can help answer these questions?
593400	595720	So we started very early with a very simple thing,
595720	598560	which is painting style classification.
598560	602360	You have a bunch of images and you have style labels on them.
602360	605600	So it's really a simple supervised machine learning
605600	608640	problem and you wanna classify the painting to think classes
608640	611080	like Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism, Cubism,
611080	612600	abstract things like that.
612600	614600	So very simple problem.
614600	618920	And we take a painting, we have visual encoding
618920	622720	using different pictures, trying to capture
622720	625000	the low-level, mid-level, semantic-level picture,
625000	628440	which are parallel to different concept art, as I mentioned,
628440	632160	and trying different machine learning techniques on them
632160	635440	and doing supervised learning to classify style.
635440	638160	And basically this is so progress over the years
638160	642840	from the year 2012, maybe three years ago,
642880	645760	where we have been really trying any new things
645760	649520	that have happened in machine learning and see what it adds.
650760	654200	Things from the time of the bag of words and classmates
654200	656960	and HOGs, if you really remember that,
658280	663280	till the time of CNNs and deep learning.
663520	667160	The number of style classes that have been basically
667160	671840	increasing the number of classes over time,
671840	672840	trying to get deeper.
672840	675000	But basically how to monitor the progress
675000	677360	is how to convey to random guess
677360	679200	how much better you can do than the random guess,
679200	681200	starting from four times random guess
681200	682560	to 12 times random guess.
682560	685880	So, okay, and can do better than that.
685880	687360	All right, so we do classification.
687360	690600	The machine can classify style at the level
690600	694360	of maybe a first-year art history students.
694360	696560	If you give it an artwork, it can tell you this is Cubism,
696560	699400	this is Impressionism, this is Renaissance.
699400	701440	Good, the machine can do that.
701440	703800	So what, why that's even important?
703800	704960	So when I talk to Arthur Historian
704960	706520	about machine classifying style,
706520	709640	he asked me, so what, why that's even important?
709640	713040	And here's why I think it's important.
713920	715320	Classifying style by the machine
715320	717240	is not what Arthur Historian,
717240	719680	but actually instead what the important is,
719680	722960	what are that tell us about the characteristics of style
722960	725200	and what drives style changes?
725200	727880	And we know that if the machine can classify style successfully
727880	730240	that implies that the machine has learned
730240	734360	some internal representation that encodes some features,
734360	736480	some discriminative features
736480	739160	through its visual analysis of these art.
739160	744080	However, we also know that the machine uses visual feature
744080	746560	that's always very hard to interpret by humans.
746560	748480	So especially if you're doing learning,
748480	751720	so we have to interpret these visual features.
751720	753160	So it's very hard to understand
753160	755400	how the machine did the execution of style
755400	758120	to start with to get something useful.
758120	760600	So we went into studying basically
760600	762240	how the machine identify style
762240	764240	and if there are a relation between the way
765560	768200	the machine internally represents style
768200	772160	and the way Arthur Historian think about style.
772160	774520	And for that is very important to look at
774520	777400	what, how Arthur Historian look at style.
777400	779240	Here, this is Henrich Wolblin,
779240	782800	one of the founding father of art history, modern art history.
782800	785960	And he basically have a theory about style.
785960	790480	In particular, he looked at how style,
790480	794280	how to separate the study of subject matter
794280	797960	from the study of the visual form, which is style.
797960	800640	And in his book, basically he really studied
800640	803160	the difference between Renaissance and Baroque.
803160	805240	So in the top here is Renaissance artwork
805240	807120	and in the bottom is a Baroque artwork.
807120	809640	And he suggested basically some visual schema
809640	811000	that you can tell the difference
811000	813440	between Renaissance art and Baroque art.
814360	819360	Basically, he mentioned five bears of elements.
819760	821960	For example, linear versus binterly.
821960	825320	In Renaissance art, if you look at the contours,
825320	830320	they are very sharp and while in Baroque,
830800	831920	it's very fuzzy contours.
831920	834320	That was it linear versus binterly.
834320	838160	In Renaissance, if all the subjects are in one plane,
838160	842360	while in Baroque, there are depth in the scene.
842360	844680	So this is Blainer versus Recessional.
844680	849680	In Renaissance, everything seemed to be within canvas
849680	853800	while in Baroque, basically you see like a cropped image
853800	855400	from a bigger scene.
855400	857920	So this is called closed form versus open form.
859040	860640	In Baroque, in Renaissance,
860640	863000	basically every subject by himself or by herself.
863000	866600	So this multiplicity versus in Baroque, this unity here,
866600	870240	you can see the old subject are part of one unit.
871240	875400	In Renaissance, everything has absolute clarity.
877040	879840	All the scene, everything's in focus
879840	883200	while in Baroque, artists start to have relative clarity.
883200	885920	There are depth, there are things that are in focus,
885920	887920	things that are out of focus,
887920	889880	depending on what the artist is trying to do.
889880	891640	So he suggested that these five bears
891640	894520	is really what make the difference
894520	896640	between Renaissance and Baroque.
896640	898880	And he even went to say that basically these five bears
899160	904160	are the kind of feature that can classify any style.
904320	908600	So any style variation really goes along these elements.
908600	909760	However, this is very interesting.
909760	913080	However, this is a theory in art history,
913080	915720	which is what we call in math or science,
915720	916960	basically a congestion, not a theory,
916960	918760	because there is no proof of that.
918760	922160	How can we even prove these theories,
922160	925520	especially if you want to generalize it to old styles?
926520	930320	So what we did is really is we're trying to look
930320	932440	at this internal representation of how the machine
932440	934600	classifies style and draw the parallel
934600	938080	to what Wolverine suggested.
938080	941520	So what we did is basically we trained several models,
941520	944560	several CNN models, and we keep doing that.
944560	947520	So things like AlexNet, when they appeared,
947520	952520	VGGNet, ResNet, every CNN model that comes around,
952560	954280	we try that as well.
954400	956240	And the goal is basically to train the machine
956240	959040	to do a style classification in a supervised manner.
959040	961400	But the goal is really is not classification,
961400	963560	the goal is to look at what has been learned here.
963560	965840	So analyze the internal representation
965840	967880	and do some statistical analysis
967880	969880	and some visualization on top of that.
969880	974880	So after the machine learned style with acceptable accuracy,
974960	977320	we kind of start adding layers in the middle here
977320	980880	to increase the interpretability of the representation.
981880	985160	Basically go down to as small as number
985160	988000	of internal nodes as possible here
988000	991200	to have more interpretable representation,
991200	995720	doing things like principle component analysis
995720	1000720	on the activation, source separation, ICA,
1001480	1004640	understand looking at the manifolds of activations,
1004640	1007520	doing correlation with time, correlation with Wolverine,
1007520	1009800	there's all these kinds of analysis we have done
1009880	1011120	to understand the representation
1011120	1014360	and basically some of the results that we found.
1014360	1017680	So this is the first thing that's very interesting.
1017680	1020760	We used either B-trained model on ImageNet
1020760	1024480	that we fine-tuned on Art Collection,
1024480	1026200	we use WikiArt Collection,
1026200	1029120	about 70,000 images in our studies.
1030280	1033400	And by doing that, we reach a accuracy of classification
1033400	1036600	is about 60% more or less by all these networks.
1036600	1039480	If you use a data from scratch,
1039480	1042720	you can actually get 10% less, 50%,
1042720	1045360	only in 77,000 images out,
1045360	1047680	they need to be trained on a million ImageNet.
1048880	1051120	All right, so that's interesting
1051120	1052440	so we can get reasonable results
1052440	1054320	even without any pre-training.
1054320	1056200	But the interesting thing is this,
1056200	1059800	looking at the filters that the machine learned
1059800	1062040	if you trained from scratch on style,
1062040	1064160	you look very different from the filter
1064160	1068840	that you typically see in object recognition CNNs.
1068880	1070240	You know in object recognition CNNs,
1070240	1071800	you always get these Gabor filters
1071800	1076800	and this edge-like, oriented edge-like filters.
1077400	1079880	If you look at how the machine look at style only,
1079880	1082480	look at style construction only, nothing like that.
1082480	1085080	We don't see almost any edges,
1085080	1088520	maybe only one filter looks like a horizontal horizon
1088520	1089680	or something like that.
1089680	1090960	But other than that,
1090960	1092400	it's very hard to interpret these filters,
1092400	1094640	but definitely they are not edge-like filters.
1094640	1096920	We should tell you if you wanna classify style,
1097360	1102360	there's nothing about object or composition that matters.
1102480	1104120	There's something else, but what is it?
1104120	1105680	We don't know.
1105680	1107720	So this is one thing to keep in mind.
1108720	1111240	The most important finding is that
1111240	1113920	looking at activation of the internal layers,
1113920	1116120	we find that a small number of factors
1116120	1118560	can explain most of the variants
1118560	1120400	in all art history that we studied.
1120400	1122520	We look at many at Western art history
1122520	1124760	or last 500 years, just to be clear.
1124760	1126080	We didn't include any Asian art
1126080	1128360	or African art or other cultures.
1129680	1131080	So between six and 10 factors
1131080	1134640	can explain 95% of the variants in the data.
1134640	1136840	And actually the first two modes of variations
1136840	1139640	explain about 75% of the variants,
1139640	1141240	depending on the network.
1141240	1143440	And this is common in all the networks we have tried,
1143440	1147280	whether it's Alexnest or complex networks like Resnet.
1147280	1152280	You can see that 75% of variants up to 75% of variants
1153240	1155880	can only explain in the first two modes of variations.
1157080	1157920	So what are these?
1157920	1161120	So here, for example, we visualize a small set
1161120	1163320	of maybe 1700 images.
1164520	1166960	Every image is a dot in this graph
1166960	1170240	and is the first two modes of variation
1170240	1174040	of the activation of the layers before the final layer.
1175400	1177360	And here we color code them
1177360	1179240	based on the time of the artwork.
1180080	1183240	And so what you see here is Renaissance art is here
1183240	1185040	and then Baroque art comes here
1185040	1189840	and then all the way 19th century
1189840	1192480	and all the way till the impressionism here.
1192480	1195040	And then you can see what's happening in 20th century
1195040	1197800	coming here, pubism and abstraction
1197800	1199640	and what art and things like that.
1199640	1200600	That's amazing.
1200600	1201920	Why that's amazing?
1201920	1205480	Basically the machine put art in an arrangement
1205480	1207920	in a chronological arrangement by itself.
1207920	1210320	Although we never tell the machine anything about
1210320	1211440	when the art was made.
1211440	1212840	The only information the machine sees
1212840	1215400	is the image and the style label.
1215400	1217320	You don't tell the machine that Renaissance happened
1217320	1219440	before Baroque or Baroque happened before impressionism
1219440	1220880	or anything like that.
1220880	1224760	But the machine to learn to classify style
1224760	1226920	by itself has to make the arrangements
1226920	1229760	that correct historical arrangement of artworks.
1229760	1234760	So we find that basically there is 0.7 correlation
1235000	1240000	coefficient with time if you go clockwise in this graph here.
1243040	1244320	And each of these axes
1244320	1247240	there is also a high correlation with time as well.
1247240	1248080	So that's very interesting.
1248080	1251160	So the machine basically, why that's important?
1251160	1256160	Because that actually was one of Wolblin theories
1257000	1261120	which he said basically that style change
1261160	1263400	in a smooth way over time
1263400	1266200	exactly like a rock rolling down a hill.
1266200	1267720	That's basically his metaphor.
1267720	1270960	And that's what we see here that the machine
1270960	1275520	find out that in order to understand this concept of style
1275520	1279640	it had to put the art in order historically
1279640	1281920	although we didn't get any historical context
1281920	1284200	but it really find that by itself.
1284200	1287360	So that's really confirmed that styles are not just bends
1287360	1292360	that are classification classes that are isolated.
1293160	1295160	It's smooth transition between them
1295160	1298120	is one of the very important things.
1298120	1300000	And this common and old representation
1300000	1303200	if you look at any of the network that we look at
1303200	1305640	whether it's be trained or trained from scratch
1305640	1309720	can find this high correlation with time in the representation.
1310960	1313560	And as I mentioned basically this is a confirmed
1313560	1317840	by Henry Wolblin congestion about that.
1317840	1320840	So the question now is what are these two factors
1320840	1324640	that explain 75% of what happened in art history?
1326440	1330000	So if you look at this and try to interpret it
1330000	1332000	it's very hard to really find one interpretation
1332000	1334040	people can have different interpretations.
1335200	1338200	But we look at basically how these axes
1338200	1341320	correlate with the five pairs that I mentioned by Wolblin
1341320	1346320	Binterley versus linear recession versus Blainer
1349960	1350880	things like that.
1350880	1355240	And we find that all the time the first mode of variation
1355240	1356560	the most important mode of variation
1356560	1359080	is being recessional versus Blainer.
1359080	1362920	And the second all the time the second most important
1362920	1366120	mode of variation is correlated the most ways
1366120	1368040	linear versus Binterley.
1368040	1370440	And then give us a very nice way to look at what happened
1370440	1372640	in art history over the last 500 years.
1372640	1377360	So basically what happened is here at Renaissance time
1377360	1381880	art was totally Blainer and basically linear
1381880	1385160	every all the contour was linear and sharp
1385160	1387240	and came Renaissance came Baroque
1387240	1391480	and things start to be recessional depth
1391480	1396480	and art becomes Binterley and the contour become fuzzy.
1397480	1400840	All the way till impressionism
1400840	1402960	where that's the ultimate Binterley experience
1402960	1405880	in impressionism all the strokes are just fuzzy
1405880	1408080	and we don't see any contours.
1408080	1410880	So this is the ultimate Binterley experience
1410880	1415880	but you can see that you still have depth artists
1418880	1423760	looking at scenes and things are still recessional.
1423760	1427920	And then came Cezanne and came 20th century art
1427920	1430480	where basically things become flat
1430480	1432200	artists start flattening the canvas again
1432200	1435480	and becoming to be Blainer again like Renaissance.
1435480	1439080	And basically most of 20th century is in the Blainer side
1439080	1441640	of things but coming to be linear again.
1441640	1446640	So if you look at Bob art like Warhol or abstract art
1447000	1450440	you can find that arts become linear again in the contours.
1450440	1455160	So basically art history went into a full 360 degree cycle
1455160	1458040	over the last 500 years in Western civilization
1458040	1460680	which really captured by this one diagram
1460680	1462400	that really came from the representation
1462400	1465600	the machine learned from looking at art style.
1468320	1471120	And again, some other interesting things
1471120	1472760	that we found in this representation
1472760	1475880	if you look at two of the modes of variation
1475880	1477360	I think these are the fifth and sixth
1477360	1479920	or maybe fourth and fifth modes of variation
1479920	1481640	and he's the one that correlates more
1481640	1484080	with the discrimination between Renaissance and Baroque.
1484080	1485680	So you can see Baroque in the top here
1485680	1487920	and Renaissance in the bottom here.
1487920	1492920	And you can see that basically these two factors
1494480	1499480	are created the most with the bears of Wolverine.
1499760	1502880	So basically Wolverine was correct in suggesting
1502880	1506000	that these bears are a good way
1506000	1508240	to discriminate between Renaissance and Baroque.
1508240	1510400	However, we also found that he's not correct
1510400	1513360	when he said that this can tell the difference
1513360	1515320	between all other styles.
1515320	1520320	All other styles basically are spanned by these five factors
1520400	1522360	because we find that we cannot tell the difference
1522360	1524080	between the inversionism and most inversionism
1524080	1526520	by looking at any of these factors.
1526520	1529280	There is none of them correlate with this discrimination.
1531720	1534440	Another very interesting thing that we find is
1535440	1540440	when we look at the activation manifolds
1541240	1545520	of these networks, in terms of representation
1545520	1547640	of these networks, we look at the activation manifolds.
1547640	1550200	And again here we're visualizing different artworks
1550200	1555040	based on the time of creation from 1400 to 2000.
1555040	1557320	You can see also the movement of art history
1557320	1559760	and how things have changed
1559760	1561320	and you can find interesting connections.
1561320	1564280	So you can see basically Renaissance here
1564400	1566160	moving into Baroque,
1566160	1570320	moving into a new classicism in 19th century,
1570320	1572080	moving into realism,
1572080	1574240	and then moving into inversionism here.
1574240	1575560	And from inversionism basically,
1575560	1577080	both the inversionism went in two direction,
1577080	1579760	one direction that go to exhibitionism
1579760	1582160	and one direction went to abstraction.
1582160	1584920	So you can see Cubism and abstraction here.
1584920	1587840	So that really tell us much about what happened in art history
1587840	1591480	and we find very interesting things when we look at this.
1591480	1593560	For example, if you look at this figure here,
1593640	1595280	look at this connection between inversionism
1595280	1596600	and what happened after.
1596600	1597520	And if you look carefully here,
1597520	1602120	we find that this connection is mainly Cézanne's work.
1602120	1605400	So all the circled artwork here are work by Cézanne.
1605400	1607800	So at the bottom here you can find the inversionism
1607800	1610640	and that's Cézanne and that connect to abstraction
1610640	1612080	and Cubism.
1612080	1613640	So that's interesting.
1613640	1615680	So you can see here Cubism and abstraction
1615680	1619360	in the early 20th century happening after Cézanne.
1619360	1622520	Here's another representation where really here are,
1622680	1625960	here is Cézanne work and this is inversionism
1625960	1630160	and basically this is Cubism, Picasso and Grace
1630160	1631640	and other Cubists.
1631640	1634120	And you can see how Cézanne's connection here,
1634120	1636200	by making the connection between inversionism
1636200	1639880	moving into 20th century and how special his artwork.
1639880	1642760	And you can see that in the data, you can even touch it.
1643960	1645880	You can see how Cézanne is a bridge here.
1645880	1648880	And the interesting thing is that obviously being
1648880	1652800	a naive person when it comes to art history,
1652800	1656280	I always go to Wikipedia when I learned about something.
1656280	1658800	When I go to Wikipedia, I'm learning more about Cézanne.
1658800	1659840	I found this in this encode.
1659840	1661960	Cézanne is said to have formed the bridge
1661960	1663440	between 19th century inversionism
1663440	1668440	and 20th century's artistic inquiries in Cubism
1668520	1673520	and both Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked Cézanne
1673760	1675320	as their father, basically.
1676440	1677560	And that's very interesting
1677560	1679440	because this is not only a metaphor,
1679440	1682800	like a bridge here is not a metaphor like in art history,
1682800	1685240	but actually it's something that you can almost touch
1685240	1687040	in the data, in the visualization.
1687040	1690320	You can see how Cézanne is really connecting this.
1691480	1693760	Not only that, but I mean, another interesting thing here,
1693760	1697080	if you look at this manifold representation,
1697080	1699960	you can see many artworks here are renaissance artworks
1699960	1702920	that are built away from the Renaissance crowd
1702920	1705120	because the way manifold learning work,
1705120	1706800	manifold learning, you're building a graph,
1706840	1711120	connecting all nodes and you do embedding of that graph.
1711120	1713760	So you see here that these renaissance paintings
1713760	1716200	are embedded away from Renaissance.
1716200	1717480	When you look carefully about this,
1717480	1721400	you find that basically these are particular artists
1721400	1723880	that keep appearing again and again here.
1723880	1728880	In particular, we find El Greco and Durer,
1730440	1731640	the German artist.
1732640	1735760	So it's clearly that El Greco and Durer
1735760	1738160	has influenced modern art
1738160	1741160	and many modern artists have really influenced by them.
1741160	1742920	And that's very clear in the case of El Greco
1742920	1746440	because of the way he draw in a very deformed way,
1746440	1750280	which really affected exhibitionism and even cubism.
1750280	1751440	And that's very clear here,
1751440	1754520	why I see El Greco work built away from Renaissance
1754520	1756720	close to modernity, modern art.
1757560	1761320	In Durer, it's very hard to understand really
1761560	1763680	how Durer influenced modern art history,
1763680	1767720	but also Durer is very well known
1767720	1771800	that he's influenced art history in the 20th century,
1771800	1773880	but not clearly exactly how.
1775280	1777320	So that's very interesting.
1777320	1782320	All these tell us about how to characterize style changes,
1782440	1784920	but let's dig deeper into that.
1784920	1788040	And our work that I'm gonna talk about now,
1788040	1791080	back from 2014, six years ago,
1791080	1793800	was about confine creativity in art networks.
1793800	1796760	How can we quantify creativity in art?
1797840	1799640	And you will understand a little bit
1799640	1802800	how that relates to style changes,
1802800	1805200	how that characterize style changes as well.
1805200	1810000	So basically you wanted to develop algorithm
1810000	1813160	that assess creativity of a painting
1813160	1816200	given its context and art history.
1816320	1818960	That might seem to be silly question for some people,
1820160	1821640	but I think it's very important
1822680	1825040	because if you wanna build creative agents,
1825040	1827280	that's able, it has to have its ability
1827280	1829800	to assess creativity by itself.
1829800	1831280	Because at this point, at this point,
1831280	1834600	when a machine create art or music,
1834600	1837560	it's always the human that assess creativity of this machine.
1837560	1839160	You do human subject studies,
1839160	1841280	we give it to judges, things like that.
1841280	1843040	But can the machine on one day
1843040	1845640	be able to assess its own creativity?
1845640	1847480	And for that, we need to develop this algorithm
1847480	1848720	to quantify creativity.
1850160	1851240	But that did us the question,
1851240	1852600	what's creativity to start with?
1852600	1853760	How can we define creativity
1853760	1856880	in a way that's this quantifiable?
1856880	1860640	So there is a historically long and ongoing debate
1860640	1863400	on how to define creativity.
1863400	1865920	We can describe a person to be creative,
1865920	1870120	like Mozart is creative or Warhol is creative.
1870120	1872720	Or we can describe a product to be creative.
1872720	1874160	So we can say, for example,
1875160	1878240	the Mona Lisa was a creative artwork.
1878240	1880160	Or some people refer to characterize
1880160	1884280	the mental process to be creative.
1884280	1887080	So there are different ways to describe creativity.
1887960	1890760	We focus on novelty of a product in particular,
1890760	1892680	whether something is creative or not.
1893800	1897240	So how can we do that in an objective way?
1897240	1902240	So it seems to be the two main condition
1902440	1905480	for some product to be called creative.
1906480	1910200	This product has to be novel compared to prior work,
1910200	1913320	but also has to be of some value.
1913320	1916080	So we will take note of it and become influential.
1916080	1918880	Which exactly what happens in scientific community
1918880	1919800	when you write a paper, right?
1919800	1920760	I mean, you have to be novel
1920760	1923240	compared to prior research.
1923240	1924760	And it doesn't make a difference
1924760	1926200	if nobody cites your work.
1926200	1928960	So basically that tells us it's not influential
1928960	1930000	and not that creative.
1931000	1933520	This is a quote from a very good book,
1933520	1936040	which is a collection of essays about creativity,
1938120	1940080	which basically concluded that
1940080	1942840	although there are different ways to define creativity,
1942840	1946520	these are the most common essence of what creativity is.
1947760	1950440	And that actually relates back to Kant philosophy.
1950440	1951880	If you go to Kant philosophy,
1951880	1955280	he defined five elements of what he called artistic genius.
1955280	1958920	And the very first two of them is originality.
1958960	1962280	The originality must be its primary characteristic
1962280	1963960	and influence.
1963960	1968960	Its product must at the same time be modeled or exemplary.
1969200	1974200	So other artists would start to get influenced by that.
1975640	1977720	So these are the two fundamental reasons
1977720	1981280	behind what he called artistic genius or creativity.
1982480	1984560	Let's move forward to the 20th century.
1985480	1989360	One person in the audience asked a question
1989360	1991080	referring to Margaret Bowden.
1991080	1993680	So Margaret Bowden suggested basically
1993680	1996360	two distinct notion of creativity,
1996360	2000000	the psychological creativity or be creativity,
2000000	2002080	which assists the novelty of idea
2002080	2003240	with respect to its creator.
2004360	2006200	Versus historical creativity,
2006200	2008760	which is assessing the novelty
2008760	2011280	with respect to the whole human history
2011280	2014320	is what I'm creating valuable and novel
2014320	2016520	compared to all what happened in history.
2017800	2019920	So this is the objective measure.
2019920	2023640	The psychological creativity is more of a subjective measure.
2023640	2027120	But historical creativity is a objective measure.
2027120	2028880	So basically that's what we're trying to do.
2028880	2030760	We're trying to align ourselves
2030760	2033000	with historical creativity of product
2033000	2035120	and try to define an algorithm to do that.
2037400	2040680	So we propose an algorithm to assess creativity
2040680	2042040	that's basically unsupervised,
2042040	2045440	meaning that we don't have any creativity labels.
2045440	2047880	We just have a bunch of artworks.
2047880	2049240	And the only information we're gonna have
2049240	2052160	is the date that artwork was done.
2052160	2053200	So these are two information,
2053200	2055720	the image and the date, nothing else.
2055720	2057680	And we're trying to infer from that
2057680	2059040	something about creativity.
2060480	2062280	Some fundamental issues we have to think about
2062280	2066080	before even we start deriving any algorithm about creativity
2066080	2067880	because these are common problems.
2069480	2071320	These are common problems that will face
2071320	2075000	any algorithm that will look at creativity.
2075000	2077640	So we have an algorithm that assess creativity.
2077640	2079480	That algorithm looking at an artwork
2079480	2082760	and try to judge whether it's creative or not.
2082760	2085120	Obviously that cannot be done in a vacuum.
2085120	2089400	The algorithm has to look at the context
2089400	2093800	of that art history to judge, right?
2093800	2095680	So this one limitation that the algorithm
2095680	2098240	only see a part of art history,
2098240	2100280	that whatever digitized, whatever reached us
2100280	2102880	and digitized and available as a dataset, right?
2102880	2104960	So that's one problem.
2104960	2106440	So these are closed,
2106440	2109280	what I call the closed world limitation.
2109280	2111240	And then the algorithm look at the art
2111240	2114000	through some visual encoding, which also add limitation.
2114000	2116440	So there are some concepts and elements
2116440	2121440	that are being quantified here through these visual features.
2121880	2124080	And there are others that might not.
2124080	2126280	So that's basically another limitation,
2126280	2130000	which I call the artistic concept quantification limitation.
2130720	2132320	And then any algorithm has parameters
2132320	2133880	and this parameter will influence the output.
2133880	2136480	So we can get different results
2136480	2137440	by changing the parameters.
2137440	2140200	So how can we make use of that?
2142080	2146840	So, however, these are all limitation should not stop us
2146840	2150000	because first the closed world limitation
2150000	2151800	will always go away.
2151800	2153520	We have more and more art being digitized
2153520	2156200	and more data we can get.
2156200	2159120	So this will go away.
2159120	2162160	We have advances every day in visual encoding
2162160	2166800	and become less blind and have better encoding.
2166800	2168760	And the parameters actually are not a limitation
2168760	2170400	because the parameter actually,
2170400	2173320	we can really give creativity scores
2173320	2177400	and understand exactly how the parameters affect the scores
2177400	2180720	in a way to understand what we are measuring.
2180720	2183680	Are we measuring creativity based on certain settings
2183680	2186280	related to composition or are you measuring
2186600	2190320	visibility to brush stroke work or color?
2190320	2195320	So all that allow us to reach way to understand K-division.
2196440	2199480	So the bottom line is we wanna derive an algorithm
2199480	2204480	that look at art pieces, images and their timestamp
2204800	2206280	and give us a score.
2207320	2209840	So that's basically the input and output.
2209840	2213560	And what we do is that we start creating a directed graph
2213560	2215800	between all paintings in our collection,
2215800	2219440	where there is an edge between each two paintings
2219440	2221800	with a weight reflecting the visual similarity
2221800	2223600	according to the visual encoding that we are using,
2223600	2225840	how similar these two paintings are.
2225840	2228160	And it's directed based on the time basically
2228160	2232480	if BI comes before BJ, so it's directed in that way.
2232480	2236320	And now let's think about assemble inference we can do.
2236320	2237840	Suppose you look at these two arts,
2237840	2242120	Caravaggio from 1602 and a less known artist from 1800,
2242120	2244160	almost 200 years later.
2244200	2246160	If you look at these two artworks side by side,
2246160	2248480	you can realize basically that this second artwork
2248480	2250800	is very close to that in terms of body bowls,
2250800	2253320	in terms of light, in terms of composition,
2253320	2256000	subject matter, everything's basically, right?
2256000	2259400	So it's clear that that work is a derivative of Caravaggio.
2259400	2262800	So in one sense that artwork is not as novel
2262800	2264600	compared to Caravaggio.
2264600	2268840	And in another sense, Caravaggio has an influence
2268840	2271160	in that way to that artist.
2272120	2276000	So high similarity between two artworks in the network
2276000	2280360	imply that creativity of the earlier work has to go up
2280360	2284480	and creativity of the later artwork has to go down.
2284480	2285880	These go down because it's derivative
2285880	2288400	and these go up because it's influential,
2288400	2290760	at least on these two bears.
2290760	2292640	Compared to another case like that,
2292640	2295600	these are precisely from 1883
2295600	2300600	and this Picasso from maybe 20 years later from 1907,
2300880	2302160	they are very different,
2302160	2304280	had nothing to do with each other,
2304280	2306520	different ways of using color, composition,
2308240	2309200	totally different, right?
2309200	2310680	So very little similarity between them,
2310680	2312960	of course, depending on the future you are looking for,
2312960	2315480	but still very low similarity.
2315480	2319080	And that imply that Cicely was not influential
2319080	2321080	on Picasso, at least in a direct way.
2321080	2324320	And Picasso was basically novel in making that art
2324320	2325520	compared to this work.
2325520	2329520	So that low similarity implies lower creativity
2329520	2331120	for that artwork by Cicely
2331120	2334120	and higher creativity for that work by Picasso.
2334120	2337600	So if you take these two elements of influence
2337600	2341800	and start building a formulation for creativity,
2341800	2344440	what you can do, we can write down a formulation like that,
2344440	2347040	where the creativity of any node can be described
2347040	2350720	as the creativity of all nodes connected to it.
2350720	2354480	In this formula here, alpha is a factor
2354480	2356480	that indicate the probability that the similarity
2356480	2358720	between painting can be just a coincidence.
2360360	2363640	And the way to interpret this formula is like that.
2364680	2368040	Any node in the graph collect influence
2368040	2369960	from all its outgoing connection
2371120	2372920	in this submission here.
2372920	2374800	And for any node in the graph,
2374800	2378560	it distributes its creativity tokens
2378560	2380880	among all incoming connections.
2380880	2384240	So you reach this formula that you can write
2384280	2387640	where this formula actually, if you look at it,
2387640	2389680	it's basically an instance
2389680	2391840	of what's called network centrality problems.
2392760	2395440	So you can see how many other algorithms
2395440	2396640	are special cases for this,
2396640	2398160	or at least a special case for others.
2398160	2399680	So you can think of this as a random work
2399680	2400840	in a Markov chain.
2400840	2404160	If you set alpha to be one, this term will vanish
2404160	2405800	and you have this term only,
2405800	2409000	which is called basically eigenvector centrality.
2409760	2412680	You can think of it as a weighted variant
2412680	2414480	of Hubel centrality.
2414480	2417000	If you're familiar with this body of work,
2417000	2418920	basically network centrality.
2418920	2421040	But basically, network centrality is very fundamental
2421040	2423160	in studying social networks in the days,
2423160	2425800	in studying pandemics, propagation, things like that.
2425800	2428240	Even in the Bej rank algorithm,
2428240	2432600	by Google is basically a network centrality problem.
2432600	2434360	And you can think of this formulation
2434360	2438480	as basically inverted weighted variants of Bej rank.
2440000	2444160	So we can even extend this in a way
2444160	2448240	to separate originality from influence.
2448240	2450360	So we can see that basically originality
2450360	2452800	can be controlled by another parameter,
2452800	2453960	is we can measure originality
2453960	2456600	or can measure influence in particular.
2456600	2459760	So the question is, how can you even evaluate that?
2459760	2462120	If everything is so unsupervised here,
2462120	2464640	you don't have any creativity labels,
2464640	2466280	you can show results to 10 art history
2466280	2468080	and everybody will have different opinions.
2468080	2472360	So how can we even evaluate this algorithm?
2472360	2475760	So we worked on different datasets,
2475760	2476640	the wiki art datasets
2476640	2479640	and something called archive datasets much older.
2480800	2484520	And at that time, we did this work on 7.14.
2484520	2488640	And at that time, this is the art in the vision
2488640	2491720	was mainly things like jest and bag of words
2491720	2492560	and things like that.
2492560	2493400	And that was really excellent
2493400	2495520	because we really wanted to use features
2495520	2497360	that are not trained on art at all.
2497360	2499800	So these are of the shelf features.
2499800	2501240	Class me, it was a feature
2501240	2506240	that basically encode object representation in images.
2506520	2510840	So it's a very good way to encode subject matter
2510840	2514840	in particular, just come from MIT,
2514840	2516160	basically comes from MIT,
2516160	2519720	which encode texture and other things
2519720	2522200	to object and scene classification.
2522200	2525920	So we thought that these two features are very useful.
2525920	2526960	They are not trained on art,
2526960	2528160	they are generic,
2528160	2530840	the capture things that we can relate to in art
2530840	2535840	with a subject matter or brushstrokes or scene composition.
2536800	2537800	So let's use them
2537800	2540840	and try to make sense of those based on that.
2540840	2544480	So here's one chart that show basically time
2544480	2548520	of x axis from 1400 till 2000.
2548520	2552720	And every artwork here is blotted with its creativity score.
2552720	2554840	So the higher the score,
2554840	2557880	the y axis is the creativity score.
2559160	2561040	And you have to remember that the formulation
2561040	2561960	is a zero one game,
2561960	2564000	meaning that if some artwork,
2564000	2565960	if you give it a set of artworks,
2565960	2567840	the sum has to be a constant.
2567840	2570680	So for some artwork to score high,
2570680	2572840	another has to score low.
2572840	2574960	Everything that we give to the algorithm
2574960	2576680	are master pieces of artwork anyway.
2576680	2579560	So nothing here is really scrambled
2579560	2581480	by somebody in the street.
2581480	2584880	All these are master pieces.
2584880	2587000	But the way to look and interpret this,
2587000	2589880	we essentially are using in particular class me
2589880	2594400	and just we are really trying to look at creativity
2594400	2595640	with this subject matter,
2595640	2598360	how creative were artists in depicting
2598360	2600680	the subject matter over time.
2602560	2604240	So we can see, for example,
2604240	2606160	what scores low in 19th centuries
2606160	2610120	is art by the amazing artist,
2610120	2611560	Prince of Hungary.
2612640	2614360	Why this score low?
2614360	2616440	Because basically according to subject matter,
2616440	2618920	there's nothing really innovative
2618920	2622480	about having a portrait of a woman in 19th century
2622480	2624640	because this has been done a lot in Renaissance
2624640	2625480	and broke all the time.
2625480	2627800	So subject matter was not re novel.
2627800	2630000	While in the same time what scored very high
2630000	2632440	was things like a monk,
2632440	2634320	the scream or money,
2635360	2638240	haystack, very early version of that and others.
2638240	2643240	So when we look carefully on the 100 years
2644080	2645600	from 1850 to 1950,
2645600	2647760	when we have a lot of data digitized
2647760	2649480	and a lot of artwork,
2649480	2650720	we can find that the machine makes sense
2650720	2653240	a lot about what happened in art history in that time.
2653240	2655560	So you can see the machine identifying things like
2655560	2657720	mink, the scream, giving very high score,
2658920	2660160	climp booster,
2662960	2665840	things like cubism and things like that.
2665840	2669920	So that makes sense.
2669920	2672160	I hear deeper into that.
2672160	2675040	If you look at the first 10 years of 20th century,
2675960	2677920	the first 10 years of 20th century,
2677920	2680560	the highest scoring artwork, for example,
2680560	2682960	is Picasso, Ladies of Abinon.
2684080	2686520	I didn't know much about that artwork other than I like it,
2686520	2689200	but I didn't know much about its history at the time.
2690640	2692160	But when I look at its history,
2692160	2693880	I find that art history now agrees
2693880	2697160	that basically artwork was the beginning of cubism.
2697160	2699440	Very early, even before cubism become a thing.
2699440	2701080	And what you see in this graph here,
2701080	2703240	the machine give this a very high score
2703240	2708240	and what's stopping that in 1912 is actually cubism itself.
2708440	2710920	So these are artworks when basically
2710920	2714560	in the very early cubism exhibitions
2714560	2719560	by Picasso and Brock.
2719840	2721840	And you can see here that before that,
2721840	2723440	that was the high scoring one.
2723440	2725040	And this is stopping that.
2725040	2728840	What's stopping that even more in 1915,
2728840	2730800	artwork by Malevich,
2730800	2733640	what's called supremist art movement,
2733640	2736640	which is totally abstraction in 1915.
2736640	2739040	That's stopping even cubism.
2739040	2740920	Okay, anyway, all that's nice,
2740920	2745920	but how can we even say that it works or not?
2746640	2748160	It's all in total evidence, right?
2748160	2751840	I mean, here is what's something very interesting.
2751840	2753320	What was that artwork
2753320	2755840	that giving very high score in that short here?
2755840	2759080	And when you look at curfew at that artwork in particular,
2759080	2761480	you find it's an artwork by Mondrian
2762440	2766680	that was dated in our dataset to be in 1910.
2766680	2768760	And that was very interesting.
2768760	2770560	Obviously, when you find something that you have to look at
2770560	2774040	and see why this is scoring very high.
2774040	2775680	And I find something very interesting
2775680	2778560	that basically Mondrian didn't bend this in 1910.
2778800	2782400	Mondrian bent this in 1932, I guess, I don't remember.
2782400	2786040	So that was a mistake in the dataset.
2786040	2787840	So the dataset itself has something wrong
2787840	2790840	that would say basically Mondrian went into that in 1910.
2790840	2794120	And if Mondrian would have painted that in 1910,
2794120	2795800	that would have been even before cubism,
2795800	2796640	before abstraction
2796640	2800360	and would have been the most creative artist in his time.
2800360	2802160	But obviously that's not.
2802160	2805680	But that mistake actually give us a very interesting idea
2805680	2808520	about how to even evaluate this.
2808560	2810480	So there are many results here, I'm gonna skip that.
2810480	2815480	And the way we evaluate this is what's called art time machine.
2818680	2822400	So the idea is this very, very simple idea
2822400	2826200	that come from this mistaken, the dating of that artwork.
2826200	2829400	So what happened if you take an artwork from Barak
2829400	2833000	or Renaissance and move it forward in time
2833000	2835240	and change its date to, let's say, 19th century
2835240	2837280	or 20th century, what do you expect?
2837280	2841560	Give the algorithm work that the creativity of score
2841560	2842960	for that artwork has to go down
2842960	2844800	because if you create an Renaissance artwork
2844800	2847200	in 19th century, you are not creative.
2847200	2849080	In the same time, you take an artwork from 19th century
2849080	2852320	or 20th century and move it back to 1400 or 1500,
2853360	2857520	you expect its creative score to be going very up
2857520	2859160	because it would have been very different
2859160	2860720	from what happened in the time
2860720	2865400	and very early influence to what happened much later.
2865400	2868240	So we expect its creativity score to go up.
2868240	2869160	And that's what we did.
2869160	2871920	So what we did is basically many experiments
2871920	2876240	where we take only 10 artworks, change their timestamp
2876240	2880560	randomly, either moving them backward to 1600
2880560	2885560	from modern schools or moving forward to 1900
2885840	2887680	for Renaissance and Barak.
2887680	2889600	Or basically as a baseline, just to move them
2889600	2893400	around 1600 randomly.
2893400	2895480	We basically find that that's interesting,
2895480	2899840	but if you move forward, Renaissance and Barak artwork
2899840	2902880	to 19th century, you can see consistent drop
2902880	2906080	of creativity by eight to 10%.
2906080	2910000	So it's consistent when we did these experiments.
2911040	2914640	If you move modern artwork from 19th and 20th century
2914640	2919240	back to 1600, you can see that the creativity score increase.
2919240	2922200	However, with varying degrees depending on the art movement
2922200	2923640	and that makes a lot of sense.
2923640	2926000	For example, if you're looking at exhibitionism
2926000	2928160	or cubism or post-embranches,
2928160	2930400	we can find a huge increase in creativity
2930400	2935080	if you move them back to 1600, compared to a new class system.
2935080	2937080	A new class system basically is a reinvention
2937080	2940360	of Renaissance in 19th century.
2940360	2943480	So if you move it back to 1600, you have only a 5% increase
2944720	2948240	compared to 16% increase for post-embranches.
2948240	2949080	So that's right.
2949080	2950080	How we tell us basically the algorithm
2950080	2951800	is really doing something making sense
2951800	2954520	in terms of quantifying creativity
2954520	2956520	and giving us a score that really captured
2956520	2958720	the novelty and influence that we're looking for.
2960040	2965040	When I showed these results to my art historian collaborator,
2965760	2967760	Maria Mazzoni at the College of Charleston,
2967760	2969280	she was interested in the result
2969280	2970560	and gave me this book, basically,
2970560	2972760	Shev's Art History, which I quoted from in the beginning
2972760	2975080	by George Kubler, who's an art historian.
2975080	2977600	And in this book, basically, Kubler had a theory
2977600	2981560	about how art history evolved.
2981560	2986320	So basically saying that artists copy ideas
2986320	2987680	from each other all the time.
2987680	2991400	That's what happened all the time, within a style.
2991400	2993320	Until, basically, some artists come
2993320	2998320	and makes some artwork that is really different for some reason.
3000640	3004720	And that's what he called primary objects,
3004720	3008320	really give birth to a new style.
3008320	3010480	And if other artists start to take a note of that
3010480	3014880	and start replicating this new style,
3014880	3016840	that becomes a new style.
3016840	3021160	So, basically, he focused on this concept of prime objects,
3021160	3025000	which are iconic artwork, and replica mass,
3025000	3030000	as opposed to that really drive style moving forward,
3031680	3032920	within a style.
3032920	3036680	And I even find very interesting quotes in his book
3036680	3040080	that say, basically, primary objects here.
3040080	3043880	Prime objects resemble prime numbers of mathematics,
3043880	3046320	because no conclusive rules is known
3046320	3049600	to govern the appearance of either,
3049600	3052240	although such a rule may be found.
3053280	3056080	So, basically, this is a very amazing analogy.
3056080	3057800	You make the analogy between these prime objects
3057800	3060360	in art history and prime numbers.
3060360	3064080	The prime numbers cannot be divided by a number before them,
3064080	3066640	but they divide many numbers that comes after them.
3067640	3072640	And that analogy really gives me thinking about
3073320	3076880	the algorithm that describes the graph inference algorithm.
3078000	3080080	If we can start with this graph,
3080080	3081760	and the nodes are numbers,
3081760	3084560	and the arrows are divisibility,
3084560	3087520	the algorithm, basically, will give you a high score
3087520	3089960	to prime numbers by definition.
3089960	3092680	By construction, you find that that algorithm
3092680	3095440	will give high score to prime numbers.
3095480	3098080	So, really, he's very, very correct in this analogy
3098080	3101760	that prime object is actually very similar
3101760	3102840	to the concept of prime numbers.
3102840	3105720	And what you're actually doing in this network
3105720	3107400	by giving creative score,
3107400	3111960	we are identifying what are the prime objects
3111960	3113800	in art history, things like Montesquim,
3113800	3115760	or Picasso, ladies have been on.
3115760	3119400	So, when art historians tell us that this artwork is major,
3119400	3123480	or basically the population think of Montesquim,
3123520	3128520	or Monet, his tag as really a masterpiece,
3128720	3130600	this is totally not subjective.
3130600	3134280	There is some unconscious reasons for that.
3134280	3138440	And this can be quantified by this kind of networks.
3138440	3141520	And they are really a changing moment in history
3141520	3143320	where something totally different happened
3143320	3146200	and artists start taking notice.
3147160	3148640	So, because of the time,
3148640	3152800	I just wanna go very fast toward the next topic,
3152800	3154760	which I'll try to finish in two minutes,
3154760	3157840	which is basically how can we actually use AI
3157840	3158840	to generate art?
3159760	3162560	And if the machine generate images,
3162560	3164880	would that be considered art or not?
3165960	3167880	These are very big topic.
3167880	3170440	And I know that other speakers in this series
3170440	3172520	will talk about that in detail.
3175080	3176480	Aaron is gonna be speaking,
3176480	3179160	or maybe has been already in this series.
3179160	3183320	But basically our work from three years ago,
3183320	3185280	called Creative Adversarial Network,
3185280	3188840	can, which basically we try to make a variant of GAN
3188840	3193400	that was new at that time to really generate a novel art.
3193400	3197120	We call it generating art by deviating from style known,
3198360	3201360	by learning about style and being from style known.
3201360	3204480	These are some of the art that this network is generating.
3204480	3207000	So, basically wanna, here's the story.
3207000	3209560	Obviously, the audience here know deep learning
3209560	3211280	and know GANs and know how they work.
3211280	3213680	I don't have to go through that.
3213680	3216640	And for example, GANs have been very successful
3216640	3218120	in generating these images of bedrooms
3218120	3222960	and other assets, very interesting things like that.
3224360	3226560	So, one question would be,
3226560	3228840	what happened if you train GANs on art images?
3228840	3231960	Suppose you give it art history images
3231960	3235040	and you train GANs on that, would it generate art?
3235040	3240040	And actually there was some trials in the early days of GANs
3241120	3244000	where people trained it on board trays
3244000	3247320	and still lifes and things like that.
3249760	3252460	However, this fundamental problem,
3253360	3257000	the generator in GAN is trained to generate samples
3257000	3258640	that pulls the discriminator to believe
3258640	3262720	they're coming from the same distribution as the inputs.
3262760	3264640	So, that's basically,
3264640	3267120	we can think about Chinese room problem here.
3267120	3272120	Imagine the generator have access to actual images
3272400	3273640	and can sheet.
3273640	3275280	So, you can take actual images of art
3275280	3277880	and just generate it right away
3277880	3279320	and give it to the discriminator.
3279320	3281160	So, actually, the discriminator this way
3281160	3282360	can be pulled right away
3282360	3285160	that thinking and generating these art works.
3286040	3289880	However, this is basically the Chinese room problem.
3289880	3292920	So, there is no motivation for the generator
3292920	3294640	actually to generate anything that's creative.
3294640	3296080	The generator is just trying to generate something
3296080	3297680	from the same distribution.
3297680	3299720	The only creativity it can do
3299720	3300520	is just to generate something
3300520	3304000	that was not generated before from the distribution.
3304000	3309000	But it's basically, if you give it artworks of board trays,
3310920	3312720	it will generate some different board tray,
3312720	3315720	but still a board tray that's very similar to what it sees.
3316720	3320840	There's no force, the bush, again, to be creative.
3320840	3322000	How can you change that?
3323000	3324120	There's some background here
3324120	3326320	that I have to go very fast over
3326320	3331080	from coming from the field of aesthetic evolution
3331080	3331920	and psychology.
3332840	3335480	Basically, these three in one slide
3335480	3340480	say that artists keep making the same kind of art all the time.
3343000	3344200	Like, if artists in Renaissance
3344200	3346800	keep doing the same kind of Renaissance all the time,
3346800	3348200	because of habituation,
3348200	3350880	we get bored of that as the viewer get bored of that.
3350880	3352800	And that become not exciting for the artist,
3352800	3353800	not exciting for the critic,
3353800	3355720	not exciting for the viewer anymore.
3355720	3358000	So, artist has to innovate all the time
3358000	3361080	to go to bush against habituation.
3361080	3363280	However, if artists innovate too much,
3363280	3367400	if artists imagine because I did that in Renaissance time,
3367400	3370520	or even when he did that in 20th century,
3370520	3371680	that's too shocking.
3371680	3373680	That people will not like that.
3373680	3375760	And people actually didn't like that.
3375760	3377800	Most people till now didn't like that.
3377800	3379960	Because basically according to what's called
3379960	3381600	one curve in psychology,
3382480	3387480	too much arousal relates to negative hedonics.
3388720	3391880	Basically, people start to unlike what they see.
3391880	3395400	So, in one sense, artists have to bush against habituation
3395400	3397800	in what's called basically least efforts.
3397800	3401120	So, artists really have to really bush the envelope
3401120	3403480	with the least minimum amount
3403480	3404480	to bush against habituation
3404480	3408080	without falling into the negative part of that curve.
3408080	3410120	So, that basically the concept that we're trying to bush,
3410120	3413840	how can we bush the network to be innovative,
3413840	3416280	but keep it within the distribution,
3416280	3418480	bush the boundary basically.
3418480	3422080	So, the way we did it is basically,
3422080	3425320	in particular, we're trying to go out of style
3425320	3427240	by appealing style ambiguity.
3427240	3430120	So, the network here is again,
3431120	3435840	we still have the real false, real fake loss,
3435840	3437560	which is in that case, art or not art
3437560	3439720	because you're training on art.
3439720	3442560	Then the network has a style classification.
3442560	3444560	The discriminator also learn about style
3444560	3446360	and try to classify styles.
3446360	3448040	We give it style labels.
3448040	3452520	And we added style ambiguity loss,
3452520	3455960	which basically mean that the discriminator
3455960	3459680	trying to see if the art as a generator fits within styles
3459720	3462960	or ambiguous in terms of satisfying style.
3462960	3466240	And we're trying to basically maximize style ambiguity
3466240	3469920	at the same time minimizing the typical loss
3469920	3474920	in real fake formulation.
3477720	3480040	So, basically, this is the loss
3480040	3481720	and we have art or not art.
3481720	3483760	We have style classification loss
3483760	3488440	and we have this style ambiguity,
3488440	3489520	which I think is very essential
3489520	3494520	because this style ambiguity bushes against art, not art.
3494920	3497280	Art, not art loss, typical gun loss,
3497280	3500440	will try to boost things into the distribution.
3500440	3503640	And style ambiguity will try to boost things
3503640	3504480	away from distribution,
3504480	3507800	but keeping that will put it back.
3507800	3511080	So, the dilemma between this almost objective
3511080	3514720	really boost the machine to try to explore the boundary.
3514720	3516400	And that's why we started getting
3516400	3519400	this very interesting artwork
3519400	3521520	that have very nice composition.
3521520	3523360	Here we train the machine on art history
3523360	3525600	from the last 500 years of art history,
3525600	3529640	all subject matter, all style, we didn't do any curation.
3529640	3531720	The goal is if the machine see all that art,
3531720	3532800	what will it generate?
3532800	3536240	Will it generate similar artworks or something novel?
3536240	3537080	And the interesting thing,
3537080	3538520	most of the things I'm machine generate
3538520	3540120	actually abstract artwork.
3540120	3541680	It didn't give us much board trace
3541680	3544400	or landscape mainly abstract.
3544400	3546840	And that was very interesting question.
3546840	3551840	If we remove the style ambiguity loss,
3552400	3554360	these what kind of things you can get,
3554360	3558240	which are basically things that looks like
3558240	3560760	mainly repetition of art history.
3560760	3564000	The machine here again is just basically trying to
3564000	3566440	generate things that looks like the distribution.
3566440	3569880	Adding style ambiguity to the different results.
3569880	3573640	Trying to, you can see it keep the aesthetic,
3573640	3575240	it learned the aesthetics trying to keep it to be
3575240	3577160	in the distribution of what's appealing,
3577160	3579120	but trying to come up with new compositions
3579120	3583040	and new combination of colors, new interesting things.
3583040	3586000	And we did a lot of experiments.
3586000	3588520	There's much time to go over them in details,
3588520	3590240	but here is the conclusion.
3590240	3592640	When we show these two human subjects
3592640	3596000	combined with artwork from Art Basel 2016,
3596000	3601000	which is a flagship art fair in contemporary artists
3601080	3606080	and also combined with another set of abstract exhibitions,
3607200	3609600	famous artworks as a baseline.
3609600	3611880	And to our surprise,
3611880	3615680	basically human subject thought art done by Cannes,
3615680	3620520	the machine basically has done by human 75% of the time
3620520	3624000	compared to 85% of the time for the case of abstract.
3624000	3629000	And only 48% of the time for art from the Art Basel.
3631840	3632960	Collection.
3632960	3635120	This doesn't take anything about creativity of the art.
3635120	3637280	It's basically a touring test to tell whether a human
3637280	3642120	can tell what art is made by a human or by a Gann.
3642120	3645080	And at that time, basically most art that is done by Gann
3645080	3649400	has this uncanny look that right away you can tell it's a Gann.
3649400	3650600	It's the format for trace,
3650600	3653040	the format so you can tell it's a machine,
3653040	3656240	but for Cannes work, you cannot tell the difference.
3656240	3657560	It's given these high scores.
3657560	3664560	And moreover, they give it described by words like intentional,
3664560	3669560	has a composition, rules, has communication inspirational.
3670200	3673320	Give it high score in all these as with the same as art made
3673320	3674160	by human.
3675000	3677120	One last thing is why it works?
3677120	3678640	Why style ambiguity work?
3679720	3682400	And that connects to what I talked about earlier.
3683960	3685080	It is not biased with the data,
3685240	3688960	because maybe you have less abstract art work in your collection
3688960	3690880	and that's why it's generating abstracts.
3690880	3694840	And it is not because all the schools here
3696280	3699360	we combine them into bins to make them uniform.
3702240	3704880	So according to our laws, if these are the solution
3704880	3706600	and these are the styles,
3706600	3710080	those are a plenty of room in between to create something
3710080	3713240	that belongs to art and doesn't belong to styles.
3713240	3715160	The machine tried to find out these spaces.
3715160	3718680	However, if you look at this figure from before,
3718680	3719920	that's renaissance, Baroque,
3719920	3721640	impressionism, realism and things like that.
3721640	3723880	You can see that there's no relation art history.
3723880	3726080	Everything has been moving smoothly.
3726080	3729560	And if you want to move forward,
3729560	3731160	obviously this two-dimension block here,
3731160	3732920	but the space is much bigger.
3732920	3734440	If we really move forward,
3734440	3737040	you cannot really get something just between renaissance
3737040	3737880	and Baroque.
3737880	3739200	You have really a budget trajectory forward,
3739200	3742480	not insert something in between.
3742480	3745480	And that's exactly why it works.
3745480	3749920	So, and that's why it tends to generate more abstract
3749920	3752120	than more uncanny repetition of the best
3752120	3754960	because it's figured out basically in the 19th century,
3754960	3756160	things are moving in that direction
3756160	3759920	and there are more space to make creating abstract art works
3759920	3762360	and studio art works without having to go
3762360	3766440	and creating board trays and battle field
3766440	3769280	and landscapes that the students can tell right away.
3769280	3771200	It's renaissance and Baroque.
3771200	3774000	So that's at least my understanding of this board.
3774000	3775680	Anyway, I'll have to stop here
3775680	3778440	because I went over time and I'm very sorry about that.
3778440	3780840	The conclusion is we just sketched the surface.
3780840	3783400	These are not to be discovered in art history
3783400	3788400	by looking at art at a macro level using the science and AI.
3788520	3791120	And also they are to be discovered
3791120	3794040	by trying to boost the AI to be created.
3794040	3795040	Thank you very much.
3795800	3798600	Thank you very much, Professor Elgamal.
3798600	3802600	It was very interesting discussion and analysis
3802600	3805240	over history of art.
3805240	3807240	I really appreciate that.
3808240	3813240	I think that if anyone has any question,
3813240	3816240	otherwise excellent.
3820240	3823240	I think it was very interesting.
3823240	3825240	It was very interesting.
3825240	3827960	I liked hearing about all of the art history
3827960	3832160	and then relating it to the computer science aspects.
3833680	3835200	Thank you.
3835200	3837760	I hope it wasn't boring from the perspective.
3837760	3840960	It was very interesting, especially trying
3840960	3844280	to quantify creativity was interesting
3844280	3847840	and kind of related to the previous talk as well.
3849400	3852960	I also find it very important that there is a separation
3852960	3856240	between science and humanities.
3857120	3859280	What we are doing in computer vision
3859280	3862880	and if you talk about being creative
3862880	3865000	and doing machine creativity
3866320	3869000	and you are disconnected from what's happening
3869000	3871600	in art history or rural art history,
3871600	3873160	we are making a big mistake.
3873160	3874600	As I said, I mean, for example,
3874600	3877160	the concept of style transfer in vision
3877160	3879200	and machine learning, totally nonsense.
3879200	3881920	When it comes to artists and it comes to art history
3881920	3883040	and we still keep doing that.
3883040	3885120	We find like hundreds and hundreds of people
3885120	3887800	come every year about style transfer.
3887800	3889520	We should keep doing the same thing.
3889520	3891400	It was totally nonsense to me
3891400	3892360	because that's not style
3892360	3894320	and that's not what interests artists
3894320	3896640	and what interests art history.
3896640	3900360	So this connect is really not good.
3902040	3904680	Thank you so much for sharing your interest with us.
3904680	3909560	I think that this is very intriguing for anyone
3909680	3912520	in the class who wants to believe myself,
3912520	3916280	who wants to explore more in this direction.
3917120	3921480	So I appreciate your time and talk.
3921480	3922480	Thank you so much.
3924960	3929960	Okay, I think that we can stop you eating your nap.
3930640	3932120	Thank you.
3932120	3933680	Okay, have a good time.
3933680	3934520	You too.
3934520	3935360	Thank you very much.
