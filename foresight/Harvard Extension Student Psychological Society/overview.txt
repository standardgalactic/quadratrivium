Checking Harvard Extension Student Psychological Society/From Mind to Matter - Dr. Michael Levin.txt
1. Dr. Levin discusses the potential for regenerative medicine to increase healthspan, drawing inspiration from planaria and salamanders. The goal is to trigger regeneration across an organism's lifespan, potentially using inexpensive ion channel drugs that are already human-approved and off-patent.

2. Dr. Levin emphasizes the affordability of these potential treatments once the necessary research and development (R&D) have been completed. He highlights that the R&D is currently expensive because it involves creating new equipment, software, and protocols from scratch.

3. The conversation touches on the philosophical aspects of transferring consciousness or identity into silicon-based systems, addressing whether our understanding of hardware and software can be applied to the idea of preserving human minds or personalities in computers.

4. Dr. Levin raises questions about the value of creating digital copies of ourselves, pointing out that the original self would still age and die, even if a copy exists elsewhere. This leads to a discussion on what we truly value and whether technology like this will ever be feasible within a relevant timeframe.

5. Dr. Levin is appreciative of the engagement and interest from the audience and invites anyone with further questions to reach out via email.

6. The event concludes with thanks to both Dr. Levin and Dr. Chesney for their insights and contributions to the discussion on regenerative medicine and the potential implications for human consciousness.
