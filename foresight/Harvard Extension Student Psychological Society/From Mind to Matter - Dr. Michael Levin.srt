00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,320
Hi, welcome. My name is Kimia Grigoryev and I'm the founder and president of HESPSS. Before

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,200
we get started, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for being here, and I also

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,160
want to thank our amazing team for working tirelessly to put this event together. I also

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,120
want to thank Dr. Michael Levin for agreeing to do this event with us. We are incredibly

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,440
honored and could not thank you enough. It is my honor to introduce Dr. Max Krasnow.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,800
He is a highly respected and esteemed professor, speaker, researcher,

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,360
and we're fortunate enough to call him our wonderful faculty advisor for the Harvard

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
Extension School Psychology Student Society. We are truly honored to have his invaluable

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,880
guidance, support, and advice. With a decade of teaching experience at Harvard in the college,

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,720
graduate school of arts and sciences, and in the Extension School, his expertise is vast and

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,920
invaluable. Prior to joining Harvard, Dr. Krasnow earned his PhD in psychology from UC Santa Barbara

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,240
with a focus on developmental and evolutionary psychology. His background and expertise make

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,600
his insights incredibly valuable to our society and its members. Additionally, Dr. Krasnow is known

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,040
for consistently going above and beyond for his students to ensure their academic and professional

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:36,560
success. Please help me welcome Dr. Max Krasnow. Thank you, Kimia. So it is my privilege today

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,800
to introduce Dr. Michael Levin. Michael Levin attended TAPS University, where he received dual

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,520
bachelor's degrees in computer science and biology. He earned a PhD from Harvard University

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,960
for the first characterization of the molecular genetic mechanisms that allow embryos to form

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,680
a consistently left-right asymmetric body structure in a universe that doesn't distinguish that for

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,040
them. This work is on nature's list of 100 milestones in developmental biology of the past

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,120
century. He's the distinguished professor and Vannevar Bush Chair in the Department of Biology

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,200
at TAPS University, where he also serves as the director of the Center for Regenerative and

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,520
Developmental Biology. After a career as a software engineer in the field of scientific computing,

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,680
Professor Levin earned his bachelor's in both computer science and biology, like I said,

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,640
before coming to Harvard for his PhD. Later in his postdoc and up to his current positions,

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
he's won numerous other awards that I won't take more time to mention,

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,000
nor the journals that he serves as editor for, and so on and so on, because I'm too excited to get

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,800
straight to letting us all hear from him. Let me present to you now Dr. Michael Levin,

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,200
who will be telling us all about bioelectricity, body intelligence, and the future of regenerative

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
medicine. And I'll say that right one of these days.

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,640
All right, thank you so much. Really appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you.

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,400
I hope you will see how all of this relates to psychology, because I think it really does.

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,840
So, if you would like to find any of the materials, the software, the papers, everything

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,400
is at this website, please feel free to get in touch with me afterwards if you have questions

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,000
or ideas or anything else. So I want to start off with this idea that all of us made this amazing

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,200
journey from quote unquote, just physics to cognition. We were all at one point

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,040
an unfertilized oocyte, so a little blob of chemistry and physics, and through this amazing

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,800
process of embryonic development, we became one of these complex body structures, or in fact,

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,360
maybe a complex metacognitive human being. And so this is really important, because for this

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
reason, I think that developmental biology is maybe one of the most remarkable and magical

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,600
of all sciences, because there you can see right in front of you, right in front of your eyes,

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,120
how physics becomes mind. And it's a slow, gradual process. There's no special lightning flash that

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,200
turns a mechanism into meaning or anything like that. It happens slowly and gradually.

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,920
And so here we are trying to understand the process and the ramifications of that process.

45
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,440
But and often we think, well, okay, so we undergo this journey. But in the end,

46
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,800
we are some sort of a unified single intelligence. We're not like these so-called collective

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
intelligences like ants and termites and bee colonies and so on. But actually, if we think

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,880
about it, we are also an interesting kind of collective intelligence, because for example,

49
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
RenÃ© Descartes really liked the pineal gland, because he said that in the brain, it's the one

50
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,000
structure that isn't duplicated. And so it's fitting that a unified human intelligence,

51
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,200
in some way, lives in that pineal gland. But if he had access to good microscopy,

52
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,680
what he would have found is that actually, there's not one of anything. He would have found that

53
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
that gland is actually full of cells. And if he were to look inside of these cells,

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
he would see something like this. This is what's actually inside of the most cells. And this is,

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,000
of course, is only a partial accounting of what's in there. So in an important sense,

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,800
we are all collective intelligences. And it's very likely that all intelligence is

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,080
collective intelligence, because all intelligence is made of parts of some sort. So this is the

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,960
kind of thing we're made of. Here is a lacrimaria. This is a free living unicellular organism.

59
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,840
What you'll notice here is that there's no brain. There's no nervous system. There are no stem cells.

60
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,840
All of its needs, metabolic, physiological states, anatomical control, all of its needs

61
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,920
are handled at the single cell level, very, very expertly, without the need for a brain or other

62
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,600
cells or anything like that. And so this is the kind of material that we're made of. It is not

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,800
where we don't consist of some sort of passive components. I sometimes give a talk called

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,680
why robots don't get cancer. And the answer is because current technology is largely,

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,480
not exclusively, but largely made at a single scale, where the overall machine might be competent

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,040
and intelligent, but it's usually made of pretty dumb parts that don't have agendas of their own.

67
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,920
But that's not true for us. We are made of an agential material because we are made of components

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,080
with competencies and agendas in various problem spaces. And so that gives rise to a number of

69
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,920
interesting biological phenomena. I'm going to just describe a few that are kind of unique,

70
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,800
and that many people don't often think about, that will set us up for the next part of the talk.

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,120
So for example, here is a soft-bodied creature, which has a brain appropriate to driving a kind

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:01,920
of soft-bodied embodiment, where it likes particular kinds of leaves and so on. And

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,200
this creature, which lives in a two-dimensional world of leaves, has to turn into this creature,

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,000
which is a now hard-bodied kind of system, completely different controller you need for that.

75
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
It lives in a three-dimensional world, doesn't care about leaves anymore, it wants nectar,

76
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,040
and it has a different brain. And there are data showing that during this process of metamorphosis,

77
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,560
which is this remarkable process in which the brain pretty much is dissolved, most of the cells

78
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,280
are killed off, the connections are broken, and then reassembled into a new kind of brain,

79
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,000
and yet memories that the caterpillar forms are retained in the moth or butterfly. And so

80
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
not only is there a very practical question here, which be because we don't have any kind of

81
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
memory medium in our computer technology or anything else that is this robust, where you

82
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,880
can basically take it apart and reshuffle all the components and kill off most of it,

83
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,680
and then you still have the original information. Not only that, but there's really a very

84
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,880
fundamental philosophical question here, and people sometimes ask,

85
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
what's it like to be a bat or a butterfly or something else? But this is one step further.

86
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,760
What's it like to be a caterpillar slowly changing into a butterfly? So this sets us up to start to

87
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,080
think about the intersection between body shape and the shape of our minds and our cognitive

88
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,000
systems, and the idea that we change not only on an evolutionary timescale, but also on an

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,720
individual timescale. This happens, this amazing transformation happens within the lifetime of

90
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,880
this individual. Memories actually can be even more robust. So this is a creature known as a

91
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,680
planarian flatworm, and I'll talk much more about this in a few minutes. But one of the things that

92
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,000
is known is that these guys regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces, each piece makes a

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,840
perfect little worm. And what was shown in the 60s, and this was James McConnell found this,

94
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,560
he got a lot of flak over it, but he was actually right. We confirmed this with modern

95
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,120
techniques about 10 years ago. If you take this planarian and you train them, for example, to

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,080
recognize that this bumpy region in this dish contains food as you feed them on this bumpy

97
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,400
kind of region, you can then amputate the brain, and they have been in fact the whole head,

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,520
the tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight to 10 days, and they slowly regrow a new

99
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,280
head. And then you can find out that the resulting worm actually still remembers the original

100
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,640
information. So it's a place preference assay, and you can show that they still remember.

101
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,360
So kind of a place conditioning paradigm there. And so what you see is that memory,

102
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,400
first of all, is not necessarily just stored inside the brain, but also can be imprinted onto

103
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
a new brain by the rest of the tissue. And so now once again, you have this very fundamental

104
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,160
philosophical experiments, such as the malfunctioning transporter from Phil 101, where

105
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,920
this transporter that makes a copy of you and then erases the original,

106
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,240
but what happens if it fails to erase the original, which one is the real you? Well,

107
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
planaria can do this all the time, right? You can cut them up into pieces, and all of them

108
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,600
have the memories of the original. So now moving to a vertebrate system, that kind of plasticity,

109
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,520
we showed something interesting in tadpoles, which you'll notice. So this is a tadpole of the

110
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,480
frog Xenopus lavas. You'll notice that here's the mouth here, the nostrils, the brain and the gut,

111
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,560
and here's the tail. And so what you'll see is that there are no primary eyes, we prevented

112
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,400
those from forming. But what we did do was cause an eye to form on its tail. And when you do this,

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,960
the eye makes an optic nerve. Well, first of all, the cells are perfectly happy to make an eye,

114
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,400
even though they're sitting next to muscle instead of up here next to the brain where they belong.

115
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,520
But also, they make this one optic nerve, the optic nerve goes and it synapses onto the spinal

116
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,760
cord that does not go all the way to the brain. And then we can show using this machine that we

117
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,320
built that these animals can see. So even though they have a, we can, we can train them in visual

118
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,320
assays. And so even though we've radically changed the sensory motor architecture of this creature,

119
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,640
with no period of evolutionary adaptation to it immediately in the first generation,

120
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,720
the animal can use this novel configuration in its adaptive behavior. So that plasticity,

121
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,760
you know, this ability to adjust to novel, novel architectures and novel circumstances

122
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,760
is really critical and we're going to, we're going to see why. So the, the, the, what, what

123
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,840
underlies all of these amazing abilities is in part something we call the multi-scale competency

124
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,840
architecture. This is the idea that not only are we this kind of nested dolls where molecular

125
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,720
networks and then subcellular components and then tissues and organs and whole bodies and even

126
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,800
swarms of organisms, not only are we a set of nested dolls structurally, but also functionally.

127
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,800
In other words, every, every layer of, of organization has its own competency to solve

128
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,000
problems in different spaces. So it's not all about traditional behavior in three-dimensional

129
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,560
space of movement. There are also transcriptional spaces, physiological spaces, metabolic spaces

130
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,200
and so on. And so the competency of all these different components simultaneously solving

131
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,320
these problems and interacting with both, both laterally and with levels above and below

132
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,680
is what enables the whole body to have this incredible kind of robustness and, and

133
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,800
creative problem solving capacities. And, you know, as humans, we're, we're very good at

134
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,120
detecting intelligence of in three-dimensional space, medium-sized objects moving at medium

135
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,240
speeds on, on our human time scale through three-dimensional space. And so we see primates

136
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,720
and we see crows and, you know, things like that. And, and we can, we can recognize intelligent

137
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,280
behavior. But there are these other spaces that we're really not very good at recognizing. And

138
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,520
it's towards the end of the talk, I'll show you some tools that we've developed to help us think

139
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,680
about this. But I firmly believe that the three-dimensional space that we're used to is not

140
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,480
privileged in some sense, but rather it's, it's a, it's a construction of our, of our

141
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,760
sensory motor architecture. And then if we, for example, had a primary perception of our blood

142
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,720
chemistry, let's say you could, you could feel some number of chemical states in your, in your

143
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,480
blood, the way that we do with vision and sight and smell and taste and so on. I think we would

144
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,280
have no trouble visualizing that we live in a kind of physiological state space, a high-dimensional

145
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,800
physiological state space. And in particular, we would recognize our, our liver, our kidneys,

146
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,560
our various organs as navigating that state space on a daily basis and doing very intelligent things

147
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,320
to get us across various problems and novel scenarios that come up. So what I'd like to do

148
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
today is to talk about one, we could talk about all of these, they're fascinating examples in them

149
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,280
all. But I'd like to spend today talking about morpho space, which is the space of possible

150
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,000
anatomical configurations. It's a kind of a, you know, pick a body structure or in fact the entire

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,920
body. And you can think about the space of all possible variants of that, of that structure

152
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,360
and how they topologically relate to each other. So let's talk about this. In order to talk about

153
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,480
that, and I'm, in particular, I'm going to propose this idea that we can fruitfully think of morphogenesis

154
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,360
of the generation of biological shape as the behavior of a collective intelligence of cells

155
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,720
in anatomical morpho space. In other words, embryonic development, regeneration, cancer

156
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,760
suppression, remodeling, metamorphosis, all of these kinds of things are a kind of behavior

157
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
there are kind of behavior of a collective intelligence that navigates that space in the

158
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,800
way that we typically think neurons are a collective intelligence that help us navigate

159
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,240
three dimensional space. So let's ask, let's ask this question. Here's, here's where we end up in

160
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,600
morpho space as adult humans. Here's a cross section through a normal human body in the torso.

161
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,080
Look at the incredible order of the structures. Everything is in the right place, the right

162
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,080
size, oriented correctly relative to the right thing. Amazing degrees of order.

163
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,840
Where does that order come from? Where is it recorded? And many people at this point would

164
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,160
say, well, it's in the DNA, of course, it's in the genome, but we can read genomes now. And we know

165
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,000
what's in the genome. It's protein sequences. So the tiniest hardware available to every cell,

166
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,480
the genome doesn't have a plan of a large scale anatomy as far as which side is left,

167
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,640
which side is right, how many eyes are you going to have eyes? All of these things have to be

168
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,640
constructed on the fly by cells that use the hardware given to them by the genome to make

169
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:36,240
all kinds of computations. And this structure is no more, quote unquote, in the DNA anymore than

170
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,520
the structure of a termite colony is in the termites DNA, or the shape of a spider's web

171
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,600
is in the spider's DNA. It's all an emergent computational process that requires a lot of

172
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,960
collective intelligence from the pieces. And so as workers in regenerative medicine, we would like

173
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,520
to know if a piece of this is missing, how do we get the cells to rebuild and repair?

174
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,440
For cancer, we might want to know how do they know when to stop building? And as engineers,

175
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,000
we'd like to know what else is possible? With the cells from the exact same genome,

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,160
what else are they willing to build if we knew the right signals? And so these are all the kinds

177
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,560
of questions that we're interested in to understand that navigation through morpheus space.

178
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,440
Now, as we think about what would a finished solution in this field look like? We don't know

179
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,560
what's the end game, when can we all go home? I think it's useful to visualize that, right? What

180
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,640
does it look like when it's solved? And I think what it looks like is something we call an anatomical

181
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:40,960
compiler. The idea here is that someday you'll be able to sit in front of a computer and draw

182
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,960
the plant or animal that you wanted. So you could draw this schematic of a three-headed

183
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,520
flatworm. And so you would draw at the level of anatomy, not at the level of molecular pathways

184
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,880
or anything like that. And if we had such a thing, if we knew what we were doing,

185
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,480
the system would compile our anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given

186
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,480
to specific cells to get them to build whatever we want them to build. Now, this is really important

187
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,920
that this device would not be a 3D printer. The point isn't to micromanage the position

188
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,960
of every cell. The point is to communicate your anatomical goals to the collective intelligence

189
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:25,840
of cells and get them to build. Why is this important besides the basic importance for

190
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,920
developmental biology and evolution and so on? Most problems in biomedicine boil down to

191
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,200
the control of shape. In other words, if we had a way to tell groups of cells what to build,

192
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,160
we would simultaneously be able to solve birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging,

193
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,160
degenerative disease. All of these things would go away if we had some ability to

194
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,880
communicate anatomical goals to cells. Now, one issue is why don't we have such a thing? I mean,

195
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,680
molecular biology and genetics have been around for a long time, amazing progress. Why don't we

196
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,120
have this yet? Well, I'll just give you a very simple example. So this here is a baby axolotl

197
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,840
and baby axolotls have little four legs. This is a tappel of the frogs and a mislevis

198
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,120
at this stage. They do not have any legs. One thing we do in our lab is we make frog

199
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,400
allotls. So these are a combination of some axolotl embryonic cells, frog embryonic cells,

200
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,440
and you get a frog allotl. And so now I pose the question. We have the axolotl genome.

201
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
We have the frog genome. So you have all the genomic information. And so now I ask,

202
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,480
could you tell me if a frog allotl is going to have legs or not? And the thing is that we can't.

203
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,200
We have no idea because while we're pretty good at the molecular machinery, we really do not

204
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,160
understand how collectives of cells make decisions. We don't know if frog allotls will have legs.

205
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
We don't know if they do have legs. There is no theory that will tell you whether those legs

206
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,080
would consist of frog cells or only axolotl cells. These are all completely open questions.

207
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,360
So where we are in biomedicine is this. We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules,

208
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,200
and we make models like this of which proteins and which genes interact with each other.

209
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,800
But what we'd really like to do is to control form and function. And so I'm going to make the

210
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,440
claim that where we are in medicine today is roughly where computer science was in the 40s and 50.

211
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,960
And so you can see what she's doing here. She's programming this computer by

212
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,760
physically rewiring it. Back in those days, you had to interact with the hardware. That was the

213
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,280
only option. And I think today, molecular medicine, so CRISPR, genome editing, protein

214
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,880
engineering, all those kinds of things, all these exciting approaches are all focused on

215
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,480
the hardware. And I think that really transformative biomedicine is going to appear when we add to

216
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:50,240
this the really critical way to understand control and communicate with the software of life or

217
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,760
AKA the collective intelligence of cells and their problem solving abilities.

218
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,640
So when I talk about intelligence, I'll probably mention that many times in this talk, what I

219
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,160
mean is this William James definition, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different

220
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,480
means. Very interesting definition. It doesn't say anything about brains. It doesn't say anything

221
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,600
about whether you were evolved or engineered or some combination thereof or how you got here.

222
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,920
It focuses on this kind of very cybernetic notion of being able to navigate a space towards a goal

223
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,320
and having some degree of competency to do it by different means when your standard way of

224
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,240
going about it is blocked in some way or perturbed. So what kind of collective intelligence do

225
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,000
these cellular swarms deploy? What can they do? Well, let's see. We know that developmental

226
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,760
self-assembly is very reliable. So most of the time, this single cell will give rise to this

227
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,520
amazing three-dimensional anatomy, this target morphology. But we know that it's not hardwired

228
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,440
because if you cut these, for example, in half, you don't get two half bodies. You get two perfectly

229
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,200
normal monozygotic twins. And so there's this and there are many other these types of perturbations

230
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,040
that the idea is that in the system from different starting positions, and so this is a very vastly

231
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,880
simplified morpho space down to two axes, you can get from different starting positions, you

232
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,240
still manage to get to the same ensemble of goal states corresponding to normal human variations.

233
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,040
And in fact, in various ways in development, you can go around local optima such as this local

234
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,520
minimum and so on, and still get to where you need to go despite starting off from different

235
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,840
positions. So that's interesting. It has some degree of flexibility of its surroundings.

236
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,120
And this isn't just for embryos. For example, this, this is that ax law that I mentioned.

237
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,640
These guys regenerate their limbs, their jaws, their eyes, their spinal cords, portions of the

238
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,920
heart and brain. And what you'll see here is that if they lose some part of this limb, and it can

239
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,120
be down here, it could be here, it could be up here anywhere, what they will do is they will rapidly

240
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,080
regrow and remake the limb, and then they stop. And that's perhaps the most amazing thing about

241
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,720
regeneration that it knows when to stop. When does it stop? It stops when a correct salamander

242
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,560
limb has been completed. So what you have here is a kind of error minimization scheme,

243
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,920
where, where the system will attempt, despite these kind of injuries and deviations, will attempt

244
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,640
to keep to this target pathology. So this idea of anatomical homeostasis, the ability to take action

245
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
repeatedly to make up for perturbations that push you out of the correct region of morphos

246
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,200
based down to this region, they can work their way back. So, of course, salamanders and worms

247
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,760
aren't the, aren't the only ones that can do this. The human liver is actually highly regenerative,

248
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,960
even the ancient Greeks knew that, I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.

249
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,000
Every year, year, which are a large adult mammal, they regenerate their, their antlers, so that

250
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,080
means bone, innervation, skin up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth every day. So,

251
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,880
so kind of remarkable regenerative ability as an adult mammal, and even human children can

252
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,440
regenerate their fingertips. So below a certain age, a clean amputation will regrow with, you

253
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,560
know, cosmetically very, very reasonable results. So one final example, this is something that we

254
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,760
discovered a few years ago, which is, which is this, tadpoles, of course, need to become frogs,

255
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,680
and in order for a tadpole face to become a frog face, things have to move. So the jaws have to

256
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,600
come out, the eyes have to move forward, the nostrils move, everything moves. And it used to

257
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,160
be thought it was assumed that this is some kind of hardwired process. After all, every tadpole looks

258
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,560
the same, every frog looks the same. And so if you just, if every piece of the head just remembers

259
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,240
which direction and how far to go, then you go from a normal tadpole to a normal frog. So that

260
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
was the assumption. So we decided to test that assumption, and this is really important, because

261
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,160
as we talk about this field of basal cognition, diverse intelligence, looking at these kind of

262
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,080
protocognitive capacities and unfamiliar embodiments, it's very important that we cannot simply make

263
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,880
armchair pronouncements about what we think, which systems we think have what degree of intelligence

264
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,080
we have to do experiments, because it is often not obvious. So what we did in this particular case

265
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,440
is we made what's called Picasso tadpoles, and Picasso tadpoles have everything scrambled. So

266
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,160
the eyes on the top of the head, the jaws are off to the side, everything is moved around.

267
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,320
And what we found is that these tadpoles make largely perfectly normal frogs,

268
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,840
because everything moves around from novel position. Sometimes it actually goes too far and has to

269
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,840
come back a little bit. It makes these movements, and then it settles into a correct frog face.

270
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,840
So in fact, it has more intelligence than you would initially assume, because it has the

271
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,960
ability to overcome a novel problem of being located in the wrong place that typical embryos

272
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,960
don't have to deal with. So the genetics doesn't specify a hardware, the hardwired rearrangements,

273
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,080
it specifies a system that executes an error minimization, a way to keep acting until you

274
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,640
get to the correct state. So that raises an obvious question, how does it know what the

275
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,480
correct target morphology is? And so this is the standard story of developmental biology told in

276
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
the textbook, which is that you have gene regulatory networks. Some of these genes make

277
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,960
effector proteins that do things, they're sticky, or they diffuse, or they signal us somehow.

278
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,520
And then there's this process of emergence where lots of this happens in parallel, and voila,

279
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,600
at the end you get some sort of complex outcome. And this is true, of course, there is this process

280
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,040
of emergence of complex form from simple rules. But this isn't the whole story, there's a really

281
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,960
important aspect of this, which we study by putting these feedback loops on here, which is that

282
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,720
when you deviate the system from its correct target morphology, and that could be large-scale

283
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,160
injury, it could be aging, it could be teratogens, or various other mutations. What happens is there

284
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,480
are loops that kick in, both in terms of physics and genetics, we're going to talk about the physics

285
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,200
one, that try to get the system back to where it was. Okay, so this is the anatomical homeostasis

286
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:11,360
part. So now, if this is true, well, this has a couple of components that you may think, well,

287
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,040
these are just feedback loops, biologists know all about feedback loops, so there's feedback

288
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,360
everywhere. And this is true, but the typical way of thinking about this, first of all, is

289
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,200
it's something like, for example, a temperature control loop, or a hunger loop, or a pH regulation,

290
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,320
is the set point is a scalar, it's a single number. This isn't the case, here you need a set point that

291
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,360
in some, to some level of detail, tells you what the correct shape is going to be. And

292
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,720
so that's unusual. And the other thing is that, typically in these kind of developmental molecular

293
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,880
biology approaches, when people don't like to think of any kind of a final goal towards which

294
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,440
the system is moving, it's supposed to be sort of this feed forward open loop kind of thing,

295
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,600
where whatever happens happens, but there isn't a goal towards which it's going. And I think

296
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,920
that's fundamentally incorrect, it leaves a lot of useful things on the table to think about it

297
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,840
that way. So what we wanted to do was to follow the predictions of this kind of way of thinking

298
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,120
about it, and it makes some very strong predictions. What it says is, if this is true, then there's

299
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,720
going to be a target morphology encoded somewhere, it's going to have a physical encoding somewhere,

300
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,160
the way that you can find the encoding in your thermostat for where the set point is recorded,

301
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,960
which is going to be an encoding that. And what we'd be able to do is learn to read it,

302
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,920
to decode it, and thus to rewrite it. Because if we can do that, what that means is that you

303
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,680
can change what happens out here by changing the set point, not just by controlling the genes and

304
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,800
then hoping that this process gets you what you want. Because working this backwards to ask,

305
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,760
which genes do I edit to make specific changes here is incredibly difficult. It's a very hard

306
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,680
inverse problem. It's what's going to limit applications of CRISPR and things like that.

307
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,320
It's very hard. So it would be much nicer if much like with your thermostat, you could change the

308
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,000
set point and let the cells do what they do best, which is rebuilt without you having to

309
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,080
micromanage from the lowest level. So those are the predictions and this is what we've been working

310
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,880
on for some years now. So I'm going to show you this. In order to start to think about how a

311
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,240
collection of cells could store some sort of goal that it's going to move towards, we use the nervous

312
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,960
system as a source of inspiration. Because it's very clear that there you have a great example

313
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,920
of a system that can store goals and memories and work towards them. So how does it work? Well,

314
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,400
the hardware looks like this. It's a network of cells, each of which has little ion channels

315
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,880
that allow the cell to generate a voltage potential by segregating positive and negative charges.

316
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,640
And those voltage potentials may or may not get propagated to neighboring cells via these

317
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,320
regulated electrical synapses known as gap junctions. And so that's how the hardware looks.

318
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,840
What that allows the networks to have is this very active electrical

319
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,240
set of electrical processes. And here you can see here, this is a zebrafish being this group

320
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,040
made an amazing video of this zebrafish while recording all the electrical activity as this

321
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,840
animal is thinking about whatever it is that zebrafish think about. And the commitment of

322
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,200
neuroscience is that you should be able to do something they call neural decoding, which is

323
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,560
that if we were to able to get all these data, and if we understood how to decode them through

324
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,040
these computer models, what we would be able to do is read out the contents of the animal's mind.

325
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,280
What is it thinking about? What are the memories, the preferences, the behavioral repertoires?

326
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,760
So the idea of neural decoding is that the information is literally encoded in the physiology.

327
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,560
All of the kind of cognitive aspects of this animal are encoded in these electrical signals.

328
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Well, it turns out the amazing thing, it turns out that that kind of trick is ancient.

329
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,280
It is not just something that is used for brains because

330
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,280
every cell in your body has ion channels. Most cells have gap junctions to their neighbors.

331
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,280
And it turns out that evolution figured out the benefits of this kind of architecture

332
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,040
oh, back around the time of bacterial biofilms long before nerve and muscle came along.

333
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,120
And so it turns out that these tricks that the nervous system uses are really based on

334
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,080
some of these very ancient ways to process information in electrical networks.

335
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,320
And so we thought, wouldn't it be remarkable if we took a lot of concepts from neuroscience

336
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,360
and behavioral science? And this is what it means to consider morphogenesis and intelligence.

337
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,960
It's not just a metaphor of speaking. It's something that actually says take seriously

338
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,840
the isomorphism between these fields and take techniques from a completely different area

339
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,240
that have never been applied to developmental biology and apply them to a different medium

340
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,960
in a different problem space and see what these tools give you. And I think they give you a lot.

341
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,360
And so that's how you cash out these claims like that. And so what we decided to do was to say,

342
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,880
okay, could we use the same kind of tools to read all the electrical conversations that

343
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,400
body cells are having with each other? And from that extract or decode,

344
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,120
what are the anatomies that they're trying to build? What are their competencies and so on?

345
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,400
And so we made the first tools to read and write the electrical information in cells outside of the

346
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,080
nervous system. And so I'm going to show you these tools. I'm going to show you what we can do with

347
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:30,240
them. So this is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye. And this allows us to noninvasively, over

348
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,880
time lapse, see what all the bioelectric patterns are. And then we can do a lot of

349
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,720
quantitative computer simulations to relate that to the different channels and pumps that are

350
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
expressed and really gain an understanding of what the physiological dynamics here.

351
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,680
So here's an example of what you see when you do this. This is a video of a frog embryo putting

352
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,360
its face together. It's grayscale, but that doesn't matter. You can see it's quite dynamic.

353
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,160
But what you'll see here, we call this the electric face. This is one frame of that movie.

354
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,200
It basically shows you that long before the organs of the face are patterned and long before the

355
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,960
genes come on that control some of these things, already this anterior ectoderm has a map

356
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,080
represented within it, this bioelectrical map of all the organs. So here's where the mouth is going

357
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,760
to go. Here's where the eye is going to go. The placode's out to the side. Here's where everything

358
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,400
is going to be. So this is an endogenous pattern. And I'll show you in a minute. It's actually

359
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:38,320
required for normal face development. It's required for the morphogenesis that actually

360
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
creates the face. If you interfere with this pattern, the gene expression will change and

361
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
the anatomy will change. So that's a normal endogenous pattern. Here's a pathological pattern.

362
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,000
What you can do is you can misexpress a human oncogene and then eventually you'll get a tumor.

363
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,160
But before the tumor becomes apparent, you will already see that there are some

364
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,320
bioelectrical changes where these cells are basically electrically disconnecting from their

365
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,960
neighbors and they're going to go off on their own and that's metastasis. And so there's some

366
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,480
obvious applications here to monitoring birth defects, to cancer diagnosis, and so on. But

367
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,000
more important than the characterization tools are the functional tools. So we don't use any

368
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,400
applied fields. There are no frequencies, no waves, no electromagnetic radiation, no magnets.

369
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,640
What we do is we control the native interface by which cells control each other. That is the

370
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,280
electrical side of electrical controls on their cell surface that they expose to each other.

371
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,160
And the way we can do that is all the techniques of neuroscience. So we can target these electrical

372
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,920
synapses to either open or close them. We can target all the ion channels to change directly,

373
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,560
not just the connectivity, but also the actual voltage states. And you can do this with drugs

374
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,240
and you can do it with ion channel mutants and with optogenetics and various other techniques.

375
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,680
And so we have the ability now to go in and with significant specificity to change which

376
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,280
cell talks to each other's cell and what voltage, in fact, they're communicating to each other,

377
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,640
which corresponds to synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, respectively. So I'm going to show

378
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:19,120
you an example of one of my favorite all-time examples, originally discovered by my very first

379
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,760
student back when I was at Forsythe Institute at the Harvard Dental School.

380
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,960
We had this amazing finding, which is that we decided to start to manipulate some of these

381
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,200
voltages to ask what will happen. These were very early days. No one knew what was going to

382
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,600
happen. In fact, people thought that voltage was a housekeeping parameter. They said, well,

383
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,920
if you mess with the voltage of these cells, they'll die. You'll get an uninterpretable phenotype.

384
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,760
But we decided to try. And so what she did was to interpret, in the first person to see this,

385
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,120
was Ivy Chen. And then several other people in my group worked on this, Shariao and Vipafai,

386
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,560
more recently. And so what she did was to inject RNA encoding a particular potassium channel

387
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,920
into some cells that were going to be something other than I. And what happens is that when you

388
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,880
establish a little spot of voltage that is the same shape and the voltage pattern as that I spot

389
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,680
in the electric face I showed you, you can induce eyes anywhere else. You can get them on the gut,

390
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,960
you can get them on the tail, you can put them anywhere on the animal. And these eyes will often

391
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,160
have all the correct internal layers, so all the retina and optic nerve, all that stuff.

392
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,480
So this tells you four really interesting things. First is that the bioelectric pattern is

393
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,040
instructive. When you change that pattern, it just doesn't just screw up normal development.

394
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,520
It's not permissive. It actually tells the cells build an eye here. That's functionally what it does.

395
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,640
Second is the amazing modularity. We didn't have to tell all the cells where the stem cells go,

396
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,960
how to build a lens, how to build a retina. We didn't have to do any of that. In fact,

397
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,920
we have no idea how to do that. We couldn't possibly give it all the information how to

398
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,040
build a whole complex eye. What we found is a very high-level subroutine call that basically

399
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,840
just says build an eye here. The animal's tissues already know how to build an eye. We found a trigger

400
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,160
for it. So very modular, and that's good for regenerative medicine. Also, what's remarkable

401
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,560
is that if you probe this animal with what was considered to be the PAC-6 master eye gene,

402
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,320
only the anterior norectoderm, which is this tissue up here, is competent to be eye. And so in the

403
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,320
developmental biology textbook, there's a story about ectodermal competency, and they tell you

404
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,320
that only these regions are competent to become eye. And that's true if you probe them with a PAC-6

405
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,840
signal. But if you go upstream and probe this system with a voltage signal, in fact, all of them,

406
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,200
you find out that all of the cells, including gut endoderm, which is really crazy,

407
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,600
are actually competent to make eye. And so the whole issue of how competent are these cells

408
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:58,400
is really predicated on how you pose the question. And this has direct implications for

409
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,960
prompting and AI and other kinds of systems. You have to have the right prompt to really

410
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,760
learn what the system is capable of. Also, something else that's interesting, this is a lens

411
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,560
sitting out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere. And what you'll notice is these blue cells,

412
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,800
this is beta galactosidase, and these blue cells are the ones that we actually injected with the

413
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,600
channel. All the rest of this was never directly injected by us. All these brown cells are native,

414
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,240
unmanipulated cells. But what happened is that something that happens in other collective

415
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,200
intelligence is like ants. When a couple of ants come along, something they want to move,

416
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,640
and it's too big for them, they will recruit their neighbors. And so that's what happens here.

417
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Two levels of instruction. We instructed these cells that, hey, you need to make an eye,

418
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,240
and these cells, on their own, without us having to handle size control or how many cells there are

419
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:59,360
or any of that, these cells come endeared and hijack their neighbors to participate with them

420
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,360
in this project of constructing this lens. Because this system knows how big the thing

421
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,960
is supposed to be, it knows how many of them there are, and it can do what's necessary,

422
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,040
which again, we didn't need to do this at all. This is a native competency,

423
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,480
scaling to the appropriate task, is something tissues already do. So this goes back to my claim

424
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
that for proper regenerative medicine, you really want to be working with all of these

425
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,920
competencies, these morphogenetic navigation tricks that the system has that are completely

426
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,480
not obvious from standard development. And we need to be able to exploit these.

427
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,600
So doing that, you can build many things. You can ask the system to make ectopic four brain.

428
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:43,680
So here's this giant brain-y tappel. You can make extra legs. So here's our six-legged frog.

429
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
You can make extra hearts, extra beating hearts. You can make extra odysses,

430
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,320
which are inner ear organs. Or you can ask it to make fins. Now that's interesting,

431
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,480
tappels aren't supposed to have fins. That's more of a fish thing. We'll get to that in a minute.

432
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:04,480
But of course, now that once we saw that we were able to induce complex structures,

433
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,480
we immediately started on a regenerative kind of medicine model, which is leg regeneration.

434
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,920
And so what we see in frogs, frogs normally don't regenerate their legs. But what we see here

435
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,600
is that if we provide a cocktail with a specific ionophore that changes the voltage

436
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,240
state of that wound cell, what we can do is we can trigger immediately within a couple

437
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,120
of days, you get this MSX1 positive blastema marker, and the leg immediately starts to grow.

438
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,440
By 45 days, you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail, and eventually you've got a very

439
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,560
nice leg that is touch-sensitive and motile. This, by the way, the stimulus here was only

440
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,840
present for 24 hours. And if you stimulate for 24 hours in our most recent paper,

441
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,920
you get a year and a half of leg growth. And the whole point is that we aren't there

442
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,960
3D printing anything. We're not there with scaffolds or control of gene expression or

443
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,440
stem cells. We're not trying to tell the frog how to build the leg. We provide a very simple

444
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,440
signal right at the beginning, which says go towards the leg-building region of morphospace,

445
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,600
not towards the scarring region. And that's it. After that, we don't touch it again. So again,

446
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,680
relying, pushing all the complexity onto the system itself. We are now attempting to do this

447
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,240
in mammals, in rodents. And I have to do a disclosure here, because David Kaplan and I are

448
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,040
scientific co-founders of a company called Morphosuticals, Inc., which tries to apply

449
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,720
this technology to get limb regeneration in mammals, and hopefully someday into the clinic.

450
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,280
Okay, I want to change gears and talk about a different organism. We're back to planaria here.

451
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,560
Remember that these guys can regenerate. Every part of their body, they're amazing in particular.

452
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,320
They also solve the aging problem. They're immortal. As far as we know, there's no such

453
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:57,120
thing as an old planarian. They regenerate everything as it is. And you've got this amazing

454
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,560
capacity. And so we wanted to answer a question, how does each piece know how many heads of tails

455
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,680
it's supposed to have? It's kind of a funny question, but if you're a piece like this,

456
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,080
you have to know how many heads. And it's not obvious from where you were located, because

457
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:17,280
if you take a planaria and cut it in half, this region has to make a tail. This region

458
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,480
has to make a head. They were direct neighbors. They were in the same location in the animal,

459
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,640
but they have radically different anatomical outcomes. So it's not a trivial problem. You

460
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,440
can't just tell what you're going to be based on where you were in the original. It doesn't work.

461
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,520
So how do they know? So what we discovered was a bioelectric circuit, and I'll skip all the details,

462
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,720
that literally controls this process and stores the information about how many heads you're

463
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,120
supposed to have. So the way it works is the single-headed planarium. And you can see the

464
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,240
anterior is where the head markers are expressed, of course. And so when you cut them like this,

465
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,320
very reliably, you get a one-headed form. But what you can also do is cut these guys, again,

466
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,600
one-headed animal, anterior gene expression in the right place in the head, not in the tail.

467
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,440
And so you cut them and you get a two-headed worm. And why would this be a two-headed...

468
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,080
And this is in Photoshop. These are real animals. And why would you get a two-headed worm? I just

469
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,760
told you that this is very reliable. The reason is that we were able to find this bioelectrical

470
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,240
pre-pattern that looks like this. And the decoding is kind of simple. I'm showing you this because

471
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,600
much like with the electric face, this is the simple one. There are other patterns that are

472
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,880
very hard. We're still trying to crack. But what you can see is one head, one tail. And what we

473
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,800
were able to do is use drugs to affect ion channels to change this pattern

474
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,760
into two heads. And it's kind of messy, but it's okay. It works. Two heads. And so

475
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,400
what you see here is that this two-headed... This two-headed pattern gives rise to two-headed

476
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,360
animals. But here's the amazing part. This is not a readout of this animal. This is a map of this

477
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,000
animal. And this normally... This anatomically and transcriptionally normal animal has a

478
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,600
different representation of what a correct planarian looks like. And if you injure him,

479
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,840
and not until then, so it's a latent memory, if you injure him, then the cells will go ahead

480
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,600
and they build what the pattern says. And then they will go ahead and they build two heads. But

481
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:20,320
until that happens, it's a perfectly normal one-headed body. So several interesting things

482
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,720
here. One of which is that this bioelectric... Again, of course, the bioelectric pattern is

483
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,480
instructive. It tells you what kind of structures you're going to have. Second, remember that at

484
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:38,080
the very beginning, I sort of promised that we were going to find a read and decode and

485
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:44,880
re-specify the pattern memories that allow a particular set of tissues to know what to build

486
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,600
and when to stop. This is it. You're looking at it. The question of how does the planarian

487
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,080
piece know what to make, this is the answer. It's because this pattern contains the information

488
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,800
that's needed to specify one aspect of its morphogenetic future. And the other thing is that

489
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,440
this is perhaps... The interesting thing is that, again, this electrical pattern is not a map of

490
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,160
this animal. It's a map of this animal. So in an important sense, it's a counterfactual memory.

491
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,920
It's a memory of what... It's a representation of what I will do in the future if I happen to be

492
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,360
injured. So maybe this is an evolutionary precursor of that amazing mental time travel

493
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,920
that the brains allow us to do, which is to imagine or remember things that are not true

494
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,280
right now, things that happened in the past or things that are going to happen in the future.

495
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,640
This is the... Perhaps this is the ancient somatic equivalent of that process. So a single

496
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,000
planarian body can store at least one of two different memories of what a correct planarian

497
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,800
should look like. So it's reprogrammable in an important sense, just like learning in the brain

498
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,640
and just like our computer technology, the same hardware can store different types of information.

499
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,960
And why do I keep calling it a memory? Because if we take these two-headed animals and we cut off

500
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,560
the primary head and we cut off this secondary head with no more manipulation, you might think

501
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,600
that, well, the genetics are untouched. You didn't edit the genome. There's nothing wrong with the

502
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:13,840
genetics. So if you get rid of this crazy secondary head, maybe the cells will just rebuild the normal

503
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,640
planarian. But that's not at all what they do. If you cut them again, they will continue to make

504
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,640
two heads in perpetuity. And this has all the properties of memory. It's long-term stable.

505
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,640
It's rewritable because we can shift back and forth. We know how to make two heads from one and we

506
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,960
can actually take these two-headed guys and put them back to being one-headed. It has conditional

507
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,600
recall, meaning it can store the memory until it actually gets injured. And it has two discrete

508
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,160
possible behaviors. And here you can see this video. You can see what these two-headed animals

509
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,840
are like. And the first two-headed planaria were reported in the early 1900s.

510
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:00,240
But it wasn't until 2008 that my student Larissa Bosniak first, I had asked her to

511
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,200
recut these things. Nobody ever recut them, to my knowledge, because it was assumed that

512
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,560
once you get rid of that extra structure, the genetics are normal. Of course, it should go

513
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:16,400
back to normal, which it was assumed. So it's really critical to think in broader directions

514
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:24,720
that uncover these novel capabilities of tissues. And what we're doing now is all kinds of

515
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,400
computational modeling to try to merge what we know about the bioelectric state of the circuit

516
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,240
here, where it has these attractors, one head, two head, and so on, with what connectionist

517
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,000
machine learning is telling us about ways in which network can store information and can

518
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,680
recover the entire information from partial or damaged pieces. And so I think there's a great

519
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,840
unification to be done here. And this paper talks about that. But it is not just about

520
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:02,000
head number. It's also about head shape. So the amazing thing is that if I take this triangular

521
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,400
shape planarian, cut off his head, perturb the electrical pattern in a particular way,

522
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,200
let them then take the reagent away, let them settle down. Sometimes they settle back to a nice

523
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,080
triangular shape like they should, or they sometimes give you a round head like this S.

524
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:24,560
Mediterranean or a flathead like this Pifolina. And so these animals are about 150 to 100 million

525
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:30,640
years in evolutionary distance. And not only does the head shape change, but all the internal

526
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,120
components, the stem cells, the shape of the brain become just like these other species.

527
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,880
So you can ask this hardware to visit attractors in that morpho space that typically belong to

528
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,080
other species, these species go there by default. But this species can be pushed to navigate space

529
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,200
in that way, if the navigation policies which are encoded by the bioelectrics are changed

530
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,800
in the right way. So the hardware is perfectly willing to visit these other

531
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:03,840
these other attractors. In fact, you can go and visit shapes that don't look like plenary at all.

532
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,240
So you can make this crazy spiky form, you can make the cylindrical things, you can make the

533
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:15,760
sort of hybrids. It's what Darcy Thompson was talking about in his classic, where he showed

534
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,120
these kind of deformations, that nowadays you would call it a kind of a latent morpho space

535
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,640
of possible shapes and have real real animals be the result of deformations of a coordinate

536
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,040
grid. And there are all these other possibilities besides the standard default that we see all the

537
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,920
time. So, of course, what we're what we're trying to do is put together a full stack

538
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,120
computational model that goes from the molecular biology of which channels and pumps are expressed

539
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:47,440
to the tissue level electrophysiology and all the voltage patterns to the organ level

540
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,080
stable patterns that eventually can be interpreted by humans and by AI as an algorithm

541
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,760
about what every piece is going to build. And here's where you want to do your interventions.

542
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,400
It's very hard to do them down here, not methodologically, of course, but conceptually

543
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,560
it's hard to know what to do. But up here, it starts to get very obvious. And so we're trying to

544
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,960
forge that, forge that thing, because we have we have simulators of bioelectrics and so on.

545
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,080
So the last story, I want to tell you about kind of this this this part of the talk has to do with

546
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,760
how this is going to play out on regenerative medicine. So here's a here's an example.

547
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,360
This is a typical tadpole brain, and you can see very nice forebrain midbrain and hindbrain

548
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:33,040
left and right halves. And there are a variety of of defects you can induce with the teratogens

549
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,680
such as nicotine and alcohol and mutations and so on that really wreck this the structure.

550
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,840
So here, the forebrain is basically gone, the the eyes are connected directly to the to the

551
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,360
midbrain real really problematic. And so, so we wanted to develop a proof of concept of using

552
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,400
what we've learned about the bioelectrics here, to, to repair this to find interventions that

553
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,880
repair these very complex birth defects, we don't have a hope of talking to each individual cell

554
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,200
and controlling where all the stem cells go and what the pattern is. And I don't think in our

555
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,920
lifetime, that's that's going to happen. But we thought, could we, could we find high level

556
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,200
controls that let us leverage the competencies of these of the system. So what we did was, was,

557
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,440
and this is the work of Alexis Pytak with Viapof Pi in the lab. And so what they did was create

558
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,160
she made a computer model of what the bioelectric pattern normally should be and how it gets altered

559
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,280
by these various treatments. And then Pi was able to do the biology and do the following

560
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,200
thing to ask the model, if the pattern is incorrect, what channels would I need to open

561
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,760
or close to make the bioelectric pattern? Correct. Not going to worry about what happens downstream,

562
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,280
not going to worry about whatever the gene expressions are that are induced by this,

563
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,560
but how do I fix the bioelectric pattern? So what I'm showing you here is perhaps the most

564
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,120
kind of the most amazing example, which is never mind the chemical

565
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,160
teratogens. Let's let's look at a mutation. So this is a mutation in a gene called notch

566
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,320
introduced into it's a dominant active mutation introduced into these animals.

567
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,960
Their brains are completely wrecked as a result of this. It's a very important neurogenesis gene.

568
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,400
Forebrain is gone, midbrain and hindbrain are a bubble. These animals lay there,

569
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,680
no behavior, you know, which is just profound, profoundly defective. And so the model said

570
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,600
something very interesting. It said there's this, there's this HCN2 channel, which kind of has this

571
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,760
special property. And what it will do is it's predicted to sharpen gradient. So it's like a,

572
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,880
like a sharpen filter in Photoshop. It basically, it basically makes makes very sharp

573
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,640
bioelectrical boundaries between compartments that are not differing by enough voltage.

574
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,560
And so what we did was find out that whether by expressing more of this channel or by drugs,

575
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,240
in fact, to already approved human antiepileptics that opened up this channel, the model predicted

576
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,680
that that would fix it. And it was kind of an amazing, a shocking prediction. We tried it.

577
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:58,320
And sure enough, incredibly, incredibly enough, even though this animal has the mutation,

578
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,080
the brain is normal, the gene expression is normal, and their learning rates are

579
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,720
indistinguishable from controls. And so I'm not claiming that all genetic defects are going to

580
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,000
be fixable this way. There will be many things like missing enzymes and things like that that

581
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,920
are not going to be fixable this way. But at least some hard hardware defects, I mean, this is an

582
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,920
actual mutation in a signaling pathway, some hardware defects can be repaired in software by

583
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,080
transient stimulation of a drug that was chosen by a computer model. So we've gone from the very

584
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,120
initial early work in, let's say around 2000, where we were just probing the space of possibilities,

585
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,720
you know, what does the, what did the bioelectrics control down to now to the point where we are

586
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,240
in already in 2018, we're able to use a computer model to pick a drug for a very complex vertebrate

587
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:56,160
birth defect and repair it. And so the way that the therapeutics is going to look is basically

588
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,520
like this. And there's already, you can sort of play around with an early version of it here.

589
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,800
You'll pick some tissues that you're interested in. And what we need is to know the correct

590
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,800
bioelectric state of that organ or tissue, and then you'll know what the incorrect state is.

591
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,000
And then there's going to be a computational platform that's going to

592
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,480
electraceutical design environment that stands for it. And what it's going to do is help you

593
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,680
choose correct channels that will need to be open or closed to correct the pattern.

594
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,600
And from there, it's very simple to find drugs that will target that channel. And so

595
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:38,560
that's how this is going to work. And so kind of the last thing I want to say about this

596
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,600
part of the talk is that if we think about the whole space of biomedical interventions,

597
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:53,600
the vast majority of efforts today go under this bottom up category. So the hardware repairs,

598
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,760
surgery, transplants, stem cell implants, genomic editing, rewiring gene regulatory networks,

599
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,640
and so on. All of these things are focused on the hardware. And we all know some of the deficiencies

600
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,360
and limitations. So we have very few things, very few treatments that actually fix anything.

601
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,960
Many things, once you stop taking the drug, everything goes right back or actually gets

602
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,280
worse because it was targeted at the symptoms. It wasn't actually fixing the fundamental issue.

603
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,880
And of course, we have great variability across patients. We have lots of side effects.

604
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,320
And this is to be expected when trying to control a complex system bottom up.

605
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,400
But there are complementary techniques that we can use having to do with, first of all,

606
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,720
I don't have time to talk about any of this, but there's lots of interesting applications in

607
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,520
actually training cells and tissues and in fact, molecular networks. So using stimuli,

608
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,880
rewards and punishments and so on to make long term lasting changes by exploiting the memory

609
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,360
capacity of all of these levels. And of course, what we've been talking about now, which is the

610
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,960
whole field of morphosuiticals, which has within it ways to target the decision making machinery,

611
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,040
the morphogenetic machinery that uses mechanical, chemical, and of course, electrical modalities.

612
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,680
And so this is all the electrosuiticals are done here with ion channeled drugs and optogenetics

613
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:23,440
and so on. And lots more is discussed here. And I think just to speculate a little bit,

614
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,120
I think that future medicine is going to look a lot less like chemistry and a lot more like

615
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:35,920
a kind of somatic psychiatry, where you're going to take very seriously the memories, the preferences,

616
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:42,400
the competencies of the body cells, tissues, and organs and try to leverage those competencies by

617
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,840
not trying to micromanage their behavior, but trying to give them signals. And so bio electricity

618
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,760
is a really critical interface that normally mediates between high level cognitive information

619
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,960
down to molecular properties. And if that sounds weird to you, just think about how you get up

620
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,720
out of bed in the morning when you when you wake up and you decide that you need to go to bed,

621
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,560
that you need to get out of bed rather and go to work. What's happening here is that your high

622
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,760
level cognitive intent that that knows what work is and all the consequences of doing it or not

623
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,000
doing it, all of that has to has to filter down to the molecular events at your at your muscle

624
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,440
cells to enable you to get up out of bed. So your cognitive intent of wanting to do something

625
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,960
changes the way that molecules interact in your muscles. And so all of that, that that

626
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,440
transduction from cognition to molecular biology is done by by electrics, all of that is electrical.

627
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,320
And I think we can hack this for the rest of the body for some really transformative health

628
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,600
applications. So the last thing I want to do just for a couple of minutes is to broaden out a little

629
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:56,560
bit into into two other quick, quick mentions. One is this idea of let's just talk about cancer

630
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:02,800
for a second. So, so this is what this is what we're made of and what evolution individual cells.

631
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:09,600
And so what evolution has has given us is some hardware that allows cells which normally work

632
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,800
on little tiny goals. So so so little tiny metabolic and proliferative goals of single cells

633
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,680
to a very grandiose large scale morphogenetic goals, like we're going to work together to build

634
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,680
this limb. And if that's inhibited, temporarily, then we're going to do it again and then build

635
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,600
it again. So these are very high level goals that these cells are going after. But that process

636
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,240
can break down. And when that process breaks down, this is what we call cancer. So these are human

637
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:41,040
glioblastoma cells. And what happens is that if you dissociate cells electrically from each other,

638
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,520
they will basically revert back to their unicellular past, they will act like amoebas. And at that

639
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,240
point, the rest of the animals just the rest of the body is just external environment to them.

640
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,520
So they're not any more selfish than somatic cells, it's just that their cells are smaller. So the

641
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,160
boundary between self and world here, the boundaries out here, it's huge to say, you know, this this

642
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,920
whole thing acts as a unit to achieve a particular morphogenetic trajectory. But but once you disconnect

643
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,440
the cells, they don't do that anymore. Now now all the all they all they have is little tiny goals

644
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,640
that stop at the roughly at the cell surface. So so one. So now that's kind of a weird way of

645
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,360
thinking about things. But as always, it has practical consequences, which is that, if you

646
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:29,360
think this way, then then you might take take this hypothesis that if we put human oncogenes into

647
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,680
this tadpole, we know it's going to make a tumor. But what we'll do, we're not going to kill those

648
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,480
cells with chemotherapy. And we're not going to try to fix the mutation. What we're going to do is

649
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,800
simply force them to remain bio electrically connected to their neighbors, even though

650
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,160
they have the mutation. And so we've done this now with with with glee and with with nasty

651
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,440
k-rass mutations. Here it's the the oncogene is marked in red. You can see that there's this tumor

652
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,800
here. There's this very, very strong low expression of this oncogene. In fact, it's all over the place

653
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,040
in the body, but there is no tumor here. This is the same animal. Because even though the oncogene is

654
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,600
blazingly strongly expressed, if the cells are electrically connected to the rest of them, what

655
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,760
they do is participate in normal organogenesis, not not crawl around and metastasize. So this is

656
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,400
this is a way of taking some of these ideas about the the shifting boundary between self and world

657
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,280
and put it into a practical application. And of course, we're pursuing this now in

658
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,720
in in human glioblastoma and some other things. Okay, the very last I'm just going to take

659
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,280
about four or five minutes here just to give you a kind of a last piece. And I have to do

660
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,240
another disclosure here of fauna systems is a company that Josh Bond guard and I have started

661
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:50,480
around computer designed by robotics. And the idea was this. I've tried to I've tried to make the

662
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,960
point that morphogenesis is a navigation of anatomical space by a kind of system that

663
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,280
remembers where it's going and has certain navigation policies and it has certain capabilities

664
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,680
of getting there despite some number of things that can happen to it. But if we if we ask the

665
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,880
question in a in a typical animal, where where do those memories come from? In other words,

666
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,640
what determines the the shape of that space? And the and fundamentally the anatomy of the

667
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,280
and the and the the behavior of that animal? Typically, the answer is, well, evolution. So

668
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,280
so years of selection have shaped that space. And now and now this is the you know, this is

669
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,520
the morphology that that survives in the real world. And so what we wanted to ask this question

670
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,960
about plasticity, we said, if if we take these cells with a standard genome, and give them a

671
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,320
chance to reboot their multicellularity, what will they build? Like, what is the what is the

672
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:52,240
structure of the of the morpho space for creatures that have never existed before? And so this is

673
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,400
where synthetic biology or better yet, synthetic morphology comes in, because we can make some

674
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,720
creatures that have never been here on earth in that in that particular embodiment. And we can

675
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:07,440
ask what do their shapes look like? So here's a here's an example. What happens is we take a frog

676
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,440
embryo. And this is all the biology here is work at the work of Doug Blackiston. And this is a

677
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,120
collaboration with Josh Bongard's lab. And Sam Creedman was a student who did a lot of the

678
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,400
computational work. What happens is we can we can take off some of the dermal skin cells from

679
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,480
the embryo, and we we dissociate them and we put them aside in this in this set set them aside.

680
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,120
And they can do many things they could they could die, they could spread out and leave, you know,

681
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:37,520
go away from each other, they could form a two dimensional flat monolayer like a cell culture.

682
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,880
What they do instead is they actually they get together and this is time lapse they get together

683
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,080
and they make something very interesting, which looks like this. And the flashing is calcium

684
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:54,880
signaling. So what they make is something we call a xenobot. Why xenobot is why xenobot xenopus

685
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,680
lavis is the name of the frog. I think it's a biorebotics platform. So that's why it's a it's a

686
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:07,200
xenobot. First of all, they swim, and they use little hairs on their cell surface on their

687
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,920
outer surface called cilia. These are normally used by the frog to move mucus down the body

688
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,800
down its body to keep the pathogens away. But they're using it to swim they can go in circles,

689
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,120
they can sort of patrol back and forth like this, they can have all kinds of interesting

690
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:25,920
collective and group behaviors that you can see some tracking data here. They change their

691
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,440
movements as a function of time, they sort of wander around doing various things. Here's one

692
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,480
doing a maze. So you can see here it swims forward, it's going to take this corner without bumping

693
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,400
into the opposite wall. So it doesn't just go straight until it hits something, it can take

694
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,480
that corner. And here it shows some some kind of primitive initiative and spontaneously turning

695
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,360
around and going back where it came from. So these are not these are not stimulated, these are not

696
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:57,600
actuated by us in any way unlike some of the current biorebotics that exist that completely

697
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:04,240
completely spontaneous. They have if we if we track the calcium signaling like we did in that

698
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:10,880
zebrafish like that other lab did in that zebrafish that I showed you earlier, you can see that

699
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,400
they're very active, there's no neurons in here. But the it's just skin but the skin cells are

700
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,480
very active and we are now applying all sorts of information theory tools to ask if we can

701
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,720
decode what the cells are saying to each other, what two xenobots might be saying to each other

702
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:34,480
and so on. They regenerate so if you cut it almost in half, it'll seal up like this. So from here

703
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:43,520
they will seal themselves and perhaps the most amazing thing we discovered by the simulations

704
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:51,360
that Sam and Josh did was that in their movements they tend to they tend to have a very peculiar

705
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,480
effect on on their environment and so so you know they built this amazing simulator where we could

706
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,440
Doug could actually build various types of xenobots corresponding to shapes that that the

707
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:08,480
that the AI was suggesting. And what we found is this if you give them loose skin cells in their

708
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,600
environment what they do is they implement von Neumann's dream which is a robot that would go

709
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:20,320
out and build copies of itself from materials that found in the environment because we've

710
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:25,040
made it impossible for these guys to reproduce themselves. They're just skin, they don't have

711
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,600
all the other organs you need for frog style reproduction but within a couple of days they

712
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,200
figure out a new way to make copies of themselves and so what they do is they by their movements

713
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,240
they collect these skin cells into a little ball and they sort of polish and compact the ball

714
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,600
and because they're working with a in a gentle material like us we we were only able to make

715
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,000
xenobots because we were working with with skin cells that have certain competencies

716
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,080
they have the same advantage and so because it's an agential material they make the next

717
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:59,440
generation of bots and when these xenobots mature guess what they do they run around and they

718
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,840
do exactly the same thing and that gives you the next generation of bots and the next generation.

719
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:09,520
So this is kinematic self-replication to our knowledge doesn't no other organism on earth does

720
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,840
this brand new brand new kind of thing and so and so this brings us kind of to almost the end

721
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:22,720
of the story where one thing you can ask is what did the frog genome learn through all all these

722
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,040
you know so eons of evolution well it's certainly learned to make a frog and it learned this

723
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,240
developmental sequence that leads through this stereotypical stages and then some tadpoles with

724
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,520
behavior that's not the only thing it makes it can also make xenobots with a completely

725
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,080
different developmental sequence this is this is a couple month old xenobot and no idea what

726
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,600
this thing's trying to become and they have different behaviors including kinematic self

727
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:51,600
replication that that has never existed before so we don't know by the way what their behavioral

728
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,400
repertoires are like do they can they learn what do they have preferences all of that is currently

729
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,000
under active investigation but at least in the case of the morphology we can say a few things we

730
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:08,640
can say that there have never been any xenobots there's never been selection to be a good xenobot

731
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:14,320
so this whole lifestyle and capabilities and everything else cannot be straightforward you

732
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,280
you can't tell a straightforward selectionist story about it where does it come from that's

733
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:26,720
an interesting thing we can we can discuss and what it looks to me like from this and many other

734
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,600
experiments is that evolution doesn't give you just solutions to specific problems what evolution

735
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:38,400
makes it's problem solving machines and under default environments they always produce the

736
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,920
same outcome and it's sort of the development sort of lulls us into a false sense of we understand

737
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,160
what the system can do and evolution gives us an easy way to to sort of to explain why we see what

738
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,280
we see but there's actually a lot more plasticity and capability that doesn't appear until you probe

739
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,320
the intelligence of the system by putting it in a new environment where it has to do new things

740
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,360
and in particular we didn't engineer this by changing the genome we didn't put in any new

741
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,760
circuits the DNA is exactly the same we didn't put any weird nanomaterials the only thing we did

742
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,320
is liberate these cells from the rest of the embryo that normally basically

743
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,480
force them into having a kind of boring two-dimensional life on the outside of the organism

744
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,120
keeping out the bacteria that's it when you take them away from it's in this case it's

745
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,360
engineering by subtraction by liberation when we take these cells away from these other

746
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,680
instructive signals then you find out what their baseline preference is their baseline

747
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:42,000
is this to have a much more exciting life as a xenobot and so I'm sure there are many many

748
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,680
of these things out there in in the world that we simply don't know about yet and so

749
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,320
what I think the xenobot really is I mean yes it's a biorebotics platform and there will be

750
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,200
useful synthetic living machines and and so on but what I think it really is and the xenobot

751
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,160
isn't just you know to be clear the xenobot isn't just this thing the xenobot is this thing plus

752
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,720
the AI that was used to to to investigate it the human engineers that that prompted these cells

753
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:13,280
to do this that whole thing is is really the xenobot and what it really is is an unusual

754
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,720
novel tool it's an exploration tool for probing these these these morpheus spaces these other

755
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,120
latent spaces that we're not very good at at noticing and and what I think is that

756
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,520
when darwin said endless forms most beautiful he was I'm kind of amazed at all the diversity of life

757
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:37,920
all of that natural life is this tiny little corner of morpheus space that's formed by the

758
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:44,160
space of possible bodies and minds that's formed by every possible combination of evolved material

759
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:50,960
cells dna tissues designed material and smart materials implants and all that and software

760
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,400
life is incredibly interoperable and every combination of of these three things is probably

761
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:02,000
going to be some kind of viable being that's uh yeah hybrids and cyborgs and and some of these

762
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,080
all already exist of course and many more will and you know for the for the younger people in

763
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:11,280
the audience in your lifetime you are going to be surrounded by other agents that are nowhere

764
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,280
on the tree of life with you you cannot decide how to relate to them based on where they are on

765
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:20,480
the standard n equals one tree of life on earth so so we are going to have to this I think is

766
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:26,000
really critical now the xenobots are just the first kind of a small step in this direction

767
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,280
we are going to have to develop a new kind of ethics for relating to truly diverse intelligences

768
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:37,680
that don't look like you they don't share uh they don't share um uh our our our evolutionary history

769
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:43,760
and uh you know uh a different a different way to relate to beings not based on uh what do you

770
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:49,280
look like what are you made of and how did you get here meaning evolved versus engineer so um

771
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:53,600
I just I'll summarize the whole thing by saying that I think one of the most interesting things

772
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,720
in biology is that um all of all intelligence is collective intelligence functioning through this

773
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,320
multi-scale competency architecture that navigates various virtual spaces um this kind of goal

774
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:10,400
directedness the cybernetic kind not the not the mystical kind is uh really an invariant for

775
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:17,360
recognizing building and relating to very unconventional agents and and there's a lot more

776
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,920
about this this this cognitive boundary that we can talk about and the collective intelligence

777
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,200
of cells is really an excellent target for regenerative medicine and also as an example

778
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:32,400
of why this kind of approach it's not philosophy and it's not metaphors it's it's something that

779
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:37,440
that actively on a on a you know every year it generates novel discoveries and new capabilities

780
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,800
that we didn't have before and um just that that that's that that exploring these spaces provides

781
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,400
an astronomically large uh possibility for new bodies and new minds which has huge implications

782
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,680
not just for um biomedicine and robotics but understanding evolution understanding ourselves

783
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:00,400
ethics so um if anybody's interested in going deeper um lots of these papers uh have discussed

784
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,200
this stuff in in great detail i want to thank um the students and postdocs we did um we did all the

785
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:13,440
work uh lots of lots of technical support um some of our amazing collaborators uh our funders um here

786
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,440
Jeremy Gay of Peregrine Creative does all the illustrations um and uh most of all uh the various

787
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:25,040
model systems because the animals do um all the heavy lifting so um i will thank you uh for listening

788
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,280
and take questions

789
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,800
thank you dr love that was fantastic um and i want to thank you on behalf of the society and the

790
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,880
students and uh guests who are um joining us today to listen um and i thank you for taking

791
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:49,280
just a couple extra minutes to answer a few questions um i'm going to paraphrase uh some

792
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:57,440
that came in on the q and a forum um one there's often a concern when there's new breakthroughs in

793
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,640
medicine that the new treatments are only going to be available to the rich that there's going to

794
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,760
be an inequity problem um and i'm kind of intuiting what the answer is going to be but uh is there a

795
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,640
potential here to have a solution that can be more um widely adapted because of the form that it takes

796
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,520
yeah yeah there is i mean i i'll i'll say first that i'm not an expert in the economics of medicine

797
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,320
as far as i understand uh we have an inequity problem with water and so you know it doesn't

798
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,680
have to be some fancy therapeutics before you get into an inequity problem so so that that's all

799
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,400
that's the you know kind of baseline um but with this with this specific set of manipulations

800
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:45,600
yeah i actually think it has an extremely favorable um equity profile because um we are we are

801
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,720
explicitly not doing the thing that's done now which is heroic interventions at the very end

802
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:55,440
of life to try to prolong basically a sinking ship and and that and what that means is that the input

803
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:02,080
to the next stage is is is way more um you know sort of uh degraded and that means the next step

804
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:07,200
has to be more expensive and heroic what we are saying is maybe there's a way to trigger regeneration

805
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:12,320
like in planaria or like in salamanders and uh and do it uh at the whole you know during during the

806
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:18,160
whole uh life life of the of the individual i'm increasing the health span and in particular

807
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:24,400
just about everything we do is uh can be done with very cheap ion channel drugs so these are

808
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,160
many of them already human approved most of them are are off-patent this is uh as far as

809
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,880
interventions go this is this is uh this is the delivery is going to be very cheap what's super

810
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,960
expensive right now is uh the r&d right so so so building all the equipment building all that

811
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,800
and i mean none of this existed before all the software everything else everything has to be built

812
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,120
once we crack this i mean i call this cracking the the morphogenetic code once we crack this

813
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:57,360
the actual treatments are going to be way cheaper than anything we've seen fantastic um and uh just

814
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,680
maybe quickly this one question because i think it's going to be on the minds of many people

815
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:09,440
we have um you know a common intuitive ends that a lot of our minds go when we think about

816
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,720
intelligence in other ways beyond the standard that we imagine that we have and that is you know

817
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:26,560
creating intelligence in silicon as opposed to in our biology and and the question is

818
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,000
what is is there something that limits the ability of taking our understanding of the

819
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,560
hardware software relationship that you're uncovering and transferring essentially ourselves

820
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:49,280
into our our goals our memories into the silicon space yeah um are you are you asking about uh

821
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:55,600
creating novel uh novel agents in silicon or are you asking uh what happened are you talking about

822
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,720
the idea of of taking an existing person and implementing them and is that that ladder thing

823
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:06,320
it's the second that was the question essentially prolonging your um your mind's existence in a

824
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:14,640
computer yeah well look uh i mean this this is really an old philosophical thing let imagine

825
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,760
imagine for a minute that um uh that uh this the the whole uh you know kind of star trek

826
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,520
transporter thing was solved and they would basically say well we're just gonna we're

827
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,040
going to record a copy of you when you're when we're going to record you when you're young

828
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,760
and then when you get old uh we're just gonna you know beam down a copy and and he'll be you

829
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,160
know you'll be young again and all great so okay there's there's a couple of ways to think about

830
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:43,360
this one way to think about it will be uh well fantastic uh there's gonna be a young me running

831
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:48,400
around on earth like great they'll bring it on another way of thinking is okay you're basically

832
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:54,080
gonna make a time shift a twin and that's great but i'm still here aging and dying that's what

833
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,360
what good does it do me uh you know what what good do the copies do me so i think that it's it's not

834
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,080
an issue of technology it's an issue of what do we really what do we really value and the question

835
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:09,040
is if if there is a you know you you you i mean i don't think the technology is going to be remotely

836
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:15,040
there in in our relevant uh time frame to to make a copy of us in any way but but let's say you could

837
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,640
i mean ultimately i don't see why it's impossible but but we're we're not able to do it for a long

838
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,320
time uh but if you know that you flip the computer on and he says oh fantastic it's it's great in here

839
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:29,120
and you say yeah well good good for you i guess but what do i do so i'm not sure that that actually

840
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:35,680
solves the problem but it's fun to think about fair point and and that's all the time of yours

841
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,120
that we're going to take i know that you have another engagement that you need to be getting to

842
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,720
but if everyone you know in your own private corner of the universe will have joined me in

843
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:50,960
giving dr levin a round of applause thank you so much thank you so much really appreciate it and

844
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,040
anybody that's interested drop me an email i saw a couple other questions i haven't gotten to so

845
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,400
anybody that wants to know anything drop me an email thank you so much for that all right thank

846
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,160
you everybody for joining us and thank you dr levin again thank you so much dr levin and thank

847
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:19,280
you so much dr chesna for being here bye everybody
