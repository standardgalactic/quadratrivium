00:00.000 --> 00:12.320
Hi, welcome. My name is Kimia Grigoryev and I'm the founder and president of HESPSS. Before

00:12.320 --> 00:17.200
we get started, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for being here, and I also

00:17.200 --> 00:22.160
want to thank our amazing team for working tirelessly to put this event together. I also

00:22.160 --> 00:27.120
want to thank Dr. Michael Levin for agreeing to do this event with us. We are incredibly

00:27.120 --> 00:33.440
honored and could not thank you enough. It is my honor to introduce Dr. Max Krasnow.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.800
He is a highly respected and esteemed professor, speaker, researcher,

00:38.800 --> 00:43.360
and we're fortunate enough to call him our wonderful faculty advisor for the Harvard

00:43.360 --> 00:48.800
Extension School Psychology Student Society. We are truly honored to have his invaluable

00:48.800 --> 00:54.880
guidance, support, and advice. With a decade of teaching experience at Harvard in the college,

00:54.880 --> 01:00.720
graduate school of arts and sciences, and in the Extension School, his expertise is vast and

01:00.720 --> 01:07.920
invaluable. Prior to joining Harvard, Dr. Krasnow earned his PhD in psychology from UC Santa Barbara

01:07.920 --> 01:14.240
with a focus on developmental and evolutionary psychology. His background and expertise make

01:14.240 --> 01:21.600
his insights incredibly valuable to our society and its members. Additionally, Dr. Krasnow is known

01:21.600 --> 01:27.040
for consistently going above and beyond for his students to ensure their academic and professional

01:27.040 --> 01:36.560
success. Please help me welcome Dr. Max Krasnow. Thank you, Kimia. So it is my privilege today

01:36.560 --> 01:42.800
to introduce Dr. Michael Levin. Michael Levin attended TAPS University, where he received dual

01:42.800 --> 01:49.520
bachelor's degrees in computer science and biology. He earned a PhD from Harvard University

01:49.520 --> 01:54.960
for the first characterization of the molecular genetic mechanisms that allow embryos to form

01:54.960 --> 02:01.680
a consistently left-right asymmetric body structure in a universe that doesn't distinguish that for

02:01.680 --> 02:09.040
them. This work is on nature's list of 100 milestones in developmental biology of the past

02:09.040 --> 02:15.120
century. He's the distinguished professor and Vannevar Bush Chair in the Department of Biology

02:15.120 --> 02:21.200
at TAPS University, where he also serves as the director of the Center for Regenerative and

02:21.200 --> 02:27.520
Developmental Biology. After a career as a software engineer in the field of scientific computing,

02:27.520 --> 02:31.680
Professor Levin earned his bachelor's in both computer science and biology, like I said,

02:31.680 --> 02:38.640
before coming to Harvard for his PhD. Later in his postdoc and up to his current positions,

02:38.640 --> 02:42.480
he's won numerous other awards that I won't take more time to mention,

02:42.480 --> 02:48.000
nor the journals that he serves as editor for, and so on and so on, because I'm too excited to get

02:48.000 --> 02:52.800
straight to letting us all hear from him. Let me present to you now Dr. Michael Levin,

02:52.800 --> 02:59.200
who will be telling us all about bioelectricity, body intelligence, and the future of regenerative

02:59.200 --> 03:01.200
medicine. And I'll say that right one of these days.

03:03.760 --> 03:08.640
All right, thank you so much. Really appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.400
I hope you will see how all of this relates to psychology, because I think it really does.

03:15.120 --> 03:21.840
So, if you would like to find any of the materials, the software, the papers, everything

03:21.840 --> 03:26.400
is at this website, please feel free to get in touch with me afterwards if you have questions

03:26.400 --> 03:34.000
or ideas or anything else. So I want to start off with this idea that all of us made this amazing

03:34.000 --> 03:39.200
journey from quote unquote, just physics to cognition. We were all at one point

03:40.880 --> 03:47.040
an unfertilized oocyte, so a little blob of chemistry and physics, and through this amazing

03:47.040 --> 03:52.800
process of embryonic development, we became one of these complex body structures, or in fact,

03:52.800 --> 03:59.360
maybe a complex metacognitive human being. And so this is really important, because for this

03:59.360 --> 04:04.000
reason, I think that developmental biology is maybe one of the most remarkable and magical

04:04.000 --> 04:07.600
of all sciences, because there you can see right in front of you, right in front of your eyes,

04:07.600 --> 04:13.120
how physics becomes mind. And it's a slow, gradual process. There's no special lightning flash that

04:14.640 --> 04:19.200
turns a mechanism into meaning or anything like that. It happens slowly and gradually.

04:19.200 --> 04:25.920
And so here we are trying to understand the process and the ramifications of that process.

04:25.920 --> 04:31.440
But and often we think, well, okay, so we undergo this journey. But in the end,

04:31.440 --> 04:38.800
we are some sort of a unified single intelligence. We're not like these so-called collective

04:38.800 --> 04:43.520
intelligences like ants and termites and bee colonies and so on. But actually, if we think

04:43.520 --> 04:48.880
about it, we are also an interesting kind of collective intelligence, because for example,

04:48.880 --> 04:53.440
RenÃ© Descartes really liked the pineal gland, because he said that in the brain, it's the one

04:53.440 --> 04:58.000
structure that isn't duplicated. And so it's fitting that a unified human intelligence,

04:58.560 --> 05:03.200
in some way, lives in that pineal gland. But if he had access to good microscopy,

05:03.200 --> 05:07.680
what he would have found is that actually, there's not one of anything. He would have found that

05:07.680 --> 05:13.120
that gland is actually full of cells. And if he were to look inside of these cells,

05:13.120 --> 05:17.840
he would see something like this. This is what's actually inside of the most cells. And this is,

05:17.840 --> 05:24.000
of course, is only a partial accounting of what's in there. So in an important sense,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.800
we are all collective intelligences. And it's very likely that all intelligence is

05:28.800 --> 05:34.080
collective intelligence, because all intelligence is made of parts of some sort. So this is the

05:34.080 --> 05:38.960
kind of thing we're made of. Here is a lacrimaria. This is a free living unicellular organism.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.840
What you'll notice here is that there's no brain. There's no nervous system. There are no stem cells.

05:43.840 --> 05:51.840
All of its needs, metabolic, physiological states, anatomical control, all of its needs

05:51.840 --> 05:57.920
are handled at the single cell level, very, very expertly, without the need for a brain or other

05:57.920 --> 06:03.600
cells or anything like that. And so this is the kind of material that we're made of. It is not

06:03.600 --> 06:08.800
where we don't consist of some sort of passive components. I sometimes give a talk called

06:08.800 --> 06:13.680
why robots don't get cancer. And the answer is because current technology is largely,

06:13.680 --> 06:18.480
not exclusively, but largely made at a single scale, where the overall machine might be competent

06:18.480 --> 06:23.040
and intelligent, but it's usually made of pretty dumb parts that don't have agendas of their own.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.920
But that's not true for us. We are made of an agential material because we are made of components

06:27.920 --> 06:34.080
with competencies and agendas in various problem spaces. And so that gives rise to a number of

06:34.080 --> 06:41.920
interesting biological phenomena. I'm going to just describe a few that are kind of unique,

06:41.920 --> 06:46.800
and that many people don't often think about, that will set us up for the next part of the talk.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.120
So for example, here is a soft-bodied creature, which has a brain appropriate to driving a kind

06:53.120 --> 07:01.920
of soft-bodied embodiment, where it likes particular kinds of leaves and so on. And

07:01.920 --> 07:07.200
this creature, which lives in a two-dimensional world of leaves, has to turn into this creature,

07:07.200 --> 07:12.000
which is a now hard-bodied kind of system, completely different controller you need for that.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.120
It lives in a three-dimensional world, doesn't care about leaves anymore, it wants nectar,

07:17.120 --> 07:23.040
and it has a different brain. And there are data showing that during this process of metamorphosis,

07:23.040 --> 07:28.560
which is this remarkable process in which the brain pretty much is dissolved, most of the cells

07:28.560 --> 07:33.280
are killed off, the connections are broken, and then reassembled into a new kind of brain,

07:33.280 --> 07:40.000
and yet memories that the caterpillar forms are retained in the moth or butterfly. And so

07:40.800 --> 07:44.720
not only is there a very practical question here, which be because we don't have any kind of

07:45.360 --> 07:49.360
memory medium in our computer technology or anything else that is this robust, where you

07:49.360 --> 07:52.880
can basically take it apart and reshuffle all the components and kill off most of it,

07:52.880 --> 07:57.680
and then you still have the original information. Not only that, but there's really a very

07:57.680 --> 08:00.880
fundamental philosophical question here, and people sometimes ask,

08:02.240 --> 08:06.240
what's it like to be a bat or a butterfly or something else? But this is one step further.

08:06.240 --> 08:11.760
What's it like to be a caterpillar slowly changing into a butterfly? So this sets us up to start to

08:11.760 --> 08:18.080
think about the intersection between body shape and the shape of our minds and our cognitive

08:18.080 --> 08:24.000
systems, and the idea that we change not only on an evolutionary timescale, but also on an

08:24.000 --> 08:28.720
individual timescale. This happens, this amazing transformation happens within the lifetime of

08:28.720 --> 08:34.880
this individual. Memories actually can be even more robust. So this is a creature known as a

08:34.880 --> 08:39.680
planarian flatworm, and I'll talk much more about this in a few minutes. But one of the things that

08:40.720 --> 08:46.000
is known is that these guys regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces, each piece makes a

08:46.000 --> 08:51.840
perfect little worm. And what was shown in the 60s, and this was James McConnell found this,

08:51.920 --> 08:56.560
he got a lot of flak over it, but he was actually right. We confirmed this with modern

08:56.560 --> 09:01.120
techniques about 10 years ago. If you take this planarian and you train them, for example, to

09:01.120 --> 09:06.080
recognize that this bumpy region in this dish contains food as you feed them on this bumpy

09:06.080 --> 09:10.400
kind of region, you can then amputate the brain, and they have been in fact the whole head,

09:10.400 --> 09:15.520
the tail will sit there doing nothing for about eight to 10 days, and they slowly regrow a new

09:15.520 --> 09:21.280
head. And then you can find out that the resulting worm actually still remembers the original

09:21.280 --> 09:24.640
information. So it's a place preference assay, and you can show that they still remember.

09:25.360 --> 09:31.360
So kind of a place conditioning paradigm there. And so what you see is that memory,

09:31.360 --> 09:36.400
first of all, is not necessarily just stored inside the brain, but also can be imprinted onto

09:36.400 --> 09:40.400
a new brain by the rest of the tissue. And so now once again, you have this very fundamental

09:40.400 --> 09:46.160
philosophical experiments, such as the malfunctioning transporter from Phil 101, where

09:47.200 --> 09:49.920
this transporter that makes a copy of you and then erases the original,

09:50.560 --> 09:54.240
but what happens if it fails to erase the original, which one is the real you? Well,

09:54.240 --> 09:58.560
planaria can do this all the time, right? You can cut them up into pieces, and all of them

09:58.560 --> 10:05.600
have the memories of the original. So now moving to a vertebrate system, that kind of plasticity,

10:05.600 --> 10:09.520
we showed something interesting in tadpoles, which you'll notice. So this is a tadpole of the

10:09.520 --> 10:14.480
frog Xenopus lavas. You'll notice that here's the mouth here, the nostrils, the brain and the gut,

10:14.480 --> 10:18.560
and here's the tail. And so what you'll see is that there are no primary eyes, we prevented

10:18.560 --> 10:24.400
those from forming. But what we did do was cause an eye to form on its tail. And when you do this,

10:24.400 --> 10:28.960
the eye makes an optic nerve. Well, first of all, the cells are perfectly happy to make an eye,

10:28.960 --> 10:32.400
even though they're sitting next to muscle instead of up here next to the brain where they belong.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.520
But also, they make this one optic nerve, the optic nerve goes and it synapses onto the spinal

10:37.520 --> 10:41.760
cord that does not go all the way to the brain. And then we can show using this machine that we

10:41.760 --> 10:46.320
built that these animals can see. So even though they have a, we can, we can train them in visual

10:46.320 --> 10:52.320
assays. And so even though we've radically changed the sensory motor architecture of this creature,

10:52.320 --> 10:56.640
with no period of evolutionary adaptation to it immediately in the first generation,

10:57.680 --> 11:04.720
the animal can use this novel configuration in its adaptive behavior. So that plasticity,

11:04.720 --> 11:11.760
you know, this ability to adjust to novel, novel architectures and novel circumstances

11:11.760 --> 11:17.760
is really critical and we're going to, we're going to see why. So the, the, the, what, what

11:17.760 --> 11:23.840
underlies all of these amazing abilities is in part something we call the multi-scale competency

11:23.840 --> 11:29.840
architecture. This is the idea that not only are we this kind of nested dolls where molecular

11:29.840 --> 11:34.720
networks and then subcellular components and then tissues and organs and whole bodies and even

11:34.720 --> 11:40.800
swarms of organisms, not only are we a set of nested dolls structurally, but also functionally.

11:40.800 --> 11:46.800
In other words, every, every layer of, of organization has its own competency to solve

11:46.800 --> 11:52.000
problems in different spaces. So it's not all about traditional behavior in three-dimensional

11:52.000 --> 11:58.560
space of movement. There are also transcriptional spaces, physiological spaces, metabolic spaces

11:58.560 --> 12:03.200
and so on. And so the competency of all these different components simultaneously solving

12:03.200 --> 12:08.320
these problems and interacting with both, both laterally and with levels above and below

12:08.320 --> 12:13.680
is what enables the whole body to have this incredible kind of robustness and, and

12:15.040 --> 12:20.800
creative problem solving capacities. And, you know, as humans, we're, we're very good at

12:20.800 --> 12:27.120
detecting intelligence of in three-dimensional space, medium-sized objects moving at medium

12:27.120 --> 12:32.240
speeds on, on our human time scale through three-dimensional space. And so we see primates

12:32.240 --> 12:36.720
and we see crows and, you know, things like that. And, and we can, we can recognize intelligent

12:36.720 --> 12:41.280
behavior. But there are these other spaces that we're really not very good at recognizing. And

12:41.280 --> 12:45.520
it's towards the end of the talk, I'll show you some tools that we've developed to help us think

12:45.520 --> 12:51.680
about this. But I firmly believe that the three-dimensional space that we're used to is not

12:51.680 --> 12:58.480
privileged in some sense, but rather it's, it's a, it's a construction of our, of our

12:58.480 --> 13:03.760
sensory motor architecture. And then if we, for example, had a primary perception of our blood

13:03.760 --> 13:08.720
chemistry, let's say you could, you could feel some number of chemical states in your, in your

13:08.720 --> 13:14.480
blood, the way that we do with vision and sight and smell and taste and so on. I think we would

13:14.480 --> 13:19.280
have no trouble visualizing that we live in a kind of physiological state space, a high-dimensional

13:19.280 --> 13:24.800
physiological state space. And in particular, we would recognize our, our liver, our kidneys,

13:24.800 --> 13:30.560
our various organs as navigating that state space on a daily basis and doing very intelligent things

13:30.560 --> 13:36.320
to get us across various problems and novel scenarios that come up. So what I'd like to do

13:36.320 --> 13:40.160
today is to talk about one, we could talk about all of these, they're fascinating examples in them

13:40.160 --> 13:45.280
all. But I'd like to spend today talking about morpho space, which is the space of possible

13:45.280 --> 13:50.000
anatomical configurations. It's a kind of a, you know, pick a body structure or in fact the entire

13:50.000 --> 13:55.920
body. And you can think about the space of all possible variants of that, of that structure

13:55.920 --> 14:01.360
and how they topologically relate to each other. So let's talk about this. In order to talk about

14:01.360 --> 14:08.480
that, and I'm, in particular, I'm going to propose this idea that we can fruitfully think of morphogenesis

14:08.480 --> 14:15.360
of the generation of biological shape as the behavior of a collective intelligence of cells

14:15.360 --> 14:20.720
in anatomical morpho space. In other words, embryonic development, regeneration, cancer

14:20.720 --> 14:25.760
suppression, remodeling, metamorphosis, all of these kinds of things are a kind of behavior

14:25.760 --> 14:29.760
there are kind of behavior of a collective intelligence that navigates that space in the

14:29.760 --> 14:34.800
way that we typically think neurons are a collective intelligence that help us navigate

14:34.800 --> 14:40.240
three dimensional space. So let's ask, let's ask this question. Here's, here's where we end up in

14:40.240 --> 14:45.600
morpho space as adult humans. Here's a cross section through a normal human body in the torso.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.080
Look at the incredible order of the structures. Everything is in the right place, the right

14:50.800 --> 14:56.080
size, oriented correctly relative to the right thing. Amazing degrees of order.

14:57.120 --> 15:01.840
Where does that order come from? Where is it recorded? And many people at this point would

15:01.840 --> 15:06.160
say, well, it's in the DNA, of course, it's in the genome, but we can read genomes now. And we know

15:06.160 --> 15:12.000
what's in the genome. It's protein sequences. So the tiniest hardware available to every cell,

15:12.720 --> 15:18.480
the genome doesn't have a plan of a large scale anatomy as far as which side is left,

15:18.480 --> 15:22.640
which side is right, how many eyes are you going to have eyes? All of these things have to be

15:22.640 --> 15:28.640
constructed on the fly by cells that use the hardware given to them by the genome to make

15:28.640 --> 15:36.240
all kinds of computations. And this structure is no more, quote unquote, in the DNA anymore than

15:36.240 --> 15:41.520
the structure of a termite colony is in the termites DNA, or the shape of a spider's web

15:41.520 --> 15:47.600
is in the spider's DNA. It's all an emergent computational process that requires a lot of

15:49.360 --> 15:54.960
collective intelligence from the pieces. And so as workers in regenerative medicine, we would like

15:54.960 --> 15:59.520
to know if a piece of this is missing, how do we get the cells to rebuild and repair?

16:00.960 --> 16:05.440
For cancer, we might want to know how do they know when to stop building? And as engineers,

16:05.440 --> 16:10.000
we'd like to know what else is possible? With the cells from the exact same genome,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.160
what else are they willing to build if we knew the right signals? And so these are all the kinds

16:14.160 --> 16:18.560
of questions that we're interested in to understand that navigation through morpheus space.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.440
Now, as we think about what would a finished solution in this field look like? We don't know

16:23.440 --> 16:28.560
what's the end game, when can we all go home? I think it's useful to visualize that, right? What

16:28.560 --> 16:32.640
does it look like when it's solved? And I think what it looks like is something we call an anatomical

16:32.640 --> 16:40.960
compiler. The idea here is that someday you'll be able to sit in front of a computer and draw

16:40.960 --> 16:44.960
the plant or animal that you wanted. So you could draw this schematic of a three-headed

16:44.960 --> 16:49.520
flatworm. And so you would draw at the level of anatomy, not at the level of molecular pathways

16:49.520 --> 16:52.880
or anything like that. And if we had such a thing, if we knew what we were doing,

16:53.600 --> 17:00.480
the system would compile our anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given

17:00.480 --> 17:08.480
to specific cells to get them to build whatever we want them to build. Now, this is really important

17:08.480 --> 17:13.920
that this device would not be a 3D printer. The point isn't to micromanage the position

17:13.920 --> 17:18.960
of every cell. The point is to communicate your anatomical goals to the collective intelligence

17:18.960 --> 17:25.840
of cells and get them to build. Why is this important besides the basic importance for

17:25.840 --> 17:31.920
developmental biology and evolution and so on? Most problems in biomedicine boil down to

17:31.920 --> 17:37.200
the control of shape. In other words, if we had a way to tell groups of cells what to build,

17:37.280 --> 17:42.160
we would simultaneously be able to solve birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging,

17:42.160 --> 17:46.160
degenerative disease. All of these things would go away if we had some ability to

17:46.160 --> 17:52.880
communicate anatomical goals to cells. Now, one issue is why don't we have such a thing? I mean,

17:52.880 --> 17:59.680
molecular biology and genetics have been around for a long time, amazing progress. Why don't we

17:59.680 --> 18:05.120
have this yet? Well, I'll just give you a very simple example. So this here is a baby axolotl

18:05.120 --> 18:11.840
and baby axolotls have little four legs. This is a tappel of the frogs and a mislevis

18:11.840 --> 18:17.120
at this stage. They do not have any legs. One thing we do in our lab is we make frog

18:17.120 --> 18:22.400
allotls. So these are a combination of some axolotl embryonic cells, frog embryonic cells,

18:22.400 --> 18:27.440
and you get a frog allotl. And so now I pose the question. We have the axolotl genome.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.400
We have the frog genome. So you have all the genomic information. And so now I ask,

18:32.400 --> 18:38.480
could you tell me if a frog allotl is going to have legs or not? And the thing is that we can't.

18:38.480 --> 18:43.200
We have no idea because while we're pretty good at the molecular machinery, we really do not

18:43.200 --> 18:48.160
understand how collectives of cells make decisions. We don't know if frog allotls will have legs.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.880
We don't know if they do have legs. There is no theory that will tell you whether those legs

18:52.880 --> 18:58.080
would consist of frog cells or only axolotl cells. These are all completely open questions.

18:58.080 --> 19:03.360
So where we are in biomedicine is this. We're very good at manipulating cells and molecules,

19:03.360 --> 19:07.200
and we make models like this of which proteins and which genes interact with each other.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.800
But what we'd really like to do is to control form and function. And so I'm going to make the

19:10.800 --> 19:15.440
claim that where we are in medicine today is roughly where computer science was in the 40s and 50.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.960
And so you can see what she's doing here. She's programming this computer by

19:18.960 --> 19:23.760
physically rewiring it. Back in those days, you had to interact with the hardware. That was the

19:23.760 --> 19:29.280
only option. And I think today, molecular medicine, so CRISPR, genome editing, protein

19:29.280 --> 19:34.880
engineering, all those kinds of things, all these exciting approaches are all focused on

19:34.880 --> 19:40.480
the hardware. And I think that really transformative biomedicine is going to appear when we add to

19:40.480 --> 19:50.240
this the really critical way to understand control and communicate with the software of life or

19:50.240 --> 19:53.760
AKA the collective intelligence of cells and their problem solving abilities.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.640
So when I talk about intelligence, I'll probably mention that many times in this talk, what I

19:58.640 --> 20:04.160
mean is this William James definition, which is the ability to reach the same goal by different

20:04.160 --> 20:08.480
means. Very interesting definition. It doesn't say anything about brains. It doesn't say anything

20:08.480 --> 20:13.600
about whether you were evolved or engineered or some combination thereof or how you got here.

20:14.240 --> 20:19.920
It focuses on this kind of very cybernetic notion of being able to navigate a space towards a goal

20:19.920 --> 20:26.320
and having some degree of competency to do it by different means when your standard way of

20:26.320 --> 20:32.240
going about it is blocked in some way or perturbed. So what kind of collective intelligence do

20:32.240 --> 20:38.000
these cellular swarms deploy? What can they do? Well, let's see. We know that developmental

20:38.000 --> 20:43.760
self-assembly is very reliable. So most of the time, this single cell will give rise to this

20:43.760 --> 20:49.520
amazing three-dimensional anatomy, this target morphology. But we know that it's not hardwired

20:49.520 --> 20:55.440
because if you cut these, for example, in half, you don't get two half bodies. You get two perfectly

20:55.440 --> 21:01.200
normal monozygotic twins. And so there's this and there are many other these types of perturbations

21:01.200 --> 21:07.040
that the idea is that in the system from different starting positions, and so this is a very vastly

21:07.040 --> 21:12.880
simplified morpho space down to two axes, you can get from different starting positions, you

21:12.880 --> 21:18.240
still manage to get to the same ensemble of goal states corresponding to normal human variations.

21:18.240 --> 21:25.040
And in fact, in various ways in development, you can go around local optima such as this local

21:25.040 --> 21:29.520
minimum and so on, and still get to where you need to go despite starting off from different

21:29.520 --> 21:35.840
positions. So that's interesting. It has some degree of flexibility of its surroundings.

21:36.400 --> 21:41.120
And this isn't just for embryos. For example, this, this is that ax law that I mentioned.

21:41.120 --> 21:46.640
These guys regenerate their limbs, their jaws, their eyes, their spinal cords, portions of the

21:46.640 --> 21:53.920
heart and brain. And what you'll see here is that if they lose some part of this limb, and it can

21:53.920 --> 21:59.120
be down here, it could be here, it could be up here anywhere, what they will do is they will rapidly

21:59.120 --> 22:04.080
regrow and remake the limb, and then they stop. And that's perhaps the most amazing thing about

22:04.080 --> 22:08.720
regeneration that it knows when to stop. When does it stop? It stops when a correct salamander

22:08.720 --> 22:12.560
limb has been completed. So what you have here is a kind of error minimization scheme,

22:13.360 --> 22:17.920
where, where the system will attempt, despite these kind of injuries and deviations, will attempt

22:17.920 --> 22:24.640
to keep to this target pathology. So this idea of anatomical homeostasis, the ability to take action

22:24.640 --> 22:29.280
repeatedly to make up for perturbations that push you out of the correct region of morphos

22:29.280 --> 22:35.200
based down to this region, they can work their way back. So, of course, salamanders and worms

22:35.200 --> 22:39.760
aren't the, aren't the only ones that can do this. The human liver is actually highly regenerative,

22:39.760 --> 22:42.960
even the ancient Greeks knew that, I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.

22:44.480 --> 22:50.000
Every year, year, which are a large adult mammal, they regenerate their, their antlers, so that

22:50.000 --> 22:56.080
means bone, innervation, skin up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth every day. So,

22:56.080 --> 23:00.880
so kind of remarkable regenerative ability as an adult mammal, and even human children can

23:00.880 --> 23:05.440
regenerate their fingertips. So below a certain age, a clean amputation will regrow with, you

23:05.680 --> 23:12.560
know, cosmetically very, very reasonable results. So one final example, this is something that we

23:12.560 --> 23:17.760
discovered a few years ago, which is, which is this, tadpoles, of course, need to become frogs,

23:17.760 --> 23:21.680
and in order for a tadpole face to become a frog face, things have to move. So the jaws have to

23:21.680 --> 23:25.600
come out, the eyes have to move forward, the nostrils move, everything moves. And it used to

23:25.600 --> 23:30.160
be thought it was assumed that this is some kind of hardwired process. After all, every tadpole looks

23:30.160 --> 23:34.560
the same, every frog looks the same. And so if you just, if every piece of the head just remembers

23:34.560 --> 23:40.240
which direction and how far to go, then you go from a normal tadpole to a normal frog. So that

23:40.240 --> 23:43.760
was the assumption. So we decided to test that assumption, and this is really important, because

23:43.760 --> 23:50.160
as we talk about this field of basal cognition, diverse intelligence, looking at these kind of

23:50.160 --> 23:56.080
protocognitive capacities and unfamiliar embodiments, it's very important that we cannot simply make

23:56.080 --> 24:00.880
armchair pronouncements about what we think, which systems we think have what degree of intelligence

24:00.880 --> 24:06.080
we have to do experiments, because it is often not obvious. So what we did in this particular case

24:06.800 --> 24:11.440
is we made what's called Picasso tadpoles, and Picasso tadpoles have everything scrambled. So

24:11.440 --> 24:16.160
the eyes on the top of the head, the jaws are off to the side, everything is moved around.

24:16.160 --> 24:20.320
And what we found is that these tadpoles make largely perfectly normal frogs,

24:20.960 --> 24:25.840
because everything moves around from novel position. Sometimes it actually goes too far and has to

24:25.840 --> 24:31.840
come back a little bit. It makes these movements, and then it settles into a correct frog face.

24:31.840 --> 24:37.840
So in fact, it has more intelligence than you would initially assume, because it has the

24:37.840 --> 24:42.960
ability to overcome a novel problem of being located in the wrong place that typical embryos

24:42.960 --> 24:48.960
don't have to deal with. So the genetics doesn't specify a hardware, the hardwired rearrangements,

24:48.960 --> 24:56.080
it specifies a system that executes an error minimization, a way to keep acting until you

24:56.080 --> 25:00.640
get to the correct state. So that raises an obvious question, how does it know what the

25:00.640 --> 25:08.480
correct target morphology is? And so this is the standard story of developmental biology told in

25:08.480 --> 25:12.240
the textbook, which is that you have gene regulatory networks. Some of these genes make

25:12.240 --> 25:16.960
effector proteins that do things, they're sticky, or they diffuse, or they signal us somehow.

25:17.520 --> 25:23.520
And then there's this process of emergence where lots of this happens in parallel, and voila,

25:23.520 --> 25:27.600
at the end you get some sort of complex outcome. And this is true, of course, there is this process

25:27.600 --> 25:33.040
of emergence of complex form from simple rules. But this isn't the whole story, there's a really

25:33.040 --> 25:38.960
important aspect of this, which we study by putting these feedback loops on here, which is that

25:40.560 --> 25:44.720
when you deviate the system from its correct target morphology, and that could be large-scale

25:44.720 --> 25:52.160
injury, it could be aging, it could be teratogens, or various other mutations. What happens is there

25:52.160 --> 25:56.480
are loops that kick in, both in terms of physics and genetics, we're going to talk about the physics

25:56.480 --> 26:03.200
one, that try to get the system back to where it was. Okay, so this is the anatomical homeostasis

26:03.200 --> 26:11.360
part. So now, if this is true, well, this has a couple of components that you may think, well,

26:11.360 --> 26:15.040
these are just feedback loops, biologists know all about feedback loops, so there's feedback

26:15.040 --> 26:19.360
everywhere. And this is true, but the typical way of thinking about this, first of all, is

26:19.360 --> 26:25.200
it's something like, for example, a temperature control loop, or a hunger loop, or a pH regulation,

26:25.200 --> 26:30.320
is the set point is a scalar, it's a single number. This isn't the case, here you need a set point that

26:30.320 --> 26:35.360
in some, to some level of detail, tells you what the correct shape is going to be. And

26:36.000 --> 26:42.720
so that's unusual. And the other thing is that, typically in these kind of developmental molecular

26:42.720 --> 26:48.880
biology approaches, when people don't like to think of any kind of a final goal towards which

26:48.880 --> 26:53.440
the system is moving, it's supposed to be sort of this feed forward open loop kind of thing,

26:53.440 --> 26:57.600
where whatever happens happens, but there isn't a goal towards which it's going. And I think

26:57.600 --> 27:01.920
that's fundamentally incorrect, it leaves a lot of useful things on the table to think about it

27:01.920 --> 27:07.840
that way. So what we wanted to do was to follow the predictions of this kind of way of thinking

27:07.840 --> 27:13.120
about it, and it makes some very strong predictions. What it says is, if this is true, then there's

27:13.120 --> 27:18.720
going to be a target morphology encoded somewhere, it's going to have a physical encoding somewhere,

27:18.720 --> 27:24.160
the way that you can find the encoding in your thermostat for where the set point is recorded,

27:24.160 --> 27:30.960
which is going to be an encoding that. And what we'd be able to do is learn to read it,

27:30.960 --> 27:35.920
to decode it, and thus to rewrite it. Because if we can do that, what that means is that you

27:35.920 --> 27:41.680
can change what happens out here by changing the set point, not just by controlling the genes and

27:41.680 --> 27:46.800
then hoping that this process gets you what you want. Because working this backwards to ask,

27:46.800 --> 27:51.760
which genes do I edit to make specific changes here is incredibly difficult. It's a very hard

27:51.760 --> 27:55.680
inverse problem. It's what's going to limit applications of CRISPR and things like that.

27:56.320 --> 28:00.320
It's very hard. So it would be much nicer if much like with your thermostat, you could change the

28:00.400 --> 28:04.000
set point and let the cells do what they do best, which is rebuilt without you having to

28:04.000 --> 28:10.080
micromanage from the lowest level. So those are the predictions and this is what we've been working

28:10.080 --> 28:14.880
on for some years now. So I'm going to show you this. In order to start to think about how a

28:14.880 --> 28:20.240
collection of cells could store some sort of goal that it's going to move towards, we use the nervous

28:20.240 --> 28:26.960
system as a source of inspiration. Because it's very clear that there you have a great example

28:26.960 --> 28:31.920
of a system that can store goals and memories and work towards them. So how does it work? Well,

28:32.880 --> 28:38.400
the hardware looks like this. It's a network of cells, each of which has little ion channels

28:38.400 --> 28:42.880
that allow the cell to generate a voltage potential by segregating positive and negative charges.

28:43.680 --> 28:48.640
And those voltage potentials may or may not get propagated to neighboring cells via these

28:48.640 --> 28:54.320
regulated electrical synapses known as gap junctions. And so that's how the hardware looks.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.840
What that allows the networks to have is this very active electrical

28:58.720 --> 29:04.240
set of electrical processes. And here you can see here, this is a zebrafish being this group

29:04.240 --> 29:09.040
made an amazing video of this zebrafish while recording all the electrical activity as this

29:09.040 --> 29:13.840
animal is thinking about whatever it is that zebrafish think about. And the commitment of

29:13.840 --> 29:19.200
neuroscience is that you should be able to do something they call neural decoding, which is

29:19.280 --> 29:24.560
that if we were to able to get all these data, and if we understood how to decode them through

29:24.560 --> 29:29.040
these computer models, what we would be able to do is read out the contents of the animal's mind.

29:29.040 --> 29:33.280
What is it thinking about? What are the memories, the preferences, the behavioral repertoires?

29:33.280 --> 29:39.760
So the idea of neural decoding is that the information is literally encoded in the physiology.

29:39.760 --> 29:44.560
All of the kind of cognitive aspects of this animal are encoded in these electrical signals.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.560
Well, it turns out the amazing thing, it turns out that that kind of trick is ancient.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.280
It is not just something that is used for brains because

29:52.480 --> 29:57.280
every cell in your body has ion channels. Most cells have gap junctions to their neighbors.

29:57.280 --> 30:03.280
And it turns out that evolution figured out the benefits of this kind of architecture

30:03.280 --> 30:09.040
oh, back around the time of bacterial biofilms long before nerve and muscle came along.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.120
And so it turns out that these tricks that the nervous system uses are really based on

30:13.120 --> 30:18.080
some of these very ancient ways to process information in electrical networks.

30:18.080 --> 30:24.320
And so we thought, wouldn't it be remarkable if we took a lot of concepts from neuroscience

30:24.320 --> 30:29.360
and behavioral science? And this is what it means to consider morphogenesis and intelligence.

30:29.360 --> 30:34.960
It's not just a metaphor of speaking. It's something that actually says take seriously

30:34.960 --> 30:39.840
the isomorphism between these fields and take techniques from a completely different area

30:39.840 --> 30:46.240
that have never been applied to developmental biology and apply them to a different medium

30:46.240 --> 30:50.960
in a different problem space and see what these tools give you. And I think they give you a lot.

30:50.960 --> 30:57.360
And so that's how you cash out these claims like that. And so what we decided to do was to say,

30:57.360 --> 31:02.880
okay, could we use the same kind of tools to read all the electrical conversations that

31:02.880 --> 31:06.400
body cells are having with each other? And from that extract or decode,

31:07.280 --> 31:11.120
what are the anatomies that they're trying to build? What are their competencies and so on?

31:11.120 --> 31:18.400
And so we made the first tools to read and write the electrical information in cells outside of the

31:18.400 --> 31:22.080
nervous system. And so I'm going to show you these tools. I'm going to show you what we can do with

31:22.080 --> 31:30.240
them. So this is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye. And this allows us to noninvasively, over

31:30.240 --> 31:34.880
time lapse, see what all the bioelectric patterns are. And then we can do a lot of

31:34.880 --> 31:38.720
quantitative computer simulations to relate that to the different channels and pumps that are

31:38.720 --> 31:43.440
expressed and really gain an understanding of what the physiological dynamics here.

31:43.440 --> 31:49.680
So here's an example of what you see when you do this. This is a video of a frog embryo putting

31:49.680 --> 31:55.360
its face together. It's grayscale, but that doesn't matter. You can see it's quite dynamic.

31:55.360 --> 32:00.160
But what you'll see here, we call this the electric face. This is one frame of that movie.

32:01.360 --> 32:07.200
It basically shows you that long before the organs of the face are patterned and long before the

32:08.080 --> 32:14.960
genes come on that control some of these things, already this anterior ectoderm has a map

32:15.920 --> 32:20.080
represented within it, this bioelectrical map of all the organs. So here's where the mouth is going

32:20.080 --> 32:23.760
to go. Here's where the eye is going to go. The placode's out to the side. Here's where everything

32:23.760 --> 32:30.400
is going to be. So this is an endogenous pattern. And I'll show you in a minute. It's actually

32:30.400 --> 32:38.320
required for normal face development. It's required for the morphogenesis that actually

32:38.320 --> 32:42.080
creates the face. If you interfere with this pattern, the gene expression will change and

32:42.080 --> 32:46.320
the anatomy will change. So that's a normal endogenous pattern. Here's a pathological pattern.

32:47.040 --> 32:52.000
What you can do is you can misexpress a human oncogene and then eventually you'll get a tumor.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.160
But before the tumor becomes apparent, you will already see that there are some

32:56.160 --> 33:00.320
bioelectrical changes where these cells are basically electrically disconnecting from their

33:00.320 --> 33:06.960
neighbors and they're going to go off on their own and that's metastasis. And so there's some

33:06.960 --> 33:12.480
obvious applications here to monitoring birth defects, to cancer diagnosis, and so on. But

33:13.360 --> 33:20.000
more important than the characterization tools are the functional tools. So we don't use any

33:20.000 --> 33:24.400
applied fields. There are no frequencies, no waves, no electromagnetic radiation, no magnets.

33:24.400 --> 33:30.640
What we do is we control the native interface by which cells control each other. That is the

33:30.640 --> 33:35.280
electrical side of electrical controls on their cell surface that they expose to each other.

33:35.280 --> 33:40.160
And the way we can do that is all the techniques of neuroscience. So we can target these electrical

33:40.160 --> 33:45.920
synapses to either open or close them. We can target all the ion channels to change directly,

33:45.920 --> 33:50.560
not just the connectivity, but also the actual voltage states. And you can do this with drugs

33:50.560 --> 33:56.240
and you can do it with ion channel mutants and with optogenetics and various other techniques.

33:56.240 --> 34:01.680
And so we have the ability now to go in and with significant specificity to change which

34:01.680 --> 34:07.280
cell talks to each other's cell and what voltage, in fact, they're communicating to each other,

34:07.280 --> 34:12.640
which corresponds to synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, respectively. So I'm going to show

34:12.640 --> 34:19.120
you an example of one of my favorite all-time examples, originally discovered by my very first

34:19.200 --> 34:23.760
student back when I was at Forsythe Institute at the Harvard Dental School.

34:25.040 --> 34:30.960
We had this amazing finding, which is that we decided to start to manipulate some of these

34:30.960 --> 34:35.200
voltages to ask what will happen. These were very early days. No one knew what was going to

34:35.200 --> 34:39.600
happen. In fact, people thought that voltage was a housekeeping parameter. They said, well,

34:39.600 --> 34:43.920
if you mess with the voltage of these cells, they'll die. You'll get an uninterpretable phenotype.

34:43.920 --> 34:49.760
But we decided to try. And so what she did was to interpret, in the first person to see this,

34:49.760 --> 34:55.120
was Ivy Chen. And then several other people in my group worked on this, Shariao and Vipafai,

34:55.120 --> 35:00.560
more recently. And so what she did was to inject RNA encoding a particular potassium channel

35:00.560 --> 35:05.920
into some cells that were going to be something other than I. And what happens is that when you

35:05.920 --> 35:12.880
establish a little spot of voltage that is the same shape and the voltage pattern as that I spot

35:12.880 --> 35:17.680
in the electric face I showed you, you can induce eyes anywhere else. You can get them on the gut,

35:17.680 --> 35:22.960
you can get them on the tail, you can put them anywhere on the animal. And these eyes will often

35:22.960 --> 35:28.160
have all the correct internal layers, so all the retina and optic nerve, all that stuff.

35:29.200 --> 35:34.480
So this tells you four really interesting things. First is that the bioelectric pattern is

35:34.480 --> 35:39.040
instructive. When you change that pattern, it just doesn't just screw up normal development.

35:39.040 --> 35:43.520
It's not permissive. It actually tells the cells build an eye here. That's functionally what it does.

35:44.240 --> 35:50.640
Second is the amazing modularity. We didn't have to tell all the cells where the stem cells go,

35:50.640 --> 35:54.960
how to build a lens, how to build a retina. We didn't have to do any of that. In fact,

35:54.960 --> 35:57.920
we have no idea how to do that. We couldn't possibly give it all the information how to

35:57.920 --> 36:03.040
build a whole complex eye. What we found is a very high-level subroutine call that basically

36:03.040 --> 36:07.840
just says build an eye here. The animal's tissues already know how to build an eye. We found a trigger

36:07.840 --> 36:14.160
for it. So very modular, and that's good for regenerative medicine. Also, what's remarkable

36:14.160 --> 36:20.560
is that if you probe this animal with what was considered to be the PAC-6 master eye gene,

36:20.560 --> 36:26.320
only the anterior norectoderm, which is this tissue up here, is competent to be eye. And so in the

36:26.320 --> 36:30.320
developmental biology textbook, there's a story about ectodermal competency, and they tell you

36:30.320 --> 36:36.320
that only these regions are competent to become eye. And that's true if you probe them with a PAC-6

36:36.320 --> 36:41.840
signal. But if you go upstream and probe this system with a voltage signal, in fact, all of them,

36:41.840 --> 36:45.200
you find out that all of the cells, including gut endoderm, which is really crazy,

36:46.160 --> 36:51.600
are actually competent to make eye. And so the whole issue of how competent are these cells

36:51.600 --> 36:58.400
is really predicated on how you pose the question. And this has direct implications for

36:59.440 --> 37:04.960
prompting and AI and other kinds of systems. You have to have the right prompt to really

37:04.960 --> 37:09.760
learn what the system is capable of. Also, something else that's interesting, this is a lens

37:09.760 --> 37:16.560
sitting out in the flank of a tadpole somewhere. And what you'll notice is these blue cells,

37:16.560 --> 37:20.800
this is beta galactosidase, and these blue cells are the ones that we actually injected with the

37:20.800 --> 37:25.600
channel. All the rest of this was never directly injected by us. All these brown cells are native,

37:25.600 --> 37:30.240
unmanipulated cells. But what happened is that something that happens in other collective

37:30.240 --> 37:35.200
intelligence is like ants. When a couple of ants come along, something they want to move,

37:35.200 --> 37:40.640
and it's too big for them, they will recruit their neighbors. And so that's what happens here.

37:41.680 --> 37:45.680
Two levels of instruction. We instructed these cells that, hey, you need to make an eye,

37:45.680 --> 37:50.240
and these cells, on their own, without us having to handle size control or how many cells there are

37:50.240 --> 37:59.360
or any of that, these cells come endeared and hijack their neighbors to participate with them

37:59.760 --> 38:03.360
in this project of constructing this lens. Because this system knows how big the thing

38:03.360 --> 38:06.960
is supposed to be, it knows how many of them there are, and it can do what's necessary,

38:06.960 --> 38:11.040
which again, we didn't need to do this at all. This is a native competency,

38:11.040 --> 38:16.480
scaling to the appropriate task, is something tissues already do. So this goes back to my claim

38:16.480 --> 38:20.480
that for proper regenerative medicine, you really want to be working with all of these

38:20.480 --> 38:25.920
competencies, these morphogenetic navigation tricks that the system has that are completely

38:25.920 --> 38:30.480
not obvious from standard development. And we need to be able to exploit these.

38:30.480 --> 38:37.600
So doing that, you can build many things. You can ask the system to make ectopic four brain.

38:37.600 --> 38:43.680
So here's this giant brain-y tappel. You can make extra legs. So here's our six-legged frog.

38:43.680 --> 38:48.000
You can make extra hearts, extra beating hearts. You can make extra odysses,

38:48.000 --> 38:52.320
which are inner ear organs. Or you can ask it to make fins. Now that's interesting,

38:52.320 --> 38:56.480
tappels aren't supposed to have fins. That's more of a fish thing. We'll get to that in a minute.

38:57.600 --> 39:04.480
But of course, now that once we saw that we were able to induce complex structures,

39:04.480 --> 39:10.480
we immediately started on a regenerative kind of medicine model, which is leg regeneration.

39:10.480 --> 39:15.920
And so what we see in frogs, frogs normally don't regenerate their legs. But what we see here

39:16.720 --> 39:21.600
is that if we provide a cocktail with a specific ionophore that changes the voltage

39:21.600 --> 39:26.240
state of that wound cell, what we can do is we can trigger immediately within a couple

39:26.240 --> 39:31.120
of days, you get this MSX1 positive blastema marker, and the leg immediately starts to grow.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.440
By 45 days, you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail, and eventually you've got a very

39:35.440 --> 39:42.560
nice leg that is touch-sensitive and motile. This, by the way, the stimulus here was only

39:42.560 --> 39:47.840
present for 24 hours. And if you stimulate for 24 hours in our most recent paper,

39:47.840 --> 39:51.920
you get a year and a half of leg growth. And the whole point is that we aren't there

39:51.920 --> 39:56.960
3D printing anything. We're not there with scaffolds or control of gene expression or

39:56.960 --> 40:01.440
stem cells. We're not trying to tell the frog how to build the leg. We provide a very simple

40:01.440 --> 40:07.440
signal right at the beginning, which says go towards the leg-building region of morphospace,

40:07.440 --> 40:11.600
not towards the scarring region. And that's it. After that, we don't touch it again. So again,

40:11.600 --> 40:17.680
relying, pushing all the complexity onto the system itself. We are now attempting to do this

40:18.080 --> 40:22.240
in mammals, in rodents. And I have to do a disclosure here, because David Kaplan and I are

40:23.280 --> 40:27.040
scientific co-founders of a company called Morphosuticals, Inc., which tries to apply

40:27.040 --> 40:32.720
this technology to get limb regeneration in mammals, and hopefully someday into the clinic.

40:33.760 --> 40:39.280
Okay, I want to change gears and talk about a different organism. We're back to planaria here.

40:40.160 --> 40:46.560
Remember that these guys can regenerate. Every part of their body, they're amazing in particular.

40:46.560 --> 40:50.320
They also solve the aging problem. They're immortal. As far as we know, there's no such

40:50.320 --> 40:57.120
thing as an old planarian. They regenerate everything as it is. And you've got this amazing

40:57.120 --> 41:02.560
capacity. And so we wanted to answer a question, how does each piece know how many heads of tails

41:02.560 --> 41:05.680
it's supposed to have? It's kind of a funny question, but if you're a piece like this,

41:05.680 --> 41:10.080
you have to know how many heads. And it's not obvious from where you were located, because

41:10.080 --> 41:17.280
if you take a planaria and cut it in half, this region has to make a tail. This region

41:17.280 --> 41:20.480
has to make a head. They were direct neighbors. They were in the same location in the animal,

41:20.480 --> 41:24.640
but they have radically different anatomical outcomes. So it's not a trivial problem. You

41:24.640 --> 41:29.440
can't just tell what you're going to be based on where you were in the original. It doesn't work.

41:29.440 --> 41:35.520
So how do they know? So what we discovered was a bioelectric circuit, and I'll skip all the details,

41:36.480 --> 41:42.720
that literally controls this process and stores the information about how many heads you're

41:42.720 --> 41:47.120
supposed to have. So the way it works is the single-headed planarium. And you can see the

41:47.120 --> 41:52.240
anterior is where the head markers are expressed, of course. And so when you cut them like this,

41:52.240 --> 41:58.320
very reliably, you get a one-headed form. But what you can also do is cut these guys, again,

41:58.320 --> 42:03.600
one-headed animal, anterior gene expression in the right place in the head, not in the tail.

42:03.600 --> 42:07.440
And so you cut them and you get a two-headed worm. And why would this be a two-headed...

42:07.440 --> 42:12.080
And this is in Photoshop. These are real animals. And why would you get a two-headed worm? I just

42:12.080 --> 42:17.760
told you that this is very reliable. The reason is that we were able to find this bioelectrical

42:17.760 --> 42:22.240
pre-pattern that looks like this. And the decoding is kind of simple. I'm showing you this because

42:22.240 --> 42:25.600
much like with the electric face, this is the simple one. There are other patterns that are

42:25.600 --> 42:30.880
very hard. We're still trying to crack. But what you can see is one head, one tail. And what we

42:30.960 --> 42:34.800
were able to do is use drugs to affect ion channels to change this pattern

42:34.800 --> 42:39.760
into two heads. And it's kind of messy, but it's okay. It works. Two heads. And so

42:41.200 --> 42:46.400
what you see here is that this two-headed... This two-headed pattern gives rise to two-headed

42:46.400 --> 42:53.360
animals. But here's the amazing part. This is not a readout of this animal. This is a map of this

42:53.360 --> 43:00.000
animal. And this normally... This anatomically and transcriptionally normal animal has a

43:00.000 --> 43:05.600
different representation of what a correct planarian looks like. And if you injure him,

43:05.600 --> 43:09.840
and not until then, so it's a latent memory, if you injure him, then the cells will go ahead

43:09.840 --> 43:13.600
and they build what the pattern says. And then they will go ahead and they build two heads. But

43:13.600 --> 43:20.320
until that happens, it's a perfectly normal one-headed body. So several interesting things

43:20.320 --> 43:24.720
here. One of which is that this bioelectric... Again, of course, the bioelectric pattern is

43:24.720 --> 43:30.480
instructive. It tells you what kind of structures you're going to have. Second, remember that at

43:30.480 --> 43:38.080
the very beginning, I sort of promised that we were going to find a read and decode and

43:38.080 --> 43:44.880
re-specify the pattern memories that allow a particular set of tissues to know what to build

43:44.880 --> 43:49.600
and when to stop. This is it. You're looking at it. The question of how does the planarian

43:49.600 --> 43:54.080
piece know what to make, this is the answer. It's because this pattern contains the information

43:54.080 --> 44:00.800
that's needed to specify one aspect of its morphogenetic future. And the other thing is that

44:01.280 --> 44:07.440
this is perhaps... The interesting thing is that, again, this electrical pattern is not a map of

44:07.440 --> 44:12.160
this animal. It's a map of this animal. So in an important sense, it's a counterfactual memory.

44:12.160 --> 44:17.920
It's a memory of what... It's a representation of what I will do in the future if I happen to be

44:17.920 --> 44:23.360
injured. So maybe this is an evolutionary precursor of that amazing mental time travel

44:23.680 --> 44:27.920
that the brains allow us to do, which is to imagine or remember things that are not true

44:27.920 --> 44:31.280
right now, things that happened in the past or things that are going to happen in the future.

44:31.280 --> 44:36.640
This is the... Perhaps this is the ancient somatic equivalent of that process. So a single

44:36.640 --> 44:42.000
planarian body can store at least one of two different memories of what a correct planarian

44:42.000 --> 44:46.800
should look like. So it's reprogrammable in an important sense, just like learning in the brain

44:46.800 --> 44:52.640
and just like our computer technology, the same hardware can store different types of information.

44:52.640 --> 44:58.960
And why do I keep calling it a memory? Because if we take these two-headed animals and we cut off

44:58.960 --> 45:04.560
the primary head and we cut off this secondary head with no more manipulation, you might think

45:04.560 --> 45:07.600
that, well, the genetics are untouched. You didn't edit the genome. There's nothing wrong with the

45:07.600 --> 45:13.840
genetics. So if you get rid of this crazy secondary head, maybe the cells will just rebuild the normal

45:13.840 --> 45:18.640
planarian. But that's not at all what they do. If you cut them again, they will continue to make

45:18.640 --> 45:26.640
two heads in perpetuity. And this has all the properties of memory. It's long-term stable.

45:26.640 --> 45:30.640
It's rewritable because we can shift back and forth. We know how to make two heads from one and we

45:30.640 --> 45:34.960
can actually take these two-headed guys and put them back to being one-headed. It has conditional

45:34.960 --> 45:39.600
recall, meaning it can store the memory until it actually gets injured. And it has two discrete

45:39.600 --> 45:44.160
possible behaviors. And here you can see this video. You can see what these two-headed animals

45:44.960 --> 45:51.840
are like. And the first two-headed planaria were reported in the early 1900s.

45:53.360 --> 46:00.240
But it wasn't until 2008 that my student Larissa Bosniak first, I had asked her to

46:00.240 --> 46:05.200
recut these things. Nobody ever recut them, to my knowledge, because it was assumed that

46:05.200 --> 46:08.560
once you get rid of that extra structure, the genetics are normal. Of course, it should go

46:08.560 --> 46:16.400
back to normal, which it was assumed. So it's really critical to think in broader directions

46:16.400 --> 46:24.720
that uncover these novel capabilities of tissues. And what we're doing now is all kinds of

46:25.440 --> 46:30.400
computational modeling to try to merge what we know about the bioelectric state of the circuit

46:30.400 --> 46:36.240
here, where it has these attractors, one head, two head, and so on, with what connectionist

46:37.200 --> 46:42.000
machine learning is telling us about ways in which network can store information and can

46:42.000 --> 46:47.680
recover the entire information from partial or damaged pieces. And so I think there's a great

46:47.680 --> 46:53.840
unification to be done here. And this paper talks about that. But it is not just about

46:54.560 --> 47:02.000
head number. It's also about head shape. So the amazing thing is that if I take this triangular

47:02.000 --> 47:06.400
shape planarian, cut off his head, perturb the electrical pattern in a particular way,

47:06.400 --> 47:11.200
let them then take the reagent away, let them settle down. Sometimes they settle back to a nice

47:11.200 --> 47:16.080
triangular shape like they should, or they sometimes give you a round head like this S.

47:16.080 --> 47:24.560
Mediterranean or a flathead like this Pifolina. And so these animals are about 150 to 100 million

47:24.560 --> 47:30.640
years in evolutionary distance. And not only does the head shape change, but all the internal

47:30.640 --> 47:35.120
components, the stem cells, the shape of the brain become just like these other species.

47:35.120 --> 47:40.880
So you can ask this hardware to visit attractors in that morpho space that typically belong to

47:40.880 --> 47:46.080
other species, these species go there by default. But this species can be pushed to navigate space

47:46.080 --> 47:51.200
in that way, if the navigation policies which are encoded by the bioelectrics are changed

47:51.840 --> 47:54.800
in the right way. So the hardware is perfectly willing to visit these other

47:55.440 --> 48:03.840
these other attractors. In fact, you can go and visit shapes that don't look like plenary at all.

48:03.840 --> 48:08.240
So you can make this crazy spiky form, you can make the cylindrical things, you can make the

48:08.240 --> 48:15.760
sort of hybrids. It's what Darcy Thompson was talking about in his classic, where he showed

48:15.760 --> 48:21.120
these kind of deformations, that nowadays you would call it a kind of a latent morpho space

48:21.120 --> 48:26.640
of possible shapes and have real real animals be the result of deformations of a coordinate

48:26.640 --> 48:31.040
grid. And there are all these other possibilities besides the standard default that we see all the

48:31.040 --> 48:35.920
time. So, of course, what we're what we're trying to do is put together a full stack

48:35.920 --> 48:41.120
computational model that goes from the molecular biology of which channels and pumps are expressed

48:41.120 --> 48:47.440
to the tissue level electrophysiology and all the voltage patterns to the organ level

48:47.440 --> 48:54.080
stable patterns that eventually can be interpreted by humans and by AI as an algorithm

48:54.080 --> 48:57.760
about what every piece is going to build. And here's where you want to do your interventions.

48:57.760 --> 49:02.400
It's very hard to do them down here, not methodologically, of course, but conceptually

49:02.400 --> 49:06.560
it's hard to know what to do. But up here, it starts to get very obvious. And so we're trying to

49:06.560 --> 49:10.960
forge that, forge that thing, because we have we have simulators of bioelectrics and so on.

49:11.440 --> 49:18.080
So the last story, I want to tell you about kind of this this this part of the talk has to do with

49:18.080 --> 49:21.760
how this is going to play out on regenerative medicine. So here's a here's an example.

49:22.480 --> 49:27.360
This is a typical tadpole brain, and you can see very nice forebrain midbrain and hindbrain

49:27.360 --> 49:33.040
left and right halves. And there are a variety of of defects you can induce with the teratogens

49:33.040 --> 49:37.680
such as nicotine and alcohol and mutations and so on that really wreck this the structure.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.840
So here, the forebrain is basically gone, the the eyes are connected directly to the to the

49:41.840 --> 49:47.360
midbrain real really problematic. And so, so we wanted to develop a proof of concept of using

49:47.360 --> 49:52.400
what we've learned about the bioelectrics here, to, to repair this to find interventions that

49:52.400 --> 49:56.880
repair these very complex birth defects, we don't have a hope of talking to each individual cell

49:56.880 --> 50:01.200
and controlling where all the stem cells go and what the pattern is. And I don't think in our

50:01.200 --> 50:05.920
lifetime, that's that's going to happen. But we thought, could we, could we find high level

50:06.000 --> 50:11.200
controls that let us leverage the competencies of these of the system. So what we did was, was,

50:11.840 --> 50:17.440
and this is the work of Alexis Pytak with Viapof Pi in the lab. And so what they did was create

50:18.560 --> 50:24.160
she made a computer model of what the bioelectric pattern normally should be and how it gets altered

50:24.160 --> 50:29.280
by these various treatments. And then Pi was able to do the biology and do the following

50:29.280 --> 50:35.200
thing to ask the model, if the pattern is incorrect, what channels would I need to open

50:35.200 --> 50:39.760
or close to make the bioelectric pattern? Correct. Not going to worry about what happens downstream,

50:39.760 --> 50:43.280
not going to worry about whatever the gene expressions are that are induced by this,

50:43.280 --> 50:48.560
but how do I fix the bioelectric pattern? So what I'm showing you here is perhaps the most

50:49.520 --> 50:53.120
kind of the most amazing example, which is never mind the chemical

50:53.760 --> 50:58.160
teratogens. Let's let's look at a mutation. So this is a mutation in a gene called notch

50:58.160 --> 51:02.320
introduced into it's a dominant active mutation introduced into these animals.

51:02.400 --> 51:06.960
Their brains are completely wrecked as a result of this. It's a very important neurogenesis gene.

51:06.960 --> 51:10.400
Forebrain is gone, midbrain and hindbrain are a bubble. These animals lay there,

51:10.400 --> 51:15.680
no behavior, you know, which is just profound, profoundly defective. And so the model said

51:15.680 --> 51:19.600
something very interesting. It said there's this, there's this HCN2 channel, which kind of has this

51:19.600 --> 51:25.760
special property. And what it will do is it's predicted to sharpen gradient. So it's like a,

51:25.760 --> 51:30.880
like a sharpen filter in Photoshop. It basically, it basically makes makes very sharp

51:30.880 --> 51:34.640
bioelectrical boundaries between compartments that are not differing by enough voltage.

51:35.200 --> 51:40.560
And so what we did was find out that whether by expressing more of this channel or by drugs,

51:40.560 --> 51:46.240
in fact, to already approved human antiepileptics that opened up this channel, the model predicted

51:46.240 --> 51:51.680
that that would fix it. And it was kind of an amazing, a shocking prediction. We tried it.

51:51.680 --> 51:58.320
And sure enough, incredibly, incredibly enough, even though this animal has the mutation,

51:58.320 --> 52:02.080
the brain is normal, the gene expression is normal, and their learning rates are

52:02.640 --> 52:08.720
indistinguishable from controls. And so I'm not claiming that all genetic defects are going to

52:08.720 --> 52:12.000
be fixable this way. There will be many things like missing enzymes and things like that that

52:12.000 --> 52:17.920
are not going to be fixable this way. But at least some hard hardware defects, I mean, this is an

52:17.920 --> 52:23.920
actual mutation in a signaling pathway, some hardware defects can be repaired in software by

52:24.000 --> 52:30.080
transient stimulation of a drug that was chosen by a computer model. So we've gone from the very

52:30.080 --> 52:35.120
initial early work in, let's say around 2000, where we were just probing the space of possibilities,

52:35.120 --> 52:40.720
you know, what does the, what did the bioelectrics control down to now to the point where we are

52:40.720 --> 52:48.240
in already in 2018, we're able to use a computer model to pick a drug for a very complex vertebrate

52:48.240 --> 52:56.160
birth defect and repair it. And so the way that the therapeutics is going to look is basically

52:56.160 --> 52:59.520
like this. And there's already, you can sort of play around with an early version of it here.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.800
You'll pick some tissues that you're interested in. And what we need is to know the correct

53:06.800 --> 53:10.800
bioelectric state of that organ or tissue, and then you'll know what the incorrect state is.

53:10.800 --> 53:14.000
And then there's going to be a computational platform that's going to

53:14.960 --> 53:20.480
electraceutical design environment that stands for it. And what it's going to do is help you

53:20.480 --> 53:25.680
choose correct channels that will need to be open or closed to correct the pattern.

53:25.680 --> 53:29.600
And from there, it's very simple to find drugs that will target that channel. And so

53:31.200 --> 53:38.560
that's how this is going to work. And so kind of the last thing I want to say about this

53:39.280 --> 53:45.600
part of the talk is that if we think about the whole space of biomedical interventions,

53:46.320 --> 53:53.600
the vast majority of efforts today go under this bottom up category. So the hardware repairs,

53:53.600 --> 53:59.760
surgery, transplants, stem cell implants, genomic editing, rewiring gene regulatory networks,

53:59.760 --> 54:06.640
and so on. All of these things are focused on the hardware. And we all know some of the deficiencies

54:06.640 --> 54:11.360
and limitations. So we have very few things, very few treatments that actually fix anything.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.960
Many things, once you stop taking the drug, everything goes right back or actually gets

54:14.960 --> 54:21.280
worse because it was targeted at the symptoms. It wasn't actually fixing the fundamental issue.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.880
And of course, we have great variability across patients. We have lots of side effects.

54:26.880 --> 54:32.320
And this is to be expected when trying to control a complex system bottom up.

54:33.280 --> 54:38.400
But there are complementary techniques that we can use having to do with, first of all,

54:38.400 --> 54:42.720
I don't have time to talk about any of this, but there's lots of interesting applications in

54:42.720 --> 54:47.520
actually training cells and tissues and in fact, molecular networks. So using stimuli,

54:47.520 --> 54:52.880
rewards and punishments and so on to make long term lasting changes by exploiting the memory

54:52.880 --> 54:59.360
capacity of all of these levels. And of course, what we've been talking about now, which is the

54:59.360 --> 55:04.960
whole field of morphosuiticals, which has within it ways to target the decision making machinery,

55:04.960 --> 55:11.040
the morphogenetic machinery that uses mechanical, chemical, and of course, electrical modalities.

55:11.040 --> 55:15.680
And so this is all the electrosuiticals are done here with ion channeled drugs and optogenetics

55:15.680 --> 55:23.440
and so on. And lots more is discussed here. And I think just to speculate a little bit,

55:23.440 --> 55:29.120
I think that future medicine is going to look a lot less like chemistry and a lot more like

55:29.120 --> 55:35.920
a kind of somatic psychiatry, where you're going to take very seriously the memories, the preferences,

55:35.920 --> 55:42.400
the competencies of the body cells, tissues, and organs and try to leverage those competencies by

55:43.120 --> 55:47.840
not trying to micromanage their behavior, but trying to give them signals. And so bio electricity

55:47.840 --> 55:55.760
is a really critical interface that normally mediates between high level cognitive information

55:55.760 --> 56:00.960
down to molecular properties. And if that sounds weird to you, just think about how you get up

56:00.960 --> 56:04.720
out of bed in the morning when you when you wake up and you decide that you need to go to bed,

56:05.360 --> 56:10.560
that you need to get out of bed rather and go to work. What's happening here is that your high

56:10.560 --> 56:15.760
level cognitive intent that that knows what work is and all the consequences of doing it or not

56:15.760 --> 56:22.000
doing it, all of that has to has to filter down to the molecular events at your at your muscle

56:22.000 --> 56:27.440
cells to enable you to get up out of bed. So your cognitive intent of wanting to do something

56:27.440 --> 56:32.960
changes the way that molecules interact in your muscles. And so all of that, that that

56:32.960 --> 56:39.440
transduction from cognition to molecular biology is done by by electrics, all of that is electrical.

56:39.440 --> 56:44.320
And I think we can hack this for the rest of the body for some really transformative health

56:44.320 --> 56:49.600
applications. So the last thing I want to do just for a couple of minutes is to broaden out a little

56:49.600 --> 56:56.560
bit into into two other quick, quick mentions. One is this idea of let's just talk about cancer

56:56.560 --> 57:02.800
for a second. So, so this is what this is what we're made of and what evolution individual cells.

57:02.800 --> 57:09.600
And so what evolution has has given us is some hardware that allows cells which normally work

57:09.600 --> 57:14.800
on little tiny goals. So so so little tiny metabolic and proliferative goals of single cells

57:14.800 --> 57:19.680
to a very grandiose large scale morphogenetic goals, like we're going to work together to build

57:19.680 --> 57:25.680
this limb. And if that's inhibited, temporarily, then we're going to do it again and then build

57:25.680 --> 57:29.600
it again. So these are very high level goals that these cells are going after. But that process

57:29.600 --> 57:34.240
can break down. And when that process breaks down, this is what we call cancer. So these are human

57:34.240 --> 57:41.040
glioblastoma cells. And what happens is that if you dissociate cells electrically from each other,

57:41.040 --> 57:47.520
they will basically revert back to their unicellular past, they will act like amoebas. And at that

57:47.520 --> 57:52.240
point, the rest of the animals just the rest of the body is just external environment to them.

57:52.240 --> 57:57.520
So they're not any more selfish than somatic cells, it's just that their cells are smaller. So the

57:57.520 --> 58:02.160
boundary between self and world here, the boundaries out here, it's huge to say, you know, this this

58:02.160 --> 58:07.920
whole thing acts as a unit to achieve a particular morphogenetic trajectory. But but once you disconnect

58:07.920 --> 58:13.440
the cells, they don't do that anymore. Now now all the all they all they have is little tiny goals

58:13.440 --> 58:18.640
that stop at the roughly at the cell surface. So so one. So now that's kind of a weird way of

58:18.640 --> 58:23.360
thinking about things. But as always, it has practical consequences, which is that, if you

58:23.360 --> 58:29.360
think this way, then then you might take take this hypothesis that if we put human oncogenes into

58:29.360 --> 58:33.680
this tadpole, we know it's going to make a tumor. But what we'll do, we're not going to kill those

58:33.680 --> 58:38.480
cells with chemotherapy. And we're not going to try to fix the mutation. What we're going to do is

58:38.480 --> 58:42.800
simply force them to remain bio electrically connected to their neighbors, even though

58:42.800 --> 58:48.160
they have the mutation. And so we've done this now with with with glee and with with nasty

58:49.440 --> 58:55.440
k-rass mutations. Here it's the the oncogene is marked in red. You can see that there's this tumor

58:56.240 --> 59:02.800
here. There's this very, very strong low expression of this oncogene. In fact, it's all over the place

59:02.800 --> 59:07.040
in the body, but there is no tumor here. This is the same animal. Because even though the oncogene is

59:07.040 --> 59:11.600
blazingly strongly expressed, if the cells are electrically connected to the rest of them, what

59:11.600 --> 59:17.760
they do is participate in normal organogenesis, not not crawl around and metastasize. So this is

59:17.760 --> 59:22.400
this is a way of taking some of these ideas about the the shifting boundary between self and world

59:22.400 --> 59:27.280
and put it into a practical application. And of course, we're pursuing this now in

59:27.600 --> 59:32.720
in in human glioblastoma and some other things. Okay, the very last I'm just going to take

59:33.440 --> 59:39.280
about four or five minutes here just to give you a kind of a last piece. And I have to do

59:39.280 --> 59:44.240
another disclosure here of fauna systems is a company that Josh Bond guard and I have started

59:44.240 --> 59:50.480
around computer designed by robotics. And the idea was this. I've tried to I've tried to make the

59:50.480 --> 59:56.960
point that morphogenesis is a navigation of anatomical space by a kind of system that

59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.280
remembers where it's going and has certain navigation policies and it has certain capabilities

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:07.680
of getting there despite some number of things that can happen to it. But if we if we ask the

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.880
question in a in a typical animal, where where do those memories come from? In other words,

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.640
what determines the the shape of that space? And the and fundamentally the anatomy of the

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.280
and the and the the behavior of that animal? Typically, the answer is, well, evolution. So

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.280
so years of selection have shaped that space. And now and now this is the you know, this is

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.520
the morphology that that survives in the real world. And so what we wanted to ask this question

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:40.960
about plasticity, we said, if if we take these cells with a standard genome, and give them a

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.320
chance to reboot their multicellularity, what will they build? Like, what is the what is the

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.240
structure of the of the morpho space for creatures that have never existed before? And so this is

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.400
where synthetic biology or better yet, synthetic morphology comes in, because we can make some

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.720
creatures that have never been here on earth in that in that particular embodiment. And we can

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:07.440
ask what do their shapes look like? So here's a here's an example. What happens is we take a frog

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.440
embryo. And this is all the biology here is work at the work of Doug Blackiston. And this is a

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.120
collaboration with Josh Bongard's lab. And Sam Creedman was a student who did a lot of the

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.400
computational work. What happens is we can we can take off some of the dermal skin cells from

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.480
the embryo, and we we dissociate them and we put them aside in this in this set set them aside.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.120
And they can do many things they could they could die, they could spread out and leave, you know,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.520
go away from each other, they could form a two dimensional flat monolayer like a cell culture.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.880
What they do instead is they actually they get together and this is time lapse they get together

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.080
and they make something very interesting, which looks like this. And the flashing is calcium

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:54.880
signaling. So what they make is something we call a xenobot. Why xenobot is why xenobot xenopus

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.680
lavis is the name of the frog. I think it's a biorebotics platform. So that's why it's a it's a

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:07.200
xenobot. First of all, they swim, and they use little hairs on their cell surface on their

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.920
outer surface called cilia. These are normally used by the frog to move mucus down the body

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.800
down its body to keep the pathogens away. But they're using it to swim they can go in circles,

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.120
they can sort of patrol back and forth like this, they can have all kinds of interesting

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.920
collective and group behaviors that you can see some tracking data here. They change their

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.440
movements as a function of time, they sort of wander around doing various things. Here's one

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.480
doing a maze. So you can see here it swims forward, it's going to take this corner without bumping

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.400
into the opposite wall. So it doesn't just go straight until it hits something, it can take

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.480
that corner. And here it shows some some kind of primitive initiative and spontaneously turning

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.360
around and going back where it came from. So these are not these are not stimulated, these are not

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.600
actuated by us in any way unlike some of the current biorebotics that exist that completely

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:04.240
completely spontaneous. They have if we if we track the calcium signaling like we did in that

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:10.880
zebrafish like that other lab did in that zebrafish that I showed you earlier, you can see that

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.400
they're very active, there's no neurons in here. But the it's just skin but the skin cells are

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:22.480
very active and we are now applying all sorts of information theory tools to ask if we can

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.720
decode what the cells are saying to each other, what two xenobots might be saying to each other

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:34.480
and so on. They regenerate so if you cut it almost in half, it'll seal up like this. So from here

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:43.520
they will seal themselves and perhaps the most amazing thing we discovered by the simulations

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:51.360
that Sam and Josh did was that in their movements they tend to they tend to have a very peculiar

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.480
effect on on their environment and so so you know they built this amazing simulator where we could

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.440
Doug could actually build various types of xenobots corresponding to shapes that that the

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:08.480
that the AI was suggesting. And what we found is this if you give them loose skin cells in their

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.600
environment what they do is they implement von Neumann's dream which is a robot that would go

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:20.320
out and build copies of itself from materials that found in the environment because we've

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.040
made it impossible for these guys to reproduce themselves. They're just skin, they don't have

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.600
all the other organs you need for frog style reproduction but within a couple of days they

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.200
figure out a new way to make copies of themselves and so what they do is they by their movements

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.240
they collect these skin cells into a little ball and they sort of polish and compact the ball

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.600
and because they're working with a in a gentle material like us we we were only able to make

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.000
xenobots because we were working with with skin cells that have certain competencies

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.080
they have the same advantage and so because it's an agential material they make the next

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.440
generation of bots and when these xenobots mature guess what they do they run around and they

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.840
do exactly the same thing and that gives you the next generation of bots and the next generation.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.520
So this is kinematic self-replication to our knowledge doesn't no other organism on earth does

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.840
this brand new brand new kind of thing and so and so this brings us kind of to almost the end

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:22.720
of the story where one thing you can ask is what did the frog genome learn through all all these

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.040
you know so eons of evolution well it's certainly learned to make a frog and it learned this

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.240
developmental sequence that leads through this stereotypical stages and then some tadpoles with

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:37.520
behavior that's not the only thing it makes it can also make xenobots with a completely

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.080
different developmental sequence this is this is a couple month old xenobot and no idea what

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.600
this thing's trying to become and they have different behaviors including kinematic self

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:51.600
replication that that has never existed before so we don't know by the way what their behavioral

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.400
repertoires are like do they can they learn what do they have preferences all of that is currently

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.000
under active investigation but at least in the case of the morphology we can say a few things we

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.640
can say that there have never been any xenobots there's never been selection to be a good xenobot

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:14.320
so this whole lifestyle and capabilities and everything else cannot be straightforward you

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:19.280
you can't tell a straightforward selectionist story about it where does it come from that's

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:26.720
an interesting thing we can we can discuss and what it looks to me like from this and many other

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.600
experiments is that evolution doesn't give you just solutions to specific problems what evolution

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.400
makes it's problem solving machines and under default environments they always produce the

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:43.920
same outcome and it's sort of the development sort of lulls us into a false sense of we understand

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:50.160
what the system can do and evolution gives us an easy way to to sort of to explain why we see what

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.280
we see but there's actually a lot more plasticity and capability that doesn't appear until you probe

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.320
the intelligence of the system by putting it in a new environment where it has to do new things

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.360
and in particular we didn't engineer this by changing the genome we didn't put in any new

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.760
circuits the DNA is exactly the same we didn't put any weird nanomaterials the only thing we did

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:16.320
is liberate these cells from the rest of the embryo that normally basically

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.480
force them into having a kind of boring two-dimensional life on the outside of the organism

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.120
keeping out the bacteria that's it when you take them away from it's in this case it's

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.360
engineering by subtraction by liberation when we take these cells away from these other

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.680
instructive signals then you find out what their baseline preference is their baseline

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.000
is this to have a much more exciting life as a xenobot and so I'm sure there are many many

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.680
of these things out there in in the world that we simply don't know about yet and so

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.320
what I think the xenobot really is I mean yes it's a biorebotics platform and there will be

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.200
useful synthetic living machines and and so on but what I think it really is and the xenobot

01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:00.160
isn't just you know to be clear the xenobot isn't just this thing the xenobot is this thing plus

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:06.720
the AI that was used to to to investigate it the human engineers that that prompted these cells

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:13.280
to do this that whole thing is is really the xenobot and what it really is is an unusual

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:20.720
novel tool it's an exploration tool for probing these these these morpheus spaces these other

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.120
latent spaces that we're not very good at at noticing and and what I think is that

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.520
when darwin said endless forms most beautiful he was I'm kind of amazed at all the diversity of life

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.920
all of that natural life is this tiny little corner of morpheus space that's formed by the

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.160
space of possible bodies and minds that's formed by every possible combination of evolved material

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:50.960
cells dna tissues designed material and smart materials implants and all that and software

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:56.400
life is incredibly interoperable and every combination of of these three things is probably

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.000
going to be some kind of viable being that's uh yeah hybrids and cyborgs and and some of these

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.080
all already exist of course and many more will and you know for the for the younger people in

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.280
the audience in your lifetime you are going to be surrounded by other agents that are nowhere

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:15.280
on the tree of life with you you cannot decide how to relate to them based on where they are on

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.480
the standard n equals one tree of life on earth so so we are going to have to this I think is

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:26.000
really critical now the xenobots are just the first kind of a small step in this direction

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.280
we are going to have to develop a new kind of ethics for relating to truly diverse intelligences

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:37.680
that don't look like you they don't share uh they don't share um uh our our our evolutionary history

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:43.760
and uh you know uh a different a different way to relate to beings not based on uh what do you

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.280
look like what are you made of and how did you get here meaning evolved versus engineer so um

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.600
I just I'll summarize the whole thing by saying that I think one of the most interesting things

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.720
in biology is that um all of all intelligence is collective intelligence functioning through this

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:04.320
multi-scale competency architecture that navigates various virtual spaces um this kind of goal

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:10.400
directedness the cybernetic kind not the not the mystical kind is uh really an invariant for

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:17.360
recognizing building and relating to very unconventional agents and and there's a lot more

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.920
about this this this cognitive boundary that we can talk about and the collective intelligence

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.200
of cells is really an excellent target for regenerative medicine and also as an example

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:32.400
of why this kind of approach it's not philosophy and it's not metaphors it's it's something that

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.440
that actively on a on a you know every year it generates novel discoveries and new capabilities

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.800
that we didn't have before and um just that that that's that that exploring these spaces provides

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.400
an astronomically large uh possibility for new bodies and new minds which has huge implications

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.680
not just for um biomedicine and robotics but understanding evolution understanding ourselves

01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:00.400
ethics so um if anybody's interested in going deeper um lots of these papers uh have discussed

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.200
this stuff in in great detail i want to thank um the students and postdocs we did um we did all the

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:13.440
work uh lots of lots of technical support um some of our amazing collaborators uh our funders um here

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:19.440
Jeremy Gay of Peregrine Creative does all the illustrations um and uh most of all uh the various

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:25.040
model systems because the animals do um all the heavy lifting so um i will thank you uh for listening

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.280
and take questions

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.800
thank you dr love that was fantastic um and i want to thank you on behalf of the society and the

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.880
students and uh guests who are um joining us today to listen um and i thank you for taking

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:49.280
just a couple extra minutes to answer a few questions um i'm going to paraphrase uh some

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:57.440
that came in on the q and a forum um one there's often a concern when there's new breakthroughs in

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.640
medicine that the new treatments are only going to be available to the rich that there's going to

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.760
be an inequity problem um and i'm kind of intuiting what the answer is going to be but uh is there a

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:16.640
potential here to have a solution that can be more um widely adapted because of the form that it takes

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:23.520
yeah yeah there is i mean i i'll i'll say first that i'm not an expert in the economics of medicine

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.320
as far as i understand uh we have an inequity problem with water and so you know it doesn't

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.680
have to be some fancy therapeutics before you get into an inequity problem so so that that's all

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.400
that's the you know kind of baseline um but with this with this specific set of manipulations

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:45.600
yeah i actually think it has an extremely favorable um equity profile because um we are we are

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.720
explicitly not doing the thing that's done now which is heroic interventions at the very end

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.440
of life to try to prolong basically a sinking ship and and that and what that means is that the input

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:02.080
to the next stage is is is way more um you know sort of uh degraded and that means the next step

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.200
has to be more expensive and heroic what we are saying is maybe there's a way to trigger regeneration

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.320
like in planaria or like in salamanders and uh and do it uh at the whole you know during during the

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:18.160
whole uh life life of the of the individual i'm increasing the health span and in particular

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:24.400
just about everything we do is uh can be done with very cheap ion channel drugs so these are

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.160
many of them already human approved most of them are are off-patent this is uh as far as

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.880
interventions go this is this is uh this is the delivery is going to be very cheap what's super

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.960
expensive right now is uh the r&d right so so so building all the equipment building all that

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.800
and i mean none of this existed before all the software everything else everything has to be built

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.120
once we crack this i mean i call this cracking the the morphogenetic code once we crack this

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:57.360
the actual treatments are going to be way cheaper than anything we've seen fantastic um and uh just

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.680
maybe quickly this one question because i think it's going to be on the minds of many people

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:09.440
we have um you know a common intuitive ends that a lot of our minds go when we think about

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.720
intelligence in other ways beyond the standard that we imagine that we have and that is you know

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:26.560
creating intelligence in silicon as opposed to in our biology and and the question is

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.000
what is is there something that limits the ability of taking our understanding of the

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.560
hardware software relationship that you're uncovering and transferring essentially ourselves

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:49.280
into our our goals our memories into the silicon space yeah um are you are you asking about uh

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.600
creating novel uh novel agents in silicon or are you asking uh what happened are you talking about

01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.720
the idea of of taking an existing person and implementing them and is that that ladder thing

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:06.320
it's the second that was the question essentially prolonging your um your mind's existence in a

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:14.640
computer yeah well look uh i mean this this is really an old philosophical thing let imagine

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.760
imagine for a minute that um uh that uh this the the whole uh you know kind of star trek

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.520
transporter thing was solved and they would basically say well we're just gonna we're

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.040
going to record a copy of you when you're when we're going to record you when you're young

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.760
and then when you get old uh we're just gonna you know beam down a copy and and he'll be you

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.160
know you'll be young again and all great so okay there's there's a couple of ways to think about

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:43.360
this one way to think about it will be uh well fantastic uh there's gonna be a young me running

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.400
around on earth like great they'll bring it on another way of thinking is okay you're basically

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.080
gonna make a time shift a twin and that's great but i'm still here aging and dying that's what

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.360
what good does it do me uh you know what what good do the copies do me so i think that it's it's not

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.080
an issue of technology it's an issue of what do we really what do we really value and the question

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.040
is if if there is a you know you you you i mean i don't think the technology is going to be remotely

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:15.040
there in in our relevant uh time frame to to make a copy of us in any way but but let's say you could

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.640
i mean ultimately i don't see why it's impossible but but we're we're not able to do it for a long

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.320
time uh but if you know that you flip the computer on and he says oh fantastic it's it's great in here

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.120
and you say yeah well good good for you i guess but what do i do so i'm not sure that that actually

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:35.680
solves the problem but it's fun to think about fair point and and that's all the time of yours

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.120
that we're going to take i know that you have another engagement that you need to be getting to

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.720
but if everyone you know in your own private corner of the universe will have joined me in

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:50.960
giving dr levin a round of applause thank you so much thank you so much really appreciate it and

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.040
anybody that's interested drop me an email i saw a couple other questions i haven't gotten to so

01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.400
anybody that wants to know anything drop me an email thank you so much for that all right thank

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.160
you everybody for joining us and thank you dr levin again thank you so much dr levin and thank

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:19.280
you so much dr chesna for being here bye everybody
