0	6140	It's strange how we seem to know everything and nothing about our brain.
6140	11600	We know it's billions of neurons connected together forming trillions of electrical circuits,
11600	18480	endlessly firing in patterns that somehow define us, but how exactly we don't know.
18480	22640	People have tried to explain the brain by breaking it into different regions, performing
22640	28840	different functions, memory here, planning here, perception here, but recent neuroscience
28840	33440	has revealed that brain functions don't exist in separate regions, but as an interplay
33440	39360	of many regions, and this is too complex to reverse engineer, because the brain was not
39360	42520	engineered the way a human would have made it.
42520	45480	The brain evolved.
45480	49080	To create what we call intelligence.
49080	53920	The modern boom in artificial intelligence has forced us to confront the question, what
53920	57680	makes human intelligence so special?
57680	62520	A recent book, A Brief History of Intelligence, takes an evolutionary view based on the most
62520	64160	modern research.
64160	70320	It follows the evolution of intelligence through five key leaps in learning ability.
70320	74280	So let's go back in time to the beginning.
74280	78560	Before brains, there was a simpler brain fabric, called a nerve net, which we see in the first
78560	80360	multicellular animals.
80360	85440	It allowed them to both sense and react to their world, enabling simple behavior such
85440	89720	as grasping at the presence of food.
89720	94920	This sets up our first breakthrough, which is the ability to navigate towards food.
94920	99080	There's a significant milestone with the emergence of our ancestors that resemble the
99080	105160	tiny worm, with a simple brain consisting of only 302 neurons.
105160	110080	And they had a primitive smell, defined by small clusters of neurons within the brain,
110080	115160	each able to detect different chemicals in the environment.
115160	119520	And their brains applied a simple rule for finding food.
119520	122760	If the concentration of a good thing increases, keep going forward.
122760	125240	If it decreases, then change direction.
125240	130520	However, these animals couldn't learn new behavior within their lifetimes.
130520	134800	Their brain circuits were genetically encoded and fixed in life.
134800	139560	This is a limitation that life forms would overcome with a new learning mechanism based
139560	141160	on experience.
141160	146000	This leads to our next breakthrough, learning from trial and error.
146000	151200	We see this evolutionary leap during the Cambrian explosion around 540 million years
151200	152520	ago.
152520	157880	This was a period of time marked by an explosion of new life forms, including another distant
157880	162600	ancestor resembling a primitive fish.
162600	168920	They evolve new neural circuits capable of adjusting behavior based on outcomes.
169200	174960	In order to learn from experience, you must have both a learnable sense and learnable
174960	175960	behavior.
175960	178160	So let's start with sense.
178160	182920	These animals develop a new brain layer that acts as an interface with the world known
182920	185800	as the cortex.
185800	192000	It receives input from all sensory organs, eyes, ears, smell, touch, and processes these
192000	198160	inputs into patterns of neuron activations within its deeper layers.
198160	203880	This enables the cortex to associate patterns with specific things in the world, such as
203880	206480	new sources of food or danger.
206480	213200	Unlike what we saw before where one neuron corresponds to one specific thing, this evolutionary
213200	220240	leap allows a pattern of neuron activations to represent different things in the world.
220240	225600	This is what allows fish to recognize new objects so effectively, including complex
225600	231280	patterns they would not have evolved to recognize, such as human faces.
231280	236040	To demonstrate this power, researchers did an experiment where they taught fish to spit
236040	242320	water at pictures of specific human faces to get rewards.
242320	246760	And they were quite good at this even if the faces were rotated.
246760	251440	So now let's turn to how behavior can be learned alongside sense.
251440	260960	To control behavior, the neurons which represent perceptions in the cortex connect to newly
260960	264080	evolved dopamine neurons.
264080	266120	Now here's the key.
266120	270960	Whenever dopamine signals increase, it makes the most recent behavior that the animal did
270960	273040	more likely to occur.
273040	277600	And when dopamine decreases, it inhibits the most recent behavior.
277600	279920	A well-known experiment was led by Schultz.
279920	285120	He showed the monkey's different cues, such as pictures of shapes, five seconds before
285120	288680	presenting the reward of sugar water.
288680	293400	First they observed that the monkey's dopamine neurons fired in response to newly presented
293400	299400	unexpected sugar water, but not when the shape was presented prior.
299400	305000	After a few repeated trials, they noticed the dopamine neurons began firing immediately
305000	310520	after the shape was presented and not when the sugar water was given.
310520	316560	So the dopamine response shifted to the earliest known expectation of the reward.
316560	322360	This made it clear that dopamine was not a signal for pleasure, but an increase in the
322360	326880	amount of expected future pleasure or reward.
326880	332000	But as we all know, unlearning is just as important as learning, which dopamine also
332000	333840	facilitates.
333840	339560	For example, they did more trials where they showed the shape but never presented the reward.
339560	345440	In these instances, the dopamine neurons showed a decrease in activity exactly when the reward
345440	347680	previously occurred.
347680	353960	This reduction in the dopamine firing rate can be interpreted as a form of negative feedback,
353960	358680	what we'd feel as dissatisfaction or disappointment.
358680	365880	And this ability to perform arbitrary sequence of actions based on rewards allowed animals
365880	371360	to better learn from their environment how to exploit rewards and avoid pain.
371360	375200	You can think of this process as intuition building.
375200	383960	However, this form of learning was limited to the experience of actual rewards and pain.
383960	388440	This leads us to our next breakthrough, simulation.
388440	394560	Now let's fast forward 400 million years to a world ruled by dinosaurs.
394560	398840	Alongside them was another ancestor, think of it as a primitive rodent.
398840	403960	While much smaller and weaker, these animals evolved something much more powerful than
403960	406240	simple trial and error learning.
406240	411840	They grew as simple imagination, something dinosaurs didn't have.
411840	415720	This required a new brain region called the neocortex.
415720	422600	The neocortex is amazing in that it can imagine possible futures, like mental movies which
422600	428440	activate the brain in the same way as if we actually experienced it.
428440	433880	And critically, those dopamine circuits can be triggered from these simulations in the
433880	440760	same way as direct experience, leveraging existing intuition circuits but applied to
440760	444920	imagined actions.
445040	449320	This allows animals to learn from mental trial and error.
449320	453800	For example, it was known for a long time that when rats were put in mazes, they would
453800	458720	often pause when they had a choice to make and look back and forth, pondering which way
458720	459720	to go.
459720	465040	It was only recently that David Reddish led an experiment where they recorded neuron activity
465040	468520	in rats while searching through mazes.
468520	474320	They found that when a rat stopped at a decision point and turned its head back and forth,
474320	478480	its brain was actually simulating going down each pathway.
478480	483440	The exact same neuron patterns were activated in the rat's mind when it walked down each
483440	486560	path and when it imagined walking down it.
486560	490680	And what you can see is a sequence running from the rat to the goal.
490680	495240	This ability to run mental simulations from your current internal state also improves
495240	497680	complex motor skills.
497680	503680	Compare this to animals which don't have a neocortex, such as lizards, since they don't
503760	509040	see their next step before they take it.
509040	514280	However in these early mammals, the simulation ability was still limited compared to our
514280	515880	own.
515880	522080	These mental movies were always from their first person perspective and based on their
522080	528240	direct experience, which leads to our next breakthrough.
528240	533880	Now we can fast forward to around 15 million years ago and our ancestors had evolved into
533880	536000	the first primates.
536000	541960	While most mammals live in solitary or small family-based groups, primates, such as chimpanzees,
541960	546080	live in tribes with dynamic social hierarchies.
546080	553080	Using empty kerosene cans to make his display more impressive, Mike rose from very low status
553440	557720	to the position of top ranking or alpha male.
557720	562600	All chimps must have the ability to know what others are thinking.
562600	567800	To do that, they must be able to break out of their first person perspective and think
567800	573600	from a third person perspective, what we call theory of mind, such as thinking about what
573600	577280	others are thinking or thinking about your own thinking.
577280	580280	Ollie is headed for a termite mound.
580280	584440	In her mouth, she carries two grass tools.
584440	591040	She has picked them even before sighting the mound, a demonstration of true forethought.
591040	597240	To do this, primates use a newly evolved brain region which grew out of the neocortex called
597240	603680	the granular prefrontal cortex, and it allows the brain to simulate things more generally.
603680	609320	For example, the primatologist Emile Menzel observed a female chimp named Belle, who came
609320	615440	up with strategies to try and trick another dominant male chimp from stealing food.
615440	621320	At first, Belle simply sat on top of a food source when she found it, until Rock realized
621320	624200	this and pushed her to get at the food.
624200	629040	In response, she came up with a new strategy where she would avoid new food locations at
629040	635000	first, waiting for Rock to look away and then immediately run towards it.
635000	639960	And once Rock figured that out, Belle began trying to lead Rock in the wrong direction,
639960	644720	walking away from food, and eventually Rock realized he should search for food in the
644720	647680	opposite direction that Belle was leading him.
647680	653200	And this process of ever escalating deceptions revealed that Belle and Rock were able to
653200	656840	understand what was going on in each other's minds.
656840	661420	And there have been many science experiments done to prove just this.
661420	665860	That primates can in fact understand what others hold in their mind, and how that might
665860	666860	change.
666860	673140	The key point for this breakthrough, though, is that primates can hold accumulated knowledge
673140	678540	that never originated in their mind, or their own personal experience.
678540	684100	The simplest example is watching someone get hurt, and men not getting hurt yourself.
684100	687780	Learning from their experience, not yours.
687780	693180	This form of imitation learning extends to learning more complex behaviors.
693180	699260	For example, we see chimps learn to use tools by first observing, and then mimicking their
699260	700260	parents.
700260	706500	These patterns may be passed from generation to generation by observational learning.
706500	710620	The chimpanzee has his own primitive culture.
710620	714180	And this sets up our final breakthrough, language.
714180	721180	In humans, we see a unique ability to communicate our imaginations with symbols we create.
721180	725820	And alongside the development of language was the development of writing.
725820	731160	And we can chain these symbols together in sequences of any length to represent thoughts
731160	734460	of any kind, or of any level of complexity.
734460	740460	And when reading or listening to language, we can see someone else's thoughts and simulate
740460	743740	those thoughts as if we had them too.
743740	750180	And this unleashed humans from the practical limitation of imitation learning.
750180	755220	Unlike chimps, which you could only learn by observing others' actual actions, we can
755220	759420	learn from other people's imagined actions.
759420	767580	And this allows knowledge to accumulate without action at all, just by observing symbols.
767580	774020	Learning is important because it allows those thoughts to accumulate outside living minds
774020	780060	and build up across generations, resulting in a technological explosion unlike anything
780060	782020	else in nature.
782020	788740	Language allowed thought to break free from the human mind completely.
788740	794900	So we've seen intelligence arise out of the evolution of progressively more complex sources
794900	801740	of learning, starting with your own actions, then your own imagined actions, and then other
801740	809060	people's actions, and finally learning from other people's imagined actions.
809060	816260	Recently, the field of AI has exploded due to large language models, like chatGPT, which
816260	821140	have learned to model human language by reading all the text in the world.
821140	826300	These systems take the exact opposite approach as that taken by evolution.
826300	833020	Human intelligence ended with language, while large language models begin with language.
833020	837780	They take the final output of human thought as their input.
837780	842100	This is the big debate in the field of AI, can artificial intelligence short circuit
842100	849180	the steps that human intelligence had to take and go straight to language, or will it need
849220	853340	to build up from more foundational experience?
853340	860900	And if so, what form does that experience need to take?
860900	865980	To put it simply, does your brain need your body?
