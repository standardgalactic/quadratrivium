1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
It's strange how we seem to know everything and nothing about our brain.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,600
We know it's billions of neurons connected together forming trillions of electrical circuits,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:18,480
endlessly firing in patterns that somehow define us, but how exactly we don't know.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
People have tried to explain the brain by breaking it into different regions, performing

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,840
different functions, memory here, planning here, perception here, but recent neuroscience

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,440
has revealed that brain functions don't exist in separate regions, but as an interplay

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,360
of many regions, and this is too complex to reverse engineer, because the brain was not

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,520
engineered the way a human would have made it.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,480
The brain evolved.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,080
To create what we call intelligence.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,920
The modern boom in artificial intelligence has forced us to confront the question, what

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,680
makes human intelligence so special?

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,520
A recent book, A Brief History of Intelligence, takes an evolutionary view based on the most

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,160
modern research.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,320
It follows the evolution of intelligence through five key leaps in learning ability.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,280
So let's go back in time to the beginning.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,560
Before brains, there was a simpler brain fabric, called a nerve net, which we see in the first

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,360
multicellular animals.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,440
It allowed them to both sense and react to their world, enabling simple behavior such

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,720
as grasping at the presence of food.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,920
This sets up our first breakthrough, which is the ability to navigate towards food.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,080
There's a significant milestone with the emergence of our ancestors that resemble the

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,160
tiny worm, with a simple brain consisting of only 302 neurons.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,080
And they had a primitive smell, defined by small clusters of neurons within the brain,

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,160
each able to detect different chemicals in the environment.

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,520
And their brains applied a simple rule for finding food.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,760
If the concentration of a good thing increases, keep going forward.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,240
If it decreases, then change direction.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,520
However, these animals couldn't learn new behavior within their lifetimes.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,800
Their brain circuits were genetically encoded and fixed in life.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,560
This is a limitation that life forms would overcome with a new learning mechanism based

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
on experience.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,000
This leads to our next breakthrough, learning from trial and error.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
We see this evolutionary leap during the Cambrian explosion around 540 million years

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,520
ago.

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,880
This was a period of time marked by an explosion of new life forms, including another distant

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,600
ancestor resembling a primitive fish.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,920
They evolve new neural circuits capable of adjusting behavior based on outcomes.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,960
In order to learn from experience, you must have both a learnable sense and learnable

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
behavior.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,160
So let's start with sense.

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,920
These animals develop a new brain layer that acts as an interface with the world known

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,800
as the cortex.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,000
It receives input from all sensory organs, eyes, ears, smell, touch, and processes these

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,160
inputs into patterns of neuron activations within its deeper layers.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,880
This enables the cortex to associate patterns with specific things in the world, such as

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,480
new sources of food or danger.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,200
Unlike what we saw before where one neuron corresponds to one specific thing, this evolutionary

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,240
leap allows a pattern of neuron activations to represent different things in the world.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,600
This is what allows fish to recognize new objects so effectively, including complex

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,280
patterns they would not have evolved to recognize, such as human faces.

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,040
To demonstrate this power, researchers did an experiment where they taught fish to spit

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,320
water at pictures of specific human faces to get rewards.

54
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,760
And they were quite good at this even if the faces were rotated.

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,440
So now let's turn to how behavior can be learned alongside sense.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:20,960
To control behavior, the neurons which represent perceptions in the cortex connect to newly

57
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,080
evolved dopamine neurons.

58
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,120
Now here's the key.

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,960
Whenever dopamine signals increase, it makes the most recent behavior that the animal did

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
more likely to occur.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
And when dopamine decreases, it inhibits the most recent behavior.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,920
A well-known experiment was led by Schultz.

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,120
He showed the monkey's different cues, such as pictures of shapes, five seconds before

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,680
presenting the reward of sugar water.

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,400
First they observed that the monkey's dopamine neurons fired in response to newly presented

66
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,400
unexpected sugar water, but not when the shape was presented prior.

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,000
After a few repeated trials, they noticed the dopamine neurons began firing immediately

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,520
after the shape was presented and not when the sugar water was given.

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,560
So the dopamine response shifted to the earliest known expectation of the reward.

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,360
This made it clear that dopamine was not a signal for pleasure, but an increase in the

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,880
amount of expected future pleasure or reward.

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,000
But as we all know, unlearning is just as important as learning, which dopamine also

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,840
facilitates.

74
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,560
For example, they did more trials where they showed the shape but never presented the reward.

75
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,440
In these instances, the dopamine neurons showed a decrease in activity exactly when the reward

76
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
previously occurred.

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,960
This reduction in the dopamine firing rate can be interpreted as a form of negative feedback,

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,680
what we'd feel as dissatisfaction or disappointment.

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,880
And this ability to perform arbitrary sequence of actions based on rewards allowed animals

80
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,360
to better learn from their environment how to exploit rewards and avoid pain.

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,200
You can think of this process as intuition building.

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:23,960
However, this form of learning was limited to the experience of actual rewards and pain.

83
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,440
This leads us to our next breakthrough, simulation.

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Now let's fast forward 400 million years to a world ruled by dinosaurs.

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,840
Alongside them was another ancestor, think of it as a primitive rodent.

86
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,960
While much smaller and weaker, these animals evolved something much more powerful than

87
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,240
simple trial and error learning.

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,840
They grew as simple imagination, something dinosaurs didn't have.

89
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,720
This required a new brain region called the neocortex.

90
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,600
The neocortex is amazing in that it can imagine possible futures, like mental movies which

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,440
activate the brain in the same way as if we actually experienced it.

92
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,880
And critically, those dopamine circuits can be triggered from these simulations in the

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,760
same way as direct experience, leveraging existing intuition circuits but applied to

94
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,920
imagined actions.

95
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,320
This allows animals to learn from mental trial and error.

96
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,800
For example, it was known for a long time that when rats were put in mazes, they would

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,720
often pause when they had a choice to make and look back and forth, pondering which way

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
to go.

99
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,040
It was only recently that David Reddish led an experiment where they recorded neuron activity

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,520
in rats while searching through mazes.

101
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,320
They found that when a rat stopped at a decision point and turned its head back and forth,

102
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,480
its brain was actually simulating going down each pathway.

103
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,440
The exact same neuron patterns were activated in the rat's mind when it walked down each

104
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,560
path and when it imagined walking down it.

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,680
And what you can see is a sequence running from the rat to the goal.

106
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,240
This ability to run mental simulations from your current internal state also improves

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,680
complex motor skills.

108
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Compare this to animals which don't have a neocortex, such as lizards, since they don't

109
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,040
see their next step before they take it.

110
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,280
However in these early mammals, the simulation ability was still limited compared to our

111
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
own.

112
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,080
These mental movies were always from their first person perspective and based on their

113
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,240
direct experience, which leads to our next breakthrough.

114
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,880
Now we can fast forward to around 15 million years ago and our ancestors had evolved into

115
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,000
the first primates.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,960
While most mammals live in solitary or small family-based groups, primates, such as chimpanzees,

117
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,080
live in tribes with dynamic social hierarchies.

118
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Using empty kerosene cans to make his display more impressive, Mike rose from very low status

119
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,720
to the position of top ranking or alpha male.

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,600
All chimps must have the ability to know what others are thinking.

121
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,800
To do that, they must be able to break out of their first person perspective and think

122
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,600
from a third person perspective, what we call theory of mind, such as thinking about what

123
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,280
others are thinking or thinking about your own thinking.

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Ollie is headed for a termite mound.

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,440
In her mouth, she carries two grass tools.

126
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,040
She has picked them even before sighting the mound, a demonstration of true forethought.

127
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,240
To do this, primates use a newly evolved brain region which grew out of the neocortex called

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,680
the granular prefrontal cortex, and it allows the brain to simulate things more generally.

129
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,320
For example, the primatologist Emile Menzel observed a female chimp named Belle, who came

130
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,440
up with strategies to try and trick another dominant male chimp from stealing food.

131
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,320
At first, Belle simply sat on top of a food source when she found it, until Rock realized

132
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,200
this and pushed her to get at the food.

133
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,040
In response, she came up with a new strategy where she would avoid new food locations at

134
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,000
first, waiting for Rock to look away and then immediately run towards it.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,960
And once Rock figured that out, Belle began trying to lead Rock in the wrong direction,

136
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,720
walking away from food, and eventually Rock realized he should search for food in the

137
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,680
opposite direction that Belle was leading him.

138
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,200
And this process of ever escalating deceptions revealed that Belle and Rock were able to

139
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,840
understand what was going on in each other's minds.

140
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,420
And there have been many science experiments done to prove just this.

141
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,860
That primates can in fact understand what others hold in their mind, and how that might

142
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
change.

143
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:13,140
The key point for this breakthrough, though, is that primates can hold accumulated knowledge

144
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,540
that never originated in their mind, or their own personal experience.

145
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,100
The simplest example is watching someone get hurt, and men not getting hurt yourself.

146
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,780
Learning from their experience, not yours.

147
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,180
This form of imitation learning extends to learning more complex behaviors.

148
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,260
For example, we see chimps learn to use tools by first observing, and then mimicking their

149
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
parents.

150
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,500
These patterns may be passed from generation to generation by observational learning.

151
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,620
The chimpanzee has his own primitive culture.

152
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,180
And this sets up our final breakthrough, language.

153
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,180
In humans, we see a unique ability to communicate our imaginations with symbols we create.

154
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,820
And alongside the development of language was the development of writing.

155
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,160
And we can chain these symbols together in sequences of any length to represent thoughts

156
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,460
of any kind, or of any level of complexity.

157
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,460
And when reading or listening to language, we can see someone else's thoughts and simulate

158
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,740
those thoughts as if we had them too.

159
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,180
And this unleashed humans from the practical limitation of imitation learning.

160
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,220
Unlike chimps, which you could only learn by observing others' actual actions, we can

161
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,420
learn from other people's imagined actions.

162
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:47,580
And this allows knowledge to accumulate without action at all, just by observing symbols.

163
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:54,020
Learning is important because it allows those thoughts to accumulate outside living minds

164
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:00,060
and build up across generations, resulting in a technological explosion unlike anything

165
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,020
else in nature.

166
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,740
Language allowed thought to break free from the human mind completely.

167
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,900
So we've seen intelligence arise out of the evolution of progressively more complex sources

168
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:21,740
of learning, starting with your own actions, then your own imagined actions, and then other

169
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:29,060
people's actions, and finally learning from other people's imagined actions.

170
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:36,260
Recently, the field of AI has exploded due to large language models, like chatGPT, which

171
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,140
have learned to model human language by reading all the text in the world.

172
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,300
These systems take the exact opposite approach as that taken by evolution.

173
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,020
Human intelligence ended with language, while large language models begin with language.

174
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,780
They take the final output of human thought as their input.

175
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,100
This is the big debate in the field of AI, can artificial intelligence short circuit

176
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,180
the steps that human intelligence had to take and go straight to language, or will it need

177
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,340
to build up from more foundational experience?

178
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:20,900
And if so, what form does that experience need to take?

179
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,980
To put it simply, does your brain need your body?

180
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,180
Thanks to Jane Street for sponsoring this art of the problem video.

189
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,500
After all, the stock market is a form of distributed intelligence, which no human or computer can

190
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,700
predict long term.

191
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,460
