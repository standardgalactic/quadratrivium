00:00.000 --> 00:06.140
It's strange how we seem to know everything and nothing about our brain.

00:06.140 --> 00:11.600
We know it's billions of neurons connected together forming trillions of electrical circuits,

00:11.600 --> 00:18.480
endlessly firing in patterns that somehow define us, but how exactly we don't know.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.640
People have tried to explain the brain by breaking it into different regions, performing

00:22.640 --> 00:28.840
different functions, memory here, planning here, perception here, but recent neuroscience

00:28.840 --> 00:33.440
has revealed that brain functions don't exist in separate regions, but as an interplay

00:33.440 --> 00:39.360
of many regions, and this is too complex to reverse engineer, because the brain was not

00:39.360 --> 00:42.520
engineered the way a human would have made it.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.480
The brain evolved.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.080
To create what we call intelligence.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.920
The modern boom in artificial intelligence has forced us to confront the question, what

00:53.920 --> 00:57.680
makes human intelligence so special?

00:57.680 --> 01:02.520
A recent book, A Brief History of Intelligence, takes an evolutionary view based on the most

01:02.520 --> 01:04.160
modern research.

01:04.160 --> 01:10.320
It follows the evolution of intelligence through five key leaps in learning ability.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.280
So let's go back in time to the beginning.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.560
Before brains, there was a simpler brain fabric, called a nerve net, which we see in the first

01:18.560 --> 01:20.360
multicellular animals.

01:20.360 --> 01:25.440
It allowed them to both sense and react to their world, enabling simple behavior such

01:25.440 --> 01:29.720
as grasping at the presence of food.

01:29.720 --> 01:34.920
This sets up our first breakthrough, which is the ability to navigate towards food.

01:34.920 --> 01:39.080
There's a significant milestone with the emergence of our ancestors that resemble the

01:39.080 --> 01:45.160
tiny worm, with a simple brain consisting of only 302 neurons.

01:45.160 --> 01:50.080
And they had a primitive smell, defined by small clusters of neurons within the brain,

01:50.080 --> 01:55.160
each able to detect different chemicals in the environment.

01:55.160 --> 01:59.520
And their brains applied a simple rule for finding food.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.760
If the concentration of a good thing increases, keep going forward.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.240
If it decreases, then change direction.

02:05.240 --> 02:10.520
However, these animals couldn't learn new behavior within their lifetimes.

02:10.520 --> 02:14.800
Their brain circuits were genetically encoded and fixed in life.

02:14.800 --> 02:19.560
This is a limitation that life forms would overcome with a new learning mechanism based

02:19.560 --> 02:21.160
on experience.

02:21.160 --> 02:26.000
This leads to our next breakthrough, learning from trial and error.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.200
We see this evolutionary leap during the Cambrian explosion around 540 million years

02:31.200 --> 02:32.520
ago.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.880
This was a period of time marked by an explosion of new life forms, including another distant

02:37.880 --> 02:42.600
ancestor resembling a primitive fish.

02:42.600 --> 02:48.920
They evolve new neural circuits capable of adjusting behavior based on outcomes.

02:49.200 --> 02:54.960
In order to learn from experience, you must have both a learnable sense and learnable

02:54.960 --> 02:55.960
behavior.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.160
So let's start with sense.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.920
These animals develop a new brain layer that acts as an interface with the world known

03:02.920 --> 03:05.800
as the cortex.

03:05.800 --> 03:12.000
It receives input from all sensory organs, eyes, ears, smell, touch, and processes these

03:12.000 --> 03:18.160
inputs into patterns of neuron activations within its deeper layers.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.880
This enables the cortex to associate patterns with specific things in the world, such as

03:23.880 --> 03:26.480
new sources of food or danger.

03:26.480 --> 03:33.200
Unlike what we saw before where one neuron corresponds to one specific thing, this evolutionary

03:33.200 --> 03:40.240
leap allows a pattern of neuron activations to represent different things in the world.

03:40.240 --> 03:45.600
This is what allows fish to recognize new objects so effectively, including complex

03:45.600 --> 03:51.280
patterns they would not have evolved to recognize, such as human faces.

03:51.280 --> 03:56.040
To demonstrate this power, researchers did an experiment where they taught fish to spit

03:56.040 --> 04:02.320
water at pictures of specific human faces to get rewards.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.760
And they were quite good at this even if the faces were rotated.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.440
So now let's turn to how behavior can be learned alongside sense.

04:11.440 --> 04:20.960
To control behavior, the neurons which represent perceptions in the cortex connect to newly

04:20.960 --> 04:24.080
evolved dopamine neurons.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.120
Now here's the key.

04:26.120 --> 04:30.960
Whenever dopamine signals increase, it makes the most recent behavior that the animal did

04:30.960 --> 04:33.040
more likely to occur.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.600
And when dopamine decreases, it inhibits the most recent behavior.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.920
A well-known experiment was led by Schultz.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.120
He showed the monkey's different cues, such as pictures of shapes, five seconds before

04:45.120 --> 04:48.680
presenting the reward of sugar water.

04:48.680 --> 04:53.400
First they observed that the monkey's dopamine neurons fired in response to newly presented

04:53.400 --> 04:59.400
unexpected sugar water, but not when the shape was presented prior.

04:59.400 --> 05:05.000
After a few repeated trials, they noticed the dopamine neurons began firing immediately

05:05.000 --> 05:10.520
after the shape was presented and not when the sugar water was given.

05:10.520 --> 05:16.560
So the dopamine response shifted to the earliest known expectation of the reward.

05:16.560 --> 05:22.360
This made it clear that dopamine was not a signal for pleasure, but an increase in the

05:22.360 --> 05:26.880
amount of expected future pleasure or reward.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.000
But as we all know, unlearning is just as important as learning, which dopamine also

05:32.000 --> 05:33.840
facilitates.

05:33.840 --> 05:39.560
For example, they did more trials where they showed the shape but never presented the reward.

05:39.560 --> 05:45.440
In these instances, the dopamine neurons showed a decrease in activity exactly when the reward

05:45.440 --> 05:47.680
previously occurred.

05:47.680 --> 05:53.960
This reduction in the dopamine firing rate can be interpreted as a form of negative feedback,

05:53.960 --> 05:58.680
what we'd feel as dissatisfaction or disappointment.

05:58.680 --> 06:05.880
And this ability to perform arbitrary sequence of actions based on rewards allowed animals

06:05.880 --> 06:11.360
to better learn from their environment how to exploit rewards and avoid pain.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.200
You can think of this process as intuition building.

06:15.200 --> 06:23.960
However, this form of learning was limited to the experience of actual rewards and pain.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.440
This leads us to our next breakthrough, simulation.

06:28.440 --> 06:34.560
Now let's fast forward 400 million years to a world ruled by dinosaurs.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.840
Alongside them was another ancestor, think of it as a primitive rodent.

06:38.840 --> 06:43.960
While much smaller and weaker, these animals evolved something much more powerful than

06:43.960 --> 06:46.240
simple trial and error learning.

06:46.240 --> 06:51.840
They grew as simple imagination, something dinosaurs didn't have.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.720
This required a new brain region called the neocortex.

06:55.720 --> 07:02.600
The neocortex is amazing in that it can imagine possible futures, like mental movies which

07:02.600 --> 07:08.440
activate the brain in the same way as if we actually experienced it.

07:08.440 --> 07:13.880
And critically, those dopamine circuits can be triggered from these simulations in the

07:13.880 --> 07:20.760
same way as direct experience, leveraging existing intuition circuits but applied to

07:20.760 --> 07:24.920
imagined actions.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.320
This allows animals to learn from mental trial and error.

07:29.320 --> 07:33.800
For example, it was known for a long time that when rats were put in mazes, they would

07:33.800 --> 07:38.720
often pause when they had a choice to make and look back and forth, pondering which way

07:38.720 --> 07:39.720
to go.

07:39.720 --> 07:45.040
It was only recently that David Reddish led an experiment where they recorded neuron activity

07:45.040 --> 07:48.520
in rats while searching through mazes.

07:48.520 --> 07:54.320
They found that when a rat stopped at a decision point and turned its head back and forth,

07:54.320 --> 07:58.480
its brain was actually simulating going down each pathway.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.440
The exact same neuron patterns were activated in the rat's mind when it walked down each

08:03.440 --> 08:06.560
path and when it imagined walking down it.

08:06.560 --> 08:10.680
And what you can see is a sequence running from the rat to the goal.

08:10.680 --> 08:15.240
This ability to run mental simulations from your current internal state also improves

08:15.240 --> 08:17.680
complex motor skills.

08:17.680 --> 08:23.680
Compare this to animals which don't have a neocortex, such as lizards, since they don't

08:23.760 --> 08:29.040
see their next step before they take it.

08:29.040 --> 08:34.280
However in these early mammals, the simulation ability was still limited compared to our

08:34.280 --> 08:35.880
own.

08:35.880 --> 08:42.080
These mental movies were always from their first person perspective and based on their

08:42.080 --> 08:48.240
direct experience, which leads to our next breakthrough.

08:48.240 --> 08:53.880
Now we can fast forward to around 15 million years ago and our ancestors had evolved into

08:53.880 --> 08:56.000
the first primates.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.960
While most mammals live in solitary or small family-based groups, primates, such as chimpanzees,

09:01.960 --> 09:06.080
live in tribes with dynamic social hierarchies.

09:06.080 --> 09:13.080
Using empty kerosene cans to make his display more impressive, Mike rose from very low status

09:13.440 --> 09:17.720
to the position of top ranking or alpha male.

09:17.720 --> 09:22.600
All chimps must have the ability to know what others are thinking.

09:22.600 --> 09:27.800
To do that, they must be able to break out of their first person perspective and think

09:27.800 --> 09:33.600
from a third person perspective, what we call theory of mind, such as thinking about what

09:33.600 --> 09:37.280
others are thinking or thinking about your own thinking.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.280
Ollie is headed for a termite mound.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.440
In her mouth, she carries two grass tools.

09:44.440 --> 09:51.040
She has picked them even before sighting the mound, a demonstration of true forethought.

09:51.040 --> 09:57.240
To do this, primates use a newly evolved brain region which grew out of the neocortex called

09:57.240 --> 10:03.680
the granular prefrontal cortex, and it allows the brain to simulate things more generally.

10:03.680 --> 10:09.320
For example, the primatologist Emile Menzel observed a female chimp named Belle, who came

10:09.320 --> 10:15.440
up with strategies to try and trick another dominant male chimp from stealing food.

10:15.440 --> 10:21.320
At first, Belle simply sat on top of a food source when she found it, until Rock realized

10:21.320 --> 10:24.200
this and pushed her to get at the food.

10:24.200 --> 10:29.040
In response, she came up with a new strategy where she would avoid new food locations at

10:29.040 --> 10:35.000
first, waiting for Rock to look away and then immediately run towards it.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.960
And once Rock figured that out, Belle began trying to lead Rock in the wrong direction,

10:39.960 --> 10:44.720
walking away from food, and eventually Rock realized he should search for food in the

10:44.720 --> 10:47.680
opposite direction that Belle was leading him.

10:47.680 --> 10:53.200
And this process of ever escalating deceptions revealed that Belle and Rock were able to

10:53.200 --> 10:56.840
understand what was going on in each other's minds.

10:56.840 --> 11:01.420
And there have been many science experiments done to prove just this.

11:01.420 --> 11:05.860
That primates can in fact understand what others hold in their mind, and how that might

11:05.860 --> 11:06.860
change.

11:06.860 --> 11:13.140
The key point for this breakthrough, though, is that primates can hold accumulated knowledge

11:13.140 --> 11:18.540
that never originated in their mind, or their own personal experience.

11:18.540 --> 11:24.100
The simplest example is watching someone get hurt, and men not getting hurt yourself.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.780
Learning from their experience, not yours.

11:27.780 --> 11:33.180
This form of imitation learning extends to learning more complex behaviors.

11:33.180 --> 11:39.260
For example, we see chimps learn to use tools by first observing, and then mimicking their

11:39.260 --> 11:40.260
parents.

11:40.260 --> 11:46.500
These patterns may be passed from generation to generation by observational learning.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.620
The chimpanzee has his own primitive culture.

11:50.620 --> 11:54.180
And this sets up our final breakthrough, language.

11:54.180 --> 12:01.180
In humans, we see a unique ability to communicate our imaginations with symbols we create.

12:01.180 --> 12:05.820
And alongside the development of language was the development of writing.

12:05.820 --> 12:11.160
And we can chain these symbols together in sequences of any length to represent thoughts

12:11.160 --> 12:14.460
of any kind, or of any level of complexity.

12:14.460 --> 12:20.460
And when reading or listening to language, we can see someone else's thoughts and simulate

12:20.460 --> 12:23.740
those thoughts as if we had them too.

12:23.740 --> 12:30.180
And this unleashed humans from the practical limitation of imitation learning.

12:30.180 --> 12:35.220
Unlike chimps, which you could only learn by observing others' actual actions, we can

12:35.220 --> 12:39.420
learn from other people's imagined actions.

12:39.420 --> 12:47.580
And this allows knowledge to accumulate without action at all, just by observing symbols.

12:47.580 --> 12:54.020
Learning is important because it allows those thoughts to accumulate outside living minds

12:54.020 --> 13:00.060
and build up across generations, resulting in a technological explosion unlike anything

13:00.060 --> 13:02.020
else in nature.

13:02.020 --> 13:08.740
Language allowed thought to break free from the human mind completely.

13:08.740 --> 13:14.900
So we've seen intelligence arise out of the evolution of progressively more complex sources

13:14.900 --> 13:21.740
of learning, starting with your own actions, then your own imagined actions, and then other

13:21.740 --> 13:29.060
people's actions, and finally learning from other people's imagined actions.

13:29.060 --> 13:36.260
Recently, the field of AI has exploded due to large language models, like chatGPT, which

13:36.260 --> 13:41.140
have learned to model human language by reading all the text in the world.

13:41.140 --> 13:46.300
These systems take the exact opposite approach as that taken by evolution.

13:46.300 --> 13:53.020
Human intelligence ended with language, while large language models begin with language.

13:53.020 --> 13:57.780
They take the final output of human thought as their input.

13:57.780 --> 14:02.100
This is the big debate in the field of AI, can artificial intelligence short circuit

14:02.100 --> 14:09.180
the steps that human intelligence had to take and go straight to language, or will it need

14:09.220 --> 14:13.340
to build up from more foundational experience?

14:13.340 --> 14:20.900
And if so, what form does that experience need to take?

14:20.900 --> 14:25.980
To put it simply, does your brain need your body?

14:25.980 --> 14:29.180
