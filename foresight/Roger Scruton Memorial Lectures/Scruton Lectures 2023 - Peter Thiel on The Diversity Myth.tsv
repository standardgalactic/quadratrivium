0	24280	Thank you all very much for coming to this notable event, it's my honor as well as my
24280	34520	pleasure to very briefly introduce the lecture we're going to have from Peter Thiel and to
34520	42620	then be in conversation with him after that presentation. I should say that Peter, to me,
42620	53440	is interesting, is one of the most deeply reflective thinkers of our time and also in
53440	60880	some respects one of the most prophetic. In 1993 he published a book, The Diversity Myth,
60880	70360	on trends in academic thought based on his experiences in Stanford which aside from a
70360	78040	few changes in minor changes actually in vocabulary is as fresh today as it was then or indeed
78040	85520	fresher because much of what he has written about has come to pass since that time. But I
85520	93520	think what's distinctive and important for me and I believe Peter will talk about it tonight
93520	105760	is the way in which he tries to dig into the deeper causes and sources and roots of present
105760	113920	intellectual and cultural as well as economic and political trends and to unstick our thinking
113920	121800	because to unfix it because just as this book I think illustrates we've not moved on, we live
121800	131240	in a perpetual groundhog day in terms of discourse and political thinking. In my smaller way I found
131240	139400	that myself, I'm still sometimes writing what I wrote in 1989 not simply because I'm not very
139400	148240	original but also because it still seems true or sometimes truer. So I think to dig into this
148240	157320	as deeply as Peter does is very very rare or unique and so I myself am enormously looking
157320	164960	forward to hearing what he has to say tonight and also talking with him after he said it. Thank you
164960	184840	very much. Thank you very much. It's a tremendous honor to be here this afternoon. I was involved
184840	192240	in a lot of these culture wars, campus wars in the late 1980s, early 1990s at Stanford University.
192240	201520	I started one of these alternative conservative newspapers and a lot of these debates had the
201520	208720	quality of these various crazy campus hijinks that then at the same time occasionally would
208720	214720	escalate into things that might be of some larger or even cosmic importance. One of the
215640	222640	Stanford debates that really was pivotal in the late 1980s involved a debate around the
222640	230760	core Western civilization class, Western culture. It was a protest in 1987 where the chant at the
230760	236720	protest was, hey, hey, ho, ho, Western cultures got to go. And it was in one sense about this
236720	243440	year-long freshman class. On another level of course it was about a repudiation of the
244120	249000	entire civilization that was being studied in that class, something somewhat more cosmic.
249000	255160	And then I covered a lot of these things and then a friend and I ended up writing a book,
255160	261800	The Diversity Myth, a few years later. I'll start by reading an excerpt from that and then I want
261800	267720	to give a little bit of a retrospective of where I was right, where I was wrong, where I was not
267760	276120	even wrong. And so one of the books that replaced Shakespeare was a book by Aimee CÃ©saire,
276120	283240	A Tempest, replaces The Tempest and it's all this inverted anti-colonial hierarchy where
283240	292280	Caliban is a revolutionary hero, Prospero is an evil colonialist. And so the final indignant
292280	300240	trade by Caliban and A Tempest. Understand what I say, Prospero, for years I bowed my head,
300240	306400	for years I took it, all of it, your insults, your ingratitude, and worst of all, more grading than
306400	313320	all the rest, your condescension. But now it's over. Over, do you hear? Of course at the moment
313320	317400	you're still stronger than I am, but I don't give a damn for your power or for your dogs or your
317400	323400	police or your inventions. And do you know why? It's because I know I'll get you. And you lied to
323400	328000	me so much about the world, about yourself, that you ended up by imposing it on me, an image of
328000	332680	myself, underdeveloping your words, incompetent. That's how you made me see myself and I loathe
332680	338200	that image and it's false. And I know that one day my bare fist, just that, will be enough to crush
338200	344440	your world, the old world is falling apart. And by the way, you have a chance to get it over with,
344760	349960	you can fuck off. You can go back to Europe, but in a pig's eye you will. I'm sure you won't
349960	354600	leave, you make me laugh with your mission, your vocation, your vocation is to give me shit. And
354600	359720	that's why you'll stay, just like those guys who founded the colonies and who now can't live
359720	366520	anywhere else. You're just an old colonial addict, that's what you are. And then this goes on for
366520	375080	250 pages where we go through things like this and sort of the somewhat pretentious idea that
375720	380280	David and I had in writing this book was we were speaking truth to power, that all that it took was
380280	386040	to sort of expose this and then you could ask questions. Well, is this new, is this an improved
386040	392280	version of Shakespeare or should one prefer the original? Is this really about multiculturalism
392360	398360	and non-western cultures or is it just all sort of an anti-western thing that drives it?
399720	404280	And then there were parts of it that felt a little bit contrived at the time where
405080	408920	we had to somehow make it relevant to the larger thing. And so we had the sort of
409560	414120	somewhat contrived construction where ideas have consequences and what happens in the university
414120	420040	will eventually spread beyond it. And then of course when you fast forward 30 years, there are
420120	425720	all these ways, a lot of this has held up quite well. And of course there are also ways where
426600	433960	it feels like it didn't matter at all. And so I don't know, I can brag that the book was prophetic
433960	441880	and that a lot of it came true. And then I can say that somehow all this effort in writing this
441880	447240	seemingly did not really matter and that on some level it was not about the logic of the ideas
447800	455640	at all. And what I want to reflect about is, and so even though I think the specific arguments
455640	462920	I would still defend is almost all right, I want to focus maybe a little bit more self-critically
462920	471000	on the places where I was not even wrong, where in some ways I didn't even understand what the
471080	478120	real issues were and think about a little bit what those were. And I think one piece of the book
478120	485080	that has held up relatively well is the title, The Diversity Myth. It's an ambiguous title. It can
485080	492680	mean on the one, you can put the stress on the word diversity in which case you can then have
492680	498520	debates of, you know, what does diversity mean and if it is some sort of celebration of difference
498520	502600	and then you can sort of debate what kinds of diversity should one have. And then there are
502600	507240	all sorts of libertarian and conservative critiques where, you know, you don't have real diversity
507240	512520	if you have a group of people who look different but think alike, you know, diversity in that sense
512520	517720	probably should involve more than just hiring the extras from the space cantina scene in Star Wars
517720	524440	or something like that. But there's a secondary, maybe somewhat deeper meaning of the title
524440	530040	where you put the stress on the word myth. And if you put the stress on the word myth,
530040	537640	you realize that diversity or multiculturalism or any of these words are extremely poorly defined
537640	541880	and that's the point. They're not supposed to be defined. They're sort of a, it's sort of like a
541880	553720	false god, idol, chivalrous, but it can never be really defined and it works maybe mostly as a sort
553800	562200	of diversion or divertissement, distraction from the things that are truly important. And it is
562200	568520	kind of like a, I don't know, it's a hypnotic magic show where you don't notice the gorilla jumping
568520	573640	up and down the back of the stage. You're just narrowly focused on what the tricks the magician
573640	583400	is doing. And I want to try to explore with you tonight is a map of the things that we've been
583400	590600	distracted from by focusing too much on wokeness, anti-wokeness, all these kinds of debates,
590600	596520	what were we missing? So three main ones, I'm going to go through
599000	608200	my brief comments tonight. The first one broadly is a category and this would be a libertarian
608200	615320	critique of diversity. It would also be a Marxist critique is that, is that when you focus on all
615320	621400	these forms of identity politics, you're not focused enough on economics. When you focus on,
622520	629080	you know, race, gender, etc., you're not going to focus enough on class. And so I think there is,
629080	635320	you know, and there is, even though I'm not a, not a communist or a Marxist, I find that even
635320	640440	the Marxist critique probably has quite a bit to it where if you had a, you know, what would be a
640440	648920	Marxist analysis of a diversity administrator? And if you had Karl Marx or Rosa Luxemburg here,
648920	654040	I think they would, they would suggest that these people are roughly in the same category
654040	660920	as a bank robber or a prostitute because they're sort of a, it's a form of crony capitalism.
660920	667160	It's sort of a reactionary class that's somehow taking advantage of the system. And then if we
667160	672440	actually sort of look at the history of this where, you know, in some ways cultural Marxism
672440	680600	replaced real Marxism, you know, in the 1970s, it roughly at least correlates with the period when,
680600	688280	you know, inequality grew massively when the economy started to stagnate. And so when we,
688360	693080	when we stopped thinking about the economy, there are sort of various perspectives from
693080	699160	both the left or right economics perspective, where something there ceased to work all that,
699160	705480	all that wealth. And, and then of course, even, you know, economics is sort of somehow
705480	711800	in a libertarian or Marxist form, it grounds you into, into substantive material type things.
712760	717960	But maybe the, the sort of libertarian Marxist synthesis that I would want to explore a little
717960	725640	bit more is the Henry George, the late 19th century economists to in the late 19th century was seen as
725640	729880	pretty socialist today he's seen as pretty libertarian, which I think doesn't simply
729880	735880	reflect sort of a way in which our society has changed. But from the Henry George perspective,
735880	741880	the economic relation that one always needed to look at was land ownership, real estate,
741880	747160	distortions in real estate. And this is the the key driver. And I want to submit that
747240	753000	if there is an area of economics that we should pay more attention to it is, it is something
753000	758680	like that that there's something about a georgist analysis of real estate that is
758680	765560	extremely suggested of some very crazy things that have happened in the last 50 years in our society.
767480	771880	One of the, one of the numbers I've seen on this and if you look at real estate in London,
772440	779320	it has an elasticity of minus two, which means that if you were to increase the supply of housing
779320	787000	by 1%, the average price would go down 2%. And if you multiply in a 1.01 by 0.98,
787000	792760	you get a smaller number. And this leads the paradoxical result that the more housing you
792760	799720	build in London, the less it is collectively worth. And, and so when you have a market that is
799800	806200	this strangely dysfunctional, some, you know, extremely odd sorts of things start to happen.
807960	814360	It, and, and, and you have to sort of ask questions whether there is a kind of
814360	820680	crony capitalism racket that, that, that starts to happen in a lot of different ways where,
821320	826600	you know, if you think about the, the, the immigration debates in the UK or the United
826600	831320	States, that there are all sorts of, you know, extremely politically correct and extremely
831320	836680	politically incorrect arguments on immigration. But, but the sort of basic George's economics
836680	844200	argument is, you know, if you add 2%, 3% a year immigration to the UK and the inelasticity is
844200	851000	two to one, then, you know, London house prices will go up 4% to 6% a year. And, and then this is
851000	857400	basically an extremely regressive tax on the half of the population that doesn't own houses.
857400	863880	It's an extremely regressive tax on young people. And it's basically a formula for left-wing
863880	870120	radicalization of the population over time. And that's, that's what we need to be able to now
870120	877800	analyze. And I would be probably open to, you know, unrestrictive immigration. If you could
877800	883240	build more housing, I think, you know, Elon will get to Mars before that happens in the UK.
886840	892440	And then if we, you know, if we, if we look at something, you know, even more prosaic like,
893160	899800	like at Oxford, one of the news items I was, I was reading was, I think the, you know,
899800	904760	relative to incomes, the cost of housing is, is among the worst in the UK. And it's like a,
904840	908920	you know, mini London or a hyper London or something like that is, is Oxford.
909720	917320	The J.R.R. Tolkien house is for sale for 4.5 million pounds. And I would submit to you that if a,
917320	923880	if an Oxford professor were to buy that house, probably the university would be justified in
925000	930040	starting an inquiry into where the professor got the money to do that. And, and you have to,
930040	936440	you have to sort of ask, you know, what, what are, you know, and then of course, if you can't
936440	941800	have single family housing, if there is no family formation possible for anybody in academia,
942920	949400	you know, is it really any wonder that you get this kind of nihilistic proletarianization of,
949400	955720	of the faculty of the students of the younger generation? And where if you do not solve this
955720	960680	sort of problem, you know, it doesn't matter what you do with all these other debates.
961640	969640	To use, to use an American example, you know, 2007, San Francisco, New York, you know,
969640	975240	I thought we were at a ridiculous housing bubble. Prices were, you know, completely insane. The
975240	981160	rents were out of control. And the same thing in London 2007. If you had told me, you know,
981640	986360	we'll fast forward to 2023, the prices are going to double. So this is just completely
986360	991880	impossible. How would this, how could this possibly happen? If people would move, they moved to a
991880	998600	different place. And, and, and if you had said, well, but, but just, just assume they doubled,
999160	1004440	how, how, you know, what would have happened? And I would, I'd be tempted. I don't know if I
1004440	1009240	would have predicted this, but retrospectively, one might say, there must have been some crazy
1009240	1016840	ideology that infested people's minds. And, and so, you know, if you're, you know, if you're a gay
1016840	1022760	person living in Manhattan, maybe you're told that if you move to a suburb, you'll be beaten up by
1022760	1028760	people with bats. And so you have to pay a gay tax and live in a big city. Or if you're a woman
1029640	1035000	living in a rat infested apartment in San Francisco, and you fantasize about a nice
1035080	1040760	suburban house in Reno, Nevada, maybe you will be told that, well, if you move to Reno, Nevada,
1040760	1046520	you're going to be chained to your bed until you are forced to carry a baby to term. And,
1047240	1053400	and that sort of all of these kinds of things would have intensified. Now, I don't have to,
1053400	1060040	you know, so, so, you know, if we analyze wokeness in terms of real estate, you don't have to,
1060040	1065720	you know, you don't have to go the full conspiracy theory. So I'm not, you know, I'm not arguing
1065720	1073880	that something like Roe v. Wade being overturned was a conspiracy by left-wing urban slumlords
1073880	1079720	in the U.S. or something like this. But, but if you have a negative in the elasticity of the
1079720	1086120	sort I described with London, the kinds, you know, where this creates trillions of dollars
1086200	1093080	of value that gets distributed, redistributed, shifted in a sort of socially toxic way.
1094120	1099400	Isn't it even odd for us not to ask the question, maybe not a full intentional conspiracy,
1099400	1105240	but at least it's an emergent property. It's the kind of thing that we, we tolerate. I will
1105240	1113080	leave it as a politically incorrect exercise to you in this room to think about the craziest
1113080	1123960	woke excess in the U.K. of the last 10 years or so. And then, and then think about how it
1123960	1133320	increased aggregate housing prices in the U.K. And again, not, not saying it's causal, but just
1133320	1141480	saying that maybe, maybe if you could stop the housing racket, you'd start to get to the roots
1141480	1150040	of, of this woke, this woke disease. Now, now when we move beyond this sort of very,
1150040	1159000	very stuck economy, one of the other, a second, a second big area where this, this focus on
1160520	1167560	identity politics, diversity tends to focus us on all these debates within the humanities. And
1167560	1173560	this is, this was also the, the direction of, of the diversity in this book. You just go through
1173560	1178600	all, all these things that go wrong in the humanities and in the sort of, in the liberal arts,
1178600	1187960	things like that. And the, the, the, the, the, the sort of idea that I've come to over the last
1187960	1198360	15, 20 years is that perhaps just as broken as the humanities are the sciences, broadly speaking,
1198360	1205320	that they are not, they are no longer progressing. They are, for the most part, pretty stuck. It's a
1205320	1212840	harder case to make because science is a harder thing to understand. And, but, you know, when I
1213080	1217000	was, when I was an undergraduate in the late 1980s, most of the science fields or
1217880	1221960	most of the engineering fields one could have gone into would have been the wrong fields,
1221960	1226680	you know, nuclear engineering, aero astro engineering, terrible ideas already in the late
1226680	1232440	80s, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, physics, chemistry, all these sort of science areas
1233320	1239000	somehow ended up being dead end. I think electrical engineering still barely worked for a while.
1239000	1246920	And then really the only thing that, that, that, that had some sort of a future was, was
1246920	1253800	computer science, which was in the late 80s, kind of a, sort of a, a field of people who couldn't
1253800	1258680	handle the, the hardness of electrical engineering or math, sort of dropped out of
1258680	1265480	electrical engineering and became a computer programmer. But, but the, you know, the rough
1265480	1271480	picture of, of scientific technological progress I have is that, you know, for maybe the last 50
1271480	1278200	years, we've had, you know, a narrow cone of progress around the world of bits, computers,
1278200	1283080	internet, mobile internet software, but that the world of atoms, you know, where, which is the
1283080	1289400	world we are embedded in, in some sense, matters more to us as human beings has been strangely
1289480	1295240	stuck. And this is, you know, this is even in the word technology, which, you know, in some ways
1295240	1301080	technology is just that, that's, that, which is progressing. And today technology has been
1301080	1307400	collapsed to IT, information technology, because it is just this world of bits. If you use the word
1307400	1313160	technology in 1973, it would have meant computers, but it also meant new medicines. It was meant the
1313160	1319000	green revolution in agriculture. It would have meant, you know, supersonic aviation. It would
1319000	1325080	have meant space travel. Technology was advancing on many, many different fronts. And, and, you
1325080	1330840	know, in a, in a world where this is stuck, and we can't even, we're not even paying attention to it,
1330840	1338120	that, that surely is, is a, is a big defect. The sort of US analogy that I've used on this is that,
1339880	1345240	you know, if you ask the question, you know, are the humanities or the sciences less healthy,
1345240	1349400	the sort of governmental analogy would be, is the Department of Motor Vehicles
1351480	1355880	better or worse run than the NSA, the National Security Agency, or maybe the,
1355880	1362200	maybe the British version would be something like the post office versus GCHQ. And the,
1362200	1366440	the seemingly straightforward answer is obviously the post office is not well run, or the DMV is
1366440	1371960	not well run in the US, and everybody can see it, just like the humanities are quite obviously
1371960	1377880	sort of broken. But, but surely the more plausible answer is that the things you don't understand
1377880	1382840	and can't see are more corrupt and that where you have, you know, these ever narrower groups of
1382840	1387640	guardians guarding themselves, the string theorists guarding the string theorists, the cancer researchers
1387640	1391240	telling us about how great they all are and how they're all going to have these breakthroughs in
1391240	1397640	the next two years. That's surely the thing one should be more suspicious about. One of my,
1397640	1403640	one of my friends worked for, was, was in the PhD physics department at Stanford, his advisor,
1403640	1411160	Bob Laughlin, got a Nobel Prize in physics in the late 1990s. And Laughlin suffered from the
1411160	1416760	supreme delusion that once he got a Nobel Prize in physics, he actually had, he finally had academic
1416760	1422760	freedom and he could do whatever he wanted. And he decided that he was going to investigate these,
1423720	1429640	you know, some areas in science that were truly taboo. And, you know, there's obviously stuff you
1429640	1435640	can't ask questions about climate change or evolution or, you know, even stem cell research is
1435640	1440600	probably, you know, allowed to ask too many questions about that. But he decided to go into
1440600	1445320	something far more taboo than any of those things. And it was, he started with the premise that most
1445320	1450440	of these scientists were actually just defrauding the government. They were engaged in semi fraudulent
1450440	1456120	research. And they were, they shouldn't, you know, he worked on high temperature superconductors.
1456120	1460200	He told me once that he thought, you know, there were 50,000 papers written in that field and only
1460200	1466600	about 25 of the 50,000 deserved to be published. And, and they started with, you know, they started
1466600	1472200	with an inquest into the Stanford biology department, where he basically believed that most of these
1472200	1478280	people had, you know, effectively stolen money from the government. And there's been since then
1478280	1484040	a sort of a replication crisis in science that people have made more of. But the replication
1484040	1489720	crisis, it always gets narrated in the slightly politically correct way, where we don't actually
1489720	1493320	mention the specific names. Lawful inside, no, I'm just going to mention the names of all the people.
1493320	1497960	And here's the list of people who are stealing money. And as you can imagine this, you, I don't
1497960	1502280	tell you how it ended, but he got promptly defunded. His students couldn't get PhDs anymore. And
1502920	1507640	he at least got some kind of education about academic freedom from this process.
1509240	1516760	And so, so, and so I think that, that, you know, I think in a, in a debate,
1518200	1522520	if you have an argument, there maybe are always, I think, two fundamental ways one can try to
1523400	1529080	make a case. And you can go after your opponent, you can go after the enemy at the weakest point,
1529720	1535640	which is where you're most likely to score a tactical victory. Or you can go after your
1535640	1544120	enemy at the strongest point. And, and if we, if we criticize the universities for the humanities,
1544120	1550200	that's in some sense, what, I don't know, the central left, the law of administrative establishment
1550200	1556280	wants us to do, we can, we can occasionally win some tactical victories. But, but, you know, the,
1557160	1563080	where, where they get, you know, their sense of validation, their sense that everything is still
1563160	1568760	healthy and great is the sciences. And if you can, if you can show that the sciences are more
1568760	1575240	corrupt than the humanities, it's harder to do. But if you can do that, you will win game set match.
1576920	1580520	And it's something, you know, I'm not, you know, it's always very difficult to do this with something
1580520	1585720	like, the way I, I would attempt it to make the argument is something like, you know, the string
1585720	1589880	theorists and physics are the smartest physics people, and they've been stuck for 40 years.
1590440	1595240	And, and the physics people are the smartest people. And so by some principle of transitivities,
1595240	1599880	string theorists have been doing nothing. There for everybody else has been doing nothing as well.
1599880	1606120	And something, something like that would be the rough way, the rough way I would, I would make
1606120	1613960	this, this sort of argument. Now, if we combine these, these two, two big things we're being distracted
1613960	1618920	from, we're being distracted from the economy, even in its most basic forms, like real estate,
1618920	1626120	we're being distracted from, from science. You know, and then in some ways things have
1626120	1631000	not been healthy in the economy and science, they've not been progressing, the GDP has not
1631000	1636360	been growing in a balanced way for quite some time. There's always a question, you know, could we,
1637640	1642680	and the wokeness is distracting us from, from these things, from going back to these things.
1643640	1649480	If we, if we focused on them, would we be able, would we be able to solve, you know, all of our
1649480	1658200	problems and sort of as a, as maybe a little bit of an aside here, I, I think, I think the, the
1658200	1666280	temptation has always been to find a straightforwardly economic solution to, you know, my, my version is
1667720	1672360	broadly science and tech have been stagnant for something like 50 years. And the temptation
1672440	1677880	is, has been to find some kind of economic fix where we don't, because getting science and tech
1677880	1684520	back on track, it does sound pretty hard. And I think the reason we haven't been transparently
1684520	1690440	stuck for 50 years is there were actually two one time economic fixes that did not involve science
1690440	1696360	and tech that were done. There was a, you know, there was a right wing Reagan Thatcher fix in the
1696360	1704120	1980s. And there was a one time solution where you could cut taxes, deregulate, allow lots of
1704120	1710200	murders and acquisitions to happen. And you could one time gain enormous, an enormous lift for the
1710200	1716920	whole economy. But it doesn't continue. If you rate lower taxes from 70% marginal rates to 28%
1716920	1723240	percent, like they did in the US. But that's a one time lift. It worked from 1983 to 1989. And
1723320	1727320	then by the late 80s, it was exhausted. And we went back to the cultural war debates that
1727320	1733960	from the 1970s, they came back in the early 90s. And then there was a one time Clinton Blair
1733960	1743880	solution circa 1995 to 2007, which was globalization. And it was also a way to increase GDP. It was
1743880	1750600	probably a far more ruthless, ruthless way to do it than capitalism. It created far more inequality.
1750600	1755160	The genie coefficient went up way more under Clinton than under Reagan in the United States.
1756120	1762760	But it also, you know, there were some gains from that. Probably were some long term costs from
1762760	1772360	that as well. But they both seem really, really hard to do. The probably there's a way in which the
1772360	1778680	center right isn't a healthier place in the center left, because on the center right, we don't really
1778680	1784360	think we can go back to to Reaganism. On the center left, there's still some idea that they can go
1784360	1790280	back to Clintonism or, you know, you know, going back to that through the UK seems hard. Going back
1790280	1798440	to Blair seems like maybe that's a mistake we still have to have to make in the UK. But I think
1799160	1806200	but certainly if we if we can't think about the economic issues more clearly, the real estate
1806200	1811800	issues more clearly, and probably if we can't think about the science and tech issues, we don't
1811800	1819480	even have don't even have a hope to get back to a genuinely progressing society. Let me let me
1819480	1826920	say something about maybe a third category that's sort of maybe even bigger than let's say the economy
1826920	1836360	or, you know, science writ large. And that is that is something like, you know, the biggest,
1836360	1840680	you know, I don't know, the biggest possible topic that one could have would be something
1840680	1845000	like God. It's something like Anselm's ontological proof is that there's nothing that you can imagine
1845000	1850040	that's bigger than God. And if and if these debates have distracted us from the economy
1850040	1855160	and from science, they probably also have distracted us from questions of religion
1855160	1862760	of God of the Christian God. And and so that would be sort of my my candidate for the biggest
1862760	1871080	thing possible that we've been distracted from. And as with the sciences and with the economics,
1871080	1878840	it also it's an odd thing for us to be distracted from because it is so suggestive and has so many
1879480	1887800	different ways that this kind of debate should be reframed. And in particular,
1889000	1894360	you know, I want to do too much on metaphysics or things like that, but maybe just focus a little
1894360	1903800	bit on on a survey. What would Christianity tell us about history? And then what does this history,
1903800	1907960	you know, does that tell us something interesting about our current historical moment and
1908840	1915240	some of these some of these debates that that that we we've been touching on over the last
1915800	1923320	half hour here. And basically, the basic thesis I would have would be that
1924200	1929960	frames a little bit provocatively would be that, you know, perhaps the the original progressive
1930840	1935800	was simply the Christian God. You know, the New Testament supersedes the Old Testament,
1935800	1943000	that's the original idea of something like progressivism in in theology, the New is better than
1943000	1949240	the Old, the New transcends the Old, there's some sort of progress in history. And and of course,
1949240	1956760	there you know, there is sort of a a Jewish or pagan critique of Christianity that those of
1956760	1961080	sort of Christian need to take very seriously, which is, you know, you know, once you have this
1961080	1966920	principle of the of the New Testament superseded the New superseding the Old, is there a limit?
1966920	1973640	Do you is it just a slippery slope to communism, to wokeness, to to ultra Christian, to some kind
1973640	1981000	of antichristic parody? And and if you and if we had to concretize this even even more,
1982680	1987320	you know, there is something about, you know, there's there's one sense, of course, in which
1987880	1994440	what, you know, what the Bible says about the founding of the first city in the history of
1994440	1999160	the world is the same as what mythology tells us about the founding of the greatest city
1999160	2005800	in the history of the world. It starts with madness and murder. So Cain kills Abel, Romulus
2005800	2012440	kills Remus. But the difference between the biblical account, and the, let's say, the,
2013160	2019640	the, the conventional religious account is that the conventional religions take the side of the
2019640	2026120	city. It takes the side, Rome takes the side of Romulus, the Bible already, already at the beginning
2026120	2031400	in Genesis takes the side of Abel. And there's, of course, there's, you know, some sense in which
2031400	2037240	the entire biblical tradition is from the point of view of the victim, you know, the Jews, you know,
2037240	2041400	the normal way this the story of Exodus would be written would be from the point of view of the
2041400	2045720	Egyptians, or these troublemakers, and they, they got removed to be like the Oedipus myth,
2045720	2052280	where you get, you get rid of Oedipus, or something like that. And, and then, and then, of course,
2052280	2058440	there is, there is something like this in, in, in the, in the Christian story itself, where
2059320	2065560	it is a sort of inversion of perspectives, and this, this, you know, elevation of, of victimhood,
2065560	2072760	this idea that this is central, surely was, was, was one of the, one of the key pieces of it. You
2072760	2076360	know, it's, I think it's sort of a, the late Nietzsche, when he was, you know, when he was sort
2076360	2081240	of going, going mad, sort of had this, it was always, you know, we need to, we need to go back
2081240	2087880	to the strong classical world, where, you know, the victims don't complain, and all this stuff is,
2088680	2095240	you know, is sort of healthy and robust, and, and, but he sort of had some sense this was not the way
2095320	2099640	history was going, and sort of the, you know, sort of in his, towards his madness was sort of,
2099640	2105400	God of the Jews, you have won. He sort of has sense that the 20th century, we're about to go,
2105400	2112680	you know, into overdrive on victimology, and things of this sort. And, and if, if I had to
2112680	2118360	sort of differentiate, maybe, you know, if I had to ask, if I had to ask the question, how is,
2119320	2127960	the Christian view different from, let's say, the neo-pagan view, or the, or the, the woke hyper,
2127960	2133160	the woke ultra-Christian view, something like that, the, you know, and I find a lot that's
2133160	2138920	extremely tempting in a classical neo-pagan thing, I don't know, there's Bronze Age pervert, or,
2138920	2144600	you know, all these sort of online people where it's, why can't we just forget about the history,
2144680	2150600	and just move on, or, you know, just, or go back to nature, where, you know, nature,
2151240	2156920	nature as a word does not occur once in the Old Testament, and, you know, nature is bare,
2156920	2161240	red, and tooth, and claw, but if you take your bearings from nature, if you set nature as a
2161240	2167400	standard, then you don't, there's nothing that's really naturally evil, nothing that's naturally,
2167400	2174680	morally wrong, and that is sort of always the, let's say, the right-wing, pre-Christian,
2174680	2179480	neo-pagan, I don't know, Nietzschean, Renaissance, humanism, all these different versions,
2180440	2187560	temptation to, to sort of go back to that, and then on the, on the other side, I would say something
2187560	2199320	like the, let's say, the woke, liberal, you know, post-Christian, maybe ultra-Christian,
2199320	2204600	temptation, is that we are going to be more Christian than the Christians. We are going to,
2204600	2208760	we're going to, you know, you know, the poor shall inherit the earth, and we're going to have a
2208760	2213240	communist revolution, and we're going to accelerate the process, and we'll make it happen even faster,
2213240	2217560	we're going to accelerate the history even more, and there's always, you know, this question,
2217560	2223080	is it possible to be too Christian? And I think the answer is, in theory, no, but in practice,
2223080	2228920	surely yes, and that in practice, if you, you know, if you try to hit the accelerator on this,
2228920	2238440	you don't end up somehow finding a way to deal with the past, but you simply end up creating some
2238440	2245720	kind of eternal recurrence, some kind of perpetual motion machine that generates nothing but violence
2245720	2250760	and never-ending cycles of revenge. It is sort of another version of the Nietzschean eternal
2250760	2257720	recurrence. And so the, you know, the Christian, the Christian perspective on this is always
2257720	2263640	some paradoxical combination that, yes, there was original sin, yes, in the beginning was madness
2263640	2269800	and murder, yes, there was incredible injustice in the past, and then you need to forgive people.
2270440	2279640	And if you go with the neo-Pagan alt-right, whatever you want to call it, version,
2279640	2287800	and you say there was nothing bad in the past, I think that somehow doesn't stand up against the
2287800	2292520	historical pressure of Christianity against the working out of the Christian revelation in history.
2292600	2300840	If you, and then if you go with the woke thing, there's some sense in which it also doesn't
2300840	2307800	work for these opposite reasons. It's always hard to transpose this into these different
2307800	2313240	categories, but the political categories I'm always tempted to use are something like these 20th
2313240	2321160	century categories, fascism, communism, Christian democracy. And, you know, there's always sort
2321160	2329000	of a debate between fascism and communism. Are they equally bad? Is communism, is fascism
2329000	2333400	worse? And there's always a sort of conservative argument that they're roughly equally bad,
2333400	2339080	they both killed millions of people, and they're sort of in some ways just copies of one another.
2339080	2346760	But the sort of perspective leads me to think that we should very squarely say that something
2346840	2354520	like fascism was generally much less bad than something like communism, because fascism was
2355320	2360840	the past. And it was just, okay, fascist, the fascist claim was the victims were all guilty,
2360840	2364600	and it's the historical victims from middle ages, we're going to go back to them, and we're going
2364600	2371000	to victimize them. And then communism was sort of, it was like always like sort of more in the
2371000	2375480	future, and it was, we're going to go after the victimizers, we're going to victimize the victimizers,
2375480	2381880	we're sort of too clever by half. And that was always the far more powerful, the far greater
2381880	2388920	temptation in our world. And that's why, you know, even if someone like Bronze Age pervert or
2388920	2398360	Iron Rand is somehow wrong in their sort of whitewashing of the past, it's probably,
2398360	2402040	it probably is always at the end of the day, the more innocent mistake to make,
2402040	2406840	because we're in this in this world, we're something like the hyper-Christian
2407720	2416040	wokeness, the original sin with no hope of forgiveness is the greater temptation.
2419000	2428440	You know, let me end with maybe one thought, I've given you three very big things that we've
2428440	2436920	been distracted from the economy, science and tech broadly, you know, the Christian God.
2437480	2441960	But you know, there's always a sense which you say, well, the more immediate thing is still
2441960	2448600	always these political questions, and we're in this political question. And so maybe if you have
2448600	2455160	to have a political answer, what are we being distracted from politically? Where is wokeness
2455240	2463000	distracting us from more important things that are immediately political? I would suggest maybe
2463000	2470120	one way to start is to think about the etymology or the sort of the word of the term political
2470120	2476600	correctness, where political correctness, you know, by the 1980s, it already was this
2476600	2481320	conservative term that conservatives used to criticize sort of intolerant liberals.
2481400	2485640	But if we go back to the 1970s, political correctness was actually a term liberals used to describe
2485640	2489960	themselves, where they were sort of like really, really progressive and really politically correct,
2489960	2496280	and that it was a term of self-congratulation. And if you went back to the 1950s, the original
2496280	2502280	meaning of political correctness was that it was you were a politically correct comrade because
2502280	2506440	you were following the orders directly from Moscow and you were following the party line of the
2506440	2515000	Communist Party. And so if we, you know, if we go back to the original meaning of political
2515000	2520040	correctness and sort of think that, you know, the real problem is something, you know, something
2520040	2525320	like communism, even though it's, you know, communism fascism in the 20th century were youth
2525320	2530200	movements and we're sort of dealing with a gerontocratic version of this. So it's different,
2530200	2537000	demographically it's very different, but something like ultra-Christianity communism,
2537000	2542600	this set of things is the real problem today. And so this is a great simplification,
2543880	2552040	great reduction, but you could do much worse than whenever you hear the term DEI to just think CCP.
2553160	2553800	Thank you very much.
2554280	2564200	Well, let's begin to explore these
2567000	2572840	very deep questions and profound thoughts that have been put before us. And I think we should
2572840	2580120	recognize that they're all attempts, I think, Peter, to shake us out of our distraction.
2580920	2587800	There were three types of distraction here. The beginning one was the first one was the way in
2587800	2596920	which debates about woke and anti-woke about culture very often lead us to turn our thoughts away
2596920	2602440	from fundamental contradictions in economic life. And this is a way in which
2602440	2611320	Peter's way of thinking combines certain aspects without being a libertarian or a Marxist of
2611960	2618440	libertarian and Marxist critiques of our current economic regime. The second was,
2618440	2623720	which I found particularly fascinating, was the way in which the kind of paradigmatic
2624840	2631880	contrast which many people including I myself have made between ethics and politics as not being
2632440	2637640	highly progressive and science and technology as being highly progressive, as being prototypically
2637640	2643960	progressive is not, in fact, substantiated by the actual evidence that sciences and technology,
2643960	2649480	except in a few narrow fields, have been stuck in the same categories of thinking in the same
2649480	2656760	theoretical frameworks and even the same types of technology for about 50 years. And then the third
2657560	2668760	type of distraction that this talk was trying to rid us of or shake us out of was a distraction in
2668760	2677320	which questions of religion or of theology or of not exactly metaphysics but of the way we
2677320	2683480	ultimately think about good and evil and how human beings are in the world have been pushed
2683480	2691240	on one side and yet they continually reappear with woke, not actually being at all, as some
2691240	2698040	people have said on the right, a repaganization of the world but as being a type of hyper-Christianity
2698040	2705720	emptied of transcendence and forgiveness. And that leads to, I guess, a question, my question
2706360	2712920	to you, Peter, is, is there some way out of this? Because in a way, I think one of the things you
2712920	2718680	said which was most interesting was the attempt to, in the 20th century, in fascism and other
2719240	2726520	types of thinking were now in interesting writers like Bronze Age, Pervert, or earlier on in Iran.
2727080	2731480	What they were doing was, I would think in your terms, Peter, it was actually very interesting
2731480	2738280	but impossible because you can't, would you think this is true, you can't actually get back to a
2738280	2743880	classical or pre-Christian view of the world in which energy and vitality empower what matters
2743880	2750200	and victimhood is contemptible or unimportant. Once Christianity is there, so we can't go back.
2750200	2753720	And that's true of the other, the previous two. We can't go back to earlier forms of science,
2753720	2757800	we can't go back to earlier forms of economic thinking, although I thought what you said about
2757800	2765160	Henry George was very interesting. Are we really stuck? Can we actually, can you actually, is it
2765160	2769480	possible to unstick us? I think it is because I think you're already unsticking us tonight.
2769480	2772920	Where would you think that there's the best chance of unsticking us?
2774360	2782040	Well, my very fast answer is always the first thing you have to do to solve problems is to
2782040	2786120	talk about them. So I think that as long as we have this, as you described, Groundhog Day of
2786120	2795080	Wokeness, we are not going to be unstuck and we're going to be in this sort of zero-sum
2796040	2804760	somewhat malthusian, ever nastier political kind of a context. I think there are,
2805560	2810920	there certainly are ways, there probably are ways all three of them could be
2812200	2817240	ways we could get unstuck in all three dimensions. I think there's some way that the
2818760	2823720	pure capitalism, pure globalism things probably don't quite work in economics.
2825320	2830440	I do think one could probably do something about the real estate problem. It's so
2830440	2837480	extraordinarily distorted. And so that's that, that there probably are things one can do. It's
2837480	2847960	very hard because you would destroy trillions of dollars in value in doing it. But that probably,
2848840	2853560	it has to give at some point. Maybe it's a technological fix. The way the Henry George
2853560	2859400	thing was historically solved was you had an open frontier in America. And then the frontier
2859400	2864520	closed in the late 19th century. So the railroads were the technology to open the frontier.
2864520	2870280	Eventually the frontier is populated, it gets closed. And then late 19th, early 20th century,
2870280	2875560	the cities start to have this gorgeous runaway real estate price effect, rising inequality,
2875560	2881320	and you get progressivism as a response to the closing of the frontier. And then in the 20th
2881320	2887800	century, in a way, another frontier got opened with the automobile and the highways and the suburbs.
2887800	2895640	And that relieved the pressure on the runaway costs. And then that technology has also run its
2895640	2901720	course. And there's a question, is there some way to reopen a frontier in real estate? And
2901720	2907240	probably the one where I think the jury is very out and doesn't look that promising in 2023,
2907480	2912040	it would be something like, could one really get remote work to work? Could the internet
2912040	2918920	be a way that people are not stuck in these cities? And that would reset all these real estate
2918920	2924360	values tremendously, because even in a rather densely populated country like England, there is
2924360	2930520	plenty of space if you're not forced to be in within the green belt of London itself. And
2930520	2938360	certainly the United States even more so. And then I think within the technology area,
2939560	2947640	my hopeful sense is that there is always a question, why did the technology slow down and
2948360	2954680	the science slow down? And the thing I'm hopeful on is that it was not that we just ran out of
2954680	2960360	ideas. It's that there were these deformations of culture, we became too risk averse, too bureaucratic,
2960440	2967400	too much peer review in the sciences. And I think we could be making a lot more progress
2967400	2973960	in a lot of areas. It's regulated, people are scared of technology. We don't want to minimize
2973960	2979800	or trivialize their fears. But I think you could have a very different balance there.
2980600	2986680	And then certainly the questions about the larger meaning of life or the meaning of history
2987560	2991960	are, you know, are ones that I think would all do well to confront more.
2995000	3001560	To take in a way what might be the most immediate part of what you've just said and said before,
3001560	3007080	I guess it implies, which I think is absolutely true, that the so-called consensus that prevails
3007080	3014120	between say, Sunak and Stammer is far more consensus on what we're not supposed to think about,
3014840	3019080	that it is on to anything positive. Because the big problems you've mentioned, the problems
3019080	3023400	stagnation in science, the problems of real estate in London and Oxford and throughout the
3023400	3028360	country, the problems of generational inequity in which young people can't find any way to live and
3028360	3033640	so they're all hardly addressed at all. There's a bit of commentary in the newspapers and so on.
3033640	3041080	But in terms of thinking about active solutions, there perhaps maybe some dim, subliminal awareness
3041080	3046280	among these politicians that the solving them would involve big losses for somebody.
3047800	3053560	Yes, or certainly big losses for them in the election. There's the felt sense. And so,
3054200	3059800	yeah, and it's certainly not limited to the UK, but certainly an outside perspective,
3059800	3064840	I would have it, because it seems to me that, yeah, there's a secret agreement between Sunak
3064920	3072360	and Stammer, let's say, to talk as much as possible about culture wars, take various
3072360	3078920	sides on those issues. And then if you have even basic economic questions like a runaway deficit
3078920	3086840	spending, and do you solve this with higher taxes or lower entitlements? And then they both have a
3086840	3091560	look ahead function where if we talk about that, we'll lose 10 or 15% of the voters.
3092360	3097160	I mean, maybe not quite as many for Sunak since it's hard to lose 10 or 15% of the voters.
3099480	3105640	But there's some kind of a look ahead function where we shouldn't touch that. But then
3107640	3112120	when everybody does that, when all the solutions are outside the Overton window,
3113080	3121080	we end up with, yeah, we're confined in this very narrow box and the Groundhog Day will
3121080	3126200	continue until at some point something really breaks. So there won't be a Nietzsche and Groundhog
3126200	3130920	Day, it won't really be eternal. It's going to break down, isn't it? I mean, that's one way or the
3130920	3136680	other, even if only for economic reasons, but we don't know when or how. Sure. Yeah, I think
3136680	3144920	there certainly are all kinds of dimensions one could point to where it is not simply stable.
3145880	3151640	The demographics are not stable. The deficits are not stable. We had pseudo stability and deficits
3151640	3156520	for 40 years in the United States and much of the Western world where the deficits were too big,
3156520	3161880	but the interest rates went steadily down. And something around that seems to have broken in
3161880	3169160	the last year or two. So I think even something as basic as deficits financed at 0% interest rates,
3169400	3175560	it seemed like the 2010s could go on forever and that seems over. And they haven't.
3176360	3186360	Yeah, ended with the 2020s. Yeah. Does that bleed back into the segue back into the cultural and
3186360	3194680	the religious questions you discussed? Because I guess part of the resistance to your analysis
3195240	3203960	of science is a kind of quasi religious conception of the salvific possibilities of science,
3203960	3213480	that science can do what religion hasn't done, which is to actually change worldly life in a way
3213480	3221240	which reads it of its deepest contradictions. And I guess if for some people, if they gave up that
3221240	3227800	faith in science, they would be left with nihilism or left with despair or left with unbearable
3227800	3234520	anxiety. Yeah, although it's sort of a, obviously there's a very complicated history of science,
3234520	3239000	and it was in some ways maybe a byproduct of Christianity and so it was an opposition to
3239000	3249000	Christianity. And certainly in its healthy, ambitious, early modern forms, whether it was
3249640	3257160	a substitute or a compliment to Christianity, it was supposed to be, it was somehow supposed
3257160	3262520	to be a vehicle for comparable transformation and sort of the indefinite prolongation of human life
3263720	3269800	was an early modern science project and people still believe very much in the 17th, 18th century.
3269800	3277160	And there was a sub movement within sort of the revolutionary Soviet politics. It was still very
3277160	3284840	healthy in the 1920s called Cosmism, where a part of the project of the revolution had to be to
3284840	3290040	physically resurrect all dead human beings. And because if science didn't do that, it would be
3290040	3294760	inferior to Christianity or something like that. That's sort of one of their slogans. They had to
3294760	3299880	adapt themselves, the cosmos to the Soviet and Bolshevik reality was, debt of the world unite.
3302200	3305800	Because they wanted to bring back not only not only that, everyone in the present generation
3305800	3309720	would live forever, but that all the people who'd ever died would come back.
3310280	3317000	And so there is this, let's say, anti-Christian or riveted from Christian, you know, a very
3317000	3323560	ambitious version of science. And of course, there is also a more defeatist version of science,
3323560	3326200	where science actually just tells us about limits and things you cannot do.
3327000	3333720	I don't know, I'll use a literary example when Hamlet's evil mother, Gertrude, says that all
3333720	3341640	that lives must die. The question you have is, is that a law of nature? Or is this just a
3341640	3347400	rationalization for the rottenness that is Denmark? Certainly, the early modern conception
3347400	3353080	was that you wanted to transcend this both in a Christian or a scientific form. And then,
3353080	3358840	yeah, late modernity, it's probably attributed more as a decay of science that this sort of ambition
3358840	3362040	is more a fringe science thing than a mainstream science thing.
3362040	3369160	And I guess there's also a kind of nihilistic version of science, a sort of brave new world
3369160	3378120	version in which sees itself as pacifying the spiritual and mental anguish and doubts of human
3378120	3383480	beings by giving them access to drugs and pornography and all kinds of things which
3383480	3388600	distract them forever from these fundamental existential questions, the religious questions.
3388760	3394040	What would work to exterminate religion wouldn't be, or to terminate the need for religion,
3394040	3399720	wouldn't be persecuting, and that obviously has never worked, but to try and put everyone asleep
3400360	3408200	with dreams of drug dreams, drug highs. And of course, drugs are a tremendous feature of our life
3408200	3414200	at the moment, aren't they, in many countries? I wouldn't even go that far. The line I was using
3414200	3418360	this is just the iPhones that distract you from your environment will distract you from
3418360	3423080	fact, you're in a 100 year old subway in London or New York or the environment hasn't changed.
3423560	3430840	And then again, I don't think one should make it fully intentional, but there is something about
3430840	3438360	certain narrow forms of technical progress that have more of this retarding effect elsewhere,
3438360	3446680	or this making us oblivious to what's going on effect. But yeah, I think most of it is not,
3447400	3453400	it's not supposed to be ambitious, world transforming. It is not at all early modern
3453400	3460440	science. It's much more, I don't know, probably the strongest science and one of the stronger
3460440	3467000	science and politics themes is always the climate change debate. And if you take climate change
3467000	3472360	seriously, there are all kinds of progressive science things one could do. You could be pushing
3472360	3476920	for the construction of hundreds of new nuclear reactors, you could be pushing for fusion. There's
3476920	3483080	sort of all kinds of ways that you could be concerned about climate change and lean into
3483960	3490840	rapidly progressing science. And then in practice, it's much more that maybe you should just ride
3490840	3498520	a bicycle or something like that. And so it's somehow a lot of science has this Luddite feel,
3498520	3502280	even though it's obviously, you can find lots of different things.
3502280	3509400	Or start eating insects rather than beef, because beef, but one, I mean, that thought
3511400	3517320	one of the functions of smartphones is to distract us from the fact that we're living in a
3517320	3524040	Victorian environment still with Victorian sewers and Victorian subways and Victorian buildings
3525240	3531720	is I think a very profound word thought because it suggests that one of the functions of technology,
3531720	3538280	which is something that affects the material world is to supplant the material world in our own
3538280	3543480	lives so that we live in a virtual world more and more of the time. Of course, it's got physical
3543480	3549400	roots, this virtual world. So if something goes wrong with the physical roots, if there is war or
3549400	3554920	terrorism or climate change or whatever, then it's all disrupted. But that's part of the way it works,
3554920	3562440	isn't it? Well, certainly, that's the part of technology that's been healthiest has been
3562440	3568600	still the most progressive is this narrow cone around this virtual world. I keep thinking that
3568680	3573800	you could do a lot more in these other areas. If I, again, come back to something like the real
3573800	3581160	estate housing version, this seems the furthest from technological innovation. I mean, there are
3581160	3585640	new building designs, you can build 100 story buildings that you could not build 20, 30 years ago.
3587160	3593560	There are presumably some new things one could even do there. But if too much of the economy
3593560	3600280	is anchored on things that are hard to improve or change, that is also a way in which progress
3600280	3603960	slows. So if we have an economy in the UK, and I'll make these numbers up where it's
3604760	3612040	50% real estate and 10% computers, then even if the 10% that is computers is somehow getting better
3612040	3619800	and better, if 50% that is real estate is very stuck, that is going to be at best a slowly improving
3619800	3624760	economy. And then the most important thing is somehow not going to be changing it. And then
3624760	3630440	that probably creates all kinds of weird side effects and incentives. So the hyper progressivism,
3630440	3638680	the hyper accelerationism that we are told we have by politicians and others by Blair, for example,
3638680	3647400	that we're accelerating in. It does not show up in the per capita GDP numbers. It does not show up
3647400	3653640	in incomes rising faster than rents. I just think the rebuttal is simply on the real estate side.
3655480	3659320	And then you can be told that people don't want to live in houses anymore. They don't want to
3659320	3663400	have families. They're conscious. You shouldn't have children because you're just beating insects.
3665880	3671240	But at some point, again, at some point, this is really a parody, not really progressivism.
3671240	3675640	I didn't attend it, but there was a meeting in London of Blair and some of his disciples at many
3675640	3681640	parties, including the Conservative Party, in which, for him, the next phase of acceleration was
3681640	3689240	precisely the one in which your analysis suggests there's been the most the largest and most neglected
3689240	3693720	stagnation in the technology, which is that all globalization might not have gone far enough.
3694600	3699560	We've retreated from it. We shouldn't have, but we have. It's still going to go on, but
3699560	3703560	we're going to try and we're resisting it. So how can we cope with the situation in which we're not
3704520	3708680	and getting enough acceleration from globalization, where we'll accelerate the technological side?
3708680	3714040	And yet, if what is accelerating, if it's going to be AI and the virtual world, I guess,
3714600	3720920	he thinks that we can solve our problems in medical care by AI, that's the solution for him.
3720920	3727800	Look, it's always dangerous for me to comment on too much on British politics, but my senses
3727880	3734280	that Blair occupies is very, very strange place where it is. It is this past. It obviously does
3734280	3741400	not work. We obviously cannot go back to the sort of globalization that he represented or doing more
3741400	3746600	of it. In some sense, doesn't work, but it never gets articulated. And so it has a very different
3747400	3753480	quality than, let's say, thatcherism where there's, you know, and again, I was in some ways very
3753480	3759400	sympathetic to Liz Truss, but there's some sense in which it didn't work. And somehow it's clear
3759400	3764760	that we somehow can't go back to thatcherism, or doing more of thatcherism isn't going to be a
3764760	3773000	solution. Whereas on the left, it's in this very strange in-between zone where somehow Blair is
3773000	3779240	not being run as a candidate for prime minister. Officially. Well, again, I'm just going, if he
3779240	3784760	ran officially, one suspects it would work very badly. But then, you know, if you're someone
3784760	3791560	like Starmer, you know, what labor leader do you want to emulate? Do you want to emulate Atlee,
3791560	3797160	which probably is not that, that doesn't work. And then maybe Blair is the only other one on offer.
3797160	3801640	And so that's sort of the default idea even though it never gets articulated, which tells you it's
3801640	3807000	probably not very good. Absolutely. I mean, I guess the difference is that when there's trust
3807000	3811960	wing of the Conservative Party wants to go back to Thatcher, because they see that as a radical
3811960	3815800	moment and they want to repeat the radical moments. But because radical moments are very hard to keep
3815800	3820840	repeating all the time. They're hard to repeat by doing the same thing. Doing the same thing.
3820840	3831240	So it's certainly, there was a one-time move to deregulate and lower taxes. And then not clear
3831240	3837160	what one can do. Doing it the second time does as much good. You know, McKinsey. McKinsey was a
3837160	3841960	real thing in 1985 in the United States. If you hired a consultant, they actually helped you improve
3841960	3847160	your company, you know, because the companies were badly run. At this point, McKinsey is a total
3847160	3857800	racket. It's just all fake. And so if you have a Reagan, you know, the Reagan Thatcher administration,
3857880	3861560	they empowered McKinsey because they allowed more companies to be acquired and more M&A
3861560	3866760	activity to happen. And it was a, you know, a somewhat brutal, but very powerful reorganization
3866760	3870920	of society. And that was possible. And that was the right thing to do in the 1980s. You know,
3870920	3877000	at this point, McKinsey is not ever going to be anything other than a super corrupt fake racket
3877000	3883000	in 2023. And so we can't go back to that specific thing, you know. It's fascinating the way in
3883000	3888440	which the product of these revolutionary changes in the economy and society and thinking produces
3888440	3893240	a proliferation of rackets in science too. And I guess that's connected with
3894360	3900840	fakery. Fakery, that's to say, so many of the phenomena around us are fakery.
3901640	3909800	I don't know if it has to happen that way, but one of my colleagues, maybe this would be another
3910520	3920040	link, the sciences to the wokeness problem, is that institutions have embedded growth
3920040	3928440	obligations, egos, in short, EGO, embedded growth obligations. And so a healthy institution,
3928440	3932360	in some sense, is one that has this exponential growth. And if you have exponential growth,
3932360	3936520	there will be more jobs and everyone can get promoted. And there's sort of a way that if a
3936520	3942280	company has exponential growth, that's a healthy company. And there are other versions of this in
3942280	3949240	different forms. And then at some point, maybe the growth stops. And when the growth stops,
3950520	3955640	you have a choice. You can maybe become more honest and say, well, you know,
3956520	3960760	the university isn't growing anymore, there'll be very few faculty slots available.
3961240	3967480	If you're in a PhD program, we're going to make sure that 80% of the students
3968520	3971560	drop out of the program within six months, so they don't waste their time.
3972600	3980200	And we're going to be honest about the fact that there's no growth. Or the thing that I think
3980200	3986440	unfortunately happens a great deal is you just lie. And the institutions become sociopathic,
3986520	3991480	where they pretend that the growth is still going on. And then it's only years and years later
3991480	3997560	that people figure out that there are no jobs. And the wokeness was just,
3998280	4003480	it's just a distraction. It's sort of like, if you have 10 graduate students in a chemistry
4003480	4008520	program, and there's a job for only one of them, and you're having fist fights over beakers and
4008520	4014120	Bunsen burners, and you're in the sort of Malthusian struggle, and there's one person who says
4014120	4018520	something slightly racist or slightly inappropriate. I mean, it's such a relief,
4018520	4026040	you can throw that one person off the overcrowded bus, right? So these are natural things to
4026040	4034680	happen, but surely we would do better to find ways to get back to growth in as many places
4034680	4039400	of our society as possible. Indeed, because what you just said is that the solution to
4039400	4045720	non-growth is persecution. You can eliminate various people from the competition by
4046840	4053000	canceling them, pushing them out. They're not there anymore. They're what was termed in the first
4053000	4059640	Constitution of the Soviet Union back, I think in 1918, 1919, former persons. So if you make
4059640	4064760	these people former persons, at least they're not competitors anymore, they're out. So that's a very,
4064840	4070440	again, unless we grow in certain ways in knowledge and technology in a genuine way,
4070440	4074680	we're going to have this persecutory mentality. It has a function, it has a role,
4074680	4077640	even an economic or a career structure role and so on.
4077640	4082680	But it's always important to understand the persecution is not as ideological as it's
4082680	4089160	dressed up to be. So because if it's actually driven by scarcity, you will just have scarcity.
4090040	4095720	The US academic version of this, when I wrote the diversity myth book in the early 90s,
4095720	4100760	I was thinking to myself, academia discriminates against conservatives, libertarians like myself.
4102040	4108040	I think that was true for one cohort of baby boomer academics who got PhDs in the 70s and
4108040	4113480	couldn't get tenure in the 80s in the US. But by my generation, where I would have gotten a PhD in
4113480	4118760	the 1990s, it was obvious there was no job because I was conservative. And so the conservatives were
4118760	4121880	actually not discriminated against. It was the liberals that were discriminated against who were
4121880	4128280	Gen X, millennial, because they all had the delusion that it was, yeah, it was kind of zero
4128280	4132920	sum. But as long as you've told the correct party line, yes, we're safe. And that was, of course,
4132920	4139240	also the delusion that the party line communists had when they were disproportionately targeted
4139240	4145720	by the Stalin show trials in the 1930s. The Soviet term for it was always section 58 of the
4145720	4150600	Soviet penal code was that you were guilty of counter-revolutionary activity. And I think the
4150600	4155160	key to understanding that was that everybody was guilty. And there were just some people who
4155160	4161080	were not being prosecuted for the time being by the government. And so in this world of extreme
4161080	4168680	scarcity, eventually everybody gets somehow deplatformed or ejected or something like that,
4169800	4174200	just about. I mean, the Soviet analogies are very rich. I think it was another Soviet term,
4174200	4178760	which was telling lies that no one believes in. And that was seen as an essential thing,
4178760	4183000	because one of the things, if you're surrounded by lies and every single person, including the
4183000	4188360	people who tell them, know that they're lies, know that it's not the truth, then it sort of hinges
4188360	4193160	you to some extent. And it makes you scared. And also because the party line, what determines what's
4193160	4198040	a lie and what's not, changes inexplicably all the time. And I think in a way we've progressed
4198040	4202040	beyond the Soviets now in that respect, because we've really got to the point where no one really
4202120	4206360	knows what the party line is, but everyone's terrified from deviating from it. It's the
4206360	4214680	postmodern version of the party. Yeah, I think it's always so hard to know exactly what's going
4214680	4223160	on. We're in this strange postmodern world. I think people are generally quite cynical.
4223160	4227480	They don't believe all the lies they're being told. It gets discounted pretty heavily.
4228440	4234520	But nevertheless, it has this effect where somehow we can't focus on the really important
4234520	4239880	things that are going on of the sort that I talked about. And so it does have this. And
4239880	4248200	I'll come back to this metaphor that it is like this hypnotic magic trick. And the important
4248200	4252200	thing is not what the magician is doing, but what the magician is distracting us from.
4252520	4259320	And maybe even the magician is taken in by the sleight of hand. Maybe it's easier to
4261000	4265720	live with oneself as a magician, a political magician, a technological magician,
4266440	4270120	if you really think there's something in it, although you can never quite see what it is,
4270120	4275080	because the trick is almost bigger than you. There's a whole division among magicians between
4275080	4278440	the ones, there's a class that claimed that it's real and there's a class that claimed that it's
4278440	4284200	fake. And so yes, that is, that is, I believe the sociology of magicians is they're those two
4284200	4292200	competing camps. How far is there just social science fit into this? There was a wonderful book
4292200	4297640	about 70 years ago by, not 70 years ago, in the 70s, 1970s, by the sociologists,
4297640	4301880	poly sociologists, I knew, there was a marvellous book in every way, but the very best part of it
4301880	4309720	was that it was called Social Sciences as Sorcery in 1970s. And he was arguing that the whole
4310360	4315000	80 or 90, not that there's no social science or that there can't be, didn't think that, he thought
4315000	4321880	there was and there could be more of it, but that much of it was just the kind of magical
4321880	4329320	transposition of terms, forms of distraction from real problems that you're talking about,
4329320	4335800	that actually a lot of it was, it was theorized and systematized distraction. So if you talk about
4337880	4342920	identity struggles, you're missing out very profound structural inequalities, economic
4342920	4351320	and temperature. He took examples of plagues and even of syphilis in which people talked about in
4351320	4355400	all sorts of complex ways of power structures, but the basic thing is the thing itself, the
4355400	4359160	material thing. It's just a way of avoiding contact with the material world, isn't it?
4359160	4364280	Yeah, I wouldn't, it feels like that's slightly too strong since I think I gave, I'm not sure it
4364280	4371560	was, I wouldn't want to call it a social science speech today, but some kind of attempt to analyze
4371560	4379000	these things in terms of the history, politics, sociology, psychology of our of our societies.
4379000	4387480	Yes, I think a lot of these soft fields do have this quality that they are, I want to say that
4387480	4393080	they are in theory extremely important and there's something about them that is an extremely
4393080	4400120	important way at getting at things and then for that reason they're also extremely prone to
4400120	4406200	politicization of various sorts. One of the things I always like to say is that any field that has
4406200	4413080	the term science in it should always be suspicious because it's sort of, it's exaggerating, it's
4413160	4419320	social science, political science, climate science, even computer science, it started as computer
4419320	4424200	science because it had a very serious inferiority complex to math and electrical engineering.
4425080	4429400	And it's not, I think, accidental, and though it's often forgotten that both of the great
4430120	4435160	terrible movements, the 20th century communism and Nazism actually, which is often seen as
4435160	4442040	anti-scientific, but was in fact often defended in the 30s and 20s and then 40s by biological or
4442040	4449800	racial science that just as dialectical materialism, diamat as it was called then, was the greatest
4449800	4456680	science that ever been. So these repressive movements, murderous movements, movements which
4456680	4461400	killed millions of people but also killed off thought wherever they could, well all advanced,
4461400	4464360	they all thought it very important to call themselves science.
4464920	4471480	Well, it's, I don't know, this may be sort of a philosophy of science thought I have is that
4472520	4478200	I think in theory what science is supposed to do is fight a two front war against excessive
4478200	4484920	dogmatism and excessive skepticism. And if you're, and so excessive dogmatism is like, I know, the
4484920	4490120	decayed Aristotelianism of the medieval church and that was what science was in some ways fighting
4490120	4496040	in the 17th and 18th century. And then excessive skepticism, if I can't trust my senses and I
4496040	4500600	don't know whether I'm sitting in front of you, if you're too skeptical, you also can't do science.
4500600	4506680	And then these two front wars intention, it's actually hard to get that balance,
4507480	4512200	it's very hard to get that balance right. Probably the early modern version I would say was
4512280	4521800	more anti-dogmatism than anti-skepticism. If we fast forward to 2023 and there are all kinds of
4521800	4527960	things where I know the scientific establishment, the leading scientists would caution us against
4527960	4532120	being too skeptical, not supposed to be vaccine skeptics, we're not supposed to be climate science
4532120	4539880	skeptics, we're not supposed, it's fighting skepticism in all its forms. And then I'd be
4539880	4543480	hard-pressed, I could maybe hold a gun to my head, I might be able to come up with one or two things,
4543480	4547880	but I'd be very hard-pressed to come up with a single instance where a scientist would say,
4547880	4553640	this is an area where science is too dogmatic today in 2023. The string theorists wouldn't
4553640	4560680	say we're too dogmatic about string theory, but just very, very hard-pressed to say where it's
4560680	4568280	too dogmatic. And that surely tells us that somehow it has degenerated into something that's
4569240	4573800	more dogmatic than the medieval church. If you're just fighting skepticism, it tells you
4573800	4581080	you're a dogman. That's probably there was some version of this with the totalitarian science
4581080	4587640	of the early 20th century, where it leveraged the term, so it was somehow still pretending to
4587640	4596840	be anti-dogmatism, anti-supernatural, anti-that sort of stuff, but in reality the anti-skepticism
4596840	4602280	dominated. Which leaves us in a situation with the near impossibility of empiricism
4603480	4608360	in the sense of a way of thinking which tries to connect with facts in the world. So if you say,
4608360	4615800	well actually racism in certain contexts is less prevalent than these claims which have been made,
4615800	4622360	suggest someone will say, you think that because you're a racist. You're neglecting the systematic
4622360	4629320	structural hidden subterranean patterns, the occult patterns of racism, so to speak, which are
4629320	4635640	there. So and this by the way is trying to me as a feature of liberal thought in even in its attempt
4635640	4642360	to prescribe solutions, which is that if a liberal experiment doesn't work, say liberal experiments
4642360	4647560	in drug legalization or drug decriminalization, the solutions are not to say they've been falsified,
4647560	4653000	it's to say double up, triple up, quadruple up, do it three or four times and then it will work.
4654280	4659560	So can we get, I mean I wouldn't say get back to empirical thinking because I guess science was never
4659560	4665320	that closely empirical, but closer to it than we've been in which someone will accept that
4667000	4671560	we aren't too dogmatic about XYZ. Maybe we don't know the answer, maybe we've actually got to go
4671560	4676360	out and check things to see what's happening. Well you know there's empirical thinking, there's
4676440	4683640	analytical thinking. I would like us just to get back to thinking. The hardest of all. Let's try to do that.
4686760	4692760	I'm wondering if that might be the moment on which I can thank Peter for stimulating,
4694360	4701800	stirring and stimulating, fertilizing my thinking on all of these issues and whether we can all
4701800	4718200	thank him for coming here and enabling us to receive his thoughts and start thinking.
