 In this discussion, Jordan Peterson reflects on the nature of science and its evolution over time. He suggests that science is meant to balance between excessive dogmatism and excessive skepticism, a delicate equilibrium that is often difficult to maintain. He notes that in the early modern era, the focus was more on countering dogmatism, particularly the Aristotelianism upheld by the medieval church. In contrast, Peterson observes that today's scientific establishment seems to be more concerned with combating skepticism across various fields, such as vaccines and climate science, which may have led to a state of being overly dogmatic.

Peterson uses the example of totalitarian science in the early 20th century to illustrate how science could become dominated by anti-skepticism while still presenting itself as anti-dogmatic. This has resulted in a situation where empirical thinking, which involves connecting with facts and observable phenomena in the world, is compromised. In contemporary liberal thought, failed experiments are often not questioned but rather repeated until they are deemed successful, which Peterson sees as an avoidance of empirical falsification.

Peterson expresses a desire to return to more rigorous thinking, where claims and theories are subject to scrutiny and verification, rather than accepted or dismissed based on ideological biases or dogmatic adherence to a particular viewpoint. He encourages the audience to engage in empirical and analytical thinking, aiming for a more balanced and objective approach to understanding the world.

The conversation ends with Peterson thanking Peter for stimulating thought and discussion among the attendees, emphasizing the importance of engaging with challenging ideas to foster critical thinking and intellectual growth.
