1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,280
Thank you all very much for coming to this notable event, it's my honor as well as my

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:34,520
pleasure to very briefly introduce the lecture we're going to have from Peter Thiel and to

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,620
then be in conversation with him after that presentation. I should say that Peter, to me,

4
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:53,440
is interesting, is one of the most deeply reflective thinkers of our time and also in

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,880
some respects one of the most prophetic. In 1993 he published a book, The Diversity Myth,

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:10,360
on trends in academic thought based on his experiences in Stanford which aside from a

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:18,040
few changes in minor changes actually in vocabulary is as fresh today as it was then or indeed

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,520
fresher because much of what he has written about has come to pass since that time. But I

9
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:33,520
think what's distinctive and important for me and I believe Peter will talk about it tonight

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:45,760
is the way in which he tries to dig into the deeper causes and sources and roots of present

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,920
intellectual and cultural as well as economic and political trends and to unstick our thinking

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,800
because to unfix it because just as this book I think illustrates we've not moved on, we live

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:11,240
in a perpetual groundhog day in terms of discourse and political thinking. In my smaller way I found

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:19,400
that myself, I'm still sometimes writing what I wrote in 1989 not simply because I'm not very

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:28,240
original but also because it still seems true or sometimes truer. So I think to dig into this

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:37,320
as deeply as Peter does is very very rare or unique and so I myself am enormously looking

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,960
forward to hearing what he has to say tonight and also talking with him after he said it. Thank you

18
00:02:44,960 --> 00:03:04,840
very much. Thank you very much. It's a tremendous honor to be here this afternoon. I was involved

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,240
in a lot of these culture wars, campus wars in the late 1980s, early 1990s at Stanford University.

20
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:21,520
I started one of these alternative conservative newspapers and a lot of these debates had the

21
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,720
quality of these various crazy campus hijinks that then at the same time occasionally would

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,720
escalate into things that might be of some larger or even cosmic importance. One of the

23
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Stanford debates that really was pivotal in the late 1980s involved a debate around the

24
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,760
core Western civilization class, Western culture. It was a protest in 1987 where the chant at the

25
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,720
protest was, hey, hey, ho, ho, Western cultures got to go. And it was in one sense about this

26
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,440
year-long freshman class. On another level of course it was about a repudiation of the

27
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,000
entire civilization that was being studied in that class, something somewhat more cosmic.

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,160
And then I covered a lot of these things and then a friend and I ended up writing a book,

29
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,800
The Diversity Myth, a few years later. I'll start by reading an excerpt from that and then I want

30
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,720
to give a little bit of a retrospective of where I was right, where I was wrong, where I was not

31
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:36,120
even wrong. And so one of the books that replaced Shakespeare was a book by Aimee CÃ©saire,

32
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,240
A Tempest, replaces The Tempest and it's all this inverted anti-colonial hierarchy where

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:52,280
Caliban is a revolutionary hero, Prospero is an evil colonialist. And so the final indignant

34
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:00,240
trade by Caliban and A Tempest. Understand what I say, Prospero, for years I bowed my head,

35
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,400
for years I took it, all of it, your insults, your ingratitude, and worst of all, more grading than

36
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,320
all the rest, your condescension. But now it's over. Over, do you hear? Of course at the moment

37
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,400
you're still stronger than I am, but I don't give a damn for your power or for your dogs or your

38
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,400
police or your inventions. And do you know why? It's because I know I'll get you. And you lied to

39
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,000
me so much about the world, about yourself, that you ended up by imposing it on me, an image of

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,680
myself, underdeveloping your words, incompetent. That's how you made me see myself and I loathe

41
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,200
that image and it's false. And I know that one day my bare fist, just that, will be enough to crush

42
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,440
your world, the old world is falling apart. And by the way, you have a chance to get it over with,

43
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,960
you can fuck off. You can go back to Europe, but in a pig's eye you will. I'm sure you won't

44
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,600
leave, you make me laugh with your mission, your vocation, your vocation is to give me shit. And

45
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,720
that's why you'll stay, just like those guys who founded the colonies and who now can't live

46
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,520
anywhere else. You're just an old colonial addict, that's what you are. And then this goes on for

47
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:15,080
250 pages where we go through things like this and sort of the somewhat pretentious idea that

48
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,280
David and I had in writing this book was we were speaking truth to power, that all that it took was

49
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,040
to sort of expose this and then you could ask questions. Well, is this new, is this an improved

50
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,280
version of Shakespeare or should one prefer the original? Is this really about multiculturalism

51
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,360
and non-western cultures or is it just all sort of an anti-western thing that drives it?

52
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,280
And then there were parts of it that felt a little bit contrived at the time where

53
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,920
we had to somehow make it relevant to the larger thing. And so we had the sort of

54
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,120
somewhat contrived construction where ideas have consequences and what happens in the university

55
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,040
will eventually spread beyond it. And then of course when you fast forward 30 years, there are

56
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,720
all these ways, a lot of this has held up quite well. And of course there are also ways where

57
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:13,960
it feels like it didn't matter at all. And so I don't know, I can brag that the book was prophetic

58
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,880
and that a lot of it came true. And then I can say that somehow all this effort in writing this

59
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,240
seemingly did not really matter and that on some level it was not about the logic of the ideas

60
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,640
at all. And what I want to reflect about is, and so even though I think the specific arguments

61
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,920
I would still defend is almost all right, I want to focus maybe a little bit more self-critically

62
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:51,000
on the places where I was not even wrong, where in some ways I didn't even understand what the

63
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,120
real issues were and think about a little bit what those were. And I think one piece of the book

64
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,080
that has held up relatively well is the title, The Diversity Myth. It's an ambiguous title. It can

65
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:12,680
mean on the one, you can put the stress on the word diversity in which case you can then have

66
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,520
debates of, you know, what does diversity mean and if it is some sort of celebration of difference

67
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,600
and then you can sort of debate what kinds of diversity should one have. And then there are

68
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,240
all sorts of libertarian and conservative critiques where, you know, you don't have real diversity

69
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,520
if you have a group of people who look different but think alike, you know, diversity in that sense

70
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,720
probably should involve more than just hiring the extras from the space cantina scene in Star Wars

71
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,440
or something like that. But there's a secondary, maybe somewhat deeper meaning of the title

72
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,040
where you put the stress on the word myth. And if you put the stress on the word myth,

73
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,640
you realize that diversity or multiculturalism or any of these words are extremely poorly defined

74
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,880
and that's the point. They're not supposed to be defined. They're sort of a, it's sort of like a

75
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:13,720
false god, idol, chivalrous, but it can never be really defined and it works maybe mostly as a sort

76
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:22,200
of diversion or divertissement, distraction from the things that are truly important. And it is

77
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,520
kind of like a, I don't know, it's a hypnotic magic show where you don't notice the gorilla jumping

78
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,640
up and down the back of the stage. You're just narrowly focused on what the tricks the magician

79
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:43,400
is doing. And I want to try to explore with you tonight is a map of the things that we've been

80
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:50,600
distracted from by focusing too much on wokeness, anti-wokeness, all these kinds of debates,

81
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,520
what were we missing? So three main ones, I'm going to go through

82
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,200
my brief comments tonight. The first one broadly is a category and this would be a libertarian

83
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,320
critique of diversity. It would also be a Marxist critique is that, is that when you focus on all

84
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,400
these forms of identity politics, you're not focused enough on economics. When you focus on,

85
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:29,080
you know, race, gender, etc., you're not going to focus enough on class. And so I think there is,

86
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,320
you know, and there is, even though I'm not a, not a communist or a Marxist, I find that even

87
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,440
the Marxist critique probably has quite a bit to it where if you had a, you know, what would be a

88
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:48,920
Marxist analysis of a diversity administrator? And if you had Karl Marx or Rosa Luxemburg here,

89
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,040
I think they would, they would suggest that these people are roughly in the same category

90
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,920
as a bank robber or a prostitute because they're sort of a, it's a form of crony capitalism.

91
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,160
It's sort of a reactionary class that's somehow taking advantage of the system. And then if we

92
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,440
actually sort of look at the history of this where, you know, in some ways cultural Marxism

93
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,600
replaced real Marxism, you know, in the 1970s, it roughly at least correlates with the period when,

94
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:28,280
you know, inequality grew massively when the economy started to stagnate. And so when we,

95
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,080
when we stopped thinking about the economy, there are sort of various perspectives from

96
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,160
both the left or right economics perspective, where something there ceased to work all that,

97
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,480
all that wealth. And, and then of course, even, you know, economics is sort of somehow

98
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,800
in a libertarian or Marxist form, it grounds you into, into substantive material type things.

99
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,960
But maybe the, the sort of libertarian Marxist synthesis that I would want to explore a little

100
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:05,640
bit more is the Henry George, the late 19th century economists to in the late 19th century was seen as

101
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,880
pretty socialist today he's seen as pretty libertarian, which I think doesn't simply

102
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,880
reflect sort of a way in which our society has changed. But from the Henry George perspective,

103
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,880
the economic relation that one always needed to look at was land ownership, real estate,

104
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,160
distortions in real estate. And this is the the key driver. And I want to submit that

105
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,000
if there is an area of economics that we should pay more attention to it is, it is something

106
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,680
like that that there's something about a georgist analysis of real estate that is

107
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,560
extremely suggested of some very crazy things that have happened in the last 50 years in our society.

108
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,880
One of the, one of the numbers I've seen on this and if you look at real estate in London,

109
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,320
it has an elasticity of minus two, which means that if you were to increase the supply of housing

110
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:07,000
by 1%, the average price would go down 2%. And if you multiply in a 1.01 by 0.98,

111
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,760
you get a smaller number. And this leads the paradoxical result that the more housing you

112
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,720
build in London, the less it is collectively worth. And, and so when you have a market that is

113
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,200
this strangely dysfunctional, some, you know, extremely odd sorts of things start to happen.

114
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,360
It, and, and, and you have to sort of ask questions whether there is a kind of

115
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,680
crony capitalism racket that, that, that starts to happen in a lot of different ways where,

116
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,600
you know, if you think about the, the, the immigration debates in the UK or the United

117
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,320
States, that there are all sorts of, you know, extremely politically correct and extremely

118
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,680
politically incorrect arguments on immigration. But, but the sort of basic George's economics

119
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:04,200
argument is, you know, if you add 2%, 3% a year immigration to the UK and the inelasticity is

120
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,000
two to one, then, you know, London house prices will go up 4% to 6% a year. And, and then this is

121
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,400
basically an extremely regressive tax on the half of the population that doesn't own houses.

122
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,880
It's an extremely regressive tax on young people. And it's basically a formula for left-wing

123
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,120
radicalization of the population over time. And that's, that's what we need to be able to now

124
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,800
analyze. And I would be probably open to, you know, unrestrictive immigration. If you could

125
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,240
build more housing, I think, you know, Elon will get to Mars before that happens in the UK.

126
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,440
And then if we, you know, if we, if we look at something, you know, even more prosaic like,

127
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,800
like at Oxford, one of the news items I was, I was reading was, I think the, you know,

128
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,760
relative to incomes, the cost of housing is, is among the worst in the UK. And it's like a,

129
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,920
you know, mini London or a hyper London or something like that is, is Oxford.

130
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:17,320
The J.R.R. Tolkien house is for sale for 4.5 million pounds. And I would submit to you that if a,

131
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,880
if an Oxford professor were to buy that house, probably the university would be justified in

132
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,040
starting an inquiry into where the professor got the money to do that. And, and you have to,

133
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,440
you have to sort of ask, you know, what, what are, you know, and then of course, if you can't

134
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,800
have single family housing, if there is no family formation possible for anybody in academia,

135
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,400
you know, is it really any wonder that you get this kind of nihilistic proletarianization of,

136
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,720
of the faculty of the students of the younger generation? And where if you do not solve this

137
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,680
sort of problem, you know, it doesn't matter what you do with all these other debates.

138
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:09,640
To use, to use an American example, you know, 2007, San Francisco, New York, you know,

139
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,240
I thought we were at a ridiculous housing bubble. Prices were, you know, completely insane. The

140
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,160
rents were out of control. And the same thing in London 2007. If you had told me, you know,

141
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,360
we'll fast forward to 2023, the prices are going to double. So this is just completely

142
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,880
impossible. How would this, how could this possibly happen? If people would move, they moved to a

143
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,600
different place. And, and, and if you had said, well, but, but just, just assume they doubled,

144
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,440
how, how, you know, what would have happened? And I would, I'd be tempted. I don't know if I

145
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,240
would have predicted this, but retrospectively, one might say, there must have been some crazy

146
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,840
ideology that infested people's minds. And, and so, you know, if you're, you know, if you're a gay

147
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,760
person living in Manhattan, maybe you're told that if you move to a suburb, you'll be beaten up by

148
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,760
people with bats. And so you have to pay a gay tax and live in a big city. Or if you're a woman

149
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,000
living in a rat infested apartment in San Francisco, and you fantasize about a nice

150
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:20,760
suburban house in Reno, Nevada, maybe you will be told that, well, if you move to Reno, Nevada,

151
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,520
you're going to be chained to your bed until you are forced to carry a baby to term. And,

152
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,400
and that sort of all of these kinds of things would have intensified. Now, I don't have to,

153
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,040
you know, so, so, you know, if we analyze wokeness in terms of real estate, you don't have to,

154
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,720
you know, you don't have to go the full conspiracy theory. So I'm not, you know, I'm not arguing

155
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:53,880
that something like Roe v. Wade being overturned was a conspiracy by left-wing urban slumlords

156
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,720
in the U.S. or something like this. But, but if you have a negative in the elasticity of the

157
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,120
sort I described with London, the kinds, you know, where this creates trillions of dollars

158
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:13,080
of value that gets distributed, redistributed, shifted in a sort of socially toxic way.

159
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,400
Isn't it even odd for us not to ask the question, maybe not a full intentional conspiracy,

160
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,240
but at least it's an emergent property. It's the kind of thing that we, we tolerate. I will

161
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:33,080
leave it as a politically incorrect exercise to you in this room to think about the craziest

162
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:43,960
woke excess in the U.K. of the last 10 years or so. And then, and then think about how it

163
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:53,320
increased aggregate housing prices in the U.K. And again, not, not saying it's causal, but just

164
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:01,480
saying that maybe, maybe if you could stop the housing racket, you'd start to get to the roots

165
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:10,040
of, of this woke, this woke disease. Now, now when we move beyond this sort of very,

166
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:19,000
very stuck economy, one of the other, a second, a second big area where this, this focus on

167
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:27,560
identity politics, diversity tends to focus us on all these debates within the humanities. And

168
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,560
this is, this was also the, the direction of, of the diversity in this book. You just go through

169
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,600
all, all these things that go wrong in the humanities and in the sort of, in the liberal arts,

170
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:47,960
things like that. And the, the, the, the, the, the sort of idea that I've come to over the last

171
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:58,360
15, 20 years is that perhaps just as broken as the humanities are the sciences, broadly speaking,

172
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,320
that they are not, they are no longer progressing. They are, for the most part, pretty stuck. It's a

173
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:12,840
harder case to make because science is a harder thing to understand. And, but, you know, when I

174
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,000
was, when I was an undergraduate in the late 1980s, most of the science fields or

175
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,960
most of the engineering fields one could have gone into would have been the wrong fields,

176
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,680
you know, nuclear engineering, aero astro engineering, terrible ideas already in the late

177
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,440
80s, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, physics, chemistry, all these sort of science areas

178
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,000
somehow ended up being dead end. I think electrical engineering still barely worked for a while.

179
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,920
And then really the only thing that, that, that, that had some sort of a future was, was

180
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:53,800
computer science, which was in the late 80s, kind of a, sort of a, a field of people who couldn't

181
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,680
handle the, the hardness of electrical engineering or math, sort of dropped out of

182
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,480
electrical engineering and became a computer programmer. But, but the, you know, the rough

183
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,480
picture of, of scientific technological progress I have is that, you know, for maybe the last 50

184
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,200
years, we've had, you know, a narrow cone of progress around the world of bits, computers,

185
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,080
internet, mobile internet software, but that the world of atoms, you know, where, which is the

186
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,400
world we are embedded in, in some sense, matters more to us as human beings has been strangely

187
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,240
stuck. And this is, you know, this is even in the word technology, which, you know, in some ways

188
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,080
technology is just that, that's, that, which is progressing. And today technology has been

189
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,400
collapsed to IT, information technology, because it is just this world of bits. If you use the word

190
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,160
technology in 1973, it would have meant computers, but it also meant new medicines. It was meant the

191
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,000
green revolution in agriculture. It would have meant, you know, supersonic aviation. It would

192
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,080
have meant space travel. Technology was advancing on many, many different fronts. And, and, you

193
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,840
know, in a, in a world where this is stuck, and we can't even, we're not even paying attention to it,

194
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:18,120
that, that surely is, is a, is a big defect. The sort of US analogy that I've used on this is that,

195
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,240
you know, if you ask the question, you know, are the humanities or the sciences less healthy,

196
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,400
the sort of governmental analogy would be, is the Department of Motor Vehicles

197
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,880
better or worse run than the NSA, the National Security Agency, or maybe the,

198
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,200
maybe the British version would be something like the post office versus GCHQ. And the,

199
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,440
the seemingly straightforward answer is obviously the post office is not well run, or the DMV is

200
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,960
not well run in the US, and everybody can see it, just like the humanities are quite obviously

201
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,880
sort of broken. But, but surely the more plausible answer is that the things you don't understand

202
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,840
and can't see are more corrupt and that where you have, you know, these ever narrower groups of

203
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,640
guardians guarding themselves, the string theorists guarding the string theorists, the cancer researchers

204
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,240
telling us about how great they all are and how they're all going to have these breakthroughs in

205
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,640
the next two years. That's surely the thing one should be more suspicious about. One of my,

206
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,640
one of my friends worked for, was, was in the PhD physics department at Stanford, his advisor,

207
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:31,160
Bob Laughlin, got a Nobel Prize in physics in the late 1990s. And Laughlin suffered from the

208
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,760
supreme delusion that once he got a Nobel Prize in physics, he actually had, he finally had academic

209
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,760
freedom and he could do whatever he wanted. And he decided that he was going to investigate these,

210
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,640
you know, some areas in science that were truly taboo. And, you know, there's obviously stuff you

211
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,640
can't ask questions about climate change or evolution or, you know, even stem cell research is

212
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,600
probably, you know, allowed to ask too many questions about that. But he decided to go into

213
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,320
something far more taboo than any of those things. And it was, he started with the premise that most

214
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,440
of these scientists were actually just defrauding the government. They were engaged in semi fraudulent

215
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,120
research. And they were, they shouldn't, you know, he worked on high temperature superconductors.

216
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,200
He told me once that he thought, you know, there were 50,000 papers written in that field and only

217
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,600
about 25 of the 50,000 deserved to be published. And, and they started with, you know, they started

218
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,200
with an inquest into the Stanford biology department, where he basically believed that most of these

219
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,280
people had, you know, effectively stolen money from the government. And there's been since then

220
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,040
a sort of a replication crisis in science that people have made more of. But the replication

221
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,720
crisis, it always gets narrated in the slightly politically correct way, where we don't actually

222
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,320
mention the specific names. Lawful inside, no, I'm just going to mention the names of all the people.

223
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,960
And here's the list of people who are stealing money. And as you can imagine this, you, I don't

224
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,280
tell you how it ended, but he got promptly defunded. His students couldn't get PhDs anymore. And

225
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,640
he at least got some kind of education about academic freedom from this process.

226
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,760
And so, so, and so I think that, that, you know, I think in a, in a debate,

227
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,520
if you have an argument, there maybe are always, I think, two fundamental ways one can try to

228
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,080
make a case. And you can go after your opponent, you can go after the enemy at the weakest point,

229
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,640
which is where you're most likely to score a tactical victory. Or you can go after your

230
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:44,120
enemy at the strongest point. And, and if we, if we criticize the universities for the humanities,

231
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,200
that's in some sense, what, I don't know, the central left, the law of administrative establishment

232
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,280
wants us to do, we can, we can occasionally win some tactical victories. But, but, you know, the,

233
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:03,080
where, where they get, you know, their sense of validation, their sense that everything is still

234
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,760
healthy and great is the sciences. And if you can, if you can show that the sciences are more

235
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,240
corrupt than the humanities, it's harder to do. But if you can do that, you will win game set match.

236
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,520
And it's something, you know, I'm not, you know, it's always very difficult to do this with something

237
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,720
like, the way I, I would attempt it to make the argument is something like, you know, the string

238
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,880
theorists and physics are the smartest physics people, and they've been stuck for 40 years.

239
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,240
And, and the physics people are the smartest people. And so by some principle of transitivities,

240
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,880
string theorists have been doing nothing. There for everybody else has been doing nothing as well.

241
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,120
And something, something like that would be the rough way, the rough way I would, I would make

242
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:53,960
this, this sort of argument. Now, if we combine these, these two, two big things we're being distracted

243
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,920
from, we're being distracted from the economy, even in its most basic forms, like real estate,

244
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:06,120
we're being distracted from, from science. You know, and then in some ways things have

245
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,000
not been healthy in the economy and science, they've not been progressing, the GDP has not

246
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,360
been growing in a balanced way for quite some time. There's always a question, you know, could we,

247
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,680
and the wokeness is distracting us from, from these things, from going back to these things.

248
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,480
If we, if we focused on them, would we be able, would we be able to solve, you know, all of our

249
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:38,200
problems and sort of as a, as maybe a little bit of an aside here, I, I think, I think the, the

250
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:46,280
temptation has always been to find a straightforwardly economic solution to, you know, my, my version is

251
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,360
broadly science and tech have been stagnant for something like 50 years. And the temptation

252
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,880
is, has been to find some kind of economic fix where we don't, because getting science and tech

253
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,520
back on track, it does sound pretty hard. And I think the reason we haven't been transparently

254
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,440
stuck for 50 years is there were actually two one time economic fixes that did not involve science

255
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,360
and tech that were done. There was a, you know, there was a right wing Reagan Thatcher fix in the

256
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:24,120
1980s. And there was a one time solution where you could cut taxes, deregulate, allow lots of

257
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,200
murders and acquisitions to happen. And you could one time gain enormous, an enormous lift for the

258
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,920
whole economy. But it doesn't continue. If you rate lower taxes from 70% marginal rates to 28%

259
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,240
percent, like they did in the US. But that's a one time lift. It worked from 1983 to 1989. And

260
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,320
then by the late 80s, it was exhausted. And we went back to the cultural war debates that

261
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,960
from the 1970s, they came back in the early 90s. And then there was a one time Clinton Blair

262
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:03,880
solution circa 1995 to 2007, which was globalization. And it was also a way to increase GDP. It was

263
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,600
probably a far more ruthless, ruthless way to do it than capitalism. It created far more inequality.

264
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,160
The genie coefficient went up way more under Clinton than under Reagan in the United States.

265
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,760
But it also, you know, there were some gains from that. Probably were some long term costs from

266
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:32,360
that as well. But they both seem really, really hard to do. The probably there's a way in which the

267
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,680
center right isn't a healthier place in the center left, because on the center right, we don't really

268
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,360
think we can go back to to Reaganism. On the center left, there's still some idea that they can go

269
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,280
back to Clintonism or, you know, you know, going back to that through the UK seems hard. Going back

270
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:58,440
to Blair seems like maybe that's a mistake we still have to have to make in the UK. But I think

271
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:06,200
but certainly if we if we can't think about the economic issues more clearly, the real estate

272
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,800
issues more clearly, and probably if we can't think about the science and tech issues, we don't

273
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:19,480
even have don't even have a hope to get back to a genuinely progressing society. Let me let me

274
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,920
say something about maybe a third category that's sort of maybe even bigger than let's say the economy

275
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:36,360
or, you know, science writ large. And that is that is something like, you know, the biggest,

276
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,680
you know, I don't know, the biggest possible topic that one could have would be something

277
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,000
like God. It's something like Anselm's ontological proof is that there's nothing that you can imagine

278
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,040
that's bigger than God. And if and if these debates have distracted us from the economy

279
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,160
and from science, they probably also have distracted us from questions of religion

280
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,760
of God of the Christian God. And and so that would be sort of my my candidate for the biggest

281
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:11,080
thing possible that we've been distracted from. And as with the sciences and with the economics,

282
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:18,840
it also it's an odd thing for us to be distracted from because it is so suggestive and has so many

283
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:27,800
different ways that this kind of debate should be reframed. And in particular,

284
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,360
you know, I want to do too much on metaphysics or things like that, but maybe just focus a little

285
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:43,800
bit on on a survey. What would Christianity tell us about history? And then what does this history,

286
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,960
you know, does that tell us something interesting about our current historical moment and

287
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:55,240
some of these some of these debates that that that we we've been touching on over the last

288
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:03,320
half hour here. And basically, the basic thesis I would have would be that

289
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,960
frames a little bit provocatively would be that, you know, perhaps the the original progressive

290
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,800
was simply the Christian God. You know, the New Testament supersedes the Old Testament,

291
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:23,000
that's the original idea of something like progressivism in in theology, the New is better than

292
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,240
the Old, the New transcends the Old, there's some sort of progress in history. And and of course,

293
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,760
there you know, there is sort of a a Jewish or pagan critique of Christianity that those of

294
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,080
sort of Christian need to take very seriously, which is, you know, you know, once you have this

295
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,920
principle of the of the New Testament superseded the New superseding the Old, is there a limit?

296
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:53,640
Do you is it just a slippery slope to communism, to wokeness, to to ultra Christian, to some kind

297
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:01,000
of antichristic parody? And and if you and if we had to concretize this even even more,

298
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,320
you know, there is something about, you know, there's there's one sense, of course, in which

299
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,440
what, you know, what the Bible says about the founding of the first city in the history of

300
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,160
the world is the same as what mythology tells us about the founding of the greatest city

301
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:25,800
in the history of the world. It starts with madness and murder. So Cain kills Abel, Romulus

302
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,440
kills Remus. But the difference between the biblical account, and the, let's say, the,

303
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:39,640
the, the conventional religious account is that the conventional religions take the side of the

304
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:46,120
city. It takes the side, Rome takes the side of Romulus, the Bible already, already at the beginning

305
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,400
in Genesis takes the side of Abel. And there's, of course, there's, you know, some sense in which

306
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,240
the entire biblical tradition is from the point of view of the victim, you know, the Jews, you know,

307
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,400
the normal way this the story of Exodus would be written would be from the point of view of the

308
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,720
Egyptians, or these troublemakers, and they, they got removed to be like the Oedipus myth,

309
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,280
where you get, you get rid of Oedipus, or something like that. And, and then, and then, of course,

310
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,440
there is, there is something like this in, in, in the, in the Christian story itself, where

311
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,560
it is a sort of inversion of perspectives, and this, this, you know, elevation of, of victimhood,

312
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:32,760
this idea that this is central, surely was, was, was one of the, one of the key pieces of it. You

313
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,360
know, it's, I think it's sort of a, the late Nietzsche, when he was, you know, when he was sort

314
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,240
of going, going mad, sort of had this, it was always, you know, we need to, we need to go back

315
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,880
to the strong classical world, where, you know, the victims don't complain, and all this stuff is,

316
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:55,240
you know, is sort of healthy and robust, and, and, but he sort of had some sense this was not the way

317
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,640
history was going, and sort of the, you know, sort of in his, towards his madness was sort of,

318
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,400
God of the Jews, you have won. He sort of has sense that the 20th century, we're about to go,

319
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:12,680
you know, into overdrive on victimology, and things of this sort. And, and if, if I had to

320
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,360
sort of differentiate, maybe, you know, if I had to ask, if I had to ask the question, how is,

321
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:27,960
the Christian view different from, let's say, the neo-pagan view, or the, or the, the woke hyper,

322
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,160
the woke ultra-Christian view, something like that, the, you know, and I find a lot that's

323
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,920
extremely tempting in a classical neo-pagan thing, I don't know, there's Bronze Age pervert, or,

324
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,600
you know, all these sort of online people where it's, why can't we just forget about the history,

325
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,600
and just move on, or, you know, just, or go back to nature, where, you know, nature,

326
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,920
nature as a word does not occur once in the Old Testament, and, you know, nature is bare,

327
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,240
red, and tooth, and claw, but if you take your bearings from nature, if you set nature as a

328
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,400
standard, then you don't, there's nothing that's really naturally evil, nothing that's naturally,

329
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,680
morally wrong, and that is sort of always the, let's say, the right-wing, pre-Christian,

330
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,480
neo-pagan, I don't know, Nietzschean, Renaissance, humanism, all these different versions,

331
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:27,560
temptation to, to sort of go back to that, and then on the, on the other side, I would say something

332
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:39,320
like the, let's say, the woke, liberal, you know, post-Christian, maybe ultra-Christian,

333
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,600
temptation, is that we are going to be more Christian than the Christians. We are going to,

334
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,760
we're going to, you know, you know, the poor shall inherit the earth, and we're going to have a

335
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,240
communist revolution, and we're going to accelerate the process, and we'll make it happen even faster,

336
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,560
we're going to accelerate the history even more, and there's always, you know, this question,

337
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,080
is it possible to be too Christian? And I think the answer is, in theory, no, but in practice,

338
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,920
surely yes, and that in practice, if you, you know, if you try to hit the accelerator on this,

339
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:18,440
you don't end up somehow finding a way to deal with the past, but you simply end up creating some

340
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,720
kind of eternal recurrence, some kind of perpetual motion machine that generates nothing but violence

341
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,760
and never-ending cycles of revenge. It is sort of another version of the Nietzschean eternal

342
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,720
recurrence. And so the, you know, the Christian, the Christian perspective on this is always

343
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,640
some paradoxical combination that, yes, there was original sin, yes, in the beginning was madness

344
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,800
and murder, yes, there was incredible injustice in the past, and then you need to forgive people.

345
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:59,640
And if you go with the neo-Pagan alt-right, whatever you want to call it, version,

346
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:07,800
and you say there was nothing bad in the past, I think that somehow doesn't stand up against the

347
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,520
historical pressure of Christianity against the working out of the Christian revelation in history.

348
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:20,840
If you, and then if you go with the woke thing, there's some sense in which it also doesn't

349
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,800
work for these opposite reasons. It's always hard to transpose this into these different

350
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,240
categories, but the political categories I'm always tempted to use are something like these 20th

351
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:41,160
century categories, fascism, communism, Christian democracy. And, you know, there's always sort

352
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:49,000
of a debate between fascism and communism. Are they equally bad? Is communism, is fascism

353
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,400
worse? And there's always a sort of conservative argument that they're roughly equally bad,

354
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,080
they both killed millions of people, and they're sort of in some ways just copies of one another.

355
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:06,760
But the sort of perspective leads me to think that we should very squarely say that something

356
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:14,520
like fascism was generally much less bad than something like communism, because fascism was

357
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,840
the past. And it was just, okay, fascist, the fascist claim was the victims were all guilty,

358
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,600
and it's the historical victims from middle ages, we're going to go back to them, and we're going

359
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:31,000
to victimize them. And then communism was sort of, it was like always like sort of more in the

360
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,480
future, and it was, we're going to go after the victimizers, we're going to victimize the victimizers,

361
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,880
we're sort of too clever by half. And that was always the far more powerful, the far greater

362
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,920
temptation in our world. And that's why, you know, even if someone like Bronze Age pervert or

363
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:58,360
Iron Rand is somehow wrong in their sort of whitewashing of the past, it's probably,

364
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,040
it probably is always at the end of the day, the more innocent mistake to make,

365
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,840
because we're in this in this world, we're something like the hyper-Christian

366
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:16,040
wokeness, the original sin with no hope of forgiveness is the greater temptation.

367
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:28,440
You know, let me end with maybe one thought, I've given you three very big things that we've

368
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:36,920
been distracted from the economy, science and tech broadly, you know, the Christian God.

369
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,960
But you know, there's always a sense which you say, well, the more immediate thing is still

370
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:48,600
always these political questions, and we're in this political question. And so maybe if you have

371
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:55,160
to have a political answer, what are we being distracted from politically? Where is wokeness

372
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:03,000
distracting us from more important things that are immediately political? I would suggest maybe

373
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,120
one way to start is to think about the etymology or the sort of the word of the term political

374
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:16,600
correctness, where political correctness, you know, by the 1980s, it already was this

375
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,320
conservative term that conservatives used to criticize sort of intolerant liberals.

376
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,640
But if we go back to the 1970s, political correctness was actually a term liberals used to describe

377
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,960
themselves, where they were sort of like really, really progressive and really politically correct,

378
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,280
and that it was a term of self-congratulation. And if you went back to the 1950s, the original

379
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,280
meaning of political correctness was that it was you were a politically correct comrade because

380
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,440
you were following the orders directly from Moscow and you were following the party line of the

381
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:55,000
Communist Party. And so if we, you know, if we go back to the original meaning of political

382
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,040
correctness and sort of think that, you know, the real problem is something, you know, something

383
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,320
like communism, even though it's, you know, communism fascism in the 20th century were youth

384
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,200
movements and we're sort of dealing with a gerontocratic version of this. So it's different,

385
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:17,000
demographically it's very different, but something like ultra-Christianity communism,

386
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,600
this set of things is the real problem today. And so this is a great simplification,

387
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:32,040
great reduction, but you could do much worse than whenever you hear the term DEI to just think CCP.

388
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,800
Thank you very much.

389
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:44,200
Well, let's begin to explore these

390
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,840
very deep questions and profound thoughts that have been put before us. And I think we should

391
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:00,120
recognize that they're all attempts, I think, Peter, to shake us out of our distraction.

392
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:07,800
There were three types of distraction here. The beginning one was the first one was the way in

393
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:16,920
which debates about woke and anti-woke about culture very often lead us to turn our thoughts away

394
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,440
from fundamental contradictions in economic life. And this is a way in which

395
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:31,320
Peter's way of thinking combines certain aspects without being a libertarian or a Marxist of

396
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,440
libertarian and Marxist critiques of our current economic regime. The second was,

397
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,720
which I found particularly fascinating, was the way in which the kind of paradigmatic

398
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:51,880
contrast which many people including I myself have made between ethics and politics as not being

399
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,640
highly progressive and science and technology as being highly progressive, as being prototypically

400
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,960
progressive is not, in fact, substantiated by the actual evidence that sciences and technology,

401
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,480
except in a few narrow fields, have been stuck in the same categories of thinking in the same

402
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,760
theoretical frameworks and even the same types of technology for about 50 years. And then the third

403
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:28,760
type of distraction that this talk was trying to rid us of or shake us out of was a distraction in

404
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:37,320
which questions of religion or of theology or of not exactly metaphysics but of the way we

405
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:43,480
ultimately think about good and evil and how human beings are in the world have been pushed

406
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:51,240
on one side and yet they continually reappear with woke, not actually being at all, as some

407
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,040
people have said on the right, a repaganization of the world but as being a type of hyper-Christianity

408
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:05,720
emptied of transcendence and forgiveness. And that leads to, I guess, a question, my question

409
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:12,920
to you, Peter, is, is there some way out of this? Because in a way, I think one of the things you

410
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,680
said which was most interesting was the attempt to, in the 20th century, in fascism and other

411
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:26,520
types of thinking were now in interesting writers like Bronze Age, Pervert, or earlier on in Iran.

412
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,480
What they were doing was, I would think in your terms, Peter, it was actually very interesting

413
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:38,280
but impossible because you can't, would you think this is true, you can't actually get back to a

414
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,880
classical or pre-Christian view of the world in which energy and vitality empower what matters

415
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,200
and victimhood is contemptible or unimportant. Once Christianity is there, so we can't go back.

416
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,720
And that's true of the other, the previous two. We can't go back to earlier forms of science,

417
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,800
we can't go back to earlier forms of economic thinking, although I thought what you said about

418
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:05,160
Henry George was very interesting. Are we really stuck? Can we actually, can you actually, is it

419
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,480
possible to unstick us? I think it is because I think you're already unsticking us tonight.

420
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,920
Where would you think that there's the best chance of unsticking us?

421
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:22,040
Well, my very fast answer is always the first thing you have to do to solve problems is to

422
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,120
talk about them. So I think that as long as we have this, as you described, Groundhog Day of

423
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:35,080
Wokeness, we are not going to be unstuck and we're going to be in this sort of zero-sum

424
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:44,760
somewhat malthusian, ever nastier political kind of a context. I think there are,

425
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,920
there certainly are ways, there probably are ways all three of them could be

426
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,240
ways we could get unstuck in all three dimensions. I think there's some way that the

427
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,720
pure capitalism, pure globalism things probably don't quite work in economics.

428
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,440
I do think one could probably do something about the real estate problem. It's so

429
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:17,480
extraordinarily distorted. And so that's that, that there probably are things one can do. It's

430
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:27,960
very hard because you would destroy trillions of dollars in value in doing it. But that probably,

431
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,560
it has to give at some point. Maybe it's a technological fix. The way the Henry George

432
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,400
thing was historically solved was you had an open frontier in America. And then the frontier

433
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,520
closed in the late 19th century. So the railroads were the technology to open the frontier.

434
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,280
Eventually the frontier is populated, it gets closed. And then late 19th, early 20th century,

435
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,560
the cities start to have this gorgeous runaway real estate price effect, rising inequality,

436
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,320
and you get progressivism as a response to the closing of the frontier. And then in the 20th

437
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:07,800
century, in a way, another frontier got opened with the automobile and the highways and the suburbs.

438
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:15,640
And that relieved the pressure on the runaway costs. And then that technology has also run its

439
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,720
course. And there's a question, is there some way to reopen a frontier in real estate? And

440
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,240
probably the one where I think the jury is very out and doesn't look that promising in 2023,

441
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,040
it would be something like, could one really get remote work to work? Could the internet

442
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:38,920
be a way that people are not stuck in these cities? And that would reset all these real estate

443
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,360
values tremendously, because even in a rather densely populated country like England, there is

444
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,520
plenty of space if you're not forced to be in within the green belt of London itself. And

445
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:58,360
certainly the United States even more so. And then I think within the technology area,

446
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:07,640
my hopeful sense is that there is always a question, why did the technology slow down and

447
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:14,680
the science slow down? And the thing I'm hopeful on is that it was not that we just ran out of

448
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,360
ideas. It's that there were these deformations of culture, we became too risk averse, too bureaucratic,

449
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:27,400
too much peer review in the sciences. And I think we could be making a lot more progress

450
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,960
in a lot of areas. It's regulated, people are scared of technology. We don't want to minimize

451
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,800
or trivialize their fears. But I think you could have a very different balance there.

452
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,680
And then certainly the questions about the larger meaning of life or the meaning of history

453
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,960
are, you know, are ones that I think would all do well to confront more.

454
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,560
To take in a way what might be the most immediate part of what you've just said and said before,

455
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:07,080
I guess it implies, which I think is absolutely true, that the so-called consensus that prevails

456
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:14,120
between say, Sunak and Stammer is far more consensus on what we're not supposed to think about,

457
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,080
that it is on to anything positive. Because the big problems you've mentioned, the problems

458
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,400
stagnation in science, the problems of real estate in London and Oxford and throughout the

459
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,360
country, the problems of generational inequity in which young people can't find any way to live and

460
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,640
so they're all hardly addressed at all. There's a bit of commentary in the newspapers and so on.

461
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:41,080
But in terms of thinking about active solutions, there perhaps maybe some dim, subliminal awareness

462
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,280
among these politicians that the solving them would involve big losses for somebody.

463
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,560
Yes, or certainly big losses for them in the election. There's the felt sense. And so,

464
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,800
yeah, and it's certainly not limited to the UK, but certainly an outside perspective,

465
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,840
I would have it, because it seems to me that, yeah, there's a secret agreement between Sunak

466
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:12,360
and Stammer, let's say, to talk as much as possible about culture wars, take various

467
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,920
sides on those issues. And then if you have even basic economic questions like a runaway deficit

468
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:26,840
spending, and do you solve this with higher taxes or lower entitlements? And then they both have a

469
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,560
look ahead function where if we talk about that, we'll lose 10 or 15% of the voters.

470
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,160
I mean, maybe not quite as many for Sunak since it's hard to lose 10 or 15% of the voters.

471
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,640
But there's some kind of a look ahead function where we shouldn't touch that. But then

472
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,120
when everybody does that, when all the solutions are outside the Overton window,

473
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:01,080
we end up with, yeah, we're confined in this very narrow box and the Groundhog Day will

474
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:06,200
continue until at some point something really breaks. So there won't be a Nietzsche and Groundhog

475
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,920
Day, it won't really be eternal. It's going to break down, isn't it? I mean, that's one way or the

476
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,680
other, even if only for economic reasons, but we don't know when or how. Sure. Yeah, I think

477
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:24,920
there certainly are all kinds of dimensions one could point to where it is not simply stable.

478
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,640
The demographics are not stable. The deficits are not stable. We had pseudo stability and deficits

479
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,520
for 40 years in the United States and much of the Western world where the deficits were too big,

480
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,880
but the interest rates went steadily down. And something around that seems to have broken in

481
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:49,160
the last year or two. So I think even something as basic as deficits financed at 0% interest rates,

482
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,560
it seemed like the 2010s could go on forever and that seems over. And they haven't.

483
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:06,360
Yeah, ended with the 2020s. Yeah. Does that bleed back into the segue back into the cultural and

484
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:14,680
the religious questions you discussed? Because I guess part of the resistance to your analysis

485
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:23,960
of science is a kind of quasi religious conception of the salvific possibilities of science,

486
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:33,480
that science can do what religion hasn't done, which is to actually change worldly life in a way

487
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:41,240
which reads it of its deepest contradictions. And I guess if for some people, if they gave up that

488
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,800
faith in science, they would be left with nihilism or left with despair or left with unbearable

489
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:54,520
anxiety. Yeah, although it's sort of a, obviously there's a very complicated history of science,

490
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,000
and it was in some ways maybe a byproduct of Christianity and so it was an opposition to

491
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Christianity. And certainly in its healthy, ambitious, early modern forms, whether it was

492
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:17,160
a substitute or a compliment to Christianity, it was supposed to be, it was somehow supposed

493
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,520
to be a vehicle for comparable transformation and sort of the indefinite prolongation of human life

494
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,800
was an early modern science project and people still believe very much in the 17th, 18th century.

495
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:37,160
And there was a sub movement within sort of the revolutionary Soviet politics. It was still very

496
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:44,840
healthy in the 1920s called Cosmism, where a part of the project of the revolution had to be to

497
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,040
physically resurrect all dead human beings. And because if science didn't do that, it would be

498
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,760
inferior to Christianity or something like that. That's sort of one of their slogans. They had to

499
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,880
adapt themselves, the cosmos to the Soviet and Bolshevik reality was, debt of the world unite.

500
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,800
Because they wanted to bring back not only not only that, everyone in the present generation

501
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,720
would live forever, but that all the people who'd ever died would come back.

502
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:17,000
And so there is this, let's say, anti-Christian or riveted from Christian, you know, a very

503
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,560
ambitious version of science. And of course, there is also a more defeatist version of science,

504
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,200
where science actually just tells us about limits and things you cannot do.

505
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,720
I don't know, I'll use a literary example when Hamlet's evil mother, Gertrude, says that all

506
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:41,640
that lives must die. The question you have is, is that a law of nature? Or is this just a

507
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,400
rationalization for the rottenness that is Denmark? Certainly, the early modern conception

508
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,080
was that you wanted to transcend this both in a Christian or a scientific form. And then,

509
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,840
yeah, late modernity, it's probably attributed more as a decay of science that this sort of ambition

510
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,040
is more a fringe science thing than a mainstream science thing.

511
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:09,160
And I guess there's also a kind of nihilistic version of science, a sort of brave new world

512
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:18,120
version in which sees itself as pacifying the spiritual and mental anguish and doubts of human

513
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:23,480
beings by giving them access to drugs and pornography and all kinds of things which

514
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,600
distract them forever from these fundamental existential questions, the religious questions.

515
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:34,040
What would work to exterminate religion wouldn't be, or to terminate the need for religion,

516
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,720
wouldn't be persecuting, and that obviously has never worked, but to try and put everyone asleep

517
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:48,200
with dreams of drug dreams, drug highs. And of course, drugs are a tremendous feature of our life

518
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,200
at the moment, aren't they, in many countries? I wouldn't even go that far. The line I was using

519
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,360
this is just the iPhones that distract you from your environment will distract you from

520
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,080
fact, you're in a 100 year old subway in London or New York or the environment hasn't changed.

521
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:10,840
And then again, I don't think one should make it fully intentional, but there is something about

522
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:18,360
certain narrow forms of technical progress that have more of this retarding effect elsewhere,

523
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:26,680
or this making us oblivious to what's going on effect. But yeah, I think most of it is not,

524
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,400
it's not supposed to be ambitious, world transforming. It is not at all early modern

525
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:40,440
science. It's much more, I don't know, probably the strongest science and one of the stronger

526
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:47,000
science and politics themes is always the climate change debate. And if you take climate change

527
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,360
seriously, there are all kinds of progressive science things one could do. You could be pushing

528
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,920
for the construction of hundreds of new nuclear reactors, you could be pushing for fusion. There's

529
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:03,080
sort of all kinds of ways that you could be concerned about climate change and lean into

530
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:10,840
rapidly progressing science. And then in practice, it's much more that maybe you should just ride

531
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:18,520
a bicycle or something like that. And so it's somehow a lot of science has this Luddite feel,

532
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,280
even though it's obviously, you can find lots of different things.

533
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:29,400
Or start eating insects rather than beef, because beef, but one, I mean, that thought

534
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,320
one of the functions of smartphones is to distract us from the fact that we're living in a

535
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:44,040
Victorian environment still with Victorian sewers and Victorian subways and Victorian buildings

536
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:51,720
is I think a very profound word thought because it suggests that one of the functions of technology,

537
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:58,280
which is something that affects the material world is to supplant the material world in our own

538
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,480
lives so that we live in a virtual world more and more of the time. Of course, it's got physical

539
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,400
roots, this virtual world. So if something goes wrong with the physical roots, if there is war or

540
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,920
terrorism or climate change or whatever, then it's all disrupted. But that's part of the way it works,

541
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:22,440
isn't it? Well, certainly, that's the part of technology that's been healthiest has been

542
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,600
still the most progressive is this narrow cone around this virtual world. I keep thinking that

543
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,800
you could do a lot more in these other areas. If I, again, come back to something like the real

544
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:41,160
estate housing version, this seems the furthest from technological innovation. I mean, there are

545
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,640
new building designs, you can build 100 story buildings that you could not build 20, 30 years ago.

546
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:53,560
There are presumably some new things one could even do there. But if too much of the economy

547
00:59:53,560 --> 01:00:00,280
is anchored on things that are hard to improve or change, that is also a way in which progress

548
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,960
slows. So if we have an economy in the UK, and I'll make these numbers up where it's

549
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:12,040
50% real estate and 10% computers, then even if the 10% that is computers is somehow getting better

550
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:19,800
and better, if 50% that is real estate is very stuck, that is going to be at best a slowly improving

551
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,760
economy. And then the most important thing is somehow not going to be changing it. And then

552
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,440
that probably creates all kinds of weird side effects and incentives. So the hyper progressivism,

553
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:38,680
the hyper accelerationism that we are told we have by politicians and others by Blair, for example,

554
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:47,400
that we're accelerating in. It does not show up in the per capita GDP numbers. It does not show up

555
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,640
in incomes rising faster than rents. I just think the rebuttal is simply on the real estate side.

556
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,320
And then you can be told that people don't want to live in houses anymore. They don't want to

557
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,400
have families. They're conscious. You shouldn't have children because you're just beating insects.

558
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,240
But at some point, again, at some point, this is really a parody, not really progressivism.

559
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,640
I didn't attend it, but there was a meeting in London of Blair and some of his disciples at many

560
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:21,640
parties, including the Conservative Party, in which, for him, the next phase of acceleration was

561
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:29,240
precisely the one in which your analysis suggests there's been the most the largest and most neglected

562
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,720
stagnation in the technology, which is that all globalization might not have gone far enough.

563
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:39,560
We've retreated from it. We shouldn't have, but we have. It's still going to go on, but

564
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,560
we're going to try and we're resisting it. So how can we cope with the situation in which we're not

565
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,680
and getting enough acceleration from globalization, where we'll accelerate the technological side?

566
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:54,040
And yet, if what is accelerating, if it's going to be AI and the virtual world, I guess,

567
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:00,920
he thinks that we can solve our problems in medical care by AI, that's the solution for him.

568
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:07,800
Look, it's always dangerous for me to comment on too much on British politics, but my senses

569
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:14,280
that Blair occupies is very, very strange place where it is. It is this past. It obviously does

570
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:21,400
not work. We obviously cannot go back to the sort of globalization that he represented or doing more

571
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,600
of it. In some sense, doesn't work, but it never gets articulated. And so it has a very different

572
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:33,480
quality than, let's say, thatcherism where there's, you know, and again, I was in some ways very

573
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,400
sympathetic to Liz Truss, but there's some sense in which it didn't work. And somehow it's clear

574
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,760
that we somehow can't go back to thatcherism, or doing more of thatcherism isn't going to be a

575
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:53,000
solution. Whereas on the left, it's in this very strange in-between zone where somehow Blair is

576
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,240
not being run as a candidate for prime minister. Officially. Well, again, I'm just going, if he

577
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,760
ran officially, one suspects it would work very badly. But then, you know, if you're someone

578
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:11,560
like Starmer, you know, what labor leader do you want to emulate? Do you want to emulate Atlee,

579
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:17,160
which probably is not that, that doesn't work. And then maybe Blair is the only other one on offer.

580
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,640
And so that's sort of the default idea even though it never gets articulated, which tells you it's

581
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:27,000
probably not very good. Absolutely. I mean, I guess the difference is that when there's trust

582
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,960
wing of the Conservative Party wants to go back to Thatcher, because they see that as a radical

583
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,800
moment and they want to repeat the radical moments. But because radical moments are very hard to keep

584
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,840
repeating all the time. They're hard to repeat by doing the same thing. Doing the same thing.

585
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:51,240
So it's certainly, there was a one-time move to deregulate and lower taxes. And then not clear

586
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:57,160
what one can do. Doing it the second time does as much good. You know, McKinsey. McKinsey was a

587
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,960
real thing in 1985 in the United States. If you hired a consultant, they actually helped you improve

588
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,160
your company, you know, because the companies were badly run. At this point, McKinsey is a total

589
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:17,800
racket. It's just all fake. And so if you have a Reagan, you know, the Reagan Thatcher administration,

590
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,560
they empowered McKinsey because they allowed more companies to be acquired and more M&A

591
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:26,760
activity to happen. And it was a, you know, a somewhat brutal, but very powerful reorganization

592
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,920
of society. And that was possible. And that was the right thing to do in the 1980s. You know,

593
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:37,000
at this point, McKinsey is not ever going to be anything other than a super corrupt fake racket

594
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
in 2023. And so we can't go back to that specific thing, you know. It's fascinating the way in

595
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,440
which the product of these revolutionary changes in the economy and society and thinking produces

596
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,240
a proliferation of rackets in science too. And I guess that's connected with

597
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,840
fakery. Fakery, that's to say, so many of the phenomena around us are fakery.

598
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:09,800
I don't know if it has to happen that way, but one of my colleagues, maybe this would be another

599
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:20,040
link, the sciences to the wokeness problem, is that institutions have embedded growth

600
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:28,440
obligations, egos, in short, EGO, embedded growth obligations. And so a healthy institution,

601
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,360
in some sense, is one that has this exponential growth. And if you have exponential growth,

602
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,520
there will be more jobs and everyone can get promoted. And there's sort of a way that if a

603
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:42,280
company has exponential growth, that's a healthy company. And there are other versions of this in

604
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:49,240
different forms. And then at some point, maybe the growth stops. And when the growth stops,

605
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,640
you have a choice. You can maybe become more honest and say, well, you know,

606
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,760
the university isn't growing anymore, there'll be very few faculty slots available.

607
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:07,480
If you're in a PhD program, we're going to make sure that 80% of the students

608
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,560
drop out of the program within six months, so they don't waste their time.

609
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:20,200
And we're going to be honest about the fact that there's no growth. Or the thing that I think

610
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:26,440
unfortunately happens a great deal is you just lie. And the institutions become sociopathic,

611
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:31,480
where they pretend that the growth is still going on. And then it's only years and years later

612
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:37,560
that people figure out that there are no jobs. And the wokeness was just,

613
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,480
it's just a distraction. It's sort of like, if you have 10 graduate students in a chemistry

614
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,520
program, and there's a job for only one of them, and you're having fist fights over beakers and

615
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:54,120
Bunsen burners, and you're in the sort of Malthusian struggle, and there's one person who says

616
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,520
something slightly racist or slightly inappropriate. I mean, it's such a relief,

617
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:06,040
you can throw that one person off the overcrowded bus, right? So these are natural things to

618
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:14,680
happen, but surely we would do better to find ways to get back to growth in as many places

619
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:19,400
of our society as possible. Indeed, because what you just said is that the solution to

620
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:25,720
non-growth is persecution. You can eliminate various people from the competition by

621
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:33,000
canceling them, pushing them out. They're not there anymore. They're what was termed in the first

622
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,640
Constitution of the Soviet Union back, I think in 1918, 1919, former persons. So if you make

623
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,760
these people former persons, at least they're not competitors anymore, they're out. So that's a very,

624
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:50,440
again, unless we grow in certain ways in knowledge and technology in a genuine way,

625
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,680
we're going to have this persecutory mentality. It has a function, it has a role,

626
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,640
even an economic or a career structure role and so on.

627
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,680
But it's always important to understand the persecution is not as ideological as it's

628
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:09,160
dressed up to be. So because if it's actually driven by scarcity, you will just have scarcity.

629
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,720
The US academic version of this, when I wrote the diversity myth book in the early 90s,

630
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:20,760
I was thinking to myself, academia discriminates against conservatives, libertarians like myself.

631
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:28,040
I think that was true for one cohort of baby boomer academics who got PhDs in the 70s and

632
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:33,480
couldn't get tenure in the 80s in the US. But by my generation, where I would have gotten a PhD in

633
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:38,760
the 1990s, it was obvious there was no job because I was conservative. And so the conservatives were

634
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,880
actually not discriminated against. It was the liberals that were discriminated against who were

635
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:48,280
Gen X, millennial, because they all had the delusion that it was, yeah, it was kind of zero

636
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,920
sum. But as long as you've told the correct party line, yes, we're safe. And that was, of course,

637
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:59,240
also the delusion that the party line communists had when they were disproportionately targeted

638
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:05,720
by the Stalin show trials in the 1930s. The Soviet term for it was always section 58 of the

639
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,600
Soviet penal code was that you were guilty of counter-revolutionary activity. And I think the

640
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,160
key to understanding that was that everybody was guilty. And there were just some people who

641
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:21,080
were not being prosecuted for the time being by the government. And so in this world of extreme

642
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:28,680
scarcity, eventually everybody gets somehow deplatformed or ejected or something like that,

643
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,200
just about. I mean, the Soviet analogies are very rich. I think it was another Soviet term,

644
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,760
which was telling lies that no one believes in. And that was seen as an essential thing,

645
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,000
because one of the things, if you're surrounded by lies and every single person, including the

646
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,360
people who tell them, know that they're lies, know that it's not the truth, then it sort of hinges

647
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:53,160
you to some extent. And it makes you scared. And also because the party line, what determines what's

648
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:58,040
a lie and what's not, changes inexplicably all the time. And I think in a way we've progressed

649
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,040
beyond the Soviets now in that respect, because we've really got to the point where no one really

650
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,360
knows what the party line is, but everyone's terrified from deviating from it. It's the

651
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:14,680
postmodern version of the party. Yeah, I think it's always so hard to know exactly what's going

652
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:23,160
on. We're in this strange postmodern world. I think people are generally quite cynical.

653
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,480
They don't believe all the lies they're being told. It gets discounted pretty heavily.

654
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:34,520
But nevertheless, it has this effect where somehow we can't focus on the really important

655
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,880
things that are going on of the sort that I talked about. And so it does have this. And

656
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:48,200
I'll come back to this metaphor that it is like this hypnotic magic trick. And the important

657
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,200
thing is not what the magician is doing, but what the magician is distracting us from.

658
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:59,320
And maybe even the magician is taken in by the sleight of hand. Maybe it's easier to

659
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,720
live with oneself as a magician, a political magician, a technological magician,

660
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,120
if you really think there's something in it, although you can never quite see what it is,

661
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:15,080
because the trick is almost bigger than you. There's a whole division among magicians between

662
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,440
the ones, there's a class that claimed that it's real and there's a class that claimed that it's

663
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:24,200
fake. And so yes, that is, that is, I believe the sociology of magicians is they're those two

664
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:32,200
competing camps. How far is there just social science fit into this? There was a wonderful book

665
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:37,640
about 70 years ago by, not 70 years ago, in the 70s, 1970s, by the sociologists,

666
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,880
poly sociologists, I knew, there was a marvellous book in every way, but the very best part of it

667
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:49,720
was that it was called Social Sciences as Sorcery in 1970s. And he was arguing that the whole

668
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:55,000
80 or 90, not that there's no social science or that there can't be, didn't think that, he thought

669
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,880
there was and there could be more of it, but that much of it was just the kind of magical

670
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:09,320
transposition of terms, forms of distraction from real problems that you're talking about,

671
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:15,800
that actually a lot of it was, it was theorized and systematized distraction. So if you talk about

672
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,920
identity struggles, you're missing out very profound structural inequalities, economic

673
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:31,320
and temperature. He took examples of plagues and even of syphilis in which people talked about in

674
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,400
all sorts of complex ways of power structures, but the basic thing is the thing itself, the

675
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,160
material thing. It's just a way of avoiding contact with the material world, isn't it?

676
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:44,280
Yeah, I wouldn't, it feels like that's slightly too strong since I think I gave, I'm not sure it

677
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:51,560
was, I wouldn't want to call it a social science speech today, but some kind of attempt to analyze

678
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:59,000
these things in terms of the history, politics, sociology, psychology of our of our societies.

679
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:07,480
Yes, I think a lot of these soft fields do have this quality that they are, I want to say that

680
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:13,080
they are in theory extremely important and there's something about them that is an extremely

681
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:20,120
important way at getting at things and then for that reason they're also extremely prone to

682
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:26,200
politicization of various sorts. One of the things I always like to say is that any field that has

683
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:33,080
the term science in it should always be suspicious because it's sort of, it's exaggerating, it's

684
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:39,320
social science, political science, climate science, even computer science, it started as computer

685
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:44,200
science because it had a very serious inferiority complex to math and electrical engineering.

686
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,400
And it's not, I think, accidental, and though it's often forgotten that both of the great

687
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:55,160
terrible movements, the 20th century communism and Nazism actually, which is often seen as

688
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:02,040
anti-scientific, but was in fact often defended in the 30s and 20s and then 40s by biological or

689
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:09,800
racial science that just as dialectical materialism, diamat as it was called then, was the greatest

690
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:16,680
science that ever been. So these repressive movements, murderous movements, movements which

691
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:21,400
killed millions of people but also killed off thought wherever they could, well all advanced,

692
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,360
they all thought it very important to call themselves science.

693
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:31,480
Well, it's, I don't know, this may be sort of a philosophy of science thought I have is that

694
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:38,200
I think in theory what science is supposed to do is fight a two front war against excessive

695
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:44,920
dogmatism and excessive skepticism. And if you're, and so excessive dogmatism is like, I know, the

696
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,120
decayed Aristotelianism of the medieval church and that was what science was in some ways fighting

697
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:56,040
in the 17th and 18th century. And then excessive skepticism, if I can't trust my senses and I

698
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,600
don't know whether I'm sitting in front of you, if you're too skeptical, you also can't do science.

699
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,680
And then these two front wars intention, it's actually hard to get that balance,

700
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:12,200
it's very hard to get that balance right. Probably the early modern version I would say was

701
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:21,800
more anti-dogmatism than anti-skepticism. If we fast forward to 2023 and there are all kinds of

702
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,960
things where I know the scientific establishment, the leading scientists would caution us against

703
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,120
being too skeptical, not supposed to be vaccine skeptics, we're not supposed to be climate science

704
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:39,880
skeptics, we're not supposed, it's fighting skepticism in all its forms. And then I'd be

705
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,480
hard-pressed, I could maybe hold a gun to my head, I might be able to come up with one or two things,

706
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,880
but I'd be very hard-pressed to come up with a single instance where a scientist would say,

707
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:53,640
this is an area where science is too dogmatic today in 2023. The string theorists wouldn't

708
01:15:53,640 --> 01:16:00,680
say we're too dogmatic about string theory, but just very, very hard-pressed to say where it's

709
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:08,280
too dogmatic. And that surely tells us that somehow it has degenerated into something that's

710
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:13,800
more dogmatic than the medieval church. If you're just fighting skepticism, it tells you

711
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:21,080
you're a dogman. That's probably there was some version of this with the totalitarian science

712
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:27,640
of the early 20th century, where it leveraged the term, so it was somehow still pretending to

713
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:36,840
be anti-dogmatism, anti-supernatural, anti-that sort of stuff, but in reality the anti-skepticism

714
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,280
dominated. Which leaves us in a situation with the near impossibility of empiricism

715
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:48,360
in the sense of a way of thinking which tries to connect with facts in the world. So if you say,

716
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:55,800
well actually racism in certain contexts is less prevalent than these claims which have been made,

717
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:02,360
suggest someone will say, you think that because you're a racist. You're neglecting the systematic

718
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:09,320
structural hidden subterranean patterns, the occult patterns of racism, so to speak, which are

719
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:15,640
there. So and this by the way is trying to me as a feature of liberal thought in even in its attempt

720
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:22,360
to prescribe solutions, which is that if a liberal experiment doesn't work, say liberal experiments

721
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,560
in drug legalization or drug decriminalization, the solutions are not to say they've been falsified,

722
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:33,000
it's to say double up, triple up, quadruple up, do it three or four times and then it will work.

723
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:39,560
So can we get, I mean I wouldn't say get back to empirical thinking because I guess science was never

724
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:45,320
that closely empirical, but closer to it than we've been in which someone will accept that

725
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,560
we aren't too dogmatic about XYZ. Maybe we don't know the answer, maybe we've actually got to go

726
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:56,360
out and check things to see what's happening. Well you know there's empirical thinking, there's

727
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:03,640
analytical thinking. I would like us just to get back to thinking. The hardest of all. Let's try to do that.

728
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:12,760
I'm wondering if that might be the moment on which I can thank Peter for stimulating,

729
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:21,800
stirring and stimulating, fertilizing my thinking on all of these issues and whether we can all

730
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:38,200
thank him for coming here and enabling us to receive his thoughts and start thinking.
