00:00.000 --> 00:24.280
Thank you all very much for coming to this notable event, it's my honor as well as my

00:24.280 --> 00:34.520
pleasure to very briefly introduce the lecture we're going to have from Peter Thiel and to

00:34.520 --> 00:42.620
then be in conversation with him after that presentation. I should say that Peter, to me,

00:42.620 --> 00:53.440
is interesting, is one of the most deeply reflective thinkers of our time and also in

00:53.440 --> 01:00.880
some respects one of the most prophetic. In 1993 he published a book, The Diversity Myth,

01:00.880 --> 01:10.360
on trends in academic thought based on his experiences in Stanford which aside from a

01:10.360 --> 01:18.040
few changes in minor changes actually in vocabulary is as fresh today as it was then or indeed

01:18.040 --> 01:25.520
fresher because much of what he has written about has come to pass since that time. But I

01:25.520 --> 01:33.520
think what's distinctive and important for me and I believe Peter will talk about it tonight

01:33.520 --> 01:45.760
is the way in which he tries to dig into the deeper causes and sources and roots of present

01:45.760 --> 01:53.920
intellectual and cultural as well as economic and political trends and to unstick our thinking

01:53.920 --> 02:01.800
because to unfix it because just as this book I think illustrates we've not moved on, we live

02:01.800 --> 02:11.240
in a perpetual groundhog day in terms of discourse and political thinking. In my smaller way I found

02:11.240 --> 02:19.400
that myself, I'm still sometimes writing what I wrote in 1989 not simply because I'm not very

02:19.400 --> 02:28.240
original but also because it still seems true or sometimes truer. So I think to dig into this

02:28.240 --> 02:37.320
as deeply as Peter does is very very rare or unique and so I myself am enormously looking

02:37.320 --> 02:44.960
forward to hearing what he has to say tonight and also talking with him after he said it. Thank you

02:44.960 --> 03:04.840
very much. Thank you very much. It's a tremendous honor to be here this afternoon. I was involved

03:04.840 --> 03:12.240
in a lot of these culture wars, campus wars in the late 1980s, early 1990s at Stanford University.

03:12.240 --> 03:21.520
I started one of these alternative conservative newspapers and a lot of these debates had the

03:21.520 --> 03:28.720
quality of these various crazy campus hijinks that then at the same time occasionally would

03:28.720 --> 03:34.720
escalate into things that might be of some larger or even cosmic importance. One of the

03:35.640 --> 03:42.640
Stanford debates that really was pivotal in the late 1980s involved a debate around the

03:42.640 --> 03:50.760
core Western civilization class, Western culture. It was a protest in 1987 where the chant at the

03:50.760 --> 03:56.720
protest was, hey, hey, ho, ho, Western cultures got to go. And it was in one sense about this

03:56.720 --> 04:03.440
year-long freshman class. On another level of course it was about a repudiation of the

04:04.120 --> 04:09.000
entire civilization that was being studied in that class, something somewhat more cosmic.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.160
And then I covered a lot of these things and then a friend and I ended up writing a book,

04:15.160 --> 04:21.800
The Diversity Myth, a few years later. I'll start by reading an excerpt from that and then I want

04:21.800 --> 04:27.720
to give a little bit of a retrospective of where I was right, where I was wrong, where I was not

04:27.760 --> 04:36.120
even wrong. And so one of the books that replaced Shakespeare was a book by Aimee CÃ©saire,

04:36.120 --> 04:43.240
A Tempest, replaces The Tempest and it's all this inverted anti-colonial hierarchy where

04:43.240 --> 04:52.280
Caliban is a revolutionary hero, Prospero is an evil colonialist. And so the final indignant

04:52.280 --> 05:00.240
trade by Caliban and A Tempest. Understand what I say, Prospero, for years I bowed my head,

05:00.240 --> 05:06.400
for years I took it, all of it, your insults, your ingratitude, and worst of all, more grading than

05:06.400 --> 05:13.320
all the rest, your condescension. But now it's over. Over, do you hear? Of course at the moment

05:13.320 --> 05:17.400
you're still stronger than I am, but I don't give a damn for your power or for your dogs or your

05:17.400 --> 05:23.400
police or your inventions. And do you know why? It's because I know I'll get you. And you lied to

05:23.400 --> 05:28.000
me so much about the world, about yourself, that you ended up by imposing it on me, an image of

05:28.000 --> 05:32.680
myself, underdeveloping your words, incompetent. That's how you made me see myself and I loathe

05:32.680 --> 05:38.200
that image and it's false. And I know that one day my bare fist, just that, will be enough to crush

05:38.200 --> 05:44.440
your world, the old world is falling apart. And by the way, you have a chance to get it over with,

05:44.760 --> 05:49.960
you can fuck off. You can go back to Europe, but in a pig's eye you will. I'm sure you won't

05:49.960 --> 05:54.600
leave, you make me laugh with your mission, your vocation, your vocation is to give me shit. And

05:54.600 --> 05:59.720
that's why you'll stay, just like those guys who founded the colonies and who now can't live

05:59.720 --> 06:06.520
anywhere else. You're just an old colonial addict, that's what you are. And then this goes on for

06:06.520 --> 06:15.080
250 pages where we go through things like this and sort of the somewhat pretentious idea that

06:15.720 --> 06:20.280
David and I had in writing this book was we were speaking truth to power, that all that it took was

06:20.280 --> 06:26.040
to sort of expose this and then you could ask questions. Well, is this new, is this an improved

06:26.040 --> 06:32.280
version of Shakespeare or should one prefer the original? Is this really about multiculturalism

06:32.360 --> 06:38.360
and non-western cultures or is it just all sort of an anti-western thing that drives it?

06:39.720 --> 06:44.280
And then there were parts of it that felt a little bit contrived at the time where

06:45.080 --> 06:48.920
we had to somehow make it relevant to the larger thing. And so we had the sort of

06:49.560 --> 06:54.120
somewhat contrived construction where ideas have consequences and what happens in the university

06:54.120 --> 07:00.040
will eventually spread beyond it. And then of course when you fast forward 30 years, there are

07:00.120 --> 07:05.720
all these ways, a lot of this has held up quite well. And of course there are also ways where

07:06.600 --> 07:13.960
it feels like it didn't matter at all. And so I don't know, I can brag that the book was prophetic

07:13.960 --> 07:21.880
and that a lot of it came true. And then I can say that somehow all this effort in writing this

07:21.880 --> 07:27.240
seemingly did not really matter and that on some level it was not about the logic of the ideas

07:27.800 --> 07:35.640
at all. And what I want to reflect about is, and so even though I think the specific arguments

07:35.640 --> 07:42.920
I would still defend is almost all right, I want to focus maybe a little bit more self-critically

07:42.920 --> 07:51.000
on the places where I was not even wrong, where in some ways I didn't even understand what the

07:51.080 --> 07:58.120
real issues were and think about a little bit what those were. And I think one piece of the book

07:58.120 --> 08:05.080
that has held up relatively well is the title, The Diversity Myth. It's an ambiguous title. It can

08:05.080 --> 08:12.680
mean on the one, you can put the stress on the word diversity in which case you can then have

08:12.680 --> 08:18.520
debates of, you know, what does diversity mean and if it is some sort of celebration of difference

08:18.520 --> 08:22.600
and then you can sort of debate what kinds of diversity should one have. And then there are

08:22.600 --> 08:27.240
all sorts of libertarian and conservative critiques where, you know, you don't have real diversity

08:27.240 --> 08:32.520
if you have a group of people who look different but think alike, you know, diversity in that sense

08:32.520 --> 08:37.720
probably should involve more than just hiring the extras from the space cantina scene in Star Wars

08:37.720 --> 08:44.440
or something like that. But there's a secondary, maybe somewhat deeper meaning of the title

08:44.440 --> 08:50.040
where you put the stress on the word myth. And if you put the stress on the word myth,

08:50.040 --> 08:57.640
you realize that diversity or multiculturalism or any of these words are extremely poorly defined

08:57.640 --> 09:01.880
and that's the point. They're not supposed to be defined. They're sort of a, it's sort of like a

09:01.880 --> 09:13.720
false god, idol, chivalrous, but it can never be really defined and it works maybe mostly as a sort

09:13.800 --> 09:22.200
of diversion or divertissement, distraction from the things that are truly important. And it is

09:22.200 --> 09:28.520
kind of like a, I don't know, it's a hypnotic magic show where you don't notice the gorilla jumping

09:28.520 --> 09:33.640
up and down the back of the stage. You're just narrowly focused on what the tricks the magician

09:33.640 --> 09:43.400
is doing. And I want to try to explore with you tonight is a map of the things that we've been

09:43.400 --> 09:50.600
distracted from by focusing too much on wokeness, anti-wokeness, all these kinds of debates,

09:50.600 --> 09:56.520
what were we missing? So three main ones, I'm going to go through

09:59.000 --> 10:08.200
my brief comments tonight. The first one broadly is a category and this would be a libertarian

10:08.200 --> 10:15.320
critique of diversity. It would also be a Marxist critique is that, is that when you focus on all

10:15.320 --> 10:21.400
these forms of identity politics, you're not focused enough on economics. When you focus on,

10:22.520 --> 10:29.080
you know, race, gender, etc., you're not going to focus enough on class. And so I think there is,

10:29.080 --> 10:35.320
you know, and there is, even though I'm not a, not a communist or a Marxist, I find that even

10:35.320 --> 10:40.440
the Marxist critique probably has quite a bit to it where if you had a, you know, what would be a

10:40.440 --> 10:48.920
Marxist analysis of a diversity administrator? And if you had Karl Marx or Rosa Luxemburg here,

10:48.920 --> 10:54.040
I think they would, they would suggest that these people are roughly in the same category

10:54.040 --> 11:00.920
as a bank robber or a prostitute because they're sort of a, it's a form of crony capitalism.

11:00.920 --> 11:07.160
It's sort of a reactionary class that's somehow taking advantage of the system. And then if we

11:07.160 --> 11:12.440
actually sort of look at the history of this where, you know, in some ways cultural Marxism

11:12.440 --> 11:20.600
replaced real Marxism, you know, in the 1970s, it roughly at least correlates with the period when,

11:20.600 --> 11:28.280
you know, inequality grew massively when the economy started to stagnate. And so when we,

11:28.360 --> 11:33.080
when we stopped thinking about the economy, there are sort of various perspectives from

11:33.080 --> 11:39.160
both the left or right economics perspective, where something there ceased to work all that,

11:39.160 --> 11:45.480
all that wealth. And, and then of course, even, you know, economics is sort of somehow

11:45.480 --> 11:51.800
in a libertarian or Marxist form, it grounds you into, into substantive material type things.

11:52.760 --> 11:57.960
But maybe the, the sort of libertarian Marxist synthesis that I would want to explore a little

11:57.960 --> 12:05.640
bit more is the Henry George, the late 19th century economists to in the late 19th century was seen as

12:05.640 --> 12:09.880
pretty socialist today he's seen as pretty libertarian, which I think doesn't simply

12:09.880 --> 12:15.880
reflect sort of a way in which our society has changed. But from the Henry George perspective,

12:15.880 --> 12:21.880
the economic relation that one always needed to look at was land ownership, real estate,

12:21.880 --> 12:27.160
distortions in real estate. And this is the the key driver. And I want to submit that

12:27.240 --> 12:33.000
if there is an area of economics that we should pay more attention to it is, it is something

12:33.000 --> 12:38.680
like that that there's something about a georgist analysis of real estate that is

12:38.680 --> 12:45.560
extremely suggested of some very crazy things that have happened in the last 50 years in our society.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.880
One of the, one of the numbers I've seen on this and if you look at real estate in London,

12:52.440 --> 12:59.320
it has an elasticity of minus two, which means that if you were to increase the supply of housing

12:59.320 --> 13:07.000
by 1%, the average price would go down 2%. And if you multiply in a 1.01 by 0.98,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.760
you get a smaller number. And this leads the paradoxical result that the more housing you

13:12.760 --> 13:19.720
build in London, the less it is collectively worth. And, and so when you have a market that is

13:19.800 --> 13:26.200
this strangely dysfunctional, some, you know, extremely odd sorts of things start to happen.

13:27.960 --> 13:34.360
It, and, and, and you have to sort of ask questions whether there is a kind of

13:34.360 --> 13:40.680
crony capitalism racket that, that, that starts to happen in a lot of different ways where,

13:41.320 --> 13:46.600
you know, if you think about the, the, the immigration debates in the UK or the United

13:46.600 --> 13:51.320
States, that there are all sorts of, you know, extremely politically correct and extremely

13:51.320 --> 13:56.680
politically incorrect arguments on immigration. But, but the sort of basic George's economics

13:56.680 --> 14:04.200
argument is, you know, if you add 2%, 3% a year immigration to the UK and the inelasticity is

14:04.200 --> 14:11.000
two to one, then, you know, London house prices will go up 4% to 6% a year. And, and then this is

14:11.000 --> 14:17.400
basically an extremely regressive tax on the half of the population that doesn't own houses.

14:17.400 --> 14:23.880
It's an extremely regressive tax on young people. And it's basically a formula for left-wing

14:23.880 --> 14:30.120
radicalization of the population over time. And that's, that's what we need to be able to now

14:30.120 --> 14:37.800
analyze. And I would be probably open to, you know, unrestrictive immigration. If you could

14:37.800 --> 14:43.240
build more housing, I think, you know, Elon will get to Mars before that happens in the UK.

14:46.840 --> 14:52.440
And then if we, you know, if we, if we look at something, you know, even more prosaic like,

14:53.160 --> 14:59.800
like at Oxford, one of the news items I was, I was reading was, I think the, you know,

14:59.800 --> 15:04.760
relative to incomes, the cost of housing is, is among the worst in the UK. And it's like a,

15:04.840 --> 15:08.920
you know, mini London or a hyper London or something like that is, is Oxford.

15:09.720 --> 15:17.320
The J.R.R. Tolkien house is for sale for 4.5 million pounds. And I would submit to you that if a,

15:17.320 --> 15:23.880
if an Oxford professor were to buy that house, probably the university would be justified in

15:25.000 --> 15:30.040
starting an inquiry into where the professor got the money to do that. And, and you have to,

15:30.040 --> 15:36.440
you have to sort of ask, you know, what, what are, you know, and then of course, if you can't

15:36.440 --> 15:41.800
have single family housing, if there is no family formation possible for anybody in academia,

15:42.920 --> 15:49.400
you know, is it really any wonder that you get this kind of nihilistic proletarianization of,

15:49.400 --> 15:55.720
of the faculty of the students of the younger generation? And where if you do not solve this

15:55.720 --> 16:00.680
sort of problem, you know, it doesn't matter what you do with all these other debates.

16:01.640 --> 16:09.640
To use, to use an American example, you know, 2007, San Francisco, New York, you know,

16:09.640 --> 16:15.240
I thought we were at a ridiculous housing bubble. Prices were, you know, completely insane. The

16:15.240 --> 16:21.160
rents were out of control. And the same thing in London 2007. If you had told me, you know,

16:21.640 --> 16:26.360
we'll fast forward to 2023, the prices are going to double. So this is just completely

16:26.360 --> 16:31.880
impossible. How would this, how could this possibly happen? If people would move, they moved to a

16:31.880 --> 16:38.600
different place. And, and, and if you had said, well, but, but just, just assume they doubled,

16:39.160 --> 16:44.440
how, how, you know, what would have happened? And I would, I'd be tempted. I don't know if I

16:44.440 --> 16:49.240
would have predicted this, but retrospectively, one might say, there must have been some crazy

16:49.240 --> 16:56.840
ideology that infested people's minds. And, and so, you know, if you're, you know, if you're a gay

16:56.840 --> 17:02.760
person living in Manhattan, maybe you're told that if you move to a suburb, you'll be beaten up by

17:02.760 --> 17:08.760
people with bats. And so you have to pay a gay tax and live in a big city. Or if you're a woman

17:09.640 --> 17:15.000
living in a rat infested apartment in San Francisco, and you fantasize about a nice

17:15.080 --> 17:20.760
suburban house in Reno, Nevada, maybe you will be told that, well, if you move to Reno, Nevada,

17:20.760 --> 17:26.520
you're going to be chained to your bed until you are forced to carry a baby to term. And,

17:27.240 --> 17:33.400
and that sort of all of these kinds of things would have intensified. Now, I don't have to,

17:33.400 --> 17:40.040
you know, so, so, you know, if we analyze wokeness in terms of real estate, you don't have to,

17:40.040 --> 17:45.720
you know, you don't have to go the full conspiracy theory. So I'm not, you know, I'm not arguing

17:45.720 --> 17:53.880
that something like Roe v. Wade being overturned was a conspiracy by left-wing urban slumlords

17:53.880 --> 17:59.720
in the U.S. or something like this. But, but if you have a negative in the elasticity of the

17:59.720 --> 18:06.120
sort I described with London, the kinds, you know, where this creates trillions of dollars

18:06.200 --> 18:13.080
of value that gets distributed, redistributed, shifted in a sort of socially toxic way.

18:14.120 --> 18:19.400
Isn't it even odd for us not to ask the question, maybe not a full intentional conspiracy,

18:19.400 --> 18:25.240
but at least it's an emergent property. It's the kind of thing that we, we tolerate. I will

18:25.240 --> 18:33.080
leave it as a politically incorrect exercise to you in this room to think about the craziest

18:33.080 --> 18:43.960
woke excess in the U.K. of the last 10 years or so. And then, and then think about how it

18:43.960 --> 18:53.320
increased aggregate housing prices in the U.K. And again, not, not saying it's causal, but just

18:53.320 --> 19:01.480
saying that maybe, maybe if you could stop the housing racket, you'd start to get to the roots

19:01.480 --> 19:10.040
of, of this woke, this woke disease. Now, now when we move beyond this sort of very,

19:10.040 --> 19:19.000
very stuck economy, one of the other, a second, a second big area where this, this focus on

19:20.520 --> 19:27.560
identity politics, diversity tends to focus us on all these debates within the humanities. And

19:27.560 --> 19:33.560
this is, this was also the, the direction of, of the diversity in this book. You just go through

19:33.560 --> 19:38.600
all, all these things that go wrong in the humanities and in the sort of, in the liberal arts,

19:38.600 --> 19:47.960
things like that. And the, the, the, the, the, the sort of idea that I've come to over the last

19:47.960 --> 19:58.360
15, 20 years is that perhaps just as broken as the humanities are the sciences, broadly speaking,

19:58.360 --> 20:05.320
that they are not, they are no longer progressing. They are, for the most part, pretty stuck. It's a

20:05.320 --> 20:12.840
harder case to make because science is a harder thing to understand. And, but, you know, when I

20:13.080 --> 20:17.000
was, when I was an undergraduate in the late 1980s, most of the science fields or

20:17.880 --> 20:21.960
most of the engineering fields one could have gone into would have been the wrong fields,

20:21.960 --> 20:26.680
you know, nuclear engineering, aero astro engineering, terrible ideas already in the late

20:26.680 --> 20:32.440
80s, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, physics, chemistry, all these sort of science areas

20:33.320 --> 20:39.000
somehow ended up being dead end. I think electrical engineering still barely worked for a while.

20:39.000 --> 20:46.920
And then really the only thing that, that, that, that had some sort of a future was, was

20:46.920 --> 20:53.800
computer science, which was in the late 80s, kind of a, sort of a, a field of people who couldn't

20:53.800 --> 20:58.680
handle the, the hardness of electrical engineering or math, sort of dropped out of

20:58.680 --> 21:05.480
electrical engineering and became a computer programmer. But, but the, you know, the rough

21:05.480 --> 21:11.480
picture of, of scientific technological progress I have is that, you know, for maybe the last 50

21:11.480 --> 21:18.200
years, we've had, you know, a narrow cone of progress around the world of bits, computers,

21:18.200 --> 21:23.080
internet, mobile internet software, but that the world of atoms, you know, where, which is the

21:23.080 --> 21:29.400
world we are embedded in, in some sense, matters more to us as human beings has been strangely

21:29.480 --> 21:35.240
stuck. And this is, you know, this is even in the word technology, which, you know, in some ways

21:35.240 --> 21:41.080
technology is just that, that's, that, which is progressing. And today technology has been

21:41.080 --> 21:47.400
collapsed to IT, information technology, because it is just this world of bits. If you use the word

21:47.400 --> 21:53.160
technology in 1973, it would have meant computers, but it also meant new medicines. It was meant the

21:53.160 --> 21:59.000
green revolution in agriculture. It would have meant, you know, supersonic aviation. It would

21:59.000 --> 22:05.080
have meant space travel. Technology was advancing on many, many different fronts. And, and, you

22:05.080 --> 22:10.840
know, in a, in a world where this is stuck, and we can't even, we're not even paying attention to it,

22:10.840 --> 22:18.120
that, that surely is, is a, is a big defect. The sort of US analogy that I've used on this is that,

22:19.880 --> 22:25.240
you know, if you ask the question, you know, are the humanities or the sciences less healthy,

22:25.240 --> 22:29.400
the sort of governmental analogy would be, is the Department of Motor Vehicles

22:31.480 --> 22:35.880
better or worse run than the NSA, the National Security Agency, or maybe the,

22:35.880 --> 22:42.200
maybe the British version would be something like the post office versus GCHQ. And the,

22:42.200 --> 22:46.440
the seemingly straightforward answer is obviously the post office is not well run, or the DMV is

22:46.440 --> 22:51.960
not well run in the US, and everybody can see it, just like the humanities are quite obviously

22:51.960 --> 22:57.880
sort of broken. But, but surely the more plausible answer is that the things you don't understand

22:57.880 --> 23:02.840
and can't see are more corrupt and that where you have, you know, these ever narrower groups of

23:02.840 --> 23:07.640
guardians guarding themselves, the string theorists guarding the string theorists, the cancer researchers

23:07.640 --> 23:11.240
telling us about how great they all are and how they're all going to have these breakthroughs in

23:11.240 --> 23:17.640
the next two years. That's surely the thing one should be more suspicious about. One of my,

23:17.640 --> 23:23.640
one of my friends worked for, was, was in the PhD physics department at Stanford, his advisor,

23:23.640 --> 23:31.160
Bob Laughlin, got a Nobel Prize in physics in the late 1990s. And Laughlin suffered from the

23:31.160 --> 23:36.760
supreme delusion that once he got a Nobel Prize in physics, he actually had, he finally had academic

23:36.760 --> 23:42.760
freedom and he could do whatever he wanted. And he decided that he was going to investigate these,

23:43.720 --> 23:49.640
you know, some areas in science that were truly taboo. And, you know, there's obviously stuff you

23:49.640 --> 23:55.640
can't ask questions about climate change or evolution or, you know, even stem cell research is

23:55.640 --> 24:00.600
probably, you know, allowed to ask too many questions about that. But he decided to go into

24:00.600 --> 24:05.320
something far more taboo than any of those things. And it was, he started with the premise that most

24:05.320 --> 24:10.440
of these scientists were actually just defrauding the government. They were engaged in semi fraudulent

24:10.440 --> 24:16.120
research. And they were, they shouldn't, you know, he worked on high temperature superconductors.

24:16.120 --> 24:20.200
He told me once that he thought, you know, there were 50,000 papers written in that field and only

24:20.200 --> 24:26.600
about 25 of the 50,000 deserved to be published. And, and they started with, you know, they started

24:26.600 --> 24:32.200
with an inquest into the Stanford biology department, where he basically believed that most of these

24:32.200 --> 24:38.280
people had, you know, effectively stolen money from the government. And there's been since then

24:38.280 --> 24:44.040
a sort of a replication crisis in science that people have made more of. But the replication

24:44.040 --> 24:49.720
crisis, it always gets narrated in the slightly politically correct way, where we don't actually

24:49.720 --> 24:53.320
mention the specific names. Lawful inside, no, I'm just going to mention the names of all the people.

24:53.320 --> 24:57.960
And here's the list of people who are stealing money. And as you can imagine this, you, I don't

24:57.960 --> 25:02.280
tell you how it ended, but he got promptly defunded. His students couldn't get PhDs anymore. And

25:02.920 --> 25:07.640
he at least got some kind of education about academic freedom from this process.

25:09.240 --> 25:16.760
And so, so, and so I think that, that, you know, I think in a, in a debate,

25:18.200 --> 25:22.520
if you have an argument, there maybe are always, I think, two fundamental ways one can try to

25:23.400 --> 25:29.080
make a case. And you can go after your opponent, you can go after the enemy at the weakest point,

25:29.720 --> 25:35.640
which is where you're most likely to score a tactical victory. Or you can go after your

25:35.640 --> 25:44.120
enemy at the strongest point. And, and if we, if we criticize the universities for the humanities,

25:44.120 --> 25:50.200
that's in some sense, what, I don't know, the central left, the law of administrative establishment

25:50.200 --> 25:56.280
wants us to do, we can, we can occasionally win some tactical victories. But, but, you know, the,

25:57.160 --> 26:03.080
where, where they get, you know, their sense of validation, their sense that everything is still

26:03.160 --> 26:08.760
healthy and great is the sciences. And if you can, if you can show that the sciences are more

26:08.760 --> 26:15.240
corrupt than the humanities, it's harder to do. But if you can do that, you will win game set match.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.520
And it's something, you know, I'm not, you know, it's always very difficult to do this with something

26:20.520 --> 26:25.720
like, the way I, I would attempt it to make the argument is something like, you know, the string

26:25.720 --> 26:29.880
theorists and physics are the smartest physics people, and they've been stuck for 40 years.

26:30.440 --> 26:35.240
And, and the physics people are the smartest people. And so by some principle of transitivities,

26:35.240 --> 26:39.880
string theorists have been doing nothing. There for everybody else has been doing nothing as well.

26:39.880 --> 26:46.120
And something, something like that would be the rough way, the rough way I would, I would make

26:46.120 --> 26:53.960
this, this sort of argument. Now, if we combine these, these two, two big things we're being distracted

26:53.960 --> 26:58.920
from, we're being distracted from the economy, even in its most basic forms, like real estate,

26:58.920 --> 27:06.120
we're being distracted from, from science. You know, and then in some ways things have

27:06.120 --> 27:11.000
not been healthy in the economy and science, they've not been progressing, the GDP has not

27:11.000 --> 27:16.360
been growing in a balanced way for quite some time. There's always a question, you know, could we,

27:17.640 --> 27:22.680
and the wokeness is distracting us from, from these things, from going back to these things.

27:23.640 --> 27:29.480
If we, if we focused on them, would we be able, would we be able to solve, you know, all of our

27:29.480 --> 27:38.200
problems and sort of as a, as maybe a little bit of an aside here, I, I think, I think the, the

27:38.200 --> 27:46.280
temptation has always been to find a straightforwardly economic solution to, you know, my, my version is

27:47.720 --> 27:52.360
broadly science and tech have been stagnant for something like 50 years. And the temptation

27:52.440 --> 27:57.880
is, has been to find some kind of economic fix where we don't, because getting science and tech

27:57.880 --> 28:04.520
back on track, it does sound pretty hard. And I think the reason we haven't been transparently

28:04.520 --> 28:10.440
stuck for 50 years is there were actually two one time economic fixes that did not involve science

28:10.440 --> 28:16.360
and tech that were done. There was a, you know, there was a right wing Reagan Thatcher fix in the

28:16.360 --> 28:24.120
1980s. And there was a one time solution where you could cut taxes, deregulate, allow lots of

28:24.120 --> 28:30.200
murders and acquisitions to happen. And you could one time gain enormous, an enormous lift for the

28:30.200 --> 28:36.920
whole economy. But it doesn't continue. If you rate lower taxes from 70% marginal rates to 28%

28:36.920 --> 28:43.240
percent, like they did in the US. But that's a one time lift. It worked from 1983 to 1989. And

28:43.320 --> 28:47.320
then by the late 80s, it was exhausted. And we went back to the cultural war debates that

28:47.320 --> 28:53.960
from the 1970s, they came back in the early 90s. And then there was a one time Clinton Blair

28:53.960 --> 29:03.880
solution circa 1995 to 2007, which was globalization. And it was also a way to increase GDP. It was

29:03.880 --> 29:10.600
probably a far more ruthless, ruthless way to do it than capitalism. It created far more inequality.

29:10.600 --> 29:15.160
The genie coefficient went up way more under Clinton than under Reagan in the United States.

29:16.120 --> 29:22.760
But it also, you know, there were some gains from that. Probably were some long term costs from

29:22.760 --> 29:32.360
that as well. But they both seem really, really hard to do. The probably there's a way in which the

29:32.360 --> 29:38.680
center right isn't a healthier place in the center left, because on the center right, we don't really

29:38.680 --> 29:44.360
think we can go back to to Reaganism. On the center left, there's still some idea that they can go

29:44.360 --> 29:50.280
back to Clintonism or, you know, you know, going back to that through the UK seems hard. Going back

29:50.280 --> 29:58.440
to Blair seems like maybe that's a mistake we still have to have to make in the UK. But I think

29:59.160 --> 30:06.200
but certainly if we if we can't think about the economic issues more clearly, the real estate

30:06.200 --> 30:11.800
issues more clearly, and probably if we can't think about the science and tech issues, we don't

30:11.800 --> 30:19.480
even have don't even have a hope to get back to a genuinely progressing society. Let me let me

30:19.480 --> 30:26.920
say something about maybe a third category that's sort of maybe even bigger than let's say the economy

30:26.920 --> 30:36.360
or, you know, science writ large. And that is that is something like, you know, the biggest,

30:36.360 --> 30:40.680
you know, I don't know, the biggest possible topic that one could have would be something

30:40.680 --> 30:45.000
like God. It's something like Anselm's ontological proof is that there's nothing that you can imagine

30:45.000 --> 30:50.040
that's bigger than God. And if and if these debates have distracted us from the economy

30:50.040 --> 30:55.160
and from science, they probably also have distracted us from questions of religion

30:55.160 --> 31:02.760
of God of the Christian God. And and so that would be sort of my my candidate for the biggest

31:02.760 --> 31:11.080
thing possible that we've been distracted from. And as with the sciences and with the economics,

31:11.080 --> 31:18.840
it also it's an odd thing for us to be distracted from because it is so suggestive and has so many

31:19.480 --> 31:27.800
different ways that this kind of debate should be reframed. And in particular,

31:29.000 --> 31:34.360
you know, I want to do too much on metaphysics or things like that, but maybe just focus a little

31:34.360 --> 31:43.800
bit on on a survey. What would Christianity tell us about history? And then what does this history,

31:43.800 --> 31:47.960
you know, does that tell us something interesting about our current historical moment and

31:48.840 --> 31:55.240
some of these some of these debates that that that we we've been touching on over the last

31:55.800 --> 32:03.320
half hour here. And basically, the basic thesis I would have would be that

32:04.200 --> 32:09.960
frames a little bit provocatively would be that, you know, perhaps the the original progressive

32:10.840 --> 32:15.800
was simply the Christian God. You know, the New Testament supersedes the Old Testament,

32:15.800 --> 32:23.000
that's the original idea of something like progressivism in in theology, the New is better than

32:23.000 --> 32:29.240
the Old, the New transcends the Old, there's some sort of progress in history. And and of course,

32:29.240 --> 32:36.760
there you know, there is sort of a a Jewish or pagan critique of Christianity that those of

32:36.760 --> 32:41.080
sort of Christian need to take very seriously, which is, you know, you know, once you have this

32:41.080 --> 32:46.920
principle of the of the New Testament superseded the New superseding the Old, is there a limit?

32:46.920 --> 32:53.640
Do you is it just a slippery slope to communism, to wokeness, to to ultra Christian, to some kind

32:53.640 --> 33:01.000
of antichristic parody? And and if you and if we had to concretize this even even more,

33:02.680 --> 33:07.320
you know, there is something about, you know, there's there's one sense, of course, in which

33:07.880 --> 33:14.440
what, you know, what the Bible says about the founding of the first city in the history of

33:14.440 --> 33:19.160
the world is the same as what mythology tells us about the founding of the greatest city

33:19.160 --> 33:25.800
in the history of the world. It starts with madness and murder. So Cain kills Abel, Romulus

33:25.800 --> 33:32.440
kills Remus. But the difference between the biblical account, and the, let's say, the,

33:33.160 --> 33:39.640
the, the conventional religious account is that the conventional religions take the side of the

33:39.640 --> 33:46.120
city. It takes the side, Rome takes the side of Romulus, the Bible already, already at the beginning

33:46.120 --> 33:51.400
in Genesis takes the side of Abel. And there's, of course, there's, you know, some sense in which

33:51.400 --> 33:57.240
the entire biblical tradition is from the point of view of the victim, you know, the Jews, you know,

33:57.240 --> 34:01.400
the normal way this the story of Exodus would be written would be from the point of view of the

34:01.400 --> 34:05.720
Egyptians, or these troublemakers, and they, they got removed to be like the Oedipus myth,

34:05.720 --> 34:12.280
where you get, you get rid of Oedipus, or something like that. And, and then, and then, of course,

34:12.280 --> 34:18.440
there is, there is something like this in, in, in the, in the Christian story itself, where

34:19.320 --> 34:25.560
it is a sort of inversion of perspectives, and this, this, you know, elevation of, of victimhood,

34:25.560 --> 34:32.760
this idea that this is central, surely was, was, was one of the, one of the key pieces of it. You

34:32.760 --> 34:36.360
know, it's, I think it's sort of a, the late Nietzsche, when he was, you know, when he was sort

34:36.360 --> 34:41.240
of going, going mad, sort of had this, it was always, you know, we need to, we need to go back

34:41.240 --> 34:47.880
to the strong classical world, where, you know, the victims don't complain, and all this stuff is,

34:48.680 --> 34:55.240
you know, is sort of healthy and robust, and, and, but he sort of had some sense this was not the way

34:55.320 --> 34:59.640
history was going, and sort of the, you know, sort of in his, towards his madness was sort of,

34:59.640 --> 35:05.400
God of the Jews, you have won. He sort of has sense that the 20th century, we're about to go,

35:05.400 --> 35:12.680
you know, into overdrive on victimology, and things of this sort. And, and if, if I had to

35:12.680 --> 35:18.360
sort of differentiate, maybe, you know, if I had to ask, if I had to ask the question, how is,

35:19.320 --> 35:27.960
the Christian view different from, let's say, the neo-pagan view, or the, or the, the woke hyper,

35:27.960 --> 35:33.160
the woke ultra-Christian view, something like that, the, you know, and I find a lot that's

35:33.160 --> 35:38.920
extremely tempting in a classical neo-pagan thing, I don't know, there's Bronze Age pervert, or,

35:38.920 --> 35:44.600
you know, all these sort of online people where it's, why can't we just forget about the history,

35:44.680 --> 35:50.600
and just move on, or, you know, just, or go back to nature, where, you know, nature,

35:51.240 --> 35:56.920
nature as a word does not occur once in the Old Testament, and, you know, nature is bare,

35:56.920 --> 36:01.240
red, and tooth, and claw, but if you take your bearings from nature, if you set nature as a

36:01.240 --> 36:07.400
standard, then you don't, there's nothing that's really naturally evil, nothing that's naturally,

36:07.400 --> 36:14.680
morally wrong, and that is sort of always the, let's say, the right-wing, pre-Christian,

36:14.680 --> 36:19.480
neo-pagan, I don't know, Nietzschean, Renaissance, humanism, all these different versions,

36:20.440 --> 36:27.560
temptation to, to sort of go back to that, and then on the, on the other side, I would say something

36:27.560 --> 36:39.320
like the, let's say, the woke, liberal, you know, post-Christian, maybe ultra-Christian,

36:39.320 --> 36:44.600
temptation, is that we are going to be more Christian than the Christians. We are going to,

36:44.600 --> 36:48.760
we're going to, you know, you know, the poor shall inherit the earth, and we're going to have a

36:48.760 --> 36:53.240
communist revolution, and we're going to accelerate the process, and we'll make it happen even faster,

36:53.240 --> 36:57.560
we're going to accelerate the history even more, and there's always, you know, this question,

36:57.560 --> 37:03.080
is it possible to be too Christian? And I think the answer is, in theory, no, but in practice,

37:03.080 --> 37:08.920
surely yes, and that in practice, if you, you know, if you try to hit the accelerator on this,

37:08.920 --> 37:18.440
you don't end up somehow finding a way to deal with the past, but you simply end up creating some

37:18.440 --> 37:25.720
kind of eternal recurrence, some kind of perpetual motion machine that generates nothing but violence

37:25.720 --> 37:30.760
and never-ending cycles of revenge. It is sort of another version of the Nietzschean eternal

37:30.760 --> 37:37.720
recurrence. And so the, you know, the Christian, the Christian perspective on this is always

37:37.720 --> 37:43.640
some paradoxical combination that, yes, there was original sin, yes, in the beginning was madness

37:43.640 --> 37:49.800
and murder, yes, there was incredible injustice in the past, and then you need to forgive people.

37:50.440 --> 37:59.640
And if you go with the neo-Pagan alt-right, whatever you want to call it, version,

37:59.640 --> 38:07.800
and you say there was nothing bad in the past, I think that somehow doesn't stand up against the

38:07.800 --> 38:12.520
historical pressure of Christianity against the working out of the Christian revelation in history.

38:12.600 --> 38:20.840
If you, and then if you go with the woke thing, there's some sense in which it also doesn't

38:20.840 --> 38:27.800
work for these opposite reasons. It's always hard to transpose this into these different

38:27.800 --> 38:33.240
categories, but the political categories I'm always tempted to use are something like these 20th

38:33.240 --> 38:41.160
century categories, fascism, communism, Christian democracy. And, you know, there's always sort

38:41.160 --> 38:49.000
of a debate between fascism and communism. Are they equally bad? Is communism, is fascism

38:49.000 --> 38:53.400
worse? And there's always a sort of conservative argument that they're roughly equally bad,

38:53.400 --> 38:59.080
they both killed millions of people, and they're sort of in some ways just copies of one another.

38:59.080 --> 39:06.760
But the sort of perspective leads me to think that we should very squarely say that something

39:06.840 --> 39:14.520
like fascism was generally much less bad than something like communism, because fascism was

39:15.320 --> 39:20.840
the past. And it was just, okay, fascist, the fascist claim was the victims were all guilty,

39:20.840 --> 39:24.600
and it's the historical victims from middle ages, we're going to go back to them, and we're going

39:24.600 --> 39:31.000
to victimize them. And then communism was sort of, it was like always like sort of more in the

39:31.000 --> 39:35.480
future, and it was, we're going to go after the victimizers, we're going to victimize the victimizers,

39:35.480 --> 39:41.880
we're sort of too clever by half. And that was always the far more powerful, the far greater

39:41.880 --> 39:48.920
temptation in our world. And that's why, you know, even if someone like Bronze Age pervert or

39:48.920 --> 39:58.360
Iron Rand is somehow wrong in their sort of whitewashing of the past, it's probably,

39:58.360 --> 40:02.040
it probably is always at the end of the day, the more innocent mistake to make,

40:02.040 --> 40:06.840
because we're in this in this world, we're something like the hyper-Christian

40:07.720 --> 40:16.040
wokeness, the original sin with no hope of forgiveness is the greater temptation.

40:19.000 --> 40:28.440
You know, let me end with maybe one thought, I've given you three very big things that we've

40:28.440 --> 40:36.920
been distracted from the economy, science and tech broadly, you know, the Christian God.

40:37.480 --> 40:41.960
But you know, there's always a sense which you say, well, the more immediate thing is still

40:41.960 --> 40:48.600
always these political questions, and we're in this political question. And so maybe if you have

40:48.600 --> 40:55.160
to have a political answer, what are we being distracted from politically? Where is wokeness

40:55.240 --> 41:03.000
distracting us from more important things that are immediately political? I would suggest maybe

41:03.000 --> 41:10.120
one way to start is to think about the etymology or the sort of the word of the term political

41:10.120 --> 41:16.600
correctness, where political correctness, you know, by the 1980s, it already was this

41:16.600 --> 41:21.320
conservative term that conservatives used to criticize sort of intolerant liberals.

41:21.400 --> 41:25.640
But if we go back to the 1970s, political correctness was actually a term liberals used to describe

41:25.640 --> 41:29.960
themselves, where they were sort of like really, really progressive and really politically correct,

41:29.960 --> 41:36.280
and that it was a term of self-congratulation. And if you went back to the 1950s, the original

41:36.280 --> 41:42.280
meaning of political correctness was that it was you were a politically correct comrade because

41:42.280 --> 41:46.440
you were following the orders directly from Moscow and you were following the party line of the

41:46.440 --> 41:55.000
Communist Party. And so if we, you know, if we go back to the original meaning of political

41:55.000 --> 42:00.040
correctness and sort of think that, you know, the real problem is something, you know, something

42:00.040 --> 42:05.320
like communism, even though it's, you know, communism fascism in the 20th century were youth

42:05.320 --> 42:10.200
movements and we're sort of dealing with a gerontocratic version of this. So it's different,

42:10.200 --> 42:17.000
demographically it's very different, but something like ultra-Christianity communism,

42:17.000 --> 42:22.600
this set of things is the real problem today. And so this is a great simplification,

42:23.880 --> 42:32.040
great reduction, but you could do much worse than whenever you hear the term DEI to just think CCP.

42:33.160 --> 42:33.800
Thank you very much.

42:34.280 --> 42:44.200
Well, let's begin to explore these

42:47.000 --> 42:52.840
very deep questions and profound thoughts that have been put before us. And I think we should

42:52.840 --> 43:00.120
recognize that they're all attempts, I think, Peter, to shake us out of our distraction.

43:00.920 --> 43:07.800
There were three types of distraction here. The beginning one was the first one was the way in

43:07.800 --> 43:16.920
which debates about woke and anti-woke about culture very often lead us to turn our thoughts away

43:16.920 --> 43:22.440
from fundamental contradictions in economic life. And this is a way in which

43:22.440 --> 43:31.320
Peter's way of thinking combines certain aspects without being a libertarian or a Marxist of

43:31.960 --> 43:38.440
libertarian and Marxist critiques of our current economic regime. The second was,

43:38.440 --> 43:43.720
which I found particularly fascinating, was the way in which the kind of paradigmatic

43:44.840 --> 43:51.880
contrast which many people including I myself have made between ethics and politics as not being

43:52.440 --> 43:57.640
highly progressive and science and technology as being highly progressive, as being prototypically

43:57.640 --> 44:03.960
progressive is not, in fact, substantiated by the actual evidence that sciences and technology,

44:03.960 --> 44:09.480
except in a few narrow fields, have been stuck in the same categories of thinking in the same

44:09.480 --> 44:16.760
theoretical frameworks and even the same types of technology for about 50 years. And then the third

44:17.560 --> 44:28.760
type of distraction that this talk was trying to rid us of or shake us out of was a distraction in

44:28.760 --> 44:37.320
which questions of religion or of theology or of not exactly metaphysics but of the way we

44:37.320 --> 44:43.480
ultimately think about good and evil and how human beings are in the world have been pushed

44:43.480 --> 44:51.240
on one side and yet they continually reappear with woke, not actually being at all, as some

44:51.240 --> 44:58.040
people have said on the right, a repaganization of the world but as being a type of hyper-Christianity

44:58.040 --> 45:05.720
emptied of transcendence and forgiveness. And that leads to, I guess, a question, my question

45:06.360 --> 45:12.920
to you, Peter, is, is there some way out of this? Because in a way, I think one of the things you

45:12.920 --> 45:18.680
said which was most interesting was the attempt to, in the 20th century, in fascism and other

45:19.240 --> 45:26.520
types of thinking were now in interesting writers like Bronze Age, Pervert, or earlier on in Iran.

45:27.080 --> 45:31.480
What they were doing was, I would think in your terms, Peter, it was actually very interesting

45:31.480 --> 45:38.280
but impossible because you can't, would you think this is true, you can't actually get back to a

45:38.280 --> 45:43.880
classical or pre-Christian view of the world in which energy and vitality empower what matters

45:43.880 --> 45:50.200
and victimhood is contemptible or unimportant. Once Christianity is there, so we can't go back.

45:50.200 --> 45:53.720
And that's true of the other, the previous two. We can't go back to earlier forms of science,

45:53.720 --> 45:57.800
we can't go back to earlier forms of economic thinking, although I thought what you said about

45:57.800 --> 46:05.160
Henry George was very interesting. Are we really stuck? Can we actually, can you actually, is it

46:05.160 --> 46:09.480
possible to unstick us? I think it is because I think you're already unsticking us tonight.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.920
Where would you think that there's the best chance of unsticking us?

46:14.360 --> 46:22.040
Well, my very fast answer is always the first thing you have to do to solve problems is to

46:22.040 --> 46:26.120
talk about them. So I think that as long as we have this, as you described, Groundhog Day of

46:26.120 --> 46:35.080
Wokeness, we are not going to be unstuck and we're going to be in this sort of zero-sum

46:36.040 --> 46:44.760
somewhat malthusian, ever nastier political kind of a context. I think there are,

46:45.560 --> 46:50.920
there certainly are ways, there probably are ways all three of them could be

46:52.200 --> 46:57.240
ways we could get unstuck in all three dimensions. I think there's some way that the

46:58.760 --> 47:03.720
pure capitalism, pure globalism things probably don't quite work in economics.

47:05.320 --> 47:10.440
I do think one could probably do something about the real estate problem. It's so

47:10.440 --> 47:17.480
extraordinarily distorted. And so that's that, that there probably are things one can do. It's

47:17.480 --> 47:27.960
very hard because you would destroy trillions of dollars in value in doing it. But that probably,

47:28.840 --> 47:33.560
it has to give at some point. Maybe it's a technological fix. The way the Henry George

47:33.560 --> 47:39.400
thing was historically solved was you had an open frontier in America. And then the frontier

47:39.400 --> 47:44.520
closed in the late 19th century. So the railroads were the technology to open the frontier.

47:44.520 --> 47:50.280
Eventually the frontier is populated, it gets closed. And then late 19th, early 20th century,

47:50.280 --> 47:55.560
the cities start to have this gorgeous runaway real estate price effect, rising inequality,

47:55.560 --> 48:01.320
and you get progressivism as a response to the closing of the frontier. And then in the 20th

48:01.320 --> 48:07.800
century, in a way, another frontier got opened with the automobile and the highways and the suburbs.

48:07.800 --> 48:15.640
And that relieved the pressure on the runaway costs. And then that technology has also run its

48:15.640 --> 48:21.720
course. And there's a question, is there some way to reopen a frontier in real estate? And

48:21.720 --> 48:27.240
probably the one where I think the jury is very out and doesn't look that promising in 2023,

48:27.480 --> 48:32.040
it would be something like, could one really get remote work to work? Could the internet

48:32.040 --> 48:38.920
be a way that people are not stuck in these cities? And that would reset all these real estate

48:38.920 --> 48:44.360
values tremendously, because even in a rather densely populated country like England, there is

48:44.360 --> 48:50.520
plenty of space if you're not forced to be in within the green belt of London itself. And

48:50.520 --> 48:58.360
certainly the United States even more so. And then I think within the technology area,

48:59.560 --> 49:07.640
my hopeful sense is that there is always a question, why did the technology slow down and

49:08.360 --> 49:14.680
the science slow down? And the thing I'm hopeful on is that it was not that we just ran out of

49:14.680 --> 49:20.360
ideas. It's that there were these deformations of culture, we became too risk averse, too bureaucratic,

49:20.440 --> 49:27.400
too much peer review in the sciences. And I think we could be making a lot more progress

49:27.400 --> 49:33.960
in a lot of areas. It's regulated, people are scared of technology. We don't want to minimize

49:33.960 --> 49:39.800
or trivialize their fears. But I think you could have a very different balance there.

49:40.600 --> 49:46.680
And then certainly the questions about the larger meaning of life or the meaning of history

49:47.560 --> 49:51.960
are, you know, are ones that I think would all do well to confront more.

49:55.000 --> 50:01.560
To take in a way what might be the most immediate part of what you've just said and said before,

50:01.560 --> 50:07.080
I guess it implies, which I think is absolutely true, that the so-called consensus that prevails

50:07.080 --> 50:14.120
between say, Sunak and Stammer is far more consensus on what we're not supposed to think about,

50:14.840 --> 50:19.080
that it is on to anything positive. Because the big problems you've mentioned, the problems

50:19.080 --> 50:23.400
stagnation in science, the problems of real estate in London and Oxford and throughout the

50:23.400 --> 50:28.360
country, the problems of generational inequity in which young people can't find any way to live and

50:28.360 --> 50:33.640
so they're all hardly addressed at all. There's a bit of commentary in the newspapers and so on.

50:33.640 --> 50:41.080
But in terms of thinking about active solutions, there perhaps maybe some dim, subliminal awareness

50:41.080 --> 50:46.280
among these politicians that the solving them would involve big losses for somebody.

50:47.800 --> 50:53.560
Yes, or certainly big losses for them in the election. There's the felt sense. And so,

50:54.200 --> 50:59.800
yeah, and it's certainly not limited to the UK, but certainly an outside perspective,

50:59.800 --> 51:04.840
I would have it, because it seems to me that, yeah, there's a secret agreement between Sunak

51:04.920 --> 51:12.360
and Stammer, let's say, to talk as much as possible about culture wars, take various

51:12.360 --> 51:18.920
sides on those issues. And then if you have even basic economic questions like a runaway deficit

51:18.920 --> 51:26.840
spending, and do you solve this with higher taxes or lower entitlements? And then they both have a

51:26.840 --> 51:31.560
look ahead function where if we talk about that, we'll lose 10 or 15% of the voters.

51:32.360 --> 51:37.160
I mean, maybe not quite as many for Sunak since it's hard to lose 10 or 15% of the voters.

51:39.480 --> 51:45.640
But there's some kind of a look ahead function where we shouldn't touch that. But then

51:47.640 --> 51:52.120
when everybody does that, when all the solutions are outside the Overton window,

51:53.080 --> 52:01.080
we end up with, yeah, we're confined in this very narrow box and the Groundhog Day will

52:01.080 --> 52:06.200
continue until at some point something really breaks. So there won't be a Nietzsche and Groundhog

52:06.200 --> 52:10.920
Day, it won't really be eternal. It's going to break down, isn't it? I mean, that's one way or the

52:10.920 --> 52:16.680
other, even if only for economic reasons, but we don't know when or how. Sure. Yeah, I think

52:16.680 --> 52:24.920
there certainly are all kinds of dimensions one could point to where it is not simply stable.

52:25.880 --> 52:31.640
The demographics are not stable. The deficits are not stable. We had pseudo stability and deficits

52:31.640 --> 52:36.520
for 40 years in the United States and much of the Western world where the deficits were too big,

52:36.520 --> 52:41.880
but the interest rates went steadily down. And something around that seems to have broken in

52:41.880 --> 52:49.160
the last year or two. So I think even something as basic as deficits financed at 0% interest rates,

52:49.400 --> 52:55.560
it seemed like the 2010s could go on forever and that seems over. And they haven't.

52:56.360 --> 53:06.360
Yeah, ended with the 2020s. Yeah. Does that bleed back into the segue back into the cultural and

53:06.360 --> 53:14.680
the religious questions you discussed? Because I guess part of the resistance to your analysis

53:15.240 --> 53:23.960
of science is a kind of quasi religious conception of the salvific possibilities of science,

53:23.960 --> 53:33.480
that science can do what religion hasn't done, which is to actually change worldly life in a way

53:33.480 --> 53:41.240
which reads it of its deepest contradictions. And I guess if for some people, if they gave up that

53:41.240 --> 53:47.800
faith in science, they would be left with nihilism or left with despair or left with unbearable

53:47.800 --> 53:54.520
anxiety. Yeah, although it's sort of a, obviously there's a very complicated history of science,

53:54.520 --> 53:59.000
and it was in some ways maybe a byproduct of Christianity and so it was an opposition to

53:59.000 --> 54:09.000
Christianity. And certainly in its healthy, ambitious, early modern forms, whether it was

54:09.640 --> 54:17.160
a substitute or a compliment to Christianity, it was supposed to be, it was somehow supposed

54:17.160 --> 54:22.520
to be a vehicle for comparable transformation and sort of the indefinite prolongation of human life

54:23.720 --> 54:29.800
was an early modern science project and people still believe very much in the 17th, 18th century.

54:29.800 --> 54:37.160
And there was a sub movement within sort of the revolutionary Soviet politics. It was still very

54:37.160 --> 54:44.840
healthy in the 1920s called Cosmism, where a part of the project of the revolution had to be to

54:44.840 --> 54:50.040
physically resurrect all dead human beings. And because if science didn't do that, it would be

54:50.040 --> 54:54.760
inferior to Christianity or something like that. That's sort of one of their slogans. They had to

54:54.760 --> 54:59.880
adapt themselves, the cosmos to the Soviet and Bolshevik reality was, debt of the world unite.

55:02.200 --> 55:05.800
Because they wanted to bring back not only not only that, everyone in the present generation

55:05.800 --> 55:09.720
would live forever, but that all the people who'd ever died would come back.

55:10.280 --> 55:17.000
And so there is this, let's say, anti-Christian or riveted from Christian, you know, a very

55:17.000 --> 55:23.560
ambitious version of science. And of course, there is also a more defeatist version of science,

55:23.560 --> 55:26.200
where science actually just tells us about limits and things you cannot do.

55:27.000 --> 55:33.720
I don't know, I'll use a literary example when Hamlet's evil mother, Gertrude, says that all

55:33.720 --> 55:41.640
that lives must die. The question you have is, is that a law of nature? Or is this just a

55:41.640 --> 55:47.400
rationalization for the rottenness that is Denmark? Certainly, the early modern conception

55:47.400 --> 55:53.080
was that you wanted to transcend this both in a Christian or a scientific form. And then,

55:53.080 --> 55:58.840
yeah, late modernity, it's probably attributed more as a decay of science that this sort of ambition

55:58.840 --> 56:02.040
is more a fringe science thing than a mainstream science thing.

56:02.040 --> 56:09.160
And I guess there's also a kind of nihilistic version of science, a sort of brave new world

56:09.160 --> 56:18.120
version in which sees itself as pacifying the spiritual and mental anguish and doubts of human

56:18.120 --> 56:23.480
beings by giving them access to drugs and pornography and all kinds of things which

56:23.480 --> 56:28.600
distract them forever from these fundamental existential questions, the religious questions.

56:28.760 --> 56:34.040
What would work to exterminate religion wouldn't be, or to terminate the need for religion,

56:34.040 --> 56:39.720
wouldn't be persecuting, and that obviously has never worked, but to try and put everyone asleep

56:40.360 --> 56:48.200
with dreams of drug dreams, drug highs. And of course, drugs are a tremendous feature of our life

56:48.200 --> 56:54.200
at the moment, aren't they, in many countries? I wouldn't even go that far. The line I was using

56:54.200 --> 56:58.360
this is just the iPhones that distract you from your environment will distract you from

56:58.360 --> 57:03.080
fact, you're in a 100 year old subway in London or New York or the environment hasn't changed.

57:03.560 --> 57:10.840
And then again, I don't think one should make it fully intentional, but there is something about

57:10.840 --> 57:18.360
certain narrow forms of technical progress that have more of this retarding effect elsewhere,

57:18.360 --> 57:26.680
or this making us oblivious to what's going on effect. But yeah, I think most of it is not,

57:27.400 --> 57:33.400
it's not supposed to be ambitious, world transforming. It is not at all early modern

57:33.400 --> 57:40.440
science. It's much more, I don't know, probably the strongest science and one of the stronger

57:40.440 --> 57:47.000
science and politics themes is always the climate change debate. And if you take climate change

57:47.000 --> 57:52.360
seriously, there are all kinds of progressive science things one could do. You could be pushing

57:52.360 --> 57:56.920
for the construction of hundreds of new nuclear reactors, you could be pushing for fusion. There's

57:56.920 --> 58:03.080
sort of all kinds of ways that you could be concerned about climate change and lean into

58:03.960 --> 58:10.840
rapidly progressing science. And then in practice, it's much more that maybe you should just ride

58:10.840 --> 58:18.520
a bicycle or something like that. And so it's somehow a lot of science has this Luddite feel,

58:18.520 --> 58:22.280
even though it's obviously, you can find lots of different things.

58:22.280 --> 58:29.400
Or start eating insects rather than beef, because beef, but one, I mean, that thought

58:31.400 --> 58:37.320
one of the functions of smartphones is to distract us from the fact that we're living in a

58:37.320 --> 58:44.040
Victorian environment still with Victorian sewers and Victorian subways and Victorian buildings

58:45.240 --> 58:51.720
is I think a very profound word thought because it suggests that one of the functions of technology,

58:51.720 --> 58:58.280
which is something that affects the material world is to supplant the material world in our own

58:58.280 --> 59:03.480
lives so that we live in a virtual world more and more of the time. Of course, it's got physical

59:03.480 --> 59:09.400
roots, this virtual world. So if something goes wrong with the physical roots, if there is war or

59:09.400 --> 59:14.920
terrorism or climate change or whatever, then it's all disrupted. But that's part of the way it works,

59:14.920 --> 59:22.440
isn't it? Well, certainly, that's the part of technology that's been healthiest has been

59:22.440 --> 59:28.600
still the most progressive is this narrow cone around this virtual world. I keep thinking that

59:28.680 --> 59:33.800
you could do a lot more in these other areas. If I, again, come back to something like the real

59:33.800 --> 59:41.160
estate housing version, this seems the furthest from technological innovation. I mean, there are

59:41.160 --> 59:45.640
new building designs, you can build 100 story buildings that you could not build 20, 30 years ago.

59:47.160 --> 59:53.560
There are presumably some new things one could even do there. But if too much of the economy

59:53.560 --> 01:00:00.280
is anchored on things that are hard to improve or change, that is also a way in which progress

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.960
slows. So if we have an economy in the UK, and I'll make these numbers up where it's

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:12.040
50% real estate and 10% computers, then even if the 10% that is computers is somehow getting better

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:19.800
and better, if 50% that is real estate is very stuck, that is going to be at best a slowly improving

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.760
economy. And then the most important thing is somehow not going to be changing it. And then

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.440
that probably creates all kinds of weird side effects and incentives. So the hyper progressivism,

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:38.680
the hyper accelerationism that we are told we have by politicians and others by Blair, for example,

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:47.400
that we're accelerating in. It does not show up in the per capita GDP numbers. It does not show up

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:53.640
in incomes rising faster than rents. I just think the rebuttal is simply on the real estate side.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.320
And then you can be told that people don't want to live in houses anymore. They don't want to

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.400
have families. They're conscious. You shouldn't have children because you're just beating insects.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:11.240
But at some point, again, at some point, this is really a parody, not really progressivism.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.640
I didn't attend it, but there was a meeting in London of Blair and some of his disciples at many

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.640
parties, including the Conservative Party, in which, for him, the next phase of acceleration was

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:29.240
precisely the one in which your analysis suggests there's been the most the largest and most neglected

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.720
stagnation in the technology, which is that all globalization might not have gone far enough.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.560
We've retreated from it. We shouldn't have, but we have. It's still going to go on, but

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.560
we're going to try and we're resisting it. So how can we cope with the situation in which we're not

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.680
and getting enough acceleration from globalization, where we'll accelerate the technological side?

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:54.040
And yet, if what is accelerating, if it's going to be AI and the virtual world, I guess,

01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:00.920
he thinks that we can solve our problems in medical care by AI, that's the solution for him.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:07.800
Look, it's always dangerous for me to comment on too much on British politics, but my senses

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:14.280
that Blair occupies is very, very strange place where it is. It is this past. It obviously does

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:21.400
not work. We obviously cannot go back to the sort of globalization that he represented or doing more

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.600
of it. In some sense, doesn't work, but it never gets articulated. And so it has a very different

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.480
quality than, let's say, thatcherism where there's, you know, and again, I was in some ways very

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:39.400
sympathetic to Liz Truss, but there's some sense in which it didn't work. And somehow it's clear

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.760
that we somehow can't go back to thatcherism, or doing more of thatcherism isn't going to be a

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:53.000
solution. Whereas on the left, it's in this very strange in-between zone where somehow Blair is

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.240
not being run as a candidate for prime minister. Officially. Well, again, I'm just going, if he

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.760
ran officially, one suspects it would work very badly. But then, you know, if you're someone

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.560
like Starmer, you know, what labor leader do you want to emulate? Do you want to emulate Atlee,

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:17.160
which probably is not that, that doesn't work. And then maybe Blair is the only other one on offer.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.640
And so that's sort of the default idea even though it never gets articulated, which tells you it's

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.000
probably not very good. Absolutely. I mean, I guess the difference is that when there's trust

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.960
wing of the Conservative Party wants to go back to Thatcher, because they see that as a radical

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.800
moment and they want to repeat the radical moments. But because radical moments are very hard to keep

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.840
repeating all the time. They're hard to repeat by doing the same thing. Doing the same thing.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:51.240
So it's certainly, there was a one-time move to deregulate and lower taxes. And then not clear

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.160
what one can do. Doing it the second time does as much good. You know, McKinsey. McKinsey was a

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.960
real thing in 1985 in the United States. If you hired a consultant, they actually helped you improve

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.160
your company, you know, because the companies were badly run. At this point, McKinsey is a total

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:17.800
racket. It's just all fake. And so if you have a Reagan, you know, the Reagan Thatcher administration,

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.560
they empowered McKinsey because they allowed more companies to be acquired and more M&A

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.760
activity to happen. And it was a, you know, a somewhat brutal, but very powerful reorganization

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.920
of society. And that was possible. And that was the right thing to do in the 1980s. You know,

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:37.000
at this point, McKinsey is not ever going to be anything other than a super corrupt fake racket

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
in 2023. And so we can't go back to that specific thing, you know. It's fascinating the way in

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.440
which the product of these revolutionary changes in the economy and society and thinking produces

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.240
a proliferation of rackets in science too. And I guess that's connected with

01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:00.840
fakery. Fakery, that's to say, so many of the phenomena around us are fakery.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:09.800
I don't know if it has to happen that way, but one of my colleagues, maybe this would be another

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:20.040
link, the sciences to the wokeness problem, is that institutions have embedded growth

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:28.440
obligations, egos, in short, EGO, embedded growth obligations. And so a healthy institution,

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.360
in some sense, is one that has this exponential growth. And if you have exponential growth,

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.520
there will be more jobs and everyone can get promoted. And there's sort of a way that if a

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:42.280
company has exponential growth, that's a healthy company. And there are other versions of this in

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:49.240
different forms. And then at some point, maybe the growth stops. And when the growth stops,

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.640
you have a choice. You can maybe become more honest and say, well, you know,

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.760
the university isn't growing anymore, there'll be very few faculty slots available.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.480
If you're in a PhD program, we're going to make sure that 80% of the students

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.560
drop out of the program within six months, so they don't waste their time.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:20.200
And we're going to be honest about the fact that there's no growth. Or the thing that I think

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:26.440
unfortunately happens a great deal is you just lie. And the institutions become sociopathic,

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:31.480
where they pretend that the growth is still going on. And then it's only years and years later

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:37.560
that people figure out that there are no jobs. And the wokeness was just,

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.480
it's just a distraction. It's sort of like, if you have 10 graduate students in a chemistry

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.520
program, and there's a job for only one of them, and you're having fist fights over beakers and

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:54.120
Bunsen burners, and you're in the sort of Malthusian struggle, and there's one person who says

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.520
something slightly racist or slightly inappropriate. I mean, it's such a relief,

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:06.040
you can throw that one person off the overcrowded bus, right? So these are natural things to

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:14.680
happen, but surely we would do better to find ways to get back to growth in as many places

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.400
of our society as possible. Indeed, because what you just said is that the solution to

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.720
non-growth is persecution. You can eliminate various people from the competition by

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:33.000
canceling them, pushing them out. They're not there anymore. They're what was termed in the first

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.640
Constitution of the Soviet Union back, I think in 1918, 1919, former persons. So if you make

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.760
these people former persons, at least they're not competitors anymore, they're out. So that's a very,

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:50.440
again, unless we grow in certain ways in knowledge and technology in a genuine way,

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:54.680
we're going to have this persecutory mentality. It has a function, it has a role,

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.640
even an economic or a career structure role and so on.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.680
But it's always important to understand the persecution is not as ideological as it's

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:09.160
dressed up to be. So because if it's actually driven by scarcity, you will just have scarcity.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:15.720
The US academic version of this, when I wrote the diversity myth book in the early 90s,

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.760
I was thinking to myself, academia discriminates against conservatives, libertarians like myself.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:28.040
I think that was true for one cohort of baby boomer academics who got PhDs in the 70s and

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.480
couldn't get tenure in the 80s in the US. But by my generation, where I would have gotten a PhD in

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.760
the 1990s, it was obvious there was no job because I was conservative. And so the conservatives were

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.880
actually not discriminated against. It was the liberals that were discriminated against who were

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:48.280
Gen X, millennial, because they all had the delusion that it was, yeah, it was kind of zero

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.920
sum. But as long as you've told the correct party line, yes, we're safe. And that was, of course,

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:59.240
also the delusion that the party line communists had when they were disproportionately targeted

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:05.720
by the Stalin show trials in the 1930s. The Soviet term for it was always section 58 of the

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.600
Soviet penal code was that you were guilty of counter-revolutionary activity. And I think the

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.160
key to understanding that was that everybody was guilty. And there were just some people who

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.080
were not being prosecuted for the time being by the government. And so in this world of extreme

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:28.680
scarcity, eventually everybody gets somehow deplatformed or ejected or something like that,

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.200
just about. I mean, the Soviet analogies are very rich. I think it was another Soviet term,

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.760
which was telling lies that no one believes in. And that was seen as an essential thing,

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.000
because one of the things, if you're surrounded by lies and every single person, including the

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.360
people who tell them, know that they're lies, know that it's not the truth, then it sort of hinges

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.160
you to some extent. And it makes you scared. And also because the party line, what determines what's

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.040
a lie and what's not, changes inexplicably all the time. And I think in a way we've progressed

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.040
beyond the Soviets now in that respect, because we've really got to the point where no one really

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.360
knows what the party line is, but everyone's terrified from deviating from it. It's the

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:14.680
postmodern version of the party. Yeah, I think it's always so hard to know exactly what's going

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:23.160
on. We're in this strange postmodern world. I think people are generally quite cynical.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.480
They don't believe all the lies they're being told. It gets discounted pretty heavily.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.520
But nevertheless, it has this effect where somehow we can't focus on the really important

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.880
things that are going on of the sort that I talked about. And so it does have this. And

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:48.200
I'll come back to this metaphor that it is like this hypnotic magic trick. And the important

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.200
thing is not what the magician is doing, but what the magician is distracting us from.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:59.320
And maybe even the magician is taken in by the sleight of hand. Maybe it's easier to

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.720
live with oneself as a magician, a political magician, a technological magician,

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.120
if you really think there's something in it, although you can never quite see what it is,

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:15.080
because the trick is almost bigger than you. There's a whole division among magicians between

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.440
the ones, there's a class that claimed that it's real and there's a class that claimed that it's

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:24.200
fake. And so yes, that is, that is, I believe the sociology of magicians is they're those two

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:32.200
competing camps. How far is there just social science fit into this? There was a wonderful book

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.640
about 70 years ago by, not 70 years ago, in the 70s, 1970s, by the sociologists,

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.880
poly sociologists, I knew, there was a marvellous book in every way, but the very best part of it

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:49.720
was that it was called Social Sciences as Sorcery in 1970s. And he was arguing that the whole

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.000
80 or 90, not that there's no social science or that there can't be, didn't think that, he thought

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.880
there was and there could be more of it, but that much of it was just the kind of magical

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:09.320
transposition of terms, forms of distraction from real problems that you're talking about,

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:15.800
that actually a lot of it was, it was theorized and systematized distraction. So if you talk about

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.920
identity struggles, you're missing out very profound structural inequalities, economic

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:31.320
and temperature. He took examples of plagues and even of syphilis in which people talked about in

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.400
all sorts of complex ways of power structures, but the basic thing is the thing itself, the

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.160
material thing. It's just a way of avoiding contact with the material world, isn't it?

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.280
Yeah, I wouldn't, it feels like that's slightly too strong since I think I gave, I'm not sure it

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:51.560
was, I wouldn't want to call it a social science speech today, but some kind of attempt to analyze

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:59.000
these things in terms of the history, politics, sociology, psychology of our of our societies.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:07.480
Yes, I think a lot of these soft fields do have this quality that they are, I want to say that

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:13.080
they are in theory extremely important and there's something about them that is an extremely

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:20.120
important way at getting at things and then for that reason they're also extremely prone to

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:26.200
politicization of various sorts. One of the things I always like to say is that any field that has

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:33.080
the term science in it should always be suspicious because it's sort of, it's exaggerating, it's

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:39.320
social science, political science, climate science, even computer science, it started as computer

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:44.200
science because it had a very serious inferiority complex to math and electrical engineering.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.400
And it's not, I think, accidental, and though it's often forgotten that both of the great

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.160
terrible movements, the 20th century communism and Nazism actually, which is often seen as

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:02.040
anti-scientific, but was in fact often defended in the 30s and 20s and then 40s by biological or

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:09.800
racial science that just as dialectical materialism, diamat as it was called then, was the greatest

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:16.680
science that ever been. So these repressive movements, murderous movements, movements which

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.400
killed millions of people but also killed off thought wherever they could, well all advanced,

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.360
they all thought it very important to call themselves science.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:31.480
Well, it's, I don't know, this may be sort of a philosophy of science thought I have is that

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:38.200
I think in theory what science is supposed to do is fight a two front war against excessive

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.920
dogmatism and excessive skepticism. And if you're, and so excessive dogmatism is like, I know, the

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.120
decayed Aristotelianism of the medieval church and that was what science was in some ways fighting

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:56.040
in the 17th and 18th century. And then excessive skepticism, if I can't trust my senses and I

01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.600
don't know whether I'm sitting in front of you, if you're too skeptical, you also can't do science.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:06.680
And then these two front wars intention, it's actually hard to get that balance,

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.200
it's very hard to get that balance right. Probably the early modern version I would say was

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:21.800
more anti-dogmatism than anti-skepticism. If we fast forward to 2023 and there are all kinds of

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.960
things where I know the scientific establishment, the leading scientists would caution us against

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.120
being too skeptical, not supposed to be vaccine skeptics, we're not supposed to be climate science

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:39.880
skeptics, we're not supposed, it's fighting skepticism in all its forms. And then I'd be

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.480
hard-pressed, I could maybe hold a gun to my head, I might be able to come up with one or two things,

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.880
but I'd be very hard-pressed to come up with a single instance where a scientist would say,

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.640
this is an area where science is too dogmatic today in 2023. The string theorists wouldn't

01:15:53.640 --> 01:16:00.680
say we're too dogmatic about string theory, but just very, very hard-pressed to say where it's

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:08.280
too dogmatic. And that surely tells us that somehow it has degenerated into something that's

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.800
more dogmatic than the medieval church. If you're just fighting skepticism, it tells you

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:21.080
you're a dogman. That's probably there was some version of this with the totalitarian science

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:27.640
of the early 20th century, where it leveraged the term, so it was somehow still pretending to

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:36.840
be anti-dogmatism, anti-supernatural, anti-that sort of stuff, but in reality the anti-skepticism

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:42.280
dominated. Which leaves us in a situation with the near impossibility of empiricism

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.360
in the sense of a way of thinking which tries to connect with facts in the world. So if you say,

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:55.800
well actually racism in certain contexts is less prevalent than these claims which have been made,

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:02.360
suggest someone will say, you think that because you're a racist. You're neglecting the systematic

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.320
structural hidden subterranean patterns, the occult patterns of racism, so to speak, which are

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:15.640
there. So and this by the way is trying to me as a feature of liberal thought in even in its attempt

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:22.360
to prescribe solutions, which is that if a liberal experiment doesn't work, say liberal experiments

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.560
in drug legalization or drug decriminalization, the solutions are not to say they've been falsified,

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:33.000
it's to say double up, triple up, quadruple up, do it three or four times and then it will work.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.560
So can we get, I mean I wouldn't say get back to empirical thinking because I guess science was never

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:45.320
that closely empirical, but closer to it than we've been in which someone will accept that

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.560
we aren't too dogmatic about XYZ. Maybe we don't know the answer, maybe we've actually got to go

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:56.360
out and check things to see what's happening. Well you know there's empirical thinking, there's

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:03.640
analytical thinking. I would like us just to get back to thinking. The hardest of all. Let's try to do that.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:12.760
I'm wondering if that might be the moment on which I can thank Peter for stimulating,

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:21.800
stirring and stimulating, fertilizing my thinking on all of these issues and whether we can all

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:38.200
thank him for coming here and enabling us to receive his thoughts and start thinking.
