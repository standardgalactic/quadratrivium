00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Welcome to this TOK short video on ComMO.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,680
ComMO is an integrative approach to

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
psychological mindfulness that guides

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,640
individuals to cultivate

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,200
a responsive reflective attitude toward

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,720
conflict and distressing emotions.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,520
ComMO represents a significant advance in

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,720
psychological mindfulness because it is

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,520
grounded in a comprehensive model of

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,160
human consciousness and relationships that

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,060
guides individuals in understanding

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,220
why mindfulness is hard, why it helps, and

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,500
the domains of consciousness to focus on.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,620
We can start with one of the basic elements

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,700
that results in psychological distress,

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,020
which involves negative reactions to

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,740
negative feelings.

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,820
Here we see somebody who feels lousy and

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,980
then hates feeling this way.

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,820
This sets up what is called a neurotic loop,

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,020
which is caused by negative reactions to

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,540
negative feelings.

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,020
This diagram depicts the central features

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,140
that drive neurotic loops.

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,820
Namely, it represents the fact that many

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,460
people try to avoid or control their

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,020
negative feelings.

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,020
They do this by adopting a stance of an

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,780
inner critic that is defensive or

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,100
judgmental or avoidant in the way they try

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,220
to cope with those feelings.

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,540
Unfortunately, this often leads to a

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,500
building up of negative feelings and a

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,900
trigger will then release strong emotions

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,740
and the person will feel flooded,

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,100
overwhelmed, and out of control and might

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,380
snap in a fit of rage or experience a

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,700
panic or overwhelming anxiety.

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,740
Of course, if this happens, it just

40
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,260
teaches the individual that negative

41
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,500
feelings are indeed bad and they will

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,980
often then double down in their efforts

43
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,660
to control them.

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,540
What is better is learning to approach

45
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,300
emotional functioning and how to be

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,700
aware and attuned to one's feelings on

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,780
the one hand and how to adaptively

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,260
regulate them on the other.

49
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,380
This is called the emotional sweet spot.

50
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,340
COMMO helps people learn how to process

51
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,260
emotions in the emotional sweet spot.

52
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,100
It starts with the MO, which is a

53
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,340
metacognitive observer.

54
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,660
This means adopting a deliberative,

55
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,620
reflective, responsive, versus reactive,

56
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,980
observing position of one's mind.

57
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,340
Take a minute and think about someone

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,780
you know who went through a stressful

59
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,500
event.

60
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,020
As you recreate the scene, allow

61
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
yourself to see in your mind's eye

62
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,340
what was going through their mind.

63
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
As you do, you're getting a feel for

64
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,900
this metacognitive observer stance,

65
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,140
which is to step outside the stream of

66
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,780
immediate experience and reflect on it.

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,540
Now imagine turning that lens of

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,300
observation and understanding on

69
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,420
yourself.

70
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,260
Imagine yourself seeing the feelings you

71
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,500
have, the rush of thoughts that follow

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,540
those feelings, and the situation you're

73
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,380
in and the history that led up to it,

74
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,020
and the other key people involved.

75
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,140
This is a participant observer stance

76
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,220
that is involved in the flow but can

77
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,660
also step outside and see one's thoughts,

78
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,140
feelings, and context from a distant,

79
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,300
and not become all the feelings that

80
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,780
are flowing through the stream.

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,300
Learning to take this metacognitive

82
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,740
stance takes practice.

83
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,420
It is not something people can do just

84
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,940
as soon as they hear about it.

85
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,100
But if guided, many can learn to do it

86
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,020
and become better and better at it.

87
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,700
The fact that it takes practice gives

88
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,020
rise to the second meaning of MO,

89
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,900
which is modus operandi, which refers to

90
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,460
one's mode of operating.

91
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Modes of operating take practice to

92
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,220
internalize so that it becomes easier

93
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,580
and easier to achieve.

94
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,580
It can then be first practice when one is

95
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,460
calm, then in mildly stressful situations,

96
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,300
and then built up from there so that

97
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,460
even when the distress is significant,

98
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,180
the metacognitive observer will naturally

99
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
come online.

100
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,300
Calm, of course, is the word, but it also

101
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
is an acronym.

102
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,100
The C stands for curiosity, which is

103
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
the desire to know more.

104
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,500
This means taking a stance of wonder

105
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
seeking and understanding.

106
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,940
It means adopting a questioning attitude.

107
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,660
The curious part of the MO asks,

108
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,820
what is going on?

109
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Where did this happen before?

110
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,020
How am I feeling?

111
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,580
When has this occurred?

112
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,860
Why might I be feeling the way I am?

113
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
And these questions are asked first

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,820
about one's feelings, then about one's

115
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,380
thoughts, what about the other?

116
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,660
About one's history, and ultimately

117
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,140
about other people involved.

118
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,740
All of this is in the service of

119
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,780
developing a rich and textured narrative

120
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,300
regarding what is happening and why.

121
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,140
This is in contrast to what many

122
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,700
individuals do when bumped by negative

123
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,260
feelings, which is to respond impulsively

124
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,500
and reacting negatively in their attempt

125
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,260
to control and escape from such feelings.

126
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,060
Accepting refers to the ability to be

127
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,380
with the pain and the awkwardness

128
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,700
without freaking out and without harsh

129
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,780
judgments or resistance.

130
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,780
It relates to the concept of emotional

131
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,540
distress tolerance.

132
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,820
It is hard, but with practice it can be done.

133
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,900
We can see this show up in the Buddhist

134
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
insights regarding suffering.

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,980
The first principle in Buddhism is life

136
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,300
is suffering, and the Buddha realized

137
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,020
that to run from suffering, to resist it

138
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,260
and pretend it is not there, to try to

139
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,900
jam it backstage or control it in other

140
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,740
ways does not lead to escape, but instead

141
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,340
leaves to more psychological difficulty.

142
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,980
The L stands for loving compassion

143
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,700
toward self and others.

144
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,780
This attitude recognizes the basic

145
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,860
wisdom that people have dignity and are

146
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
worthy of respect, and this is the

147
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,260
starting point for constructing a just

148
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,060
world.

149
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,900
It also means adopting the stance of

150
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
hoping that people will flourish and

151
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,460
have how high well-being and feeling

152
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,100
compassion or sympathy for those who are

153
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,860
genuinely experiencing genuine

154
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,060
difficulties.

155
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,540
This attitude is cultivated because most

156
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,700
people including oneself at their core

157
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,820
is generally doing the best they can.

158
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,540
The M stands for motivated toward valued

159
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,100
states of being in both the short and

160
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,220
long term.

161
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,540
The short term refers to the desired

162
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,700
outcome one wants given the actual

163
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,860
situation one is in.

164
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
A long term refers to the deliberative

165
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,540
ethical or moral principles that

166
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,260
individuals have about who they want to

167
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,900
be over the long term.

168
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,740
For example, kind, courageous, prudent.

169
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,820
This values-based element allows

170
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
individuals to separate their feelings

171
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,900
from the impulsive reactive instincts

172
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,780
and orient toward activities that will be

173
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,300
adapted.

174
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,620
In sum, Kamimo integrates many different

175
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,380
principles to provide a guide for the

176
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
kind of processes that are helpful

177
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,620
when one is bumped by the vagaries of

178
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,580
life.

179
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,980
If we can learn to respond to adversity

180
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,340
with a calm attitude,

181
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,580
both with ourselves and in relationships

182
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,540
to others,

183
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,180
we will be able to move much towards a

184
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,740
much healthier and more mature way of

185
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,740
being.
