0	11400	Welcome to the Theory of Knowledge Society, home to a new unified theory of knowledge.
11400	17640	Let's start by reflecting on the current global situation we find ourselves in.
17640	23280	Of course there is the pandemic and in the United States we are seeing massive amounts
23280	32600	of social upheaval, political polarization, chaotic information ecologies, and much fragmentation
32600	38120	and a general sense of confusion and chaos.
38120	47080	Globally we face a number of what Thomas Bjorkman called metacrisies in the 21st century,
47080	53800	such as the techno environmental crisis involving climate change, resource depletion, mass extinction
53800	60280	and weapons of mass destruction, the digital globalization crisis where the digital world
60280	63280	is changing everything.
63280	70440	There is, as John Vervake brilliantly articulates, a meaning crisis whereby we are deeply confused
70440	77400	and conflicted about what is real and good, and we are facing a mental health crisis of
77400	85480	dramatic proportions before the COVID pandemic, and now the wave of mental health crisis is
85480	91960	cresting especially found in our youth.
91960	97880	We need new ways to make sense of the world so that we can make better choices, realize
97880	104700	our potential, and be good ancestors to future generations.
104700	113000	This is what the theory of knowledge society is all about.
113000	118320	It's the home of the unified theory of knowledge, which of course is a bold statement, what
118320	121200	is this unified theory?
121200	126720	It's a new system of thought that stretches from quantum mechanics to general relativity
126720	135560	and ultimately functions in particular to solve the problem of psychology.
135560	138480	What is the problem of psychology?
138480	144280	This refers to the fact that we psychologists do not have effective consensual ways of scientifically
144280	147120	defining mind and behavior.
147120	152720	You likely haven't heard of the problem of psychology, but it is central to our knowledge
152720	153720	systems.
154720	161800	Although psychology has been around in terms of its official birth date in 1879, there
161800	169440	is no consensual understanding of what the term means, how we should refer and conceptualize
169440	175760	what mind is, what behavior is, what is the language system that we should use to organize
175760	185560	the empirical data that we have, and inform us about our condition as humans on this planet.
185560	190880	This is a remarkable fact that's little known, but the unified theory of knowledge emphasizes
190880	196400	why it is central by identifying what is called the Enlightenment Gap.
196400	202240	The Enlightenment refers to the set of philosophical and scientific knowledge systems that emerged
202240	205840	in the 16th and 17th centuries.
205840	213800	It gave rise to brilliant advances and developments, but it resulted in a tremendous problem, the
213800	221840	mind versus body problem or mind-matter problem, which was introduced most dramatically by
221840	224640	Ren√© Descartes and his dualism.
224640	229360	We have been struggling with Cartesian dualism ever since, and we have never been able to
229360	239160	effectively clarify in a unified field theory sort of way what exactly is mind or the mind,
239160	245800	what is behavior, and what is our scientific investigation and conceptualization of it.
245800	253040	It is this problem that the unified theory of knowledge addresses head on.
254040	260360	The unified theory starts with what is called the Tree of Knowledge System.
260360	266280	The Tree of Knowledge System is a new map of big history.
266280	274080	It depicts cosmic evolution from the Big Bang to the present, but does so in a novel way.
274080	280640	Specifically, as shown here, it depicts the evolution of behavioral complexity as emerging
280640	290120	across four different planes of existence, identified as matter, life, mind, and culture.
290120	295760	The reason there are different planes of existence is that following matter, novel information
295760	303560	processing and communication systems emerge, so we get genetic information processing and
303560	308960	the emergence of cells and their communication to give rise to the plane of life.
308960	315320	Then we get neuronal information processing and animal-to-animal communication, which
315320	322040	in the language of the Tree of Knowledge gives rise to mind as a novel plane of existence.
322040	327640	Then finally, we get symbolic information processing and person-to-person communication
327640	335120	to build systems of justification known as culture and the fourth dimension of complexity
335120	338080	depicted on the Tree of Knowledge.
338080	345000	This allows us to divide the universe up into four distinct dimensions.
345000	352040	It's a crucial insight that allows the Tree of Knowledge, the first system that can effectively
352040	360160	define the parameters to enable us to get clear about solving the problem of psychology.
360160	366280	A key feature of the Tree of Knowledge is that it defines the ontic reality as what's
366280	372720	real independent of beliefs in relationship to scientific ontology that is claims about
372720	377880	reality and scientific epistemology.
377880	384320	Indeed it offers us a new way to think about science as a system of justification that
384320	389600	evolves out of sociocultural processes.
389600	395360	It corresponds then the physical sciences to the first dimension of complexity matter,
395360	401200	the biological sciences are corresponding to the dimension of life, and then it corresponds
401200	408280	the basic psychological sciences to the dimension of mind, which differentiates then from human
408280	414280	psychology and then the rest of the social sciences, which correspond to the culture
414280	418200	person plane of existence.
418200	424960	The unified framework sets the stage for solving the problem of psychology as follows.
424960	429000	First we can see that physics maps the dimension of matter.
429000	436080	This is consensually agreed upon by physicists and gives us a bedrock of knowledge.
436080	441760	We can then see that biology maps clearly to the dimension of life.
441760	448400	Together physics and biology can be thought of in relationship to the STEM disciplines
448400	454880	whereby we have consensual knowledge about the material and living dimensions of complexity.
455800	462040	However, everything breaks down when we move beyond biology and psychology as a discipline
462040	468600	exists as a confused set of ideas on the one hand between biology and the social sciences
468600	474720	and on the other at one level can be identified as existing between skinner on the one hand
474720	480760	representing an extreme form of behaviorism and Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytic ideas
480760	487960	representing an extreme form of mentalism and the way of understanding exactly what
487960	493040	mind and behavior is has never been effectively resolved.
493040	499080	It is this that the unified theory addresses.
499080	506240	The way it addresses it is by taking skinner's ideas and connecting them with cognitive neuroscience
506240	510000	in the form of what is called behavioral investment theory.
510000	517480	That organizes the dimension of animal behavior or more appropriately called mental behavior
517480	522320	as understanding that the nervous system is computing behavioral investments based on
522320	525360	environmental contingencies.
525360	530720	Then we get to human consciousness language and the evolution of culture.
530720	536480	The justification hypothesis give rise to justification systems theory which assimilates
536480	542080	and integrates Freud's key insights about how humans rationalize their behavior and
542080	545640	repress unwanted drives and desires.
545640	551280	And it is this dynamic arrangement of human consciousness that gives rise to collective
551280	557400	processes of justification and it is these collective processes of justification that
557400	563320	set the stage for and give rise to the culture person plane of existence.
563320	569480	This gives rise to a complete alignment of matter, life, mind and culture studied by
569480	575960	the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.
575960	581320	It also demonstrates why psychology has been so confused over the years.
581320	586960	Psychology must be effectively differentiated between basic psychology that is the science
586960	593200	of animal mental behavior and human psychology which is the science of human individuals
593200	598760	on the culture person plane of existence.
598760	604960	The theory of knowledge can be represented in the form of the theory of knowledge tree
604960	609440	which has as its first branch the tree of knowledge system.
609440	615040	But to make it a unified theory of knowledge it must be much, much more than this macro
615040	621080	level framework and indeed the unified theory of knowledge is exactly that.
621080	626860	It consists of the justification hypothesis with its updated tripartite model of human
626860	629200	consciousness.
629200	635160	Behavioral investment theory and the architecture of human cognition which describes the functional
635160	640320	organization of the nervous system and how it processes information to guide behavioral
640320	645360	investments across various levels of cognitive processing.
645360	650640	It includes the influence matrix, a map of the human relationship system and the underlying
650640	656280	needs and drives that humans have for what is called high relational value, the desire
656280	661800	to be known and valued by important others to contribute to the group and be loved for
661800	668400	one's contribution as opposed to low relational value, the state of disconnected dejectedness
668640	674080	and being alone, isolated or abused.
674080	679680	These four ideas, the tree of knowledge system, justification systems theory, behavioral investment
679680	687200	theory and the influence matrix provide the unified theory of psychology.
687200	692240	It then bridges over to the unified approach starting with character adaptation systems
692240	699080	theory which bridges modern human personality theory into the different individual level
699080	702000	paradigms of psychotherapy.
702000	707480	Character adaptation systems theory grounds the character wheel of development and together
707480	714960	they form frameworks for understanding character adaptive development which is crucial to understanding
714960	718200	human psychological health and fulfillment.
718200	724520	The nested model of well-being defines what human psychology well-being is in terms of
724520	729840	how it can be conceptualized as happiness with the worthiness to be happy involving
729840	735560	subject of well-being, health and functioning, consideration of the environmental context
735560	739600	and the ideology and values of the evaluator.
739600	744960	And finally the unified approach consists of an integrated approach to psychological
744960	751400	mindfulness called calm MO that cult where individuals learn how to cultivate a metacognitive
751400	757600	observer that is curious, accepting, loving, compassionate and motivated to learn and grow
757600	761200	toward valued states of being.
761200	766720	We welcome you to the theory of knowledge society and invite you to join us on the journey
766720	770360	toward knowledge and wisdom in the 21st century.
770360	775280	What could be a more noble, engaging and exciting journey than that?
