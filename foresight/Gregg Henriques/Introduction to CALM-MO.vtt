00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
Welcome to this TOK short video on ComMO.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.680
ComMO is an integrative approach to

00:07.680 --> 00:09.840
psychological mindfulness that guides

00:09.840 --> 00:11.640
individuals to cultivate

00:11.640 --> 00:14.200
a responsive reflective attitude toward

00:14.200 --> 00:16.720
conflict and distressing emotions.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.520
ComMO represents a significant advance in

00:19.520 --> 00:21.720
psychological mindfulness because it is

00:21.720 --> 00:23.520
grounded in a comprehensive model of

00:23.520 --> 00:26.160
human consciousness and relationships that

00:26.160 --> 00:28.060
guides individuals in understanding

00:28.060 --> 00:31.220
why mindfulness is hard, why it helps, and

00:31.220 --> 00:34.500
the domains of consciousness to focus on.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.620
We can start with one of the basic elements

00:36.620 --> 00:40.700
that results in psychological distress,

00:40.700 --> 00:43.020
which involves negative reactions to

00:43.020 --> 00:44.740
negative feelings.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.820
Here we see somebody who feels lousy and

00:47.820 --> 00:50.980
then hates feeling this way.

00:50.980 --> 00:54.820
This sets up what is called a neurotic loop,

00:54.820 --> 00:57.020
which is caused by negative reactions to

00:57.020 --> 00:59.540
negative feelings.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.020
This diagram depicts the central features

01:02.020 --> 01:04.140
that drive neurotic loops.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.820
Namely, it represents the fact that many

01:05.820 --> 01:08.460
people try to avoid or control their

01:08.460 --> 01:10.020
negative feelings.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.020
They do this by adopting a stance of an

01:12.020 --> 01:14.780
inner critic that is defensive or

01:14.780 --> 01:17.100
judgmental or avoidant in the way they try

01:17.100 --> 01:19.220
to cope with those feelings.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.540
Unfortunately, this often leads to a

01:21.540 --> 01:24.500
building up of negative feelings and a

01:24.500 --> 01:26.900
trigger will then release strong emotions

01:26.900 --> 01:28.740
and the person will feel flooded,

01:28.740 --> 01:31.100
overwhelmed, and out of control and might

01:31.100 --> 01:33.380
snap in a fit of rage or experience a

01:33.380 --> 01:36.700
panic or overwhelming anxiety.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.740
Of course, if this happens, it just

01:38.740 --> 01:40.260
teaches the individual that negative

01:40.260 --> 01:42.500
feelings are indeed bad and they will

01:42.500 --> 01:44.980
often then double down in their efforts

01:44.980 --> 01:47.660
to control them.

01:47.660 --> 01:49.540
What is better is learning to approach

01:49.540 --> 01:53.300
emotional functioning and how to be

01:53.300 --> 01:55.700
aware and attuned to one's feelings on

01:55.700 --> 01:57.780
the one hand and how to adaptively

01:57.780 --> 02:00.260
regulate them on the other.

02:00.260 --> 02:03.380
This is called the emotional sweet spot.

02:03.380 --> 02:06.340
COMMO helps people learn how to process

02:06.340 --> 02:10.260
emotions in the emotional sweet spot.

02:10.260 --> 02:14.100
It starts with the MO, which is a

02:14.100 --> 02:16.340
metacognitive observer.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.660
This means adopting a deliberative,

02:18.740 --> 02:21.620
reflective, responsive, versus reactive,

02:21.620 --> 02:24.980
observing position of one's mind.

02:24.980 --> 02:26.340
Take a minute and think about someone

02:26.340 --> 02:27.780
you know who went through a stressful

02:27.780 --> 02:28.500
event.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.020
As you recreate the scene, allow

02:30.020 --> 02:32.020
yourself to see in your mind's eye

02:32.020 --> 02:34.340
what was going through their mind.

02:34.340 --> 02:35.940
As you do, you're getting a feel for

02:35.940 --> 02:38.900
this metacognitive observer stance,

02:38.900 --> 02:41.140
which is to step outside the stream of

02:41.140 --> 02:43.780
immediate experience and reflect on it.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.540
Now imagine turning that lens of

02:45.540 --> 02:47.300
observation and understanding on

02:47.300 --> 02:48.420
yourself.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.260
Imagine yourself seeing the feelings you

02:50.260 --> 02:52.500
have, the rush of thoughts that follow

02:52.500 --> 02:55.540
those feelings, and the situation you're

02:55.540 --> 02:57.380
in and the history that led up to it,

02:57.380 --> 03:00.020
and the other key people involved.

03:00.020 --> 03:03.140
This is a participant observer stance

03:03.140 --> 03:05.220
that is involved in the flow but can

03:05.220 --> 03:08.660
also step outside and see one's thoughts,

03:08.660 --> 03:11.140
feelings, and context from a distant,

03:11.140 --> 03:13.300
and not become all the feelings that

03:13.300 --> 03:15.780
are flowing through the stream.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.300
Learning to take this metacognitive

03:17.300 --> 03:18.740
stance takes practice.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.420
It is not something people can do just

03:20.420 --> 03:21.940
as soon as they hear about it.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.100
But if guided, many can learn to do it

03:24.100 --> 03:26.020
and become better and better at it.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.700
The fact that it takes practice gives

03:27.700 --> 03:30.020
rise to the second meaning of MO,

03:30.020 --> 03:32.900
which is modus operandi, which refers to

03:32.900 --> 03:35.460
one's mode of operating.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.300
Modes of operating take practice to

03:37.300 --> 03:39.220
internalize so that it becomes easier

03:39.220 --> 03:40.580
and easier to achieve.

03:41.060 --> 03:44.580
It can then be first practice when one is

03:44.580 --> 03:47.460
calm, then in mildly stressful situations,

03:47.460 --> 03:49.300
and then built up from there so that

03:49.300 --> 03:51.460
even when the distress is significant,

03:51.460 --> 03:54.180
the metacognitive observer will naturally

03:54.180 --> 03:56.180
come online.

03:56.180 --> 03:59.300
Calm, of course, is the word, but it also

03:59.300 --> 04:01.300
is an acronym.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.100
The C stands for curiosity, which is

04:04.100 --> 04:06.100
the desire to know more.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.500
This means taking a stance of wonder

04:08.820 --> 04:10.820
seeking and understanding.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.940
It means adopting a questioning attitude.

04:13.940 --> 04:16.660
The curious part of the MO asks,

04:16.660 --> 04:18.820
what is going on?

04:18.820 --> 04:20.820
Where did this happen before?

04:20.820 --> 04:24.020
How am I feeling?

04:24.020 --> 04:26.580
When has this occurred?

04:26.580 --> 04:29.860
Why might I be feeling the way I am?

04:29.860 --> 04:31.860
And these questions are asked first

04:31.860 --> 04:34.820
about one's feelings, then about one's

04:34.820 --> 04:37.380
thoughts, what about the other?

04:38.260 --> 04:40.660
About one's history, and ultimately

04:40.660 --> 04:43.140
about other people involved.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.740
All of this is in the service of

04:44.740 --> 04:47.780
developing a rich and textured narrative

04:47.780 --> 04:51.300
regarding what is happening and why.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.140
This is in contrast to what many

04:53.140 --> 04:55.700
individuals do when bumped by negative

04:55.700 --> 04:58.260
feelings, which is to respond impulsively

04:58.260 --> 05:00.500
and reacting negatively in their attempt

05:00.500 --> 05:04.260
to control and escape from such feelings.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.060
Accepting refers to the ability to be

05:07.060 --> 05:09.380
with the pain and the awkwardness

05:09.380 --> 05:11.700
without freaking out and without harsh

05:11.700 --> 05:13.780
judgments or resistance.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.780
It relates to the concept of emotional

05:15.780 --> 05:17.540
distress tolerance.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.820
It is hard, but with practice it can be done.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.900
We can see this show up in the Buddhist

05:22.900 --> 05:24.900
insights regarding suffering.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.980
The first principle in Buddhism is life

05:26.980 --> 05:29.300
is suffering, and the Buddha realized

05:29.300 --> 05:32.020
that to run from suffering, to resist it

05:32.020 --> 05:34.260
and pretend it is not there, to try to

05:34.260 --> 05:36.900
jam it backstage or control it in other

05:36.900 --> 05:40.740
ways does not lead to escape, but instead

05:40.740 --> 05:44.340
leaves to more psychological difficulty.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.980
The L stands for loving compassion

05:46.980 --> 05:49.700
toward self and others.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.780
This attitude recognizes the basic

05:51.780 --> 05:53.860
wisdom that people have dignity and are

05:53.860 --> 05:55.860
worthy of respect, and this is the

05:55.860 --> 05:58.260
starting point for constructing a just

05:58.260 --> 05:59.060
world.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.900
It also means adopting the stance of

06:00.900 --> 06:02.900
hoping that people will flourish and

06:02.900 --> 06:05.460
have how high well-being and feeling

06:05.460 --> 06:08.100
compassion or sympathy for those who are

06:08.100 --> 06:09.860
genuinely experiencing genuine

06:09.860 --> 06:11.060
difficulties.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.540
This attitude is cultivated because most

06:13.540 --> 06:15.700
people including oneself at their core

06:15.700 --> 06:18.820
is generally doing the best they can.

06:18.820 --> 06:21.540
The M stands for motivated toward valued

06:21.540 --> 06:24.100
states of being in both the short and

06:24.100 --> 06:25.220
long term.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.540
The short term refers to the desired

06:27.540 --> 06:29.700
outcome one wants given the actual

06:29.700 --> 06:31.860
situation one is in.

06:31.860 --> 06:33.860
A long term refers to the deliberative

06:33.860 --> 06:35.540
ethical or moral principles that

06:35.540 --> 06:38.260
individuals have about who they want to

06:38.260 --> 06:40.900
be over the long term.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.740
For example, kind, courageous, prudent.

06:44.740 --> 06:46.820
This values-based element allows

06:46.820 --> 06:48.820
individuals to separate their feelings

06:48.820 --> 06:50.900
from the impulsive reactive instincts

06:50.900 --> 06:53.780
and orient toward activities that will be

06:53.780 --> 06:55.300
adapted.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.620
In sum, Kamimo integrates many different

06:57.620 --> 06:59.380
principles to provide a guide for the

06:59.380 --> 07:01.380
kind of processes that are helpful

07:01.380 --> 07:03.620
when one is bumped by the vagaries of

07:03.620 --> 07:04.580
life.

07:04.580 --> 07:06.980
If we can learn to respond to adversity

07:06.980 --> 07:08.340
with a calm attitude,

07:08.340 --> 07:10.580
both with ourselves and in relationships

07:10.580 --> 07:11.540
to others,

07:11.540 --> 07:14.180
we will be able to move much towards a

07:14.180 --> 07:16.740
much healthier and more mature way of

07:16.740 --> 07:18.740
being.
