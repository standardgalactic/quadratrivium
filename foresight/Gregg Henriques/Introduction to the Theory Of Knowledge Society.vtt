00:00.000 --> 00:11.400
Welcome to the Theory of Knowledge Society, home to a new unified theory of knowledge.

00:11.400 --> 00:17.640
Let's start by reflecting on the current global situation we find ourselves in.

00:17.640 --> 00:23.280
Of course there is the pandemic and in the United States we are seeing massive amounts

00:23.280 --> 00:32.600
of social upheaval, political polarization, chaotic information ecologies, and much fragmentation

00:32.600 --> 00:38.120
and a general sense of confusion and chaos.

00:38.120 --> 00:47.080
Globally we face a number of what Thomas Bjorkman called metacrisies in the 21st century,

00:47.080 --> 00:53.800
such as the techno environmental crisis involving climate change, resource depletion, mass extinction

00:53.800 --> 01:00.280
and weapons of mass destruction, the digital globalization crisis where the digital world

01:00.280 --> 01:03.280
is changing everything.

01:03.280 --> 01:10.440
There is, as John Vervake brilliantly articulates, a meaning crisis whereby we are deeply confused

01:10.440 --> 01:17.400
and conflicted about what is real and good, and we are facing a mental health crisis of

01:17.400 --> 01:25.480
dramatic proportions before the COVID pandemic, and now the wave of mental health crisis is

01:25.480 --> 01:31.960
cresting especially found in our youth.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.880
We need new ways to make sense of the world so that we can make better choices, realize

01:37.880 --> 01:44.700
our potential, and be good ancestors to future generations.

01:44.700 --> 01:53.000
This is what the theory of knowledge society is all about.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.320
It's the home of the unified theory of knowledge, which of course is a bold statement, what

01:58.320 --> 02:01.200
is this unified theory?

02:01.200 --> 02:06.720
It's a new system of thought that stretches from quantum mechanics to general relativity

02:06.720 --> 02:15.560
and ultimately functions in particular to solve the problem of psychology.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.480
What is the problem of psychology?

02:18.480 --> 02:24.280
This refers to the fact that we psychologists do not have effective consensual ways of scientifically

02:24.280 --> 02:27.120
defining mind and behavior.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.720
You likely haven't heard of the problem of psychology, but it is central to our knowledge

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
systems.

02:34.720 --> 02:41.800
Although psychology has been around in terms of its official birth date in 1879, there

02:41.800 --> 02:49.440
is no consensual understanding of what the term means, how we should refer and conceptualize

02:49.440 --> 02:55.760
what mind is, what behavior is, what is the language system that we should use to organize

02:55.760 --> 03:05.560
the empirical data that we have, and inform us about our condition as humans on this planet.

03:05.560 --> 03:10.880
This is a remarkable fact that's little known, but the unified theory of knowledge emphasizes

03:10.880 --> 03:16.400
why it is central by identifying what is called the Enlightenment Gap.

03:16.400 --> 03:22.240
The Enlightenment refers to the set of philosophical and scientific knowledge systems that emerged

03:22.240 --> 03:25.840
in the 16th and 17th centuries.

03:25.840 --> 03:33.800
It gave rise to brilliant advances and developments, but it resulted in a tremendous problem, the

03:33.800 --> 03:41.840
mind versus body problem or mind-matter problem, which was introduced most dramatically by

03:41.840 --> 03:44.640
RenÃ© Descartes and his dualism.

03:44.640 --> 03:49.360
We have been struggling with Cartesian dualism ever since, and we have never been able to

03:49.360 --> 03:59.160
effectively clarify in a unified field theory sort of way what exactly is mind or the mind,

03:59.160 --> 04:05.800
what is behavior, and what is our scientific investigation and conceptualization of it.

04:05.800 --> 04:13.040
It is this problem that the unified theory of knowledge addresses head on.

04:14.040 --> 04:20.360
The unified theory starts with what is called the Tree of Knowledge System.

04:20.360 --> 04:26.280
The Tree of Knowledge System is a new map of big history.

04:26.280 --> 04:34.080
It depicts cosmic evolution from the Big Bang to the present, but does so in a novel way.

04:34.080 --> 04:40.640
Specifically, as shown here, it depicts the evolution of behavioral complexity as emerging

04:40.640 --> 04:50.120
across four different planes of existence, identified as matter, life, mind, and culture.

04:50.120 --> 04:55.760
The reason there are different planes of existence is that following matter, novel information

04:55.760 --> 05:03.560
processing and communication systems emerge, so we get genetic information processing and

05:03.560 --> 05:08.960
the emergence of cells and their communication to give rise to the plane of life.

05:08.960 --> 05:15.320
Then we get neuronal information processing and animal-to-animal communication, which

05:15.320 --> 05:22.040
in the language of the Tree of Knowledge gives rise to mind as a novel plane of existence.

05:22.040 --> 05:27.640
Then finally, we get symbolic information processing and person-to-person communication

05:27.640 --> 05:35.120
to build systems of justification known as culture and the fourth dimension of complexity

05:35.120 --> 05:38.080
depicted on the Tree of Knowledge.

05:38.080 --> 05:45.000
This allows us to divide the universe up into four distinct dimensions.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.040
It's a crucial insight that allows the Tree of Knowledge, the first system that can effectively

05:52.040 --> 06:00.160
define the parameters to enable us to get clear about solving the problem of psychology.

06:00.160 --> 06:06.280
A key feature of the Tree of Knowledge is that it defines the ontic reality as what's

06:06.280 --> 06:12.720
real independent of beliefs in relationship to scientific ontology that is claims about

06:12.720 --> 06:17.880
reality and scientific epistemology.

06:17.880 --> 06:24.320
Indeed it offers us a new way to think about science as a system of justification that

06:24.320 --> 06:29.600
evolves out of sociocultural processes.

06:29.600 --> 06:35.360
It corresponds then the physical sciences to the first dimension of complexity matter,

06:35.360 --> 06:41.200
the biological sciences are corresponding to the dimension of life, and then it corresponds

06:41.200 --> 06:48.280
the basic psychological sciences to the dimension of mind, which differentiates then from human

06:48.280 --> 06:54.280
psychology and then the rest of the social sciences, which correspond to the culture

06:54.280 --> 06:58.200
person plane of existence.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.960
The unified framework sets the stage for solving the problem of psychology as follows.

07:04.960 --> 07:09.000
First we can see that physics maps the dimension of matter.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.080
This is consensually agreed upon by physicists and gives us a bedrock of knowledge.

07:16.080 --> 07:21.760
We can then see that biology maps clearly to the dimension of life.

07:21.760 --> 07:28.400
Together physics and biology can be thought of in relationship to the STEM disciplines

07:28.400 --> 07:34.880
whereby we have consensual knowledge about the material and living dimensions of complexity.

07:35.800 --> 07:42.040
However, everything breaks down when we move beyond biology and psychology as a discipline

07:42.040 --> 07:48.600
exists as a confused set of ideas on the one hand between biology and the social sciences

07:48.600 --> 07:54.720
and on the other at one level can be identified as existing between skinner on the one hand

07:54.720 --> 08:00.760
representing an extreme form of behaviorism and Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytic ideas

08:00.760 --> 08:07.960
representing an extreme form of mentalism and the way of understanding exactly what

08:07.960 --> 08:13.040
mind and behavior is has never been effectively resolved.

08:13.040 --> 08:19.080
It is this that the unified theory addresses.

08:19.080 --> 08:26.240
The way it addresses it is by taking skinner's ideas and connecting them with cognitive neuroscience

08:26.240 --> 08:30.000
in the form of what is called behavioral investment theory.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.480
That organizes the dimension of animal behavior or more appropriately called mental behavior

08:37.480 --> 08:42.320
as understanding that the nervous system is computing behavioral investments based on

08:42.320 --> 08:45.360
environmental contingencies.

08:45.360 --> 08:50.720
Then we get to human consciousness language and the evolution of culture.

08:50.720 --> 08:56.480
The justification hypothesis give rise to justification systems theory which assimilates

08:56.480 --> 09:02.080
and integrates Freud's key insights about how humans rationalize their behavior and

09:02.080 --> 09:05.640
repress unwanted drives and desires.

09:05.640 --> 09:11.280
And it is this dynamic arrangement of human consciousness that gives rise to collective

09:11.280 --> 09:17.400
processes of justification and it is these collective processes of justification that

09:17.400 --> 09:23.320
set the stage for and give rise to the culture person plane of existence.

09:23.320 --> 09:29.480
This gives rise to a complete alignment of matter, life, mind and culture studied by

09:29.480 --> 09:35.960
the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

09:35.960 --> 09:41.320
It also demonstrates why psychology has been so confused over the years.

09:41.320 --> 09:46.960
Psychology must be effectively differentiated between basic psychology that is the science

09:46.960 --> 09:53.200
of animal mental behavior and human psychology which is the science of human individuals

09:53.200 --> 09:58.760
on the culture person plane of existence.

09:58.760 --> 10:04.960
The theory of knowledge can be represented in the form of the theory of knowledge tree

10:04.960 --> 10:09.440
which has as its first branch the tree of knowledge system.

10:09.440 --> 10:15.040
But to make it a unified theory of knowledge it must be much, much more than this macro

10:15.040 --> 10:21.080
level framework and indeed the unified theory of knowledge is exactly that.

10:21.080 --> 10:26.860
It consists of the justification hypothesis with its updated tripartite model of human

10:26.860 --> 10:29.200
consciousness.

10:29.200 --> 10:35.160
Behavioral investment theory and the architecture of human cognition which describes the functional

10:35.160 --> 10:40.320
organization of the nervous system and how it processes information to guide behavioral

10:40.320 --> 10:45.360
investments across various levels of cognitive processing.

10:45.360 --> 10:50.640
It includes the influence matrix, a map of the human relationship system and the underlying

10:50.640 --> 10:56.280
needs and drives that humans have for what is called high relational value, the desire

10:56.280 --> 11:01.800
to be known and valued by important others to contribute to the group and be loved for

11:01.800 --> 11:08.400
one's contribution as opposed to low relational value, the state of disconnected dejectedness

11:08.640 --> 11:14.080
and being alone, isolated or abused.

11:14.080 --> 11:19.680
These four ideas, the tree of knowledge system, justification systems theory, behavioral investment

11:19.680 --> 11:27.200
theory and the influence matrix provide the unified theory of psychology.

11:27.200 --> 11:32.240
It then bridges over to the unified approach starting with character adaptation systems

11:32.240 --> 11:39.080
theory which bridges modern human personality theory into the different individual level

11:39.080 --> 11:42.000
paradigms of psychotherapy.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.480
Character adaptation systems theory grounds the character wheel of development and together

11:47.480 --> 11:54.960
they form frameworks for understanding character adaptive development which is crucial to understanding

11:54.960 --> 11:58.200
human psychological health and fulfillment.

11:58.200 --> 12:04.520
The nested model of well-being defines what human psychology well-being is in terms of

12:04.520 --> 12:09.840
how it can be conceptualized as happiness with the worthiness to be happy involving

12:09.840 --> 12:15.560
subject of well-being, health and functioning, consideration of the environmental context

12:15.560 --> 12:19.600
and the ideology and values of the evaluator.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.960
And finally the unified approach consists of an integrated approach to psychological

12:24.960 --> 12:31.400
mindfulness called calm MO that cult where individuals learn how to cultivate a metacognitive

12:31.400 --> 12:37.600
observer that is curious, accepting, loving, compassionate and motivated to learn and grow

12:37.600 --> 12:41.200
toward valued states of being.

12:41.200 --> 12:46.720
We welcome you to the theory of knowledge society and invite you to join us on the journey

12:46.720 --> 12:50.360
toward knowledge and wisdom in the 21st century.

12:50.360 --> 12:55.280
What could be a more noble, engaging and exciting journey than that?
