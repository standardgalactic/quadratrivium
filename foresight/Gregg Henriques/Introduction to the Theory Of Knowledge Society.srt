00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Welcome to the Theory of Knowledge Society, home to a new unified theory of knowledge.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,640
Let's start by reflecting on the current global situation we find ourselves in.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,280
Of course there is the pandemic and in the United States we are seeing massive amounts

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:32,600
of social upheaval, political polarization, chaotic information ecologies, and much fragmentation

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,120
and a general sense of confusion and chaos.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:47,080
Globally we face a number of what Thomas Bjorkman called metacrisies in the 21st century,

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,800
such as the techno environmental crisis involving climate change, resource depletion, mass extinction

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,280
and weapons of mass destruction, the digital globalization crisis where the digital world

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
is changing everything.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,440
There is, as John Vervake brilliantly articulates, a meaning crisis whereby we are deeply confused

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,400
and conflicted about what is real and good, and we are facing a mental health crisis of

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,480
dramatic proportions before the COVID pandemic, and now the wave of mental health crisis is

13
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,960
cresting especially found in our youth.

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,880
We need new ways to make sense of the world so that we can make better choices, realize

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,700
our potential, and be good ancestors to future generations.

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:53,000
This is what the theory of knowledge society is all about.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,320
It's the home of the unified theory of knowledge, which of course is a bold statement, what

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
is this unified theory?

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,720
It's a new system of thought that stretches from quantum mechanics to general relativity

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,560
and ultimately functions in particular to solve the problem of psychology.

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,480
What is the problem of psychology?

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,280
This refers to the fact that we psychologists do not have effective consensual ways of scientifically

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,120
defining mind and behavior.

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,720
You likely haven't heard of the problem of psychology, but it is central to our knowledge

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
systems.

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,800
Although psychology has been around in terms of its official birth date in 1879, there

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,440
is no consensual understanding of what the term means, how we should refer and conceptualize

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,760
what mind is, what behavior is, what is the language system that we should use to organize

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:05,560
the empirical data that we have, and inform us about our condition as humans on this planet.

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,880
This is a remarkable fact that's little known, but the unified theory of knowledge emphasizes

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,400
why it is central by identifying what is called the Enlightenment Gap.

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,240
The Enlightenment refers to the set of philosophical and scientific knowledge systems that emerged

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,840
in the 16th and 17th centuries.

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,800
It gave rise to brilliant advances and developments, but it resulted in a tremendous problem, the

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,840
mind versus body problem or mind-matter problem, which was introduced most dramatically by

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
RenÃ© Descartes and his dualism.

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,360
We have been struggling with Cartesian dualism ever since, and we have never been able to

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:59,160
effectively clarify in a unified field theory sort of way what exactly is mind or the mind,

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,800
what is behavior, and what is our scientific investigation and conceptualization of it.

40
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:13,040
It is this problem that the unified theory of knowledge addresses head on.

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,360
The unified theory starts with what is called the Tree of Knowledge System.

42
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,280
The Tree of Knowledge System is a new map of big history.

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,080
It depicts cosmic evolution from the Big Bang to the present, but does so in a novel way.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,640
Specifically, as shown here, it depicts the evolution of behavioral complexity as emerging

45
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:50,120
across four different planes of existence, identified as matter, life, mind, and culture.

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,760
The reason there are different planes of existence is that following matter, novel information

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:03,560
processing and communication systems emerge, so we get genetic information processing and

48
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,960
the emergence of cells and their communication to give rise to the plane of life.

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,320
Then we get neuronal information processing and animal-to-animal communication, which

50
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,040
in the language of the Tree of Knowledge gives rise to mind as a novel plane of existence.

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,640
Then finally, we get symbolic information processing and person-to-person communication

52
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,120
to build systems of justification known as culture and the fourth dimension of complexity

53
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
depicted on the Tree of Knowledge.

54
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,000
This allows us to divide the universe up into four distinct dimensions.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,040
It's a crucial insight that allows the Tree of Knowledge, the first system that can effectively

56
00:05:52,040 --> 00:06:00,160
define the parameters to enable us to get clear about solving the problem of psychology.

57
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,280
A key feature of the Tree of Knowledge is that it defines the ontic reality as what's

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,720
real independent of beliefs in relationship to scientific ontology that is claims about

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,880
reality and scientific epistemology.

60
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,320
Indeed it offers us a new way to think about science as a system of justification that

61
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,600
evolves out of sociocultural processes.

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,360
It corresponds then the physical sciences to the first dimension of complexity matter,

63
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,200
the biological sciences are corresponding to the dimension of life, and then it corresponds

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:48,280
the basic psychological sciences to the dimension of mind, which differentiates then from human

65
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,280
psychology and then the rest of the social sciences, which correspond to the culture

66
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,200
person plane of existence.

67
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,960
The unified framework sets the stage for solving the problem of psychology as follows.

68
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,000
First we can see that physics maps the dimension of matter.

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,080
This is consensually agreed upon by physicists and gives us a bedrock of knowledge.

70
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,760
We can then see that biology maps clearly to the dimension of life.

71
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,400
Together physics and biology can be thought of in relationship to the STEM disciplines

72
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,880
whereby we have consensual knowledge about the material and living dimensions of complexity.

73
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,040
However, everything breaks down when we move beyond biology and psychology as a discipline

74
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,600
exists as a confused set of ideas on the one hand between biology and the social sciences

75
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,720
and on the other at one level can be identified as existing between skinner on the one hand

76
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,760
representing an extreme form of behaviorism and Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytic ideas

77
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,960
representing an extreme form of mentalism and the way of understanding exactly what

78
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,040
mind and behavior is has never been effectively resolved.

79
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,080
It is this that the unified theory addresses.

80
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:26,240
The way it addresses it is by taking skinner's ideas and connecting them with cognitive neuroscience

81
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
in the form of what is called behavioral investment theory.

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,480
That organizes the dimension of animal behavior or more appropriately called mental behavior

83
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,320
as understanding that the nervous system is computing behavioral investments based on

84
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
environmental contingencies.

85
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,720
Then we get to human consciousness language and the evolution of culture.

86
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,480
The justification hypothesis give rise to justification systems theory which assimilates

87
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,080
and integrates Freud's key insights about how humans rationalize their behavior and

88
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,640
repress unwanted drives and desires.

89
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,280
And it is this dynamic arrangement of human consciousness that gives rise to collective

90
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,400
processes of justification and it is these collective processes of justification that

91
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,320
set the stage for and give rise to the culture person plane of existence.

92
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,480
This gives rise to a complete alignment of matter, life, mind and culture studied by

93
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,960
the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

94
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,320
It also demonstrates why psychology has been so confused over the years.

95
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,960
Psychology must be effectively differentiated between basic psychology that is the science

96
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,200
of animal mental behavior and human psychology which is the science of human individuals

97
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,760
on the culture person plane of existence.

98
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,960
The theory of knowledge can be represented in the form of the theory of knowledge tree

99
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,440
which has as its first branch the tree of knowledge system.

100
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,040
But to make it a unified theory of knowledge it must be much, much more than this macro

101
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,080
level framework and indeed the unified theory of knowledge is exactly that.

102
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,860
It consists of the justification hypothesis with its updated tripartite model of human

103
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,200
consciousness.

104
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,160
Behavioral investment theory and the architecture of human cognition which describes the functional

105
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,320
organization of the nervous system and how it processes information to guide behavioral

106
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
investments across various levels of cognitive processing.

107
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,640
It includes the influence matrix, a map of the human relationship system and the underlying

108
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,280
needs and drives that humans have for what is called high relational value, the desire

109
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,800
to be known and valued by important others to contribute to the group and be loved for

110
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,400
one's contribution as opposed to low relational value, the state of disconnected dejectedness

111
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,080
and being alone, isolated or abused.

112
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,680
These four ideas, the tree of knowledge system, justification systems theory, behavioral investment

113
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:27,200
theory and the influence matrix provide the unified theory of psychology.

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
It then bridges over to the unified approach starting with character adaptation systems

115
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,080
theory which bridges modern human personality theory into the different individual level

116
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,000
paradigms of psychotherapy.

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,480
Character adaptation systems theory grounds the character wheel of development and together

118
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,960
they form frameworks for understanding character adaptive development which is crucial to understanding

119
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,200
human psychological health and fulfillment.

120
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,520
The nested model of well-being defines what human psychology well-being is in terms of

121
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,840
how it can be conceptualized as happiness with the worthiness to be happy involving

122
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,560
subject of well-being, health and functioning, consideration of the environmental context

123
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,600
and the ideology and values of the evaluator.

124
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,960
And finally the unified approach consists of an integrated approach to psychological

125
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,400
mindfulness called calm MO that cult where individuals learn how to cultivate a metacognitive

126
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,600
observer that is curious, accepting, loving, compassionate and motivated to learn and grow

127
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
toward valued states of being.

128
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,720
We welcome you to the theory of knowledge society and invite you to join us on the journey

129
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,360
toward knowledge and wisdom in the 21st century.

130
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,280
What could be a more noble, engaging and exciting journey than that?
