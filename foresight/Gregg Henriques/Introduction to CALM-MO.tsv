0	5100	Welcome to this TOK short video on ComMO.
5100	7680	ComMO is an integrative approach to
7680	9840	psychological mindfulness that guides
9840	11640	individuals to cultivate
11640	14200	a responsive reflective attitude toward
14200	16720	conflict and distressing emotions.
16720	19520	ComMO represents a significant advance in
19520	21720	psychological mindfulness because it is
21720	23520	grounded in a comprehensive model of
23520	26160	human consciousness and relationships that
26160	28060	guides individuals in understanding
28060	31220	why mindfulness is hard, why it helps, and
31220	34500	the domains of consciousness to focus on.
34500	36620	We can start with one of the basic elements
36620	40700	that results in psychological distress,
40700	43020	which involves negative reactions to
43020	44740	negative feelings.
44740	47820	Here we see somebody who feels lousy and
47820	50980	then hates feeling this way.
50980	54820	This sets up what is called a neurotic loop,
54820	57020	which is caused by negative reactions to
57020	59540	negative feelings.
59540	62020	This diagram depicts the central features
62020	64140	that drive neurotic loops.
64140	65820	Namely, it represents the fact that many
65820	68460	people try to avoid or control their
68460	70020	negative feelings.
70020	72020	They do this by adopting a stance of an
72020	74780	inner critic that is defensive or
74780	77100	judgmental or avoidant in the way they try
77100	79220	to cope with those feelings.
79220	81540	Unfortunately, this often leads to a
81540	84500	building up of negative feelings and a
84500	86900	trigger will then release strong emotions
86900	88740	and the person will feel flooded,
88740	91100	overwhelmed, and out of control and might
91100	93380	snap in a fit of rage or experience a
93380	96700	panic or overwhelming anxiety.
96700	98740	Of course, if this happens, it just
98740	100260	teaches the individual that negative
100260	102500	feelings are indeed bad and they will
102500	104980	often then double down in their efforts
104980	107660	to control them.
107660	109540	What is better is learning to approach
109540	113300	emotional functioning and how to be
113300	115700	aware and attuned to one's feelings on
115700	117780	the one hand and how to adaptively
117780	120260	regulate them on the other.
120260	123380	This is called the emotional sweet spot.
123380	126340	COMMO helps people learn how to process
126340	130260	emotions in the emotional sweet spot.
130260	134100	It starts with the MO, which is a
134100	136340	metacognitive observer.
136340	138660	This means adopting a deliberative,
138740	141620	reflective, responsive, versus reactive,
141620	144980	observing position of one's mind.
144980	146340	Take a minute and think about someone
146340	147780	you know who went through a stressful
147780	148500	event.
148500	150020	As you recreate the scene, allow
150020	152020	yourself to see in your mind's eye
152020	154340	what was going through their mind.
154340	155940	As you do, you're getting a feel for
155940	158900	this metacognitive observer stance,
158900	161140	which is to step outside the stream of
161140	163780	immediate experience and reflect on it.
163780	165540	Now imagine turning that lens of
165540	167300	observation and understanding on
167300	168420	yourself.
168420	170260	Imagine yourself seeing the feelings you
170260	172500	have, the rush of thoughts that follow
172500	175540	those feelings, and the situation you're
175540	177380	in and the history that led up to it,
177380	180020	and the other key people involved.
180020	183140	This is a participant observer stance
183140	185220	that is involved in the flow but can
185220	188660	also step outside and see one's thoughts,
188660	191140	feelings, and context from a distant,
191140	193300	and not become all the feelings that
193300	195780	are flowing through the stream.
195780	197300	Learning to take this metacognitive
197300	198740	stance takes practice.
198740	200420	It is not something people can do just
200420	201940	as soon as they hear about it.
201940	204100	But if guided, many can learn to do it
204100	206020	and become better and better at it.
206020	207700	The fact that it takes practice gives
207700	210020	rise to the second meaning of MO,
210020	212900	which is modus operandi, which refers to
212900	215460	one's mode of operating.
215460	217300	Modes of operating take practice to
217300	219220	internalize so that it becomes easier
219220	220580	and easier to achieve.
221060	224580	It can then be first practice when one is
224580	227460	calm, then in mildly stressful situations,
227460	229300	and then built up from there so that
229300	231460	even when the distress is significant,
231460	234180	the metacognitive observer will naturally
234180	236180	come online.
236180	239300	Calm, of course, is the word, but it also
239300	241300	is an acronym.
241300	244100	The C stands for curiosity, which is
244100	246100	the desire to know more.
246100	248500	This means taking a stance of wonder
248820	250820	seeking and understanding.
250820	253940	It means adopting a questioning attitude.
253940	256660	The curious part of the MO asks,
256660	258820	what is going on?
258820	260820	Where did this happen before?
260820	264020	How am I feeling?
264020	266580	When has this occurred?
266580	269860	Why might I be feeling the way I am?
269860	271860	And these questions are asked first
271860	274820	about one's feelings, then about one's
274820	277380	thoughts, what about the other?
278260	280660	About one's history, and ultimately
280660	283140	about other people involved.
283140	284740	All of this is in the service of
284740	287780	developing a rich and textured narrative
287780	291300	regarding what is happening and why.
291300	293140	This is in contrast to what many
293140	295700	individuals do when bumped by negative
295700	298260	feelings, which is to respond impulsively
298260	300500	and reacting negatively in their attempt
300500	304260	to control and escape from such feelings.
304260	307060	Accepting refers to the ability to be
307060	309380	with the pain and the awkwardness
309380	311700	without freaking out and without harsh
311700	313780	judgments or resistance.
313780	315780	It relates to the concept of emotional
315780	317540	distress tolerance.
317540	320820	It is hard, but with practice it can be done.
320820	322900	We can see this show up in the Buddhist
322900	324900	insights regarding suffering.
324900	326980	The first principle in Buddhism is life
326980	329300	is suffering, and the Buddha realized
329300	332020	that to run from suffering, to resist it
332020	334260	and pretend it is not there, to try to
334260	336900	jam it backstage or control it in other
336900	340740	ways does not lead to escape, but instead
340740	344340	leaves to more psychological difficulty.
344340	346980	The L stands for loving compassion
346980	349700	toward self and others.
349700	351780	This attitude recognizes the basic
351780	353860	wisdom that people have dignity and are
353860	355860	worthy of respect, and this is the
355860	358260	starting point for constructing a just
358260	359060	world.
359060	360900	It also means adopting the stance of
360900	362900	hoping that people will flourish and
362900	365460	have how high well-being and feeling
365460	368100	compassion or sympathy for those who are
368100	369860	genuinely experiencing genuine
369860	371060	difficulties.
371060	373540	This attitude is cultivated because most
373540	375700	people including oneself at their core
375700	378820	is generally doing the best they can.
378820	381540	The M stands for motivated toward valued
381540	384100	states of being in both the short and
384100	385220	long term.
385220	387540	The short term refers to the desired
387540	389700	outcome one wants given the actual
389700	391860	situation one is in.
391860	393860	A long term refers to the deliberative
393860	395540	ethical or moral principles that
395540	398260	individuals have about who they want to
398260	400900	be over the long term.
400900	404740	For example, kind, courageous, prudent.
404740	406820	This values-based element allows
406820	408820	individuals to separate their feelings
408820	410900	from the impulsive reactive instincts
410900	413780	and orient toward activities that will be
413780	415300	adapted.
415300	417620	In sum, Kamimo integrates many different
417620	419380	principles to provide a guide for the
419380	421380	kind of processes that are helpful
421380	423620	when one is bumped by the vagaries of
423620	424580	life.
424580	426980	If we can learn to respond to adversity
426980	428340	with a calm attitude,
428340	430580	both with ourselves and in relationships
430580	431540	to others,
431540	434180	we will be able to move much towards a
434180	436740	much healthier and more mature way of
436740	438740	being.
