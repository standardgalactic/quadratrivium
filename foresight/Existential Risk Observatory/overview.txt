Checking Existential Risk Observatory/AI Summit Talks featuring Stuart Russell, Max Tegmark, Jaan Tallinn, and many more - Livestream.txt
1. Otto, head of ERO at the Future of Life Institute, thanks everyone for attending the event at Wilton Hall and acknowledges the rapid growth in AI capabilities, which poses both opportunities and risks to human existence. He emphasizes the importance of the discussions happening at the upcoming summits on AI safety.

2. Otto highlights a recent BBC discussion about human extinction due to AI as a positive development because it indicates that AI safety is gaining attention from world leaders. The UK's prime minister has explicitly warned about these risks, and the press is increasingly interested in how AI should be regulated or controlled.

3. He encourages continued open debate and societal coordination on AI safety to ensure we can implement necessary measures to prevent existential risk, as suggested by the Extension Risk Observatory (ERO).

4. The event at Wilton Hall was organized in collaboration with Conjecture and could not have happened without the support of many individuals, including volunteers and staff like David Wood, Ruben Dileman, Katrina Joslyn, Connor Axiotis, Sue Chisholm, Tillman Schepke, Niky Drogdowski, Mark van der Waal, and Joep Soeren.

5. Otto invites everyone to join the discussion in the pub afterward for more informal conversations and thanks all attendees and participants for their contributions to the important discussions on AI safety.

6. A special thank you is extended to the moderator and speakers of the event, including Professor Stuart Russell, Connolly Professor Max Tegmark, Jan Lenneberg, Annika Brack, Mark Brackle, Ron Resnick, Alexandra Moussavi, Andrea Mariotti, Helhotzen, and others who made the event a success.

7. The event concludes with an invitation to support ERO's efforts in organizing similar events in the future through funding, volunteering, or by following and sharing their content.

8. A final note mentions that there might be a wedding taking place at Wilton Hall shortly, so attendees are encouraged to exit the venue if they are not part of the wedding party.

1. **Understanding Net Positive**: The question of what we can do about AI safety is complex. There are multiple approaches, such as developing AI safely (as organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are doing), focusing on AI alignment, improving interpretability of AI systems, advocating for regulations (like an AI pause), and ensuring public awareness and participation in the conversation.

2. **Public Involvement**: The speaker emphasizes that any significant development in AI should not be undertaken without informing the public. It's crucial that a tiny group of people doesn't decide on the extinction risk for humanity. We need an open debate about how AI should or should not be developed, with the aim of reducing human extinction risk.

3. **Upcoming Event**: On October 31st at 2 pm, there will be another event featuring Professor Stuart Russell in Bletchley Park's old assembly hall, where attendees can discuss AI safety and risks democratically. This event aims to celebrate the opportunity for a broad public conversation on these critical issues.

4. **Engagement and Follow-up**: The Existential Risk Observatory, along with Conjecture, encourages everyone to be part of this ongoing conversation about AI safety. There will be more summits in the future, and the organizations plan to continue their research, inform governments, and host additional events.

1. **AI Safety and Human Extinction Risk**: The discussion centered around the safety of AI development, particularly the potential risk of human extinction due to uncontrolled or misaligned AI systems. The speaker emphasized that decisions about AI should not be made in secret by a small group of people but should involve democratic discussion and public consent.

2. **AI Development**: There are several entities, like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, working on developing AI safely. This includes efforts in AI alignment, interpretability, and understanding how AI systems make decisions.

3. **Increasing Knowledge and Public Involvement**: The speaker highlighted the importance of increasing public knowledge about AI to ensure informed consent about its development and use. Events like the one at Conway Hall are crucial for open debate on these issues.

4. **Regulation and Transparency**: There's a call for transparency in AI development and potential support for an "AI pause" or moratorium to evaluate risks. However, there are also concerns that regulations might have unintended consequences.

5. **Next Steps**: The speaker announced the next event will be on October 31st at Blashley Park, just before the AI Safety Summit, where these discussions can continue democratically and inclusively. They encourage everyone to participate in this conversation about managing risks associated with AI.

6. **Support and Engagement**: The Existential Risk Observatory is looking for support and engagement from the public to help inform governments and continue research on AI safety. Attendees were invited to scan a QR code to register for the Blashley Park event and follow future events and research initiatives from the observatory.

7. **Closing Remarks**: The speaker thanked all the speakers, organizers, and participants of the event, including Romeo Polsky, Cornelly Sir Robert Buckland, Yantian Li, Andrea Miltnerová, Alexandra Mosfegh, Day Evrard Birnbaum, and others. Special thanks were given to David Wood, Conor Xi, Dibson Dealer Man, and everyone at Conway Hall for making the event possible.

8. **Further Engagement**: The speaker encouraged attendees to stay engaged, attend future events, and support ongoing efforts to ensure AI development is aligned with human values and safety.

Checking Existential Risk Observatory/Existential Risks of AI - Debate with Stuart Russell at Pakhuis de Zwijger.txt
1. The discussion emphasized the need for regulations that extend beyond the deployment of AI to include its training phase, as current EU regulations focus only on the market introduction of AI products and not on their development or testing phases.
   
2. There is a concern about the immense computational power held by a few AI companies, like OpenAI, which is significantly more than entire countries like the UK. This raises worries about the potential for unregulated AI development.

3. The panel agreed that regulating the training of AI models could be a critical point to mitigate existential risks, as it requires substantial computational resources and presents an opportunity for intervention before deployment.

4. The seven recommendations mentioned earlier include targeting AI safety research, ethics in engineering programs, increasing funding, and countering the lobbying power of the tech industry.

5. The event concluded with a call to action for the audience to continue the conversation about AI risks over drinks and to engage further on the topic.

6. A round of applause was given to the panelists for their insights, and it was suggested that the audience might meet again at a demonstration in the Netherlands, specifically at Dam Square, with a date yet to be determined.

7. The event organizers encouraged attendees to network and discuss these critical issues further, emphasizing that this is just the beginning of a larger ongoing dialogue about AI safety and governance.

1. The speaker, a behavioral biometrics expert who transitioned into AI safety research, discussed the potential impact of successful alignment between humans and AI on various aspects of society. They proposed the concept of a "personal universe" where individuals could fulfill their desires without the need for social consensus, addressing one part of the value alignment problem by ensuring that the computational substrate can support everyone's personal universe.

2. The speaker reflected on how they were drawn into AI safety research through their work detecting bots in online environments and eventually engaging with organizations like the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI). They noted that some AI researchers might be hesitant to discuss existential risks publicly due to career considerations or the desire to avoid causing undue alarm.

3. The speaker emphasized the importance of communicating about the existential risks associated with developing AI and creating a GAI (General Intelligence) to the general public, as this research fundamentally affects all humans and none have consented to be subjects in this experiment.

4. The speaker concluded by expressing hope for continued collaboration on solving these complex problems and encouraged attendance at the rest of the conference for further discussion and networking among researchers and enthusiasts in the field.
