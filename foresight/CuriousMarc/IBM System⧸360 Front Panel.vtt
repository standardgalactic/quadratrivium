WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
All right, we've got a really big box.

00:15.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, this is an upside-down IBM 36050 front panel.

00:45.000 --> 01:04.000
All right, there it is right side up and it's mostly complete actually.

01:04.000 --> 01:17.000
A few lights missing this one and that one which is amazing considering how poorly they have been glued.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Most of the switchwork, those are supposed to be that way.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
This is the only one who is not returning because it's missing the blades on the back.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
All the address switches work beautifully.

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
Most everything is working.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
The only two things I found is this has no pot at the back but all the other ones have.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
And the switch I have to repair.

02:02.000 --> 02:12.000
So I took it off its frame and removed this one which was bent and cleaned it.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
And interestingly enough, that allows me to date it.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
It's January 69.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
The year men went on the moon.

02:26.000 --> 02:41.000
Here is the backside and most of the switches are there.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
I have to remove this.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
The rollers are there.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
They've cut all the cabling which is annoying.

02:54.000 --> 03:07.000
And all of the lights have been cut and removed also.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
So I was afraid they had cut the lights but they didn't.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
They just took the outer part where the light goes and out and then they glued it very crudely.

03:19.000 --> 03:34.000
So what I need to do is to make a 3D print or order to find something that can go on top and make a light out of it.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Many many many times.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
So you can tell what the problem trials are.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It's all the rotating commutators.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
They have taken the beatings.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
There is almost nothing left of this one.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
This one is gone.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
This one is intact.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
And at the bottom also this one is gone.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
This one is gone.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
This one is gone too.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
So probably the most fragile ones.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Here is the switch that doesn't work very well because it's missing the top.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
So I have made some progress here.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
For now I put this nicer protection of an IBM 360 front plate.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Somebody made a 3D version of it and offered it on eBay.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So why not?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I found all the lights.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So those are apparently easy to find.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I got several of them on eBay.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
So the panel is cosmetically intact in the front.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
Then I reinforced the frame so I can have it as a static display.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
And then some parts I bought like the lights.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
So I got some actually are slightly different there for the 370 and some for the 360.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
But I got also some donated.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Thank you Vincent from France.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
So I got a few rotators.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Unfortunately they are by 10.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
And the 360 panel uses either by 14 or by 6.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
This one might be a 14.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
So I might have one that works.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The switches look exactly like the right ones.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
So I'll be able to repair my one switch.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Look at that.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Beautiful hardware.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
And then the buttons, those will come handy for the tape.

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
I intend to get the tape drives from the same vintage vacuum tape drives that would work.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
So this is the switch that doesn't work.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Because it's missing the contacts on top.

06:08.000 --> 06:20.000
But it looks like this guy is the exact same type of contacts as this one.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
All right.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
There you go, it works.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
There.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I think they will have to do for now.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
Okay, so this is an imposing panel by any measure.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
The Model 50 was a rather big machine at the time.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
And the panel has over 250 lights in it.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
So let me try to give you a little tour of what every section does.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
The panel was mostly used for debug of the machine.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
And not very much interaction during regular operation.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
So this here is the power section.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
And it has all the pots for margining.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
So there is 10 voltages that you can tweak.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
There's little pots with a little center switch on it.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
And you can choose any of the 10 and monitor them over here

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
and try to create a fault by getting the voltage too low or too high

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
if it's an intermittent fault.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
And actually the 36050 was known to be a machine with a lot of intermittent faults.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
So much so that they had a joke about it.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
They say that if you threw a Model 50 in the Hudson River,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
it would probably sink intermittently.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Anyhow, so you have those 10 voltages that you can margin.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
So you can tweak them around their nominal value.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
And there's also 10 other voltages here that are fixed that you can monitor.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
DC off, turn voltage to CPU and there's a few thermal overloads

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
and no breaker and power problem slides over here.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
So that's the power section.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
Next to it is actually an interesting section over here.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
This is the storage test.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
So you have this button here allows you to write all ones, all zeros,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
worst patterns. I have no idea what the worst pattern is

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
or the reverse of the worst pattern into memory.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
If you press the right button, it will write you continuously

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and if you have also this stop on check,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
it will stop where it finds the memory error.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
And there are no some other optional buttons here.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
So that's for the memory check.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
Then there's the famous emergency pole switch.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So this one, I'll just do it for you.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
Once you can pull it, but you cannot push it back without calling IBM.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It stays stuck in that position.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Actually, you have to unlock it from for the back.

10:09.000 --> 10:17.000
So beneath here is another power section, which is optional.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So apparently this came from a bigger machine

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
and this is for the auxiliary storage power.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
So you have four more, four more powers

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
and that's because this machine was equipped with 512K.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
We had an extra 256K auxiliary storage, I guess.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
I haven't double checked that, so don't kill me if I'm not exact.

10:46.000 --> 10:56.000
But probably this machine was maxed out with 512K of core memory,

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
which was quite a lot at the time in 1964 was when the machine was announced.

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
So over in the little corner here is the channel test.

11:12.000 --> 11:22.000
And basically that allows you to test channel instructions one by one

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
and you have the choice between the selector channel here or the multiplex channel

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
and you would just enter instruction one by one manually.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
So channels are IO and instructions are defined by this portion here.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
So that's the main portion.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Well, let's zoom in on one of them.

11:44.000 --> 11:54.000
This is 144 lights that display all the CPU and channels terrace

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
and the two tops are channels and the two lower are mostly CPU.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
And since 144 lights weren't enough, they made the rollers out of it

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
and they're controlled by those buttons on the side.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Let's see if I can activate one.

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
And so these are multiple position 8 per roller.

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
So you can display 8 times 144 bits on that thing.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
And there's a little cheat sheet over here that tells you what status registers

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
or data channel registers you are looking at.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
So that's the main diagnosis to look at the bits in the machine.

12:46.000 --> 12:57.000
Down there in the middle is where you have the entry for data and addresses

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
and that's of course for manual operation and debugging.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
So you can manually enter an address.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Actually, no, this is data.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
So data is 32 bits, 4 times 8.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
And you see that the indicators have an extra light that's parity.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
So every byte has a parity byte and there's a weird button here.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
And that's called actually parity reverse.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
So parity is generated automatically but for some weird reason for debugging purposes

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
you can push this one and it will change parity.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
And data can be either red or input and you see the lights on top.

13:50.000 --> 14:01.000
And at the bottom you have the address switches which can also be used for operating the channels.

14:01.000 --> 14:09.000
So you see some white markings here and there are special channels, addresses

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
when you use the blue button that I showed you before.

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
And the row of lights at the top, these are all the air lights.

14:22.000 --> 14:33.000
So this row here, so the most important light is that fellow over here, the master check.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
So if you have an error, this thing stops and then you have to figure out what went wrong.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
So there's all kind of air lights.

14:42.000 --> 14:54.000
And towards the left here there is the FLT, the fault location test lights.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
We'll talk about them later.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
Here you can select which memory location you work on.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And apparently there are four of them.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
Main memory, local memory which I suppose is cache or equivalent to cache.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
And multiplex and something that's called protect which I don't know yet what it is.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I haven't read enough.

15:25.000 --> 15:35.000
Over here is a little cheat sheet to work the channel addresses which are hardwired mostly.

15:35.000 --> 15:46.000
And then down here is a series of interesting switches here where you can do, that's for deep debugging here.

15:46.000 --> 15:57.000
You can do tests and stop the machine or sync a nosoloscope on some special conditions.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
So this is the instruction address match.

16:01.000 --> 16:11.000
So normal is in process but you can have it stop when it matches an address that you have set in the address switches.

16:11.000 --> 16:23.000
So it's the equivalent of setting a debug point in your software.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
Then you can do the same trick with the micro instruction.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
That's the set of switches next to it.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
And you can do the same trick by matching a storage address compare.

16:39.000 --> 16:47.000
So you can basically put stop and break points manually by combination of those switches.

16:47.000 --> 16:56.000
And then it will match the address that you have put in the switches over here and stop the processor.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
And then there's a few more I'd like to show you.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
There's of course the lamp test.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
But my favorite one is the force indicator.

17:14.000 --> 17:24.000
And I wanted really hard to be, for that to be the Star Wars switch when everything else fails you use the force.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
But no it has to do with the FLTs which are the fault locator tests.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
And so it's not as fast as I thought.

17:35.000 --> 17:47.000
And so this controls how the fault locator tests work and which we are going to talk more about when we move to other section of the panel.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
So here we have the counters.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
So two counters. One when it's in regular mode when your machine runs and that's the one that IBM makes you pay for.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
So this one has 9000 something on it and we don't know how many times it went over.

18:08.000 --> 18:22.000
This is the CE key, customer engineer key switch that will switch it to the maintenance counter for which you won't be built.

18:22.000 --> 18:33.000
And next over here are some of the main manual operation buttons.

18:33.000 --> 18:42.000
So you have start and that's the button you will use to load some memory.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
You push start and you load what you had put in the keys into the memory.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
And then you can run the processor in the normal mode in single step.

18:54.000 --> 19:04.000
So one instruction at a time or single cycle which I suppose is a micro instruction or part of a micro instruction at a time.

19:04.000 --> 19:14.000
And then you can stop it and bring it in manual mode which gives you access to the other keys.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
Once in stop mode so this becomes active so you can do a system reset.

19:19.000 --> 19:27.000
You can do a PSW restart. Basically it's a reset and it starts at address 0 and loads code from there.

19:27.000 --> 19:36.000
Check reset and that's a switch we have on the 1401 also that clears the errors.

19:36.000 --> 19:44.000
Set IC that's one you use to set the instruction counter.

19:44.000 --> 20:00.000
So you would put addresses over here and then press set instruction counter and it would force a jump to that instruction.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.000
Store if that's if you want to store in a certain address.

20:07.000 --> 20:18.000
You would put the data over the switch at the top and press store and it would load the data at the memory address at the bottom.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Displace the inverse when you read it.

20:21.000 --> 20:34.000
And log out if I understand well is to do a dump I suspect on the printer or something like that of the state of the machine.

20:34.000 --> 20:45.000
And here a few of the control knobs, the process control in normal, disabled stop or channel stop.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
So it basically defines what the processor will do when it encounters an error.

20:51.000 --> 21:03.000
And then there's this other one I talked about which is the FLT which is default location test.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Where you can have the machine if you put it in the FLT mode.

21:08.000 --> 21:22.000
You can have the machine do a series of tests and you can have repeat the tests stop if it encounters a problem and other modes like this.

21:22.000 --> 21:36.000
And what will happen is that it will go through a series of hardware hardwired tests and display the result is a pass or fail light here.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
And which test it was operating etc.

21:40.000 --> 21:49.000
So I understand it has a whole suite of hardware tests that it can do.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
And then finally we are at the bottom right of the panel and that's the one the regular operator would use and not the IBM customer engineer.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And it has a big power on button and power off.

22:03.000 --> 22:13.000
And here are the rollers or the rotary controllers for entering the address from your start device.

22:13.000 --> 22:22.000
So which channel it is and which address on the channel and you would start your disk or your magnetic device on which you have your boot code.

22:23.000 --> 22:33.000
And you would press load and it would boot but IBM doesn't call it boot it calls it IPL.

22:33.000 --> 22:44.000
Initial program load and here you have the main indicator lights system when it's running.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Manual when you have stopped it.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Weight when it's in the weight state.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
Test when any of the test switches like the memory or the FLT is on.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
And load when it's doing IPL.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
And that's it there you have it.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
Of course the whole difficulty here is to understand what the registers do and there are so many of them.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
It's just mind boggling.

23:14.000 --> 23:25.000
But when you had a machine made of hundreds of thousands of parts that could and would all fail.

23:25.000 --> 23:39.000
You needed to have that degree of test lights in them and to be able to maintain them easily.

23:39.000 --> 23:47.000
And therefore the blink and light front panels which are still very pretty today.

23:47.000 --> 24:05.000
So give a hand to the IBM 360 model 50 from control panel and the deal here will be to try to make a replica of the IBM CPU

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
and try to bring this panel to life.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
And that's of course going to be a very major and long project so it's a multi-year affair here.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
So for now is just a static display just for looks.
