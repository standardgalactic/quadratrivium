Checking CuriousMarc/Divide by Zero on the Friden STW10 Mechanical Calculator.txt
 It seems like you're describing an experience with a Frieden STW-10 calculator, a vintage scientific calculator known for its precision and capabilities. You received frequent comments about the idea that dividing by zero on this calculator could be dangerous or "awesome," leading to a popular YouTube video challenge.

Contrary to the belief that dividing by zero would cause the calculator to catch fire, you decided to investigate what actually happens. After clearing the calculator and entering the number 355 as the dividend, you attempted to divide by zero. To your knowledge, the calculator was designed with a "div stop" button, which likely prevents it from entering an infinite loop, a situation that could potentially cause overheating and damage, although it might not necessarily lead to a fire.

You explained that the calculator performs division by successive subtractions (long division) and that when you attempt to divide by zero, the calculator doesn't find a number to subtract, leading it into an infinite loop where it keeps trying to subtract zero from the dividend without ever finding a result.

In your experiment, the calculator indeed entered an infinite loop, demonstrating that dividing by zero on this particular model does not cause a fire but can make the calculator overheat and potentially damage it if left unchecked. You also demonstrated a regular division using the number 355 divided by 113, which successfully calculated an approximation of pi (π).

In summary, dividing by zero on a Frieden STW-10 calculator will result in an infinite loop rather than a fire or any other catastrophic failure, and it's wise to use the "div stop" feature to prevent potential damage.

Checking CuriousMarc/IBM System⧸360 Front Panel.txt
 The IBM System/360 Model 50's control console is a complex piece of equipment that allows operators to interact with the computer system, perform diagnostics, and manage its operations. Here's a summary of the key components and functions of the control console as described in the video:

1. **FLTs (Fault Locator Tests):** These are used to test various parts of the machine to ensure they are functioning correctly. The tests can be initiated in different modes, and the results are displayed by pass/fail lights.

2. **Counters:** There are two counters on the console—one for regular operation (which incurs a cost) and another for maintenance operations (which does not). These counters keep track of the number of times the machine has been used or tested.

3. **Manual Operation Buttons:** These include start, stop, single step, and single cycle modes, allowing operators to manually control the CPU's operation and interact with memory and other components.

4. **Maintenance Keys:** These include reset, PSW restart (Program Status Word), set IC (Instruction Counter), store, displace, and log out. They enable operators to perform specific maintenance tasks.

5. **Process Control Switches:** These control what the CPU does when it encounters an error, with options for normal, disabled, stop, and channel stop modes.

6. **Registers and Address Entry:** Operators can enter addresses via rotary controls for loading programs or performing other memory operations. The console allows operators to interact with the machine's registers directly.

7. **Indicator Lights:** These provide visual feedback on the system's status, including whether it is running, in manual mode, in weight mode (for critical data), or undergoing a test sequence.

8. **Power Control:** There are big buttons for turning the machine on and off.

The control console is designed to be robust and user-friendly, with a wide range of controls to manage the complex IBM System/360 Model 50, which was a groundbreaking computer system in its time. The console's design reflects the importance of diagnostics and maintenance in ensuring the reliability and performance of large-scale computing systems during the era when it was introduced. Today, enthusiasts and historians are working to recreate this console and bring it back to life as a functional piece of vintage computer hardware.
