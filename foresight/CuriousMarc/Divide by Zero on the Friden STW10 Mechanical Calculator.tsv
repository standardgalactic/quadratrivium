0	10400	So here's my Frieden STW-10 and today I wanted to respond to one of the most
10400	17760	frequent comments I get which is try to divide by zero is awesome and
17760	24160	dangerous if divide by zero does it catch fire try to divide by zero please
24160	28680	make a division by zero and then I ask a guy to try it by himself and say I only
28680	34040	do it on my piano which actually wouldn't help again I was kind of reluctant
34040	37840	to do it and I had to think for a while what would happen if I did it and I
37840	43600	convinced myself that no it wouldn't catch fire so it would be a very
43600	49960	popular YouTube video so let's try it let's divide by zero and see what
49960	63320	happens so let me clear everything and enter 355 as the dividend okay so we have
63320	75360	a 355 out there there you go 355 right here and now we are going to divide by
75360	81480	zero so I'll do a keyboard clear plump there's nothing on the keyboard and I'll
81480	87080	hit the two buttons and we'll see what happens before that I will reset it
87080	95400	other direction reset it here because it's more spectacular and okay off we go
95400	99240	so it's a freedom you need to press two buttons to divide the right one and the
99240	101520	left one
104600	111840	and what happens that it gets into an infinite loop and will never stop and I
111840	116960	guess it heats up so eventually it would catch fire but guess what they thought
116960	123760	about it there's a button here it's called div stop and I guess that was made
123760	129120	especially for idiots making YouTube videos and they had lots of foresight
129120	136120	so this is what it does it just gets set in an infinite infinite loop but let's
136120	144640	understand why that is so let's clear everything and I'll do a regular division
144640	159120	though of my favorite one which gives pi 355 dividend divided by 113 and again
159120	165600	I'll try to do it from the edge here so what happens is that in order to do
165600	171920	divisions what it actually does is successive subtractions and does it as
171920	176600	we do it in school is trial and error so it will try to subtract what I just
176600	183800	entered which is 113 from this number and trying progressively know this time
183800	189240	10, 900, 1000 until it hits over here and finally it subtracts enough of a
189240	194480	chunk that it overflows and it tells it it has subtracted too much and then it
194480	200160	starts to move it one to the left and subtract smaller amounts and that's how
200160	206280	it does the division eventually so let's see how that works
206280	213000	see it move move move move move move move ding it overflows
216480	224240	and eventually it divide in and it's in the 3.141592 something it's the
224240	227280	approximation of pi
254240	280240	so what happens that when you divide by zero is just subtract nothing and so it
280240	286280	can never overflow and it gets stuck in an infinite loop so here you go here you
286280	293640	have it divide by zero on a Frieden STW10 let's do it again
293640	300120	as clear enter some kind of stupid number
300120	309200	dividend all to the right here the keyboard divide by zero and watch the
309200	311480	smoke
317680	323160	okay we'll do that forever good night
330120	346740	a brilliant cast Jack Lemon in a delightful role which gives full reign to
346740	350240	Jack's amazing versatility
360120	362180	you
