1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All right, we've got a really big box.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, this is an upside-down IBM 36050 front panel.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All right, there it is right side up and it's mostly complete actually.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A few lights missing this one and that one which is amazing considering how poorly they have been glued.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Most of the switchwork, those are supposed to be that way.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is the only one who is not returning because it's missing the blades on the back.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All the address switches work beautifully.

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Most everything is working.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The only two things I found is this has no pot at the back but all the other ones have.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And the switch I have to repair.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So I took it off its frame and removed this one which was bent and cleaned it.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And interestingly enough, that allows me to date it.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's January 69.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The year men went on the moon.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Here is the backside and most of the switches are there.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have to remove this.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The rollers are there.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They've cut all the cabling which is annoying.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And all of the lights have been cut and removed also.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I was afraid they had cut the lights but they didn't.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They just took the outer part where the light goes and out and then they glued it very crudely.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So what I need to do is to make a 3D print or order to find something that can go on top and make a light out of it.

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Many many many times.

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you can tell what the problem trials are.

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's all the rotating commutators.

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They have taken the beatings.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There is almost nothing left of this one.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This one is gone.

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This one is intact.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And at the bottom also this one is gone.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This one is gone.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This one is gone too.

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So probably the most fragile ones.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Here is the switch that doesn't work very well because it's missing the top.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I have made some progress here.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
For now I put this nicer protection of an IBM 360 front plate.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Somebody made a 3D version of it and offered it on eBay.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So why not?

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I found all the lights.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So those are apparently easy to find.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I got several of them on eBay.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So the panel is cosmetically intact in the front.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then I reinforced the frame so I can have it as a static display.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then some parts I bought like the lights.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I got some actually are slightly different there for the 370 and some for the 360.

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I got also some donated.

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you Vincent from France.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So I got a few rotators.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Unfortunately they are by 10.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And the 360 panel uses either by 14 or by 6.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This one might be a 14.

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I might have one that works.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The switches look exactly like the right ones.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I'll be able to repair my one switch.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look at that.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Beautiful hardware.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then the buttons, those will come handy for the tape.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I intend to get the tape drives from the same vintage vacuum tape drives that would work.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So this is the switch that doesn't work.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because it's missing the contacts on top.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But it looks like this guy is the exact same type of contacts as this one.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All right.

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There you go, it works.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think they will have to do for now.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, so this is an imposing panel by any measure.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The Model 50 was a rather big machine at the time.

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And the panel has over 250 lights in it.

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So let me try to give you a little tour of what every section does.

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The panel was mostly used for debug of the machine.

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And not very much interaction during regular operation.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So this here is the power section.

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And it has all the pots for margining.

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So there is 10 voltages that you can tweak.

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There's little pots with a little center switch on it.

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And you can choose any of the 10 and monitor them over here

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and try to create a fault by getting the voltage too low or too high

79
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
if it's an intermittent fault.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And actually the 36050 was known to be a machine with a lot of intermittent faults.

81
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So much so that they had a joke about it.

82
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They say that if you threw a Model 50 in the Hudson River,

83
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it would probably sink intermittently.

84
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Anyhow, so you have those 10 voltages that you can margin.

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you can tweak them around their nominal value.

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And there's also 10 other voltages here that are fixed that you can monitor.

87
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
DC off, turn voltage to CPU and there's a few thermal overloads

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and no breaker and power problem slides over here.

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So that's the power section.

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Next to it is actually an interesting section over here.

91
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is the storage test.

92
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So you have this button here allows you to write all ones, all zeros,

93
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
worst patterns. I have no idea what the worst pattern is

94
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
or the reverse of the worst pattern into memory.

95
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you press the right button, it will write you continuously

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and if you have also this stop on check,

97
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
it will stop where it finds the memory error.

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And there are no some other optional buttons here.

99
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So that's for the memory check.

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then there's the famous emergency pole switch.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So this one, I'll just do it for you.

102
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Once you can pull it, but you cannot push it back without calling IBM.

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It stays stuck in that position.

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Actually, you have to unlock it from for the back.

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So beneath here is another power section, which is optional.

106
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So apparently this came from a bigger machine

107
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and this is for the auxiliary storage power.

108
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So you have four more, four more powers

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and that's because this machine was equipped with 512K.

110
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We had an extra 256K auxiliary storage, I guess.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I haven't double checked that, so don't kill me if I'm not exact.

112
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But probably this machine was maxed out with 512K of core memory,

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
which was quite a lot at the time in 1964 was when the machine was announced.

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So over in the little corner here is the channel test.

115
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And basically that allows you to test channel instructions one by one

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and you have the choice between the selector channel here or the multiplex channel

117
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and you would just enter instruction one by one manually.

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So channels are IO and instructions are defined by this portion here.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So that's the main portion.

120
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, let's zoom in on one of them.

121
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This is 144 lights that display all the CPU and channels terrace

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and the two tops are channels and the two lower are mostly CPU.

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And since 144 lights weren't enough, they made the rollers out of it

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and they're controlled by those buttons on the side.

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's see if I can activate one.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And so these are multiple position 8 per roller.

127
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So you can display 8 times 144 bits on that thing.

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And there's a little cheat sheet over here that tells you what status registers

129
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
or data channel registers you are looking at.

130
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So that's the main diagnosis to look at the bits in the machine.

131
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Down there in the middle is where you have the entry for data and addresses

132
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and that's of course for manual operation and debugging.

133
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So you can manually enter an address.

134
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Actually, no, this is data.

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So data is 32 bits, 4 times 8.

136
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And you see that the indicators have an extra light that's parity.

137
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So every byte has a parity byte and there's a weird button here.

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And that's called actually parity reverse.

139
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So parity is generated automatically but for some weird reason for debugging purposes

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you can push this one and it will change parity.

141
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And data can be either red or input and you see the lights on top.

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And at the bottom you have the address switches which can also be used for operating the channels.

143
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So you see some white markings here and there are special channels, addresses

144
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
when you use the blue button that I showed you before.

145
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And the row of lights at the top, these are all the air lights.

146
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So this row here, so the most important light is that fellow over here, the master check.

147
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So if you have an error, this thing stops and then you have to figure out what went wrong.

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So there's all kind of air lights.

149
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And towards the left here there is the FLT, the fault location test lights.

150
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We'll talk about them later.

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Here you can select which memory location you work on.

152
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And apparently there are four of them.

153
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Main memory, local memory which I suppose is cache or equivalent to cache.

154
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And multiplex and something that's called protect which I don't know yet what it is.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I haven't read enough.

156
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Over here is a little cheat sheet to work the channel addresses which are hardwired mostly.

157
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And then down here is a series of interesting switches here where you can do, that's for deep debugging here.

158
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You can do tests and stop the machine or sync a nosoloscope on some special conditions.

159
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So this is the instruction address match.

160
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So normal is in process but you can have it stop when it matches an address that you have set in the address switches.

161
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So it's the equivalent of setting a debug point in your software.

162
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Then you can do the same trick with the micro instruction.

163
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's the set of switches next to it.

164
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And you can do the same trick by matching a storage address compare.

165
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So you can basically put stop and break points manually by combination of those switches.

166
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And then it will match the address that you have put in the switches over here and stop the processor.

167
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then there's a few more I'd like to show you.

168
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There's of course the lamp test.

169
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But my favorite one is the force indicator.

170
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And I wanted really hard to be, for that to be the Star Wars switch when everything else fails you use the force.

171
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But no it has to do with the FLTs which are the fault locator tests.

172
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And so it's not as fast as I thought.

173
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And so this controls how the fault locator tests work and which we are going to talk more about when we move to other section of the panel.

174
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So here we have the counters.

175
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So two counters. One when it's in regular mode when your machine runs and that's the one that IBM makes you pay for.

176
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So this one has 9000 something on it and we don't know how many times it went over.

177
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is the CE key, customer engineer key switch that will switch it to the maintenance counter for which you won't be built.

178
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And next over here are some of the main manual operation buttons.

179
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So you have start and that's the button you will use to load some memory.

180
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You push start and you load what you had put in the keys into the memory.

181
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And then you can run the processor in the normal mode in single step.

182
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So one instruction at a time or single cycle which I suppose is a micro instruction or part of a micro instruction at a time.

183
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then you can stop it and bring it in manual mode which gives you access to the other keys.

184
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Once in stop mode so this becomes active so you can do a system reset.

185
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You can do a PSW restart. Basically it's a reset and it starts at address 0 and loads code from there.

186
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Check reset and that's a switch we have on the 1401 also that clears the errors.

187
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Set IC that's one you use to set the instruction counter.

188
00:19:44,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So you would put addresses over here and then press set instruction counter and it would force a jump to that instruction.

189
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Store if that's if you want to store in a certain address.

190
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You would put the data over the switch at the top and press store and it would load the data at the memory address at the bottom.

191
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Displace the inverse when you read it.

192
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And log out if I understand well is to do a dump I suspect on the printer or something like that of the state of the machine.

193
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And here a few of the control knobs, the process control in normal, disabled stop or channel stop.

194
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So it basically defines what the processor will do when it encounters an error.

195
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And then there's this other one I talked about which is the FLT which is default location test.

196
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Where you can have the machine if you put it in the FLT mode.

197
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You can have the machine do a series of tests and you can have repeat the tests stop if it encounters a problem and other modes like this.

198
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And what will happen is that it will go through a series of hardware hardwired tests and display the result is a pass or fail light here.

199
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And which test it was operating etc.

200
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So I understand it has a whole suite of hardware tests that it can do.

201
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And then finally we are at the bottom right of the panel and that's the one the regular operator would use and not the IBM customer engineer.

202
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And it has a big power on button and power off.

203
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And here are the rollers or the rotary controllers for entering the address from your start device.

204
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So which channel it is and which address on the channel and you would start your disk or your magnetic device on which you have your boot code.

205
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And you would press load and it would boot but IBM doesn't call it boot it calls it IPL.

206
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Initial program load and here you have the main indicator lights system when it's running.

207
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Manual when you have stopped it.

208
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Weight when it's in the weight state.

209
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Test when any of the test switches like the memory or the FLT is on.

210
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And load when it's doing IPL.

211
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And that's it there you have it.

212
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Of course the whole difficulty here is to understand what the registers do and there are so many of them.

213
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's just mind boggling.

214
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But when you had a machine made of hundreds of thousands of parts that could and would all fail.

215
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You needed to have that degree of test lights in them and to be able to maintain them easily.

216
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And therefore the blink and light front panels which are still very pretty today.

217
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So give a hand to the IBM 360 model 50 from control panel and the deal here will be to try to make a replica of the IBM CPU

218
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and try to bring this panel to life.

219
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And that's of course going to be a very major and long project so it's a multi-year affair here.

220
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So for now is just a static display just for looks.
