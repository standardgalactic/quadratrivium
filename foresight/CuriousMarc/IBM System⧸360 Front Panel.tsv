0	15000	All right, we've got a really big box.
15000	33000	Well, this is an upside-down IBM 36050 front panel.
45000	64000	All right, there it is right side up and it's mostly complete actually.
64000	77000	A few lights missing this one and that one which is amazing considering how poorly they have been glued.
77000	84000	Most of the switchwork, those are supposed to be that way.
84000	90000	This is the only one who is not returning because it's missing the blades on the back.
90000	99000	All the address switches work beautifully.
99000	109000	Most everything is working.
109000	117000	The only two things I found is this has no pot at the back but all the other ones have.
117000	122000	And the switch I have to repair.
122000	132000	So I took it off its frame and removed this one which was bent and cleaned it.
132000	137000	And interestingly enough, that allows me to date it.
137000	141000	It's January 69.
141000	146000	The year men went on the moon.
146000	161000	Here is the backside and most of the switches are there.
161000	165000	I have to remove this.
165000	169000	The rollers are there.
169000	174000	They've cut all the cabling which is annoying.
174000	187000	And all of the lights have been cut and removed also.
187000	191000	So I was afraid they had cut the lights but they didn't.
191000	199000	They just took the outer part where the light goes and out and then they glued it very crudely.
199000	214000	So what I need to do is to make a 3D print or order to find something that can go on top and make a light out of it.
214000	218000	Many many many times.
218000	221000	So you can tell what the problem trials are.
221000	224000	It's all the rotating commutators.
224000	226000	They have taken the beatings.
226000	230000	There is almost nothing left of this one.
230000	233000	This one is gone.
233000	236000	This one is intact.
236000	242000	And at the bottom also this one is gone.
242000	244000	This one is gone.
244000	247000	This one is gone too.
247000	251000	So probably the most fragile ones.
251000	256000	Here is the switch that doesn't work very well because it's missing the top.
256000	260000	So I have made some progress here.
260000	266000	For now I put this nicer protection of an IBM 360 front plate.
266000	270000	Somebody made a 3D version of it and offered it on eBay.
270000	272000	So why not?
272000	274000	I found all the lights.
274000	278000	So those are apparently easy to find.
278000	281000	I got several of them on eBay.
281000	287000	So the panel is cosmetically intact in the front.
287000	296000	Then I reinforced the frame so I can have it as a static display.
296000	300000	And then some parts I bought like the lights.
300000	307000	So I got some actually are slightly different there for the 370 and some for the 360.
307000	309000	But I got also some donated.
309000	312000	Thank you Vincent from France.
312000	315000	So I got a few rotators.
315000	318000	Unfortunately they are by 10.
318000	324000	And the 360 panel uses either by 14 or by 6.
324000	328000	This one might be a 14.
328000	331000	So I might have one that works.
331000	334000	The switches look exactly like the right ones.
334000	338000	So I'll be able to repair my one switch.
338000	340000	Look at that.
340000	343000	Beautiful hardware.
343000	351000	And then the buttons, those will come handy for the tape.
351000	360000	I intend to get the tape drives from the same vintage vacuum tape drives that would work.
360000	364000	So this is the switch that doesn't work.
364000	368000	Because it's missing the contacts on top.
368000	380000	But it looks like this guy is the exact same type of contacts as this one.
381000	386000	All right.
391000	393000	There you go, it works.
393000	395000	Okay.
402000	404000	There.
405000	409000	I think they will have to do for now.
417000	423000	Okay, so this is an imposing panel by any measure.
423000	429000	The Model 50 was a rather big machine at the time.
430000	436000	And the panel has over 250 lights in it.
436000	443000	So let me try to give you a little tour of what every section does.
443000	450000	The panel was mostly used for debug of the machine.
450000	457000	And not very much interaction during regular operation.
458000	464000	So this here is the power section.
464000	469000	And it has all the pots for margining.
469000	474000	So there is 10 voltages that you can tweak.
474000	479000	There's little pots with a little center switch on it.
479000	484000	And you can choose any of the 10 and monitor them over here
484000	489000	and try to create a fault by getting the voltage too low or too high
489000	491000	if it's an intermittent fault.
491000	499000	And actually the 36050 was known to be a machine with a lot of intermittent faults.
499000	503000	So much so that they had a joke about it.
503000	507000	They say that if you threw a Model 50 in the Hudson River,
507000	510000	it would probably sink intermittently.
510000	515000	Anyhow, so you have those 10 voltages that you can margin.
515000	519000	So you can tweak them around their nominal value.
519000	526000	And there's also 10 other voltages here that are fixed that you can monitor.
526000	531000	DC off, turn voltage to CPU and there's a few thermal overloads
531000	535000	and no breaker and power problem slides over here.
535000	539000	So that's the power section.
539000	547000	Next to it is actually an interesting section over here.
547000	552000	This is the storage test.
552000	559000	So you have this button here allows you to write all ones, all zeros,
560000	563000	worst patterns. I have no idea what the worst pattern is
563000	567000	or the reverse of the worst pattern into memory.
567000	573000	If you press the right button, it will write you continuously
573000	576000	and if you have also this stop on check,
576000	579000	it will stop where it finds the memory error.
579000	584000	And there are no some other optional buttons here.
584000	589000	So that's for the memory check.
589000	595000	Then there's the famous emergency pole switch.
595000	597000	So this one, I'll just do it for you.
597000	603000	Once you can pull it, but you cannot push it back without calling IBM.
603000	605000	It stays stuck in that position.
605000	609000	Actually, you have to unlock it from for the back.
609000	617000	So beneath here is another power section, which is optional.
617000	620000	So apparently this came from a bigger machine
620000	626000	and this is for the auxiliary storage power.
626000	630000	So you have four more, four more powers
630000	636000	and that's because this machine was equipped with 512K.
636000	641000	We had an extra 256K auxiliary storage, I guess.
641000	646000	I haven't double checked that, so don't kill me if I'm not exact.
646000	656000	But probably this machine was maxed out with 512K of core memory,
656000	664000	which was quite a lot at the time in 1964 was when the machine was announced.
664000	672000	So over in the little corner here is the channel test.
672000	682000	And basically that allows you to test channel instructions one by one
682000	688000	and you have the choice between the selector channel here or the multiplex channel
688000	692000	and you would just enter instruction one by one manually.
692000	699000	So channels are IO and instructions are defined by this portion here.
699000	702000	So that's the main portion.
702000	704000	Well, let's zoom in on one of them.
704000	714000	This is 144 lights that display all the CPU and channels terrace
714000	720000	and the two tops are channels and the two lower are mostly CPU.
720000	727000	And since 144 lights weren't enough, they made the rollers out of it
727000	729000	and they're controlled by those buttons on the side.
729000	733000	Let's see if I can activate one.
733000	740000	And so these are multiple position 8 per roller.
740000	748000	So you can display 8 times 144 bits on that thing.
748000	756000	And there's a little cheat sheet over here that tells you what status registers
756000	760000	or data channel registers you are looking at.
760000	766000	So that's the main diagnosis to look at the bits in the machine.
766000	777000	Down there in the middle is where you have the entry for data and addresses
777000	784000	and that's of course for manual operation and debugging.
784000	789000	So you can manually enter an address.
789000	791000	Actually, no, this is data.
791000	797000	So data is 32 bits, 4 times 8.
797000	801000	And you see that the indicators have an extra light that's parity.
801000	806000	So every byte has a parity byte and there's a weird button here.
806000	811000	And that's called actually parity reverse.
811000	816000	So parity is generated automatically but for some weird reason for debugging purposes
816000	822000	you can push this one and it will change parity.
822000	830000	And data can be either red or input and you see the lights on top.
830000	841000	And at the bottom you have the address switches which can also be used for operating the channels.
841000	849000	So you see some white markings here and there are special channels, addresses
849000	854000	when you use the blue button that I showed you before.
854000	862000	And the row of lights at the top, these are all the air lights.
862000	873000	So this row here, so the most important light is that fellow over here, the master check.
873000	879000	So if you have an error, this thing stops and then you have to figure out what went wrong.
879000	882000	So there's all kind of air lights.
882000	894000	And towards the left here there is the FLT, the fault location test lights.
894000	896000	We'll talk about them later.
901000	906000	Here you can select which memory location you work on.
906000	909000	And apparently there are four of them.
909000	915000	Main memory, local memory which I suppose is cache or equivalent to cache.
915000	922000	And multiplex and something that's called protect which I don't know yet what it is.
922000	925000	I haven't read enough.
925000	935000	Over here is a little cheat sheet to work the channel addresses which are hardwired mostly.
935000	946000	And then down here is a series of interesting switches here where you can do, that's for deep debugging here.
946000	957000	You can do tests and stop the machine or sync a nosoloscope on some special conditions.
957000	961000	So this is the instruction address match.
961000	971000	So normal is in process but you can have it stop when it matches an address that you have set in the address switches.
971000	983000	So it's the equivalent of setting a debug point in your software.
983000	988000	Then you can do the same trick with the micro instruction.
988000	992000	That's the set of switches next to it.
992000	999000	And you can do the same trick by matching a storage address compare.
999000	1007000	So you can basically put stop and break points manually by combination of those switches.
1007000	1016000	And then it will match the address that you have put in the switches over here and stop the processor.
1016000	1023000	And then there's a few more I'd like to show you.
1023000	1029000	There's of course the lamp test.
1029000	1034000	But my favorite one is the force indicator.
1034000	1044000	And I wanted really hard to be, for that to be the Star Wars switch when everything else fails you use the force.
1044000	1051000	But no it has to do with the FLTs which are the fault locator tests.
1051000	1055000	And so it's not as fast as I thought.
1055000	1067000	And so this controls how the fault locator tests work and which we are going to talk more about when we move to other section of the panel.
1067000	1073000	So here we have the counters.
1073000	1081000	So two counters. One when it's in regular mode when your machine runs and that's the one that IBM makes you pay for.
1081000	1088000	So this one has 9000 something on it and we don't know how many times it went over.
1088000	1102000	This is the CE key, customer engineer key switch that will switch it to the maintenance counter for which you won't be built.
1102000	1113000	And next over here are some of the main manual operation buttons.
1113000	1122000	So you have start and that's the button you will use to load some memory.
1122000	1127000	You push start and you load what you had put in the keys into the memory.
1127000	1134000	And then you can run the processor in the normal mode in single step.
1134000	1144000	So one instruction at a time or single cycle which I suppose is a micro instruction or part of a micro instruction at a time.
1144000	1154000	And then you can stop it and bring it in manual mode which gives you access to the other keys.
1154000	1159000	Once in stop mode so this becomes active so you can do a system reset.
1159000	1167000	You can do a PSW restart. Basically it's a reset and it starts at address 0 and loads code from there.
1167000	1176000	Check reset and that's a switch we have on the 1401 also that clears the errors.
1176000	1184000	Set IC that's one you use to set the instruction counter.
1184000	1200000	So you would put addresses over here and then press set instruction counter and it would force a jump to that instruction.
1200000	1207000	Store if that's if you want to store in a certain address.
1207000	1218000	You would put the data over the switch at the top and press store and it would load the data at the memory address at the bottom.
1218000	1221000	Displace the inverse when you read it.
1221000	1234000	And log out if I understand well is to do a dump I suspect on the printer or something like that of the state of the machine.
1234000	1245000	And here a few of the control knobs, the process control in normal, disabled stop or channel stop.
1245000	1251000	So it basically defines what the processor will do when it encounters an error.
1251000	1263000	And then there's this other one I talked about which is the FLT which is default location test.
1263000	1268000	Where you can have the machine if you put it in the FLT mode.
1268000	1282000	You can have the machine do a series of tests and you can have repeat the tests stop if it encounters a problem and other modes like this.
1282000	1296000	And what will happen is that it will go through a series of hardware hardwired tests and display the result is a pass or fail light here.
1296000	1300000	And which test it was operating etc.
1300000	1309000	So I understand it has a whole suite of hardware tests that it can do.
1309000	1319000	And then finally we are at the bottom right of the panel and that's the one the regular operator would use and not the IBM customer engineer.
1319000	1323000	And it has a big power on button and power off.
1323000	1333000	And here are the rollers or the rotary controllers for entering the address from your start device.
1333000	1342000	So which channel it is and which address on the channel and you would start your disk or your magnetic device on which you have your boot code.
1343000	1353000	And you would press load and it would boot but IBM doesn't call it boot it calls it IPL.
1353000	1364000	Initial program load and here you have the main indicator lights system when it's running.
1364000	1366000	Manual when you have stopped it.
1366000	1369000	Weight when it's in the weight state.
1369000	1375000	Test when any of the test switches like the memory or the FLT is on.
1375000	1380000	And load when it's doing IPL.
1380000	1383000	And that's it there you have it.
1383000	1390000	Of course the whole difficulty here is to understand what the registers do and there are so many of them.
1390000	1394000	It's just mind boggling.
1394000	1405000	But when you had a machine made of hundreds of thousands of parts that could and would all fail.
1405000	1419000	You needed to have that degree of test lights in them and to be able to maintain them easily.
1419000	1427000	And therefore the blink and light front panels which are still very pretty today.
1427000	1445000	So give a hand to the IBM 360 model 50 from control panel and the deal here will be to try to make a replica of the IBM CPU
1445000	1449000	and try to bring this panel to life.
1449000	1456000	And that's of course going to be a very major and long project so it's a multi-year affair here.
1456000	1463000	So for now is just a static display just for looks.
