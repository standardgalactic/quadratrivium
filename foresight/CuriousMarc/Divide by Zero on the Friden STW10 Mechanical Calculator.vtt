00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
So here's my Frieden STW-10 and today I wanted to respond to one of the most

00:10.400 --> 00:17.760
frequent comments I get which is try to divide by zero is awesome and

00:17.760 --> 00:24.160
dangerous if divide by zero does it catch fire try to divide by zero please

00:24.160 --> 00:28.680
make a division by zero and then I ask a guy to try it by himself and say I only

00:28.680 --> 00:34.040
do it on my piano which actually wouldn't help again I was kind of reluctant

00:34.040 --> 00:37.840
to do it and I had to think for a while what would happen if I did it and I

00:37.840 --> 00:43.600
convinced myself that no it wouldn't catch fire so it would be a very

00:43.600 --> 00:49.960
popular YouTube video so let's try it let's divide by zero and see what

00:49.960 --> 01:03.320
happens so let me clear everything and enter 355 as the dividend okay so we have

01:03.320 --> 01:15.360
a 355 out there there you go 355 right here and now we are going to divide by

01:15.360 --> 01:21.480
zero so I'll do a keyboard clear plump there's nothing on the keyboard and I'll

01:21.480 --> 01:27.080
hit the two buttons and we'll see what happens before that I will reset it

01:27.080 --> 01:35.400
other direction reset it here because it's more spectacular and okay off we go

01:35.400 --> 01:39.240
so it's a freedom you need to press two buttons to divide the right one and the

01:39.240 --> 01:41.520
left one

01:44.600 --> 01:51.840
and what happens that it gets into an infinite loop and will never stop and I

01:51.840 --> 01:56.960
guess it heats up so eventually it would catch fire but guess what they thought

01:56.960 --> 02:03.760
about it there's a button here it's called div stop and I guess that was made

02:03.760 --> 02:09.120
especially for idiots making YouTube videos and they had lots of foresight

02:09.120 --> 02:16.120
so this is what it does it just gets set in an infinite infinite loop but let's

02:16.120 --> 02:24.640
understand why that is so let's clear everything and I'll do a regular division

02:24.640 --> 02:39.120
though of my favorite one which gives pi 355 dividend divided by 113 and again

02:39.120 --> 02:45.600
I'll try to do it from the edge here so what happens is that in order to do

02:45.600 --> 02:51.920
divisions what it actually does is successive subtractions and does it as

02:51.920 --> 02:56.600
we do it in school is trial and error so it will try to subtract what I just

02:56.600 --> 03:03.800
entered which is 113 from this number and trying progressively know this time

03:03.800 --> 03:09.240
10, 900, 1000 until it hits over here and finally it subtracts enough of a

03:09.240 --> 03:14.480
chunk that it overflows and it tells it it has subtracted too much and then it

03:14.480 --> 03:20.160
starts to move it one to the left and subtract smaller amounts and that's how

03:20.160 --> 03:26.280
it does the division eventually so let's see how that works

03:26.280 --> 03:33.000
see it move move move move move move move ding it overflows

03:36.480 --> 03:44.240
and eventually it divide in and it's in the 3.141592 something it's the

03:44.240 --> 03:47.280
approximation of pi

04:14.240 --> 04:40.240
so what happens that when you divide by zero is just subtract nothing and so it

04:40.240 --> 04:46.280
can never overflow and it gets stuck in an infinite loop so here you go here you

04:46.280 --> 04:53.640
have it divide by zero on a Frieden STW10 let's do it again

04:53.640 --> 05:00.120
as clear enter some kind of stupid number

05:00.120 --> 05:09.200
dividend all to the right here the keyboard divide by zero and watch the

05:09.200 --> 05:11.480
smoke

05:17.680 --> 05:23.160
okay we'll do that forever good night

05:30.120 --> 05:46.740
a brilliant cast Jack Lemon in a delightful role which gives full reign to

05:46.740 --> 05:50.240
Jack's amazing versatility

06:00.120 --> 06:02.180
you
