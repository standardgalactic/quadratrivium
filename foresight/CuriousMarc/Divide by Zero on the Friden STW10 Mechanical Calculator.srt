00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
So here's my Frieden STW-10 and today I wanted to respond to one of the most

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,760
frequent comments I get which is try to divide by zero is awesome and

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,160
dangerous if divide by zero does it catch fire try to divide by zero please

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,680
make a division by zero and then I ask a guy to try it by himself and say I only

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,040
do it on my piano which actually wouldn't help again I was kind of reluctant

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,840
to do it and I had to think for a while what would happen if I did it and I

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,600
convinced myself that no it wouldn't catch fire so it would be a very

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,960
popular YouTube video so let's try it let's divide by zero and see what

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:03,320
happens so let me clear everything and enter 355 as the dividend okay so we have

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:15,360
a 355 out there there you go 355 right here and now we are going to divide by

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,480
zero so I'll do a keyboard clear plump there's nothing on the keyboard and I'll

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,080
hit the two buttons and we'll see what happens before that I will reset it

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:35,400
other direction reset it here because it's more spectacular and okay off we go

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,240
so it's a freedom you need to press two buttons to divide the right one and the

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,520
left one

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:51,840
and what happens that it gets into an infinite loop and will never stop and I

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,960
guess it heats up so eventually it would catch fire but guess what they thought

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,760
about it there's a button here it's called div stop and I guess that was made

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,120
especially for idiots making YouTube videos and they had lots of foresight

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,120
so this is what it does it just gets set in an infinite infinite loop but let's

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,640
understand why that is so let's clear everything and I'll do a regular division

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:39,120
though of my favorite one which gives pi 355 dividend divided by 113 and again

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,600
I'll try to do it from the edge here so what happens is that in order to do

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,920
divisions what it actually does is successive subtractions and does it as

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,600
we do it in school is trial and error so it will try to subtract what I just

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,800
entered which is 113 from this number and trying progressively know this time

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,240
10, 900, 1000 until it hits over here and finally it subtracts enough of a

28
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,480
chunk that it overflows and it tells it it has subtracted too much and then it

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,160
starts to move it one to the left and subtract smaller amounts and that's how

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,280
it does the division eventually so let's see how that works

31
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,000
see it move move move move move move move ding it overflows

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,240
and eventually it divide in and it's in the 3.141592 something it's the

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,280
approximation of pi

34
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:40,240
so what happens that when you divide by zero is just subtract nothing and so it

35
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,280
can never overflow and it gets stuck in an infinite loop so here you go here you

36
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,640
have it divide by zero on a Frieden STW10 let's do it again

37
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,120
as clear enter some kind of stupid number

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:09,200
dividend all to the right here the keyboard divide by zero and watch the

39
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,480
smoke

40
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,160
okay we'll do that forever good night

41
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:46,740
a brilliant cast Jack Lemon in a delightful role which gives full reign to

42
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,240
Jack's amazing versatility

43
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,180
you
