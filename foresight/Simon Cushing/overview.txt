Checking Simon Cushing/Quine： Two Dogmas of Empiricism.txt
 The indeterminacy of translation is a philosophical thesis proposed by W.V.O. Quine, which argues that in many cases, we cannot definitively determine the correct translation of statements or words from one language to another. This is due to the underdetermination of theory by data—our observations alone cannot uniquely determine a particular interpretation or meaning.

Quine's argument relies on several key points:

1. **Behaviorism**: In language acquisition, we rely solely on observable behavior (stimulus-response) because we are not telepathic and cannot directly access others' mental states.

2. **Economy of Mental Effort**: We tend to choose the simplest explanations for others' behavior that work, based on our pragmatic interests (ease of use, communication efficiency).

3. **The Rabbit-Rabbit Part Problem**: Quine uses the example of 'Gavagai', which could mean either 'rabbit' or 'undetached rabbit part'. This demonstrates that certain terms can have extensionally equivalent uses but inconsistent meanings, and there is no clear way to decide which interpretation is correct based on observable behavior alone.

4. **Indeterminacy of Reference**: The meaning of words is not fixed; it can shift as our understanding of the world changes. This leads to the conclusion that translation from one language to another cannot be objectively right or wrong because there are often several consistent but mutually exclusive ways to translate between languages.

5. **Holism**: Meanings of words are not determined by individual sentences but by their role within the entire system of beliefs and practices (the "web of belief"). This means that changing one part of this web can affect our understanding of other parts, leading to indeterminacy.

Quine's thesis was groundbreaking and controversial, as it challenges the traditional notion of meaning and suggests that translation is an underdetermined problem. His views have been widely debated and have influenced various fields in philosophy, particularly the philosophy of language and epistemology. While Quine's influence has waned somewhat from his mid-century peak, his ideas remain significant in philosophical discourse.

 The discussion revolves around the nature of epistemology, particularly the relationship between normative and descriptive aspects of knowledge within the field. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Evolutionary Epistemology**: Our perceptual abilities, such as detecting movement off to the side, are shaped by evolution and affect how we view the world. This illustrates how our senses have normative implications for how we understand knowledge.

2. **Normative vs. Descriptive Epistemology**: Traditionally, epistemology has been seen as a branch of philosophy that provides norms or standards to evaluate claims in other spheres of knowledge (metaphysics, ethics). However, with the advent of naturalized epistemology, which is part of science, the question arises whether it can still serve this normative role.

3. **Naturalized Epistemology**: This approach to epistemology is concerned with how knowledge is actually acquired and doesn't make value judgments about the content of knowledge itself. It provides standards based on scientific rigor.

4. **The Role of Science**: Science is interested in facts, not values. It can tell us why humans are violent, for example, but doesn't judge whether this is good or bad.

5. **Quine's Perspective**: According to W.V.O. Quine, we cannot step outside our own "intellectual cage" (a la Noam Chomsky's thought experiment with a brain in a vat) to objectively judge epistemology. We are bound by the conditions of our knowledge acquisition.

6. **The Persistence of Traditional Epistemology**: Despite Quine's arguments, traditional epistemology persists alongside naturalized epistemology, forming a larger, more complex field of inquiry.

7. **The Ghetier Problem**: This problem presents scenarios where it is unclear whether knowledge can be claimed based on deduction from true premises. For example, if you know that if either (Birch is in Warren and Warren is in Ghent) or (Warren is in Ghent), then Birch is in Ghent; you know that if Birch is not in Ghent, then Warren is not in Ghent; Birch is not in Ghent; and Warren is not in Ghent, can you deduce that Birch is not in Warren? The Ghetier problem challenges epistemologists to clarify what additional information or conditions are necessary for knowledge claims.

In summary, the discussion touches on the evolutionary basis of human perception, the normative function of epistemology, and the challenges posed by the Ghetier problem in understanding the nature of knowledge. Naturalized epistemology offers a scientifically grounded approach to understanding knowledge acquisition, but it must coexist with traditional epistemological concerns that deal with norms and standards for knowledge claims.
