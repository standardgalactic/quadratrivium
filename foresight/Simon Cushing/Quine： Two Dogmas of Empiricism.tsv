0	8600	So we're going to talk now about one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century,
8600	20720	certainly most important of the American philosophers, W. V. O. Willard Van Orman Quine.
20720	32400	He is an interesting figure. He sort of marks the transition from logical positivism into
32400	40720	post-positivism. In that, he has a lot of sympathies with the logical positivists. There
40720	48200	are some assumptions that the positivists had that he shares, and some would say that makes
48200	56360	his view archaic, because some of the things that he retains from logical positivism say
56360	66440	his critics, you shouldn't. They should be rejected. But at the same time, his view, and in
66440	76080	particular a very famous article, if you had to rank the top analytic philosophy articles of the
76080	84240	20th century, two dogmas of empiricism by W. V. O. Quine would be in the top five. It certainly
84240	95760	was seen as a huge bombshell and was cited and discussed massively in the years after its release
95840	107640	in the 50s. And in that paper, he basically attacks logical positivism. Now, reading that
107640	117160	paper is very difficult. Quine, in general, writes, I think, beautifully, but does not
117160	127040	write clearly. He writes as if his audience is very knowledgeable. It's like coming in
127040	133320	in the middle of a conversation, a very erudite conversation, and it's very easy to get lost.
133640	147760	And what also makes it hard is that Quine's whole philosophy is a big system. There are some
147760	154360	philosophical papers that just stand alone, that are talking about a specific topic and making
154360	158680	specific points about this specific topic. In fact, probably the majority of philosophy papers
158680	167640	in journals are like that. Whereas each of Quine's papers is just a small picture, a small window
167640	171720	onto a giant picture, which is his whole theory. And it's got all of these elements to hang
171720	179800	together. Probably the best thing to read to get his theory, or at least the theory, the most
179880	188880	famous version of the theory, is his 1960 book, Word and Object, which, of course, came after
188880	194720	two dogmas of empiricism, and perhaps goes even further down the road that two dogmas
194720	203720	went down. But he writes articles, he writes books, and they're all sort of little pieces
203720	210240	of this giant picture. The other thing that kind of makes him a distinctive figure about
210240	217240	the 20th century is that he stretched almost exactly the length of the 20th century. He
217240	226000	was born in 1908, died in 1999, I believe I'm right in saying, and was still publishing
226000	235800	up until the end. For example, this book Pursuit of Truth, which is more accessible than many
235800	243120	of his books, although it's a slim volume, was published in the early 90s, the second
243120	250400	edition I think 1992. And it's still beautifully written. I think I'm going to read you the
250400	256640	beginning sentence of this to give you some idea of, because it sort of hints at a lot
256640	263440	of the themes in Quine. From impacts on our sensory surfaces, we in our collective and
263440	269560	cumulative creativity down the generations have projected our systematic theory of the
269560	275960	external world. Our system is proving successful in predicting subsequent sensory input. How
275960	284560	have we done it? Okay, that hints at a lot of themes in Quine. One of them, and perhaps
284560	292400	the most important, is naturalism. Now for Quine, naturalism is the idea that there is
292400	301280	sort of a single theory of the world. There aren't really separate disciplines. So if
301280	309040	you do philosophy of science, there's a debate about whether or not the hard sciences are
309040	318160	doing something different in kind from the softer sciences. And is history a social science?
318160	322240	Are social sciences sciences? You get into all these debates and people draw lines and
322240	330680	so on. For Quine, it's much simpler than that. It's an overall theory of the world.
330680	338960	Now so it's a matter of decree. Philosophy isn't a separate thing. It's part of this
338960	347400	whole approach and the point of our total theory of the world is to work from inputs
347400	353640	to make predictions, to explain the inputs and to make predictions about future inputs.
353640	361200	And of course, this is something he shares with the logical positivists, a keenness for
361200	367760	science. The logical positivists, as I said, were writing in a time when Einstein was alive
367760	373360	and making new contributions, quantum mechanics, all that stuff. Incredibly exciting time where
373360	379360	science was making advances by leaps and bounds and it seemed to the logical positivists that
379400	388120	philosophy was kind of stultifying. It was stuck, it hadn't made progress. So that's why they came
388120	396200	up with their verificationist criterion of meaning that in order to be meaningful, something must
396200	403200	be, it must be clear what kind of sentences about the world, what kind of statements about the
403200	412200	world, facts about the world, contributes to its truth or falsity. So if nothing about the world
412200	417080	affects whether or not a sentence you're saying is true or false, then either, according to the
417080	424080	logical positivists, you're stating an analytic truth that is true in virtue of the meanings of
424080	432480	the words contained within, like all bachelors are unmarried, or you're stating nonsense. And as
432560	438680	we saw, the logical positivists thought that huge swathes of what had been counted respectable
438680	445800	academic discussion were in fact nonsense and bullshit and should be trashed. In this, they
445800	452320	were following David Hume, who'd made a very similar claim centuries before. But for example,
452320	459880	so to give an example, AJ Air, who was our sort of English language popularizer of logical
459880	468280	positivism, says that he's not an atheist, because an atheist believe that God does not exist is a
468280	474480	meaningful sentence, whereas he Air doesn't think that any talk of God is meaningful, because it
474480	483400	fails the verification standard, you cannot, there are no facts about the world that would refute,
483640	494560	that would affect either positively or negatively the truth of God exists. Okay, so part of the
495240	505960	positivist project rests on these distinctions that we've, we've come across before. There's a set of
505960	513080	pairs of distinctions that are have been seen as very significant down through the history of
513080	520880	Western philosophy. There's analytic versus synthetic. This is to do with meaning. And for
520880	531160	the logical positivists, as for thinkers before them, analytic sentences are ones that are true
531160	540280	million virtue of the words involved. And that, so for example, Air would say, experience is
540280	547000	relevant to the confirmation of individual synthetic statements, like grass is green, but
547000	557680	not analytic sentences, like all bachelors are unmarried. So, in other words, synthetic statements
557680	567120	are ones that are actually saying something about the world, because they can be verified or falsified
567480	576080	by facts about the world, whereas analytic statements are not. So, this kind of robbs analytic
576080	585280	statements of some significance, because they're like true by definition. Now, the positivists
585280	591200	didn't think that this was necessarily a bad thing, because they thought that math, all the
591240	598160	statements of math were analytic. And in fact, they said that what philosophy was doing was trying
598160	606720	to find interesting analytic truths. So, philosophers still had a job to do. Philosophy wasn't
606720	613520	nonsense, like theology, for example. But its role was limited to talking about analytic truths,
613520	619560	because the scientists were dealing with synthetic truths. Scientists had the best equipment for
619600	626840	testing the world and coming up with new claims about the world, like electrons exist or something
626840	639480	like that. So, there's this clean divide between sentences whose meaning is unaffected by facts
639480	646040	about the world, because its meaning is solely dependent on the words that make it up, true by
646040	651120	definition, and sentences that are actually meaningful, because they're saying something
651120	656640	about the world. This is the analytic synthetic distinction, and it is the first of the two
656640	669920	dogmas of empiricism that Quine is attacking. But notice, as I said, he actually agrees with the
670280	677600	positivists about a lot of things. For example, Quine is a huge fan of science. Science is perhaps
677600	686600	the most important part of this total theory of the world. But where he disagrees with the
686600	692320	logical positivists is this, in this idea that there's a clear dividing line. Here's science,
692320	699440	here's philosophy. Science is doing empirical stuff, philosophy is doing analytic stuff. And in
699440	709400	fact, because he denies that there's a distinction, Quine has interesting ideas about the way
709400	719400	philosophy should proceed. A famous work of his is called epistemology naturalized. Epistemology
719400	725000	is a branch of philosophy that typically has been concerned with questions of knowledge. That's
725120	734520	what epistemology is about. What can we know? And a lot of epistemology before Quine was devoted
734520	740320	to sort of analyzing the notion of knowledge. What is it to know something and coming up with a
740320	747680	definition of knowledge? Quine is not interested in that in tall. He says that epistemology should
747680	756600	be about sort of more nitty gritty issues like how it is that children learn a theory of the
756600	765760	world. It should be like a branch of science where we're studying how humans acquire information. So
765760	774400	it should be done like science. It is naturalized. In other words, it is a branch of what we would
774440	782560	normally call science. And part of that follows from him denying that there is a clear distinction
782560	788280	between analytic and synthetic. So that's one pair, analytic, synthetic. That's to do with,
788280	797640	that's a semantic distinction between how the meanings of sentences are determined. According
797640	806160	to the positivists with their verification standard, analytic sentences are not verified by
806160	812600	experience. They're true by definition. Synthetic sentences are verified by experience. Okay,
812600	821040	there are two other related distinctions. There's the a priori versus a posteriori. This is an
821040	827720	epistemological distinction. That is, so knowledge a priori is supposedly knowledge that you have
827720	834360	without any experience. Now, if you've taken an early modern class, you will notice that there's a
834360	843600	big divide between the empiricists like Locke, Barkley and Hume, who minimize the amount of a
843600	850120	priori truth to essentially nothing. They say we are born tabula rasa, which is Latin for blank
850200	858440	slate. We don't know anything. And everything we all the knowledge we have is we have to have
858440	869080	acquired by sensory inputs. So empiricism is the idea that the important knowledge comes from
869080	875880	experience comes from sensory inputs. Quine is an empiricist, even though he's talking about two
875880	881840	dogmas of empiricism, that doesn't mean that he's saying empiricism is what's bad. He's saying,
881840	887640	these things that empiricists have believed have held back empiricism. And in fact, we should get
887640	895560	rid of these dogmas and we will improve empiricism. So he's a big fan of empiricism. And that's clear
895560	903800	actually from that opening sentence that I just read you. I will read it to you again. He says,
904720	913720	from impacts on our sensory surfaces, we in our collective and cumulative creativity down the
913720	919360	generations have projected our systematic theory of the external world. So you know,
919360	926560	that's an empiricist statement. It says that where we get our information is impacts on our sensory
926560	937360	surfaces. So a priori versus a posteriori seems to be it's a different distinction than
937360	943960	analytic synthetic. Analytics synthetic is about meanings. A priori versus a posteriori is about
943960	954680	knowledge, how we can know things. But with some rare exceptions like Kant, they're taken to track
954720	960840	each other. So it was it was assumed that all a priori truths were at analytic truths and vice
960840	968640	versa. And the third distinction is sometimes called a metaphysical distinction. It's a fact
968640	976680	about the world. And it's a distinction between necessary and contingent. So a necessary truth
976680	983320	is one that cannot possibly be false. And a contingent truth is one that is in fact true,
983360	989880	but could be otherwise. So grass is green, of course, is is contingently true. It is true. But
989880	996960	there is no contradiction in imagining blue grass that that isn't a contradiction in terms. So you
996960	1003920	can see that this is very close to the idea of analytic. A contradiction in terms is is how we
1003920	1010840	would explain the denying an analytic truth. Alright, so we've got these three pairs. Analytics
1010880	1021440	synthetic, a priori, a posteriori, and necessary and contingent. And the a post the synthetic,
1021440	1032360	a posteriori and contingent are taken to all overlap. And the analytic, a priori, and necessary
1032360	1039440	are taken to all overlap. But there has to be a distinction between them for the logical positive
1039480	1048800	ists project to go through, because they want to make this clear dividing line between sentences
1048800	1054400	that actually say stuff about the real world, and the kind of stuff that math and philosophy does.
1054400	1063080	It's still valuable, but it's different in kind from what natural science does. So these claims
1063680	1075000	are held by the logical positivists. The logical positivists actually make one further claim about
1075000	1082640	these three pairs of concepts. They claim that the most basic of the three pairs is the analytic
1082640	1088640	synthetic, and that you can explain the other two in terms of that. So all necessary and a
1088680	1095160	priori truths are analytic. An analytic, analyticity is needed to explain necessity. In other words,
1095160	1102920	so not only they're not just claiming that all three overlap, they're also claiming that one of
1102920	1112160	them is explanatorily prior. So analyticity is the key that explains, it's the foundation that
1112200	1125080	explains necessary and a priori. So if you believe that, then it better be the case that you can
1125080	1136000	give an account of analyticity that is independent of your account of necessity and a priori city,
1136840	1144360	because you're saying that what explains necessity and a priori city is analyticity. So you better
1144360	1150200	not do it in reverse, otherwise you're doing circular reasoning. And that is exactly what
1150200	1157560	Quine said is going on. Quine in the early sections of this paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism,
1158520	1167200	actually says, okay, let's see if we can come up with the independent explanation of what it is to
1167200	1174880	be analytic that the positivists need in order to explain the other two and in order to make this
1174880	1187160	clear cut distinction. And he says, okay, analyticity, an analytic truth is one that, well,
1187240	1191680	an obvious example of an analytic truth, particularly if you're a big fan of logic, which
1191680	1200760	Quine was actually Quine wrote his dissertation on Russell and Whitehead's famous book,
1200760	1209120	Principia Mathematica, which is practically all logic. So Quine was a made contributions to
1209120	1216960	logic, and that's how he started out. So big fan of logic. He says, well, the best candidate for
1217160	1231000	analyticity is logical truth, because it's clear that P or not P is true by definition. That is,
1231000	1239800	P or not P is something that is true in all possible circumstances. Because if you assume as
1240760	1248520	Quine does and as logic, certainly the logic that he was dealing with does, that P has to be true
1248520	1256480	or false. Well, even if you don't know the truth of P, P has to be true or false, and not P has to
1256480	1262880	be the opposite. And in a disjunction, if one of them is true, then the whole thing is true. But in
1262880	1269440	P or not P, one of them has to be true, because P is either true, in which case, it's true and the
1269440	1274800	whole disjunction is true, or P is false, in which case not P is true, in which case the whole
1274800	1282640	disjunction is true. So that's known as a logical tautology, something that has to be true. If that's
1282640	1287960	what analyticity was, then we do have a coherent notion of it. But the trouble is that's a very
1287960	1295440	narrow set of sentences. And that doesn't include things like all bachelor's are unmarried, because
1295560	1306880	that's not P or not P. So for that to count as also like a logical truth, you need to be able to
1306880	1314120	translate statements like all bachelor's are unmarried into a logical truth, which it isn't so
1314120	1321560	far. All bachelor's are unmarried is not on its face a logical truth, a tautology. But you, if you
1321560	1330520	can translate it into one, then that logical truth or anything translatable into a logical truth
1330520	1339120	would be the kind of explanation of analyticity that the positivists could use, and it would save
1339120	1346160	their project. The trouble is, in order to translate something like all bachelor's are unmarried
1346200	1352760	into a logical truth, you need the notion of synonymy. You need to be able to say, well,
1353000	1362760	bachelor means the same as unmarried man. So you need a notion of synonymy. So in other words,
1362760	1369080	before you can explain necessary and a priori in terms of analyticity, you need to explain
1369080	1375880	analyticity in terms of synonymy. But it better not be the case that synonymy is relying on a
1375920	1380400	notion of necessity and a priori. Otherwise, you've still got the circle going on, and you haven't
1380440	1390200	explained any of them. It's a bit like there's a famous story about a dictionary that has a
1390200	1398960	definition of grass that says grass is the stuff that grazing animals eat. So suppose you want
1398960	1403240	to know, is wheat a grass? I better look up the definition of grass. So you look up the definition
1403240	1411720	of grass. Grass is what grazing animals eat. Have you learned what grass is yet? Well, it depends
1411720	1418040	on the definition of grazing. So you look up grazing and it says eating grass. You haven't
1418040	1423320	learned anything because it's circular. If the same thing is happening with analyticity and
1423320	1430720	necessity and a priori, a priori city, then none of them have been explained and they're empty
1430720	1438640	concepts, according to quite. Okay, so here's the suggestion. We can explain analyticity as logic
1438760	1444640	cultures or sentences that can be translated into logical truths. Well, the idea of translation
1444640	1448880	requires synonymy, because if you're going to translate one sentence into another, they have to
1448880	1457480	be synonymous. Okay, what's synonymy? Well, here's a promising suggestion for synonymy. Synonymy is
1457480	1468720	intersubstitutivity salva veritate. This is Leibniz's phrase. It means two phrases are are
1468720	1475880	synonymous. If for any sentence that is true, you can replace one of the phrases with the other
1475960	1482480	without affecting the truth value of the sentences. So all unmarried men are unmarried. Take out
1482600	1487640	unmarried man replaced by bachelor and you get all bachelor's unmarried. And it looks like you
1487640	1493280	don't change the truth value of the sentence. So it looks like, hey, we've got we've got something
1493280	1500240	here. We've got a standard for explaining synonymy, which we can then use to explain analyticity,
1500240	1505800	which we can use to explain these other two. The trouble is, as coin says, you've got to make a
1505800	1512240	distinction between sentences of what's called an extensional language, like logic, logic is an
1512280	1524280	extensional language. That is, extensional means, well, it just meaning is explained in terms of
1524320	1533240	reference. So for example, logic explains what green is, extensionally. So if you talk about a
1533240	1540800	predicate in logic, like green, all that there is to the predicate green is not some notion of
1540800	1546320	greenness, but rather all the green things. So what is the meaning of green in an extensional
1546320	1554960	language? It's all the green things. The trouble with that is two terms that we would say are not
1555000	1564760	synonymous, have the same extension, that is, the same group of objects are covered by them. So
1564760	1573120	according to an extensional theory, they mean the same. But renate, which means having kidneys and
1573120	1578440	coordinate, which means having a heart, are true of the same group of animals. All the animals that
1578440	1587800	are renate are coordinate. So this notion of synonymy would produce the result that renate is
1587800	1593000	synonymous with coordinate. And of course, it isn't. We know that renate and coordinate mean two
1593000	1600200	different things. Creature with a heart is different from creature with a kidneys. So this
1600440	1605600	would if this worked, it would solve the problem because this is an independent non circular
1605600	1612840	definition of synonymy. Trouble is, it doesn't explain our concept of synonymy. Well, so you an
1612840	1620920	extensional language doesn't work. What about an intentional language? Extensional intentional, it's
1620920	1625760	like the distinction like Frager's distinction between sense and reference. Reference is
1625760	1632200	extensional, sense is intentional. Well, intentional languages like English, English is
1632200	1642240	intentional, have these contexts called modal contexts that use like it is necessary that. So if
1642240	1651480	we're allowed to use intersubstitutivity into intentional languages, then renate and coordinate
1651520	1661040	are not intersubstitutional salva veritate. Because it is not true, it is true that it is
1661040	1665760	necessary that all coordinates are coordinate. That's true. But if you take out coordinate and
1665760	1671880	replace it with renate, it is not true that it is necessary that all renates are coordinate. Because
1671920	1677960	it's possible, we can imagine an animal with a heart but no kidneys. There aren't any in the real
1677960	1686480	world, which is what an extensional language deals with, but we can imagine one possibly. So this,
1686520	1693400	if we're allowed to use intentional concepts, then not only does synonymy is intersubstitutivity
1693440	1700280	salva veritate appear to give an independent definition of, of analyticity, which we need. But
1700280	1705080	it also appears to match our notion, our intuitive notion of synonymy, because it says, it says the
1705080	1710160	bachelor and unmarried man are synonymous, but renate and coordinate aren't, gives the right
1710160	1719080	results. But of course, it uses the notion of necessity, which is supposedly being explained by
1719080	1729160	analyticity. So it's circular. So you're, you face a dilemma in trying to explain synonymy. Either
1729160	1735080	you come up with this version of synonymy that doesn't match what we want it to, which Quine is
1735080	1740480	going to say, actually, that's your best bet. This, if we're going to use the notion of synonymy, this
1740480	1747600	is the best you can do, which is going to produce some very radical effects that is related to as
1747640	1754760	indeterminacy of translation, as we'll see in a second. Or you, you try and get it closer to our
1754760	1760200	intuitive notion, but then you've still got the circle. So consequently, we should abandon this
1760200	1769080	analytic-synthetic distinction. We cannot make a clear distinction. Now, Grace and Strawson, whom
1769080	1778240	we've come across, this is Paul Grace and Peter Strawson, or HP Grace and PF Strawson, as they're
1778240	1785000	usually known, who are part of the ordinary language school, which is flourishing in Oxford at the
1785000	1791440	same time that Quine is writing. Now, the ordinary language school in Oxford is influenced by the
1791440	1798800	later Wittgenstein. The later Wittgenstein of the philosophical investigations in the Blue and
1798800	1808800	Brown books and various others rejects most of what the early Wittgenstein of the Traktatus says.
1809680	1815360	But it's the early Wittgenstein of the Traktatus who is very influential on the logical positivists. So
1815360	1821840	if you follow all that, you can see that Grace and Strawson are no fans of logical positivism. However,
1822720	1831360	they retain these claims of logical positivism, because even though they reject the verificationist
1831360	1838880	theory of meaning, and for example, Grace has his account of meaning in terms of Uttara's intentions,
1841440	1847360	and in general, they talk about meaning as something that humans do. That's Strawson's notion of
1847360	1853760	referring rather than denoting, where Russell talks about denoting, which is what sentences do.
1853760	1859760	Strawson talks about referring, which is what people do. So they're no fans of logical positivism,
1859760	1868000	and yet they do share these two claims. I'm drawing on the work of Scott Somes in saying this. In fact,
1868960	1874240	I'm presenting you Scott Somes' analysis from his book on analytic philosophy.
1878160	1887760	I'll say a little bit about his suggestion for an alternative version of synonymy that appears to
1888720	1894400	not rely on necessity, and therefore might appear to dodge the circle. We can talk about that in a
1894400	1900480	minute. But anyway, Grace and Strawson write this famous paper, A Defense of a Dogma, and the dogma
1900480	1907680	they're talking about is the first one, the analytic-synthetic distinction. Because when
1909200	1915120	Quine produces this argument against analytic-synthetic distinction, it's incredibly radical,
1915120	1922400	because this is a distinction that it has been agreed on for hundreds of years, and hundreds of
1922400	1928160	very different philosophers, the empiricists and the rationalists, have agreed on this distinction,
1929040	1934000	that you can distinguish clearly between analytic truths and synthetic truths. It's just
1934880	1942720	there's an obvious and very useful distinction. And they say, look, so now all you've done, Quine,
1942720	1948880	is you've shown at best what you've shown is that you can't define analytic without using
1948880	1957040	necessary or vice versa, and the same for a priori-city. In other words, they're sort of in
1957040	1963120	a circle. But just because you can't define them without getting out of a circle doesn't mean
1965040	1971680	that there aren't obvious examples of analytic truths and obvious examples of necessary truths.
1971680	1978400	So maybe we can't define them, but we can point to, okay, I can't give a good definition of it,
1978400	1985440	but I know that that's one and that's the other. This is very similar to a classic quote from a
1985440	1994240	Supreme Court justice, where a case came up about whether a particular piece of artwork was art or
1994240	1999600	pornography. And if it's art, it's protected by the First Amendment, and if it's pornography,
1999600	2004400	it's not protected. So you need to be able to distinguish between art and pornography. Both
2004480	2010080	of them can involve nudity, both of them can involve depicting sex acts. So how do you distinguish
2010080	2017040	it? And famously, the Supreme Court justice says, I know it when I see it. So what he's saying is
2017040	2022000	exactly what Gries and Strawson are saying, even if we can't give a good definition of it, that
2022000	2026240	doesn't mean there isn't a difference. I know that that's pornography and that's art. I know that
2026240	2032320	that's analytic and that's synthetic. And they point to not just the fact that there has been
2032320	2039040	consistent usage of these, but also that you can teach them to students and say this is an analytic
2039040	2044160	and this is synthetic. Got it now? Okay, and then you can give them new examples that they haven't
2044160	2051040	encountered before, and they all sort them into the same groups. So clearly, they have mastered
2051040	2059280	a concept that they can apply to novel instances, and they all reproduce the same results, which is
2059280	2064240	good evidence that it's a genuine concept. Because if it was just made up bullshit,
2064240	2068480	then they would be getting it ran, they wouldn't get the same distinctions, they would just
2069200	2075120	process them randomly. But they have mastered something. And of course, this is very important
2075120	2080400	if you believe as the later Wittgenstein did, and so Gries and Strawson were influenced by that,
2080400	2085520	that meaning is use. If they can use it in the same way, then it is a meaningful distinction.
2086080	2094240	And the other point that they make is that if you get rid of the notion of synonymy,
2094240	2098320	as Quine is doing here, as part of his attack on analyticity,
2099280	2106080	this is much more radical than Quine lets on in two dogmas, because it appears to undermine
2106080	2113760	the very notion of meaning itself. Because if you can't say, what is it to say that
2113760	2121760	two things are synonymous, they mean the same. If there is no notion of synonymy,
2121760	2127200	then there is no notion of means the same as. And if there's no notion of means the same as,
2127200	2133680	then we can't say what something means. Because if we could say what something means,
2133680	2138320	then there would be a notion of means the same as. Because if we can say what this means,
2139280	2145360	what this means, then we could explain synonymy in the terms of, well those things both mean
2145360	2150880	the same. So if we haven't got synonymy, that shows that we can't have meaning, because if we
2150880	2158720	did have meaning, we'd have synonymy. So if there's no synonymy, there is no meaning, and that's just
2158720	2164480	absurd, say Gries and Strawson. So there must be something wrong with your argument attacking
2164480	2171680	this distinction, quine. Well, hold my beer, says quine, except he didn't, because that
2172320	2180000	cliche hadn't come up then. And quine's more of a martini drinker. He was a pretty heavy drinker,
2180000	2185680	I'm told, but yeah, it would have been martinis. I mean, he's picked your quine as the madman
2186000	2192400	era. He was very much into wearing suits and drinking martinis. Anyway,
2194880	2203440	after, so two dogmas comes out early 50s, this comes out as a response. And then in 1960,
2203440	2212400	quine publishes Word and Object, where he makes clear his theory of indeterminacy of translation.
2212400	2220400	We'll talk about that in a little bit. But let me just, before we leave this
2221680	2227120	attack on the first dogma, Somes, in the chapter where he's talking about the first
2227120	2234560	chapter, where the chapter where he's talking about this dogma, he suggests quine has ignored a
2234560	2240320	possible definition of synonymy. Instead of using the context, it is necessary that, which of course
2240320	2247840	relies on necessary and maintains the circle, you could say x believes that. So for example,
2250160	2259360	the other thing with it is necessary that is some necessary truths don't appear to be
2259760	2272000	the analytic truths, because analytic truths appear to be narrower than necessary truth. Now,
2272000	2281440	in saying this, Somes is denying that analyticity and necessity match up exactly. So he's abandoning
2281440	2292240	these. And the reason why quine didn't consider this is because he and the positivists basically
2292240	2299360	shared these assumptions. But what Somes is suggesting is that if we give up the idea that
2299360	2309280	analyticity and necessity perfectly match up, then we can come up with a definition in terms of
2309280	2317520	believes that. I should give some context here. Quine publishes where an object in 1960. Quine
2317520	2325760	basically rules the 60s, but in 1970, Kripke comes on the scene and Kripke in the lectures
2326400	2330800	that he gives in 1970 that are published in 1980 as the book naming a necessity,
2331440	2338080	gives an account of necessity that marks it as completely independent from analyticity and
2338080	2345440	a priori. And in fact, Kripke argues that they don't line up neatly and argues that you can have
2346080	2353280	a posteriori necessary truths. So that goes across the divide. Like, for example,
2353280	2359760	Hesperus is phosphorus. That is, the morning star, the thing that the Greeks named Hesperus,
2359760	2364800	which is the evening star, is the same thing that the Greeks named phosphorus, which is the
2364800	2370640	morning star. They're both the planet Venus. That is something that has to be learned a posteriori.
2370640	2376560	You can't know that a priori without experience. And yet it is a necessary truth according to
2376560	2382080	Kripke's account. And Kripke's account was very influential and Somes clearly agrees with it.
2383040	2391040	So it's no problem if we end up with a concept of analyticity that is narrower than necessity.
2391920	2401200	Now, he says X believes blank. So if, is it true that X believes that renate,
2402880	2409280	that, you know, X believes that renates are renate? That's true. X believes that renates
2409280	2415360	are chordate. That's false. So that produces the right result that renate and chordate are not
2416160	2425520	synonymous. But the trouble with this is, if we allow X believes that, these are called
2425520	2435360	propositional attitude contexts, it will remove a lot of the truths of mathematics from being
2435360	2442320	analytic truths. And it will also remove anything interesting as an analytic truth because X is
2442320	2449920	only going to believe that, you know, something is substituted, you're only going to get exactly
2449920	2457360	the same result in these contexts for things that the average person can instantly see are the same.
2458000	2465920	So in other words, you're not even going to get like two to the power eight and 256 as
2466640	2476160	synonymous, because not everybody can understand that. So they don't, they understand 256, but
2476160	2483360	they won't know that that's replaceable in all instances with two to the power eight.
2484240	2490400	So this is going to produce a much narrower range of analytic truths. And as the positivists
2490400	2497200	wanted to reserve a lot of interesting and surprising analytic truths as the province of
2497200	2503280	philosophy, all of those would kind of disappear under this version of analyticity and philosophy,
2503280	2509120	the role that was set aside for philosophy would just vanish under this definition.
2511040	2519200	Okay, dogma number two, the second of the two dogmas of empiricism, radical reductionism.
2520800	2526080	And it's very much related to the idea of synthetic truths. So a synthetic truth
2526080	2534720	is one that can be falsified by experience. Now, this will include a lot of the generalizations
2534720	2547840	of science, which are not necessarily immediately falsifiable. So obviously, testable synthetic
2547840	2558400	propositions are, you know, that that dog is brown, because you can go and examine the dog
2558400	2566560	closely to see what color it is. But generalizations of science, f equals ma are going to require
2568240	2574720	a set of other conditions that specify the appropriate conditions for experimentally
2574720	2580800	testing them. And it's only when you add all of those assumptions to the claim f equals ma
2580800	2592240	that you that it becomes testable. However, what what the positivists thought is that basically
2592240	2598160	you could take a synthetic claim, add a bunch of other analytic claims. So have the synthetic
2598160	2604880	claim plus a bunch of other things. And it will logically imply something that if we can observe
2604880	2612000	the negation of that, then that will falsify the synthetic claim. And because it can be falsified
2612000	2618160	or confirmed, it is a synthetic truth, it is susceptible to being tested by experience.
2619200	2624880	So someone like air would say, and this is again taken from Somes, experience is relevant to the
2624880	2633120	confirmation of individual synthetic but not analytic sentences. Now, Quine says, Quine points out
2633120	2639200	that the logical positivists are the heirs of the empiricists, the British empiricists like
2639200	2647440	Locke, Barkley and Hume. And the British empiricist says the meanings of individual terms are our
2647440	2654000	sensory experiences. So something like red is explained in terms of our sensory experiences.
2654000	2662160	What the logical positivists did that was an advance on those 18th century thinkers is say that
2662160	2672240	it's not the individual words that are testable, that are the meaning of which we learn from our
2672240	2681760	experience, it's sentences. And that's important, because an obvious problem for empiricists is
2681760	2689680	what about words that don't talk about the world, what about and and or and things like that. If
2689680	2694960	you're going to say to be meaningful, they have to be susceptible, they have to be testable by
2694960	2705920	experience, what do you do with that? So the logical positivists and under the influence of
2705920	2714640	someone like Russell have come up with ways to explain the meanings, an extra way to explain the
2714640	2722080	meanings, role that they play in in sentences. But still, the unit of meaning is the sentence.
2722080	2728320	So according to the logical positivists, words have meaning merely because of the role they play
2728320	2735600	in a sentence. And if you remember Russell's theory of descriptions said that his analysis of a
2735600	2742880	definite description like the king of France didn't have meaning by itself in abstraction,
2744000	2750560	because it doesn't actually pick out anything in the real world. It only had meaning when it you
2750560	2757920	put it in a sentence. So in other words, the meaning of a term is acquired from the sentence.
2757920	2766080	It's the sentence that is the vehicle of meaning. Quine says good advance logical positivists on
2766080	2771440	going from words as the unit of meaning to sentences as the unit of meaning, but you didn't go far
2771440	2777520	enough. In fact, the unit of meaning is not individual sentences. It's our entire theory of
2777520	2782720	the world. That is the thing that's meaningful and sentences insofar as they're meaningful
2783360	2788800	acquire that meaning in the context of the entire theory. So just as the positivists said
2788800	2795440	words acquire meaning in the context of a sentence. So Quine says sentences acquire meaning in the
2795440	2802320	context of the theory itself. This is part of his holism, which I'm going to explain in a bit more
2802320	2807840	detail. All right. So Ayer says experience the relevance to the confirmation of individual
2807840	2813600	synthetic but not analytic sentences. Quine, of course, has said that we can't make this
2813600	2823600	distinction. And in fact, it is it is never experienced is never relevant to the confirmation
2823600	2830960	of individual sentences. Experiences relevant to the confirmation of the total theory. So we have
2830960	2838960	a total theory of the world that makes predictions about the world. And experience is relevant to
2838960	2849040	the confirmation of that, but not to individual sentences. What does he mean? Well, you might
2849040	2857200	think, okay, look, I can imagine a must be right, because think of a synthetic sentence like,
2857920	2866800	I don't know, that dog is brown or whatever. Surely that is confirmable or deniable by sensory
2866800	2871760	experience going over and looking at the damn dog. Surely that will determine whether or not
2871760	2878960	that individual sentence by itself is true or false. Quine says no, it's not that simple,
2878960	2889840	because our experience now, except in very rare sentences. Actually, here's Quine says that there
2889840	2898800	are. So there are sentences that are like what Ayer says, are all synthetic sentences. They're
2898800	2905760	called observation sentences. And they're very specific. And they're at the sort of periphery
2905760	2914640	of our theory. Quine has this analogy that our theory is like an upturned bowl. Actually,
2914640	2921760	he uses the analogy of web, where if you take a bowl and you turn upside down, and the edge of
2921760	2929680	the bowl is where our theory of the world interacts with the world. So the world is the table, the
2929760	2936400	bowl is our theory of it. There's an edge where they interact. And that is observation sentences,
2936400	2943920	where they are directly confirmable or deniable. But they are very specific and very narrow.
2943920	2946960	They wouldn't even be things like there is a brown dog there. They would be,
2948240	2953120	depending on your theory, they would be having a certain kind of experience.
2954000	2963680	So, you know, having read, actually, Quine disagrees with the classic empiricist because
2963680	2969680	he's a Gestalt empiricist. He doesn't believe that we have like 2D experiences. We can have
2969680	2977440	3D experiences at once. So he disagrees in the content of sensory input. But he does agree
2977520	2984480	that observation sentences are confirmed or denied by our sensory experience.
2985280	2992400	Okay, the vast majority of all of our statements are going to be not observation sentences.
2992400	2997280	They're going to be part of the bowl. At the top of the bowl, at the most furthest removed from the
2997280	3004960	edge, are our most theoretic sentences, like Aristotle's Laws of Thought, like the Law of
3004960	3014080	Non-Contradiction. Now, Quine thinks that any non-observation sentence, which is the vast
3014080	3020000	majority of them, can be held true or can be rejected on the basis of any experience.
3020560	3025760	What the hell is he talking about? Well, here is an example that is making a slightly different
3025760	3032800	point. But I've always loved this example because it's a really good illustration of why it is
3032800	3040400	that sensory experience isn't directly relevant to specific claims. It's relevant to a bunch of
3040400	3048880	claims, any one of which we can choose to reject. We are not forced to say, okay, that experience
3048880	3057120	made us reject that statement. That experience might be definitely inconsistent with our current
3057120	3062880	theory, but we can make our current theory consistent with that experience by changing
3062880	3069760	any one of a number of claims within our theory, not necessarily that that isn't a brown dot.
3070400	3074160	And this example is due to a philosopher of science called Imri Lakatos.
3075760	3080400	The story is about an imaginary case of planetary misbehavior. A physicist of the
3080400	3085920	pre-Einsteinian era takes Newton mechanics and his Law of Gravitation, the accepted initial
3085920	3090320	conditions, and calculates with their help the path of a newly discovered small planet.
3091440	3097760	But, so he says, according to Newton's science, the planet should move like this. It doesn't.
3098800	3105200	Now, you might say, okay, we have to change something. Now, already you could say, well,
3105200	3111360	do I change my theory? Do I reject Newton's theory and look for a new one like Einstein's,
3111360	3117680	or do I assume that I've measured it wrong? Well, actually, those aren't your only choices.
3118240	3122880	But the planet deviates from the calculated path. Does our Newtonian physicist consider that the
3122880	3127440	deviation was forbidden by Newton's theory and therefore that once established it refutes Newton's
3127440	3134880	theory? No. He suggests that there must be a hitherto unknown planet, P star, which perturbs
3134880	3141040	the path of P, the original planet. He calculates the mass orbit, etc., of this hypothetical
3141040	3146880	planet, and then asks an experimental astronomer to test his hypothesis. The planet P star is so
3146880	3151120	small that even the biggest available telescopes cannot possibly observe it. The experimental
3151120	3155280	astronomer applies for a search grant to build yet a bigger one. In three years' time, the new
3155280	3160080	telescope is ready. Were the unknown planet P star to be discovered, it would be held as a new
3160080	3165680	victory of Newtonian science? But it is not. Does our scientist abandon Newton's theory and his
3165680	3170960	idea of the perturbing planet? No. He suggests that a cloud of cosmic dust hides the planet from
3170960	3175840	Earth's. He calculates the location and property of this cloud and asks for a search grant to send a
3175840	3180480	satellite to test his calculation. You can see that this goes on and on. In other words,
3181360	3192880	what he's doing is he's making a decision which of his sentences about the external world to hold
3192880	3199440	true and which to revise. He is unwilling to reject Newtonian science despite evidence that
3199440	3208560	appears to contradict it. And that's perfectly okay according to Quine because you cannot say
3208560	3214240	that some of the sentences are synthetic and have to be the ones that are revised,
3214240	3220320	and some are analytic. Any sentence can be revised according to experience. Even
3221200	3226960	classic examples of analytic sentences like you can't have P and not P, the law of non-contradiction.
3227600	3232720	Quine points out, and this was actually a legitimate argument, that some discoveries of
3232720	3239600	quantum mechanics appear to threaten the law of non-contradiction. Like in the two-slit experiment,
3239600	3245520	electrons appear to be in two places at once. The same electron appears to be in two places at once.
3246080	3252560	What do we decide? We could say, well, it's possible for something to both be and not be in a place
3252560	3261360	like Schrodinger's Cat and all that stuff. And so that is a possible conclusion we could draw.
3261360	3267840	We could say, given this experimental result, the two-slit experiment, we can revise one of our
3267840	3274160	most central, isolated from experience is sentences about the world that the logical
3274160	3280080	positivists would have called analytic and therefore true by definition and immune to revision.
3280080	3285920	There is no such thing, says Quine. Everything can be revised. Any non-observation sentence can
3285920	3293840	be held true. Any changes, so analytic sentences can be held true in face of all evidence. So they
3293840	3299440	would say no evidence. Someone like Ayer would say no evidence would cause us to reject the law of
3299440	3307360	contradiction, non-contradiction. But Quine said no. Any sentence, even ones that you regard as
3307360	3315440	synthetic can be held true. What are our guidelines in deciding which sentences to reject or hold
3315440	3322480	true, like in the case of the planetary observation? They're pragmatic. They're entirely pragmatic
3322480	3330640	considerations. We try and minimize the damage to our theory. Now, if enough observations happen
3331200	3336640	that are inconsistent with our theory, then to make our theory consistent with the observations,
3336640	3343040	we will have to make central changes to our theory. But what we do is we try and we make
3343040	3348320	pragmatic considerations about which to give up, which is exactly what that scientist was doing
3348320	3354800	in the case of the planet. He's saying, shall I give up my theory of the path of the planet,
3354800	3362480	which requires rejecting Newton's physics, or shall I give up my theory that there wasn't
3362480	3367120	another planet affecting them, which was an assumption? Shall I reject that assumption?
3368080	3375920	So, Quine has the theory of the web of belief that our entire theory of the world is interconnected
3376480	3389280	statements that we try and maintain consistency among, but our goal is to produce a theory that
3389280	3397040	takes input, which is sensory because he's an empiricist, and produces the output of predictions
3397760	3410000	about future experiences. Our goal is to maintain peak success in this. But what do we do in the face
3410000	3416880	of evidence that appears to contradict claims within our total theory? Well, we make changes
3416880	3421840	that minimize the damage to our theory or keep the theory simple and powerful.
3422240	3432560	Indeterminacy of translation. This is another core argument of Quine's that isn't talked about
3432560	3437360	in two dogmas of empiricism, but it's worth mentioning because it's one of the key claims
3437360	3444640	of Quine's that made him such a radical and interesting philosopher. The indeterminacy
3444640	3453200	of translation is sort of, as I said, Quine saying, in response to critics like Grayson
3453200	3459440	Strawson saying, your attack on synonymy is an attack on meaning, Quine says, well, yeah,
3460480	3468640	there is no such thing as synonymy, and let's do a little thought experiment that illustrates
3468640	3477760	the real situation we're in. Quine is a behaviorist. Now, not a behaviorist in the sense of skinner,
3477760	3483680	behavioral psychology, although he probably was at the time because skinnerian psychology was
3483680	3491200	in the air. But what he definitely is to his dying day was a behaviorist about language learning.
3491200	3498160	Now, in this, he differs from Chomsky. Chomsky, of course, famously says we're hardwired.
3498240	3505920	Chomsky is like the descendant of the rationalists who say that certain things are known a priori.
3507200	3512720	Chomsky would basically say, yeah, our language talent is hardwired into us. We don't require
3512720	3517360	experience to acquire that skill. It's already there. And so there's this sort of underlying
3517360	3524400	structure that all languages share. Quine is going to reject that. He's a classic empiricist who says
3524480	3532160	we're blank-sates, we acquire information. Except in that he's a naturalist, he says if
3532160	3538720	science chose that that's true, he would have to accept that. But he is a behaviorist about
3538720	3546400	language acquisition. And we'll see the importance of that in his indeterminacy of translation.
3547600	3553840	So what is indeterminacy of translation? Well, the most famous illustration of this is in Word
3553840	3563200	and Object. And it involves a term that Quine invented, which is gather guy.
3568480	3575440	So remember, Quine is a behaviorist, certainly about language acquisition. And he says,
3576320	3584560	and he asks us to imagine a field linguist. This is kind of the linguists equivalent of
3584560	3593120	Indiana Jones. What the field linguist has to do is parachute into a remote area where we've
3593120	3598560	discovered a previously undiscovered tribe who speak a language that has never been exposed to
3598560	3604800	the outside world. And the field linguist's job is to visit this tribe and come away with a translation
3604800	3617040	manual that can translate anything that they say into English, let's say. This is a good analogy
3617040	3627200	for essentially any language acquisition. Because on Quine on empiricist assumptions,
3627200	3631920	we come into the world without language, and we have to acquire language. So
3632880	3639760	if that is possible, it certainly must be possible for a field linguist who is someone who already
3639760	3648400	has a language to acquire a different language, this isolated tribes language. Okay, so the field
3648400	3657760	linguist parachutes in. And how does he go about this? How does he go about learning the language?
3658480	3665440	Well, all he can do if you're an empiricist, or the only evidence he's got to go on
3666080	3676960	for the meanings of the words that he hears is empirical and is sensory input. So it involves
3676960	3685040	pointing at things and looking at the reaction of speakers of this language. Now Quine kind of
3685040	3697600	cheats a little, because he says the linguist already knows what gestures are affirmation
3697600	3708960	and denial. So what he can do then is test hypotheses about the meanings of words in exactly the way
3708960	3715280	that a scientist tests hypotheses about any theory he has by looking at the evidence,
3715280	3727040	because you know, everything is like is science in in Quine's terms. So a rabbit hops by and
3727040	3733680	the natives, one of the native's points at the rabbit and says gavagai. Okay, now you might think
3734400	3742560	great. Now, our field linguist knows that gavagai is rabbit, not so fast. First of all,
3746720	3752400	it's only going to he's only going to acquire the language sentences at a time because sentences
3753040	3761360	are the kind of things that are have truth value that can be affirmed or denied. So gavagai could
3761360	3768240	be just an abbreviated sentence, just like a single word, or it could itself be an entire sentence.
3768240	3775040	So that's one complication. But the other complication is indeterminacy of reference, that is.
3778800	3785360	Well, before I get to that, the how would you confirm how would our field linguist confirm
3785360	3791040	that gavagai means rabbit? Well, you can't just take one instance and assume that means rabbit,
3791040	3797760	because of course, there are many alternatives that are consistent with the evidence that he
3797760	3804320	now has. So so far, he's got a piece of evidence, which is a native pointing at a rabbit and saying
3804320	3811440	gavagai. That is consistent with a whole bunch of translation manuals. It you could translate
3811440	3817520	gavagai as rabbit, you could translate gavagai as complete sentence, that's a rabbit.
3818400	3824880	Gavagai could be the name of that specific rabbit. Gavagai could be oh, there goes lunch.
3824880	3832640	Gavagai could be my kids let his pet out again. All of these are entirely consistent with the
3832640	3841600	evidence that we've got so far. Now, presumably, it should be possible for the trans the field
3841600	3849040	linguist to narrow it down to eliminate many of these possibilities. What quines thesis is
3849040	3857360	essentially that well, however many eliminates, there is still going to be and literally an
3857360	3865920	infinite number of interpretations of the language translation manuals of the language
3865920	3872160	that are consistent with the all the information that he's acquired, but that are contradictory
3872160	3879680	to each other. So in other words, you can get at least, let's say just two, two translation
3879680	3886000	manuals, each of which is equally confirmed by the evidence, which includes, of course,
3886000	3890400	the only evidence we've got so far is this one piece of evidence pointing at a rabbit and saying
3890400	3895680	Gavagai, you could have two translation manuals that are consistent with all not only all the
3895680	3902000	evidence that the field man linguist ever acquires, but that the field linguist could acquire.
3903760	3907680	It is still going to be the case that you have two translation manuals that are inconsistent
3907680	3913520	with each other, but entirely consistent within with the effect with the facts, which of them is
3913520	3920160	the right one. Quine says, that's an empty question. There is no such thing as the right one,
3921360	3927280	which is obviously something like what Gries and Struessen were afraid of because we want to say,
3927280	3932560	well, look, their language means something. And if it means something, it can't mean both of these
3932560	3937600	things because they're inconsistent with each other. So Quine would say, then let's drop the
3937600	3945440	notion of meaning. Both of these work. Our theory of the world is about what works. And so each of
3945440	3951440	these, we could, we can choose between each of these by pragmatic terms. If this one is easier
3951440	3956320	to use than this one, let's pick this one. Does this mean that one's true? No, it just means it's
3956320	3964400	easier for us to use. Now, what kind of things would we do to eliminate alternatives? Like,
3965360	3969040	obviously, you think, well, look, there's going to be evidence that eliminates
3969040	3973840	Gavagai as the name of that one particular rabbit. You find another rabbit and you point to the other
3973840	3980720	rabbit and presumably, again, this assumes that we know how to ask a question. It assumes that,
3980720	3985280	you know, questions go up at the end of the sentence. We don't know that in this other person's
3985280	3990480	language. So these are even more difficulties that Quine doesn't get into. But suppose you can say,
3990480	3997440	point in another rabbit and say, Gavagai. And if they say yes, then that appears to eliminate the
3997440	4003280	claim that Gavagai is a proper name because they can't both be Gavagai. So it looks like we can
4003280	4009920	do more and more of this. And finally, narrow it down. But what Quine points out with a thesis
4009920	4018800	called indeterminacy of reference is there are some things that we can never eliminate,
4019680	4025920	such as Gavagai could mean rabbit or it could mean undetached rabbit part because
4027440	4033200	wherever it's a bit like the Renate Cordate problem, every time you're pointing at a rabbit,
4033200	4041440	you're pointing at an undetached rabbit part. So every time it's true to say that he is referring
4041440	4046880	to a rabbit, it is true to say that he is referring to an undetached rabbit part and every time it's
4046880	4051600	false of one, it's false of the other. So in other words, they're like extensionally equivalent.
4051600	4058480	And given that we have to be a behaviorist in language acquisition because we're not telepathic,
4059200	4064800	the only thing that we have to go on in learning a language is the evidence. And if the evidence
4064800	4072080	cannot decide between two inconsistent translation manuals, then there is indeterminacy of translation.
4072080	4079280	You cannot say one is the correct one. And of course, there's examples that you might say,
4080000	4085600	illustrate this, in that there are genuinely inconsistent translations of, say, the Bible.
4085600	4094960	The further away from us a language is written in, the greater leeway there is in translating
4095200	4101440	in what's the correct translation of it. But it's worse than that because
4101440	4109920	Quine says indeterminacy of translation happens within a language. I am translating what you mean
4109920	4118240	by your words into what makes sense for me. And somebody else could take by your words
4119440	4124480	you to mean something inconsistent with what I take it. And both of them are consistent with
4124480	4130080	the evidence. And we can't say that one of them is wrong. And the other one is right. So
4131040	4137360	this is a very radical kind of skepticism about notion of meaning as we normally understand
4137360	4145840	it. We're replacing meaning with some kind of behaviorist stand in that doesn't do what we
4145840	4152560	think meaning should. But Quine says, if we're honest, this is the best we can do. And this brought
4152560	4159280	a storm of criticism and commentary on Quine, which is one of the reasons he's so famous,
4159280	4165520	because he's making radical claims. He's also pretty cool. Everybody should go through a Quine
4165520	4171200	phase of thinking that Quine's right about something. Now, most philosophers, there aren't
4171200	4180480	many Quineans left, probably, maybe not as few as there are logical positivists left, but he still
4180480	4191680	has his defenders. And but his his view has, he's not sort of as current as he was in the mid
4191680	4196160	century. In the mid century, everybody was talking if they weren't agreeing with Quine, they were
4196160	4200400	disagreeing with Quine, they were talking about Quine. So that's why I have to know about him.
4200400	4201920	He was such an important figure.
