0	8240	Here we are again with our old pal, Willard Van Orman Quine, another famous article, not
8240	16080	as famous and influential as Two Dogmas of Empiricism, but definitely well known and
16080	18880	that's called Epistemology Naturalized.
18880	23680	Okay, well what does the title mean for the first thing?
24080	31680	Well Epistemology since, epistemological issues have been with us since the dawn of philosophy.
32480	41440	Plato talks about what we can know and what knowing does for the knower and things like that.
42240	48400	In the era of modern philosophy of course we have Descartes, Descartes' Meditations and
48400	56000	their epistemology is as what is sometimes called first philosophy, that is before you can
56000	65680	start philosophizing about anything like what the world is like, what things exist, what is right
65680	74560	and what is wrong, you need to first know what it is to know anything and then once you establish
74640	84560	that you have some criterion to judge whether or not we can claim to know things about the
84560	91120	external world, things about ethics, things like that. So you've got to settle our standards of
91120	104320	knowing first and they give you guidelines that affect the way that you reason in all
104320	110800	other areas of philosophy. So epistemology in that sense is what you handle first and that's
110800	118560	evident in the way Descartes structures the meditations where he talks about what we can know
118560	131840	right up front. Quine is a big fan of science and in fact Quine doesn't make a clear distinction
131840	140480	between epistemology and the rest of philosophy or between philosophy and science. He just talks
140480	147520	in terms of our theory of the world and our theory of the world includes all of science and philosophy
147600	158160	and there's no clear boundaries between them. So this very much prevents us sort of taking a
158800	163840	placing philosophy above science and saying, whoa science you can't make claims to know
163840	169440	something because you're not meeting our strict philosophical standards so therefore your scientific
169440	175920	results fall short or something like that. That would be the sort of old-fashioned way of looking
175920	182000	at epistemology is sort of above science and providing standards that science must reach,
182720	190720	must meet. Once you naturalize epistemology you say epistemology is part of science
190720	200400	and can use the scientific method. Now this would be quite radical because then you could,
200640	209120	how is it that you're supposed to judge the standards that you use? How is it that you're
209120	214880	supposed to, that you can judge whether or not the products of science are things that we can
214880	225360	actually know or that are in some sense theory-laden or whatever? Well as is usual with a Quine article
225360	235360	it's very dense and it's written in a way that seems to require us having a huge amount of
235360	243360	background information. Quine's articles tend to read as if they're for an audience of buddies that
243360	252800	he's already in the middle of conversations with. So it's hard to make sense of it which is why
253280	260000	as the reading I gave a version of epistemology naturalized that has sort of a commentary on it
262800	269760	and chunks cut out. So let's talk about some of his assumptions. The first and major assumption
269760	275440	that he makes clear is something that he calls the Quine-Dewam thesis. This is he talks about in
275680	283760	two dogmas of empiricism. I don't think he calls it that there. He starts calling it maybe in Word
283760	294080	and Objects which is his book that comes out in 1960 and it's a little arrogant. Pierre Duem was a
294080	303200	French physicist who made this claim about science that it's basically, you can call it
303200	309360	confirmation holism and I talked about it in talking about two dogmas from empiricism. That is
309360	314080	contrary to what the logical positivists say, the logical positivist says that every sentence
314800	322080	if it is meaningful and is not just true by the definition of the words involved, if it is meaningful
322720	334320	then it has clear criteria of testability that is it is relevant to specific
336000	340560	facts about the world. So and they are what make it meaningful.
343200	350640	And what Quine insists on and he says Duem insisted on before him. So if Duem insisted on it before
350800	356880	him, why is it called the Quine-Dewam thesis? Why not just call it the Duem thesis but I guess maybe
356880	363040	it had become famous as what Quine says and Quine wanted to say well this other guy said it before
363040	370480	me and I've just discovered that or anyway. The Quine-Dewam thesis is this idea that while
371040	380720	the only evidence we have for our theory, our grand theory of the world is observation of
381840	390480	the natural world, it is relevant only, it only confirms or dis confirms our theory as a whole
390480	399440	and and this is because no claim that we make about the world can be directly tested in isolation
399440	407200	from other claims like for example if I make a claim about the motion of a planet and I observe
407200	415440	through a telescope that my claim appears to be false, that would appear to mean that the evidence
415440	421680	dis confirms my specific claim about planetary motion but of course it doesn't because I could
421680	428000	say no no no my claim about planetary motion is correct, the only reason the observation appears
428000	433840	to dis confirm it is because there's something wrong with our theory of how this telescope works
433840	439280	or there's some other facts we don't know like there's another planet that we haven't seen yet
439280	445440	affecting the motion of the planet so I can I don't have to dis confirm my particular claim
445440	452640	there's no evidence that will directly dis confirm that claim alone it's always and this is Quine's
452640	462320	big contribution it's actually up to us to pick which claim we want to dis confirm it's not dictated
462320	468880	by the evidence it's our choice to decide okay I'm going to stick to my observational claim
468880	475520	and I'm going to claim that this telescope is faulty or something like that we make the choices
475520	481600	and nothing about our observation dictates that choice so all we know is that our current
481600	487280	observation doesn't fit with our whole theory but which of the elements of our theory we decide to
487280	493760	discard or maybe we decide to discard the observation itself it's up to us this is what
493760	503280	confirmation holism is and given that fact it looks like one of the projects that was particularly
503280	511760	dear to one of the logical positivists who had the longest career some logical positivists didn't
511760	520240	make it out of Vienna for example Marie Schlick was shot by a crazy ex-student on the steps of I
520240	527600	think the university but one who had a long and distinguished career in in America was Rudolph
527600	536480	Carnap and he sort of evolved out of logical positivism and started calling it logical empiricism
536480	546160	instead and sort of gave up some aspects of logical positivism but took the core insights and sort of
546160	553680	said no no no we can work with this and Carnap and Quine had a long going back and forth over the
553760	559440	decades in America and and Carnap was older than Quine and a great influence on Quine
560160	566320	so he risked Quine respected Carnap but said he was wrong about some things anyway Carnap
567520	580480	his big project was that he wanted to see if you could justify your theory by logically reducing it
580480	586320	to statement to these observation statements now observation statements which Quine remains
586320	596320	committed to are the kind of thing that people like Kuhn or more extreme or a more extreme
596320	602480	version is a guy called Paul Feierabend would say observation sentences are kind of a myth you
602480	611600	cannot have these sentences so Quine maintains that although in general it's the theory as a whole
611600	616800	that is confirmed or disconfirmed by the evidence he still maintains that there are very specific
616800	624720	sentences that can be confirmed or disconfirmed but these are very rare and right at the edge and
624720	629600	he says the reason why he says there has to be some of these is because he says otherwise
629600	637600	we would never be able to learn language here's where he and Wittgenstein would butt heads because
637600	644800	Wittgenstein has that analysis of extensive definition where you point to something and say
644800	650240	that's a table or something like that and says that you in order to do that you have to already
650240	656960	be immersed in the language game of extensive definition Quine thinks you can do extensive
656960	663600	definition and in fact you have to be able to do that otherwise babies would never acquire language
663600	672160	there has to be an an entering wedge into language and it has to be these very basic claims about
672160	682080	the world that can be confirmed or disconfirmed by the evidence so Quine and Kahnab share this
682080	690880	belief in observation sentences and what the project that Kahnab is interested in is to try to
691440	700880	justify our theory of the world by showing that it reduces to our evidence for it now
700880	708240	Quine says this is an epistemological project because what we're trying to do is we're trying
708240	715840	to show how our view of how the world works which is sort of out you know might say like
715840	722320	our collective beliefs about the world is justified on the basis of the evidence we have for it and
722320	728800	that's very much like the old epistemological project of saying can I know that there's an
728800	736320	external world my evidence for it is what my senses are telling me but is that evidence enough to
736320	741360	justify the belief I have that there's a world out there and the skeptics say no
743680	749840	so this is just sort of on a larger scale so instead of talking about individual people's
749840	758160	beliefs we're talking about the human human Kahn's collective theory of the world is that
758160	768320	justified based on the basis of the kind of input or that we as humans have and Kahnab wants to try
768320	777040	and do that now because of the Quine duem thesis essentially Quine says you can't do that you
777040	784560	cannot reduce theoretical sentences individually to observational sentences and consequently
784560	793440	you can have and this is the indeterminacy of translation another one of Quine's key and
793440	802320	controversial theses you can have inconsistent theories of the world that are equally confirmed
802320	812560	by the evidence and there is no way to decide between them so we have to give up on this so
812560	817360	but epistemologies if there is such a thing as epistemology its job is to explain the
817360	823280	relationship between our theory of the world and the observational evidence well the logical
823280	831120	positivist thought it could be done this way it can't this kind of project is like in the beginning
831120	836000	of his article he compares it with what Frager and Russell were trying to do with math they were
836000	845040	trying to say well we have this we have math how can we justify our mathematical beliefs well
845040	850000	if we could reduce them to the claims of logic which is more basic and elementary and and self
850000	856560	evidently true then that would in some sense justify math well we couldn't that's one of the
856560	863520	things that for example girdle's incompleteness shows that this this project won't work and
863520	871680	quine is saying a similar thing we can't do the reduction of theory into observational sentences
871680	878880	where does that leave epistemology well quine says the only other option is to treat epistem is to
878880	889440	naturalize epistemology that is to treat epistemology as instead a study of what humans do in fact do
889440	899120	because humans as a matter of fact are constantly producing theories of the world on the basis of
900160	907360	our sensory stimulus and quine calls a late work of his from stimulus to science which is
908400	916000	he talks about us as sort of like bags of nerve endings and he says our nerve endings are stimulated
916000	925440	that's the input from this as he calls it meager input just electrical signals that we're getting
925440	934640	from our nerve endings we construct as he puts it this torrential this far more ornate and convoluted
935360	943440	description of the reality our theoretical view of of the explanation of our sensory stimulation
944400	950720	and and epistemology's job now according to quine given that it can't be reduced to
951760	962400	in this way is to just say well how do humans do that how do humans produce this huge theoretical
962400	970960	output on the basis of sensory input so on a more a very basic example would be how is it
970960	980160	that we see in 3d given that our input is 2d that we're just getting stimulation that it doesn't
980160	987600	really have a dimension it's just electrical impulses reaching our brain and as far as we know
987600	995040	they're not caused by 3d objects and yet we see the world in 3d why is it that we see this world
995040	1002640	in 3d how are we constructing 3d pictures of the world from 2d input that's an epistemological
1002640	1010400	issue how do we do it and so for example a naturalized epistemologist would be interested in something
1010400	1018400	called mars theory of vision which is a scientific study of how this works and that's what that's
1018400	1023440	the kind of thing that epistemologists should be interested in they shouldn't be interested in this
1023520	1031120	crusty old philosophical business of you know the kind of thing that getier wrote on you know
1031120	1037360	what are the conditions for knowing that p no you should get into the science because science
1037360	1045840	is all we have to go on so if knowledge knowledge is a natural phenomenon that can be studied our
1045840	1051440	knowledge is our picture of the world so here of course classical epistemologists would say well
1052080	1056800	we can't call it knowledge yet because we don't know if it meets the standards of knowledge
1056800	1062240	but to say that is to say that there's something above science that can judge what
1062240	1067440	the correct standards are and there aren't there isn't there's only science all we have to go on
1067440	1073840	is science quine is is very fond of quoting another logical positivist called Otto Neurath
1074800	1082400	uh who has an image of a ship and he says we're on this ship and we're building the ship at the
1082400	1090000	same time we're on it we're building the ship that we're floating on um and that's our relationship
1090000	1097520	to science that is we're using science at the same time we're thinking about science but you
1097520	1103520	there is no you can't get off the ship of science to look down on it and say oh we're doing it right
1104160	1109840	the only standards by which to judge science are science there or where science here is
1109840	1115920	taken broadly to include all of our theory of the world which includes philosophy but the method
1115920	1122960	science uh like natural science is the most successful and therefore preferable methodology
1122960	1130560	because as the positivist pointed out science was far more was advancing at a massively accelerated
1130560	1135200	rate in the early 20th century with Einstein and quantum mechanics and all of that stuff
1136640	1143600	so clearly science's methodology is is the one that we should be using okay so knowledge is a
1143600	1151680	natural phenomenon it resolves the issue of epistemological priority what's this well he says
1151760	1162720	uh prior a a fairly recent dispute in in epistemology that he says now is goes by the board
1163440	1171040	is um was brought up by the gestalt psychologists and gestalt psychologists say we don't actually
1171920	1181600	perceive in the way that classic philosophers like Descartes and Locke and in particular Locke
1181600	1189680	Barkley and Hume say they say we get we are directly aware of sense data first like patches of red
1189680	1196240	and patches of blue and then Locke in particular paints this picture we take these tiny little
1196320	1202480	Lego building blocks and then we construct them together to form objects so an object is constructed
1202480	1209520	in our mind from all of these tiny little individual very basic sense data um and the
1209520	1215920	gestalt psychologist says that's not true we just directly see the world in 3d we don't see the world
1215920	1224000	in 2d and then in further 3d world we directly perceive in 3d that's what we're or wherever
1224000	1233760	conscious of we're never conscious of the sensory stimulations that are uh sort of cause you might
1233760	1238480	say our 3d picture of the world we're never conscious of those what we're conscious of
1238480	1244640	immediately is a 3d picture of the world we see the world in color in 3d and that's what we're
1244640	1252080	conscious of so that's our first that should have epistemological priority over the unconscious stuff
1252080	1260640	that causes it um and quine says well once we see knowledge as a natural phenomenon we uh epistemological
1260640	1267120	priority is resolved by what should come first the conscious or the unconscious and he says it's
1267120	1274000	obviously the unconscious because if you're viewing things in a naturalistic way you look to the the
1274000	1279440	causal origin and the causal origin of our 3d picture of the world is the sensory stimulation
1279440	1285280	so that comes first and he suggests at the end of the article possible projects for epist for
1285280	1294240	naturalized epistemology is to look at our do humans have a certain limited number of epistemological
1294240	1301520	building blocks it and he draws the analogy with phonemes in in linguistics in linguistics there's
1301520	1311040	this idea of phonemes that there's a finite number of uh audible um sounds that can be the basis of
1311040	1319920	words and language if languages share the same set then humans we know something about languages of
1319920	1326720	which humans are capable of speaking you can't use you can't have more uh phonetic distinctions than
1326720	1333840	we're capable of perceiving and maybe there are you know we there's sort of uh humans have a limited
1333840	1341920	resolution you might say a limited pixel um density in our uh perception of the world
1341920	1347040	that will be something worth finding out and that would tell us that would tell us something about
1347040	1353920	what we can know or another suggestion is evolutionary epistemology why do we see the world
1353920	1361760	in color for example I imagine uh this is an example uh you know we have color in the center of our
1361760	1368960	retinas and black and white uh rods color cones color sensing cones and black and white sensing
1368960	1374480	rods on the periphery of our vision what this now the black and white ones are much more sensitive
1374480	1380560	to minute changes in light which is why in your peripheral vision you can detect motion
1380560	1388320	much better and the evolutionary uh suggestion for this is this is good if you're being hunted by
1388320	1395280	if you're a prey animal as we are uh this will enable you to detect the movement of tigers or
1395280	1401280	wolves uh off to the side and you can you will immediately see them you'll be much harder to
1401280	1408400	sneak up on but of course these features of our eyes while they serve an evolutionary purpose
1408800	1416080	uh dictate how we view the world so evolutionary epistemology would say the way we view the world
1416080	1427760	is a product of forces that enabled us to survive um now epistemology in general or
1427760	1434720	certainly before this suggestion was deemed to be normative that is epistemology this is why it
1434720	1440400	was first philosophy this is why Descartes starts with epistemology because he says we've got to give
1440400	1446720	produce standards to judge our knowledge claims in other spheres when we start making metaphysical
1446720	1454240	or ethical claims we judge them by the standards that epistemology has given us so epistemology
1454240	1461760	provides us with norms standards to judge knowledge in other spheres can naturalized epistemology
1461840	1468000	do that or is it just a descriptive enterprise uh does it just say this is how
1469920	1473200	we acquire our picture of the world is it the right picture of the world
1474000	1479760	i'm not interested in that it seems like it seems like and science is norm is often said
1479760	1484880	there's usually said to be a fact value distinction science is interested in the facts
1485520	1489440	you know like scientists would say it's just the fact that humans are violent
1489440	1494400	we don't say that it's a good thing we just tell you why humans are violent because you
1494400	1498800	know it helps in survival or it was evolutionary practical or something we're not saying it's a
1498800	1503520	good thing or that it should continue we're just telling you the facts we're not judging the facts
1504080	1510240	so if epistemology is now just part of science can it provide us with standards
1511200	1516960	coins is yes it can give us standards the standards of science the standards of scientific
1516960	1525840	rigor so if we want to know are we in a position to know this well uh you know science would say
1527040	1532400	you will be in a position to know it if you're in the kind of circumstances where the typical
1532400	1541280	human can provide a picture that is reliable um now but then is there any way to get outside of
1541280	1547840	science and say is science doing it right no uh there is no such thing for for quine as first
1547840	1554400	philosophy again back to noir earth's ship we can't get off the ship and look down on it and judge it
1554400	1559040	so although quine says it does provide us with norms the they're the norms of science and we
1559040	1566320	can't judge those um so other although quine says yes other people the critics would say no
1567120	1576400	uh naturalized epistemology has become an important part of um epistemology but it
1576400	1582320	hasn't killed off the old-fashioned epistemology either now it's just so epistemology is just a
1582320	1590320	larger animal quine would have had it kill off all the other kinds of epistemology he he would say
1590400	1597360	come on haven't you seen i've told you that uh uh the old-fashioned epistemology it's obvious
1597360	1605200	that it's a pointless exercise but epistemology goes on regardless uh it's just now there's a new
1606000	1612480	subsection of epistemology thanks to quine and people who are influenced by him
1620320	1621700	you
1650320	1651780	you
1680320	1681780	you
1710320	1711780	you
1740320	1741780	you
1770320	1771780	you
1800320	1800820	you
1808960	1819040	ghettier cases are pretty much uh they multiply these aren't rare ones these aren't specifically
1819920	1828320	very um very contrived cases it's it's fairly easy to come up with cases like this in fact
1828320	1833840	there's some suggestion that birch and russell uh came up with his own cases uh a long time
1833840	1839920	previously in a book of his so that's a little bit of controversy it's it's not necessarily clear
1839920	1846000	that ghettier was the first person to publish on this but certainly he did a good good job of
1846000	1856400	presenting the cases and they have led to a sort of sea change in um epistemology in this kind of
1856400	1863200	epistemology you can so the the ghettier problem is what's missing what is the extra element that
1863200	1871600	we need to add um so that if you meet one two three four then you do know something that's the
1871600	1877920	debate or there is some suggestion that this is okay and that we can fix this and respond to
1877920	1884960	ghettier cases but certainly ghettier presented a challenge that epistemologists then had to meet
1884960	1890560	which is why this article short as it is is so famous
