1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Here we are again with our old pal, Willard Van Orman Quine, another famous article, not

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,080
as famous and influential as Two Dogmas of Empiricism, but definitely well known and

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,880
that's called Epistemology Naturalized.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,680
Okay, well what does the title mean for the first thing?

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,680
Well Epistemology since, epistemological issues have been with us since the dawn of philosophy.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:41,440
Plato talks about what we can know and what knowing does for the knower and things like that.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,400
In the era of modern philosophy of course we have Descartes, Descartes' Meditations and

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:56,000
their epistemology is as what is sometimes called first philosophy, that is before you can

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,680
start philosophizing about anything like what the world is like, what things exist, what is right

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:14,560
and what is wrong, you need to first know what it is to know anything and then once you establish

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,560
that you have some criterion to judge whether or not we can claim to know things about the

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,120
external world, things about ethics, things like that. So you've got to settle our standards of

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:44,320
knowing first and they give you guidelines that affect the way that you reason in all

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,800
other areas of philosophy. So epistemology in that sense is what you handle first and that's

15
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:58,560
evident in the way Descartes structures the meditations where he talks about what we can know

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:11,840
right up front. Quine is a big fan of science and in fact Quine doesn't make a clear distinction

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,480
between epistemology and the rest of philosophy or between philosophy and science. He just talks

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,520
in terms of our theory of the world and our theory of the world includes all of science and philosophy

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:38,160
and there's no clear boundaries between them. So this very much prevents us sort of taking a

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,840
placing philosophy above science and saying, whoa science you can't make claims to know

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,440
something because you're not meeting our strict philosophical standards so therefore your scientific

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,920
results fall short or something like that. That would be the sort of old-fashioned way of looking

23
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,000
at epistemology is sort of above science and providing standards that science must reach,

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,720
must meet. Once you naturalize epistemology you say epistemology is part of science

25
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:20,400
and can use the scientific method. Now this would be quite radical because then you could,

26
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,120
how is it that you're supposed to judge the standards that you use? How is it that you're

27
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,880
supposed to, that you can judge whether or not the products of science are things that we can

28
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:45,360
actually know or that are in some sense theory-laden or whatever? Well as is usual with a Quine article

29
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:55,360
it's very dense and it's written in a way that seems to require us having a huge amount of

30
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,360
background information. Quine's articles tend to read as if they're for an audience of buddies that

31
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:12,800
he's already in the middle of conversations with. So it's hard to make sense of it which is why

32
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,000
as the reading I gave a version of epistemology naturalized that has sort of a commentary on it

33
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,760
and chunks cut out. So let's talk about some of his assumptions. The first and major assumption

34
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,440
that he makes clear is something that he calls the Quine-Dewam thesis. This is he talks about in

35
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:43,760
two dogmas of empiricism. I don't think he calls it that there. He starts calling it maybe in Word

36
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:54,080
and Objects which is his book that comes out in 1960 and it's a little arrogant. Pierre Duem was a

37
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:03,200
French physicist who made this claim about science that it's basically, you can call it

38
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,360
confirmation holism and I talked about it in talking about two dogmas from empiricism. That is

39
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
contrary to what the logical positivists say, the logical positivist says that every sentence

40
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,080
if it is meaningful and is not just true by the definition of the words involved, if it is meaningful

41
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:34,320
then it has clear criteria of testability that is it is relevant to specific

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
facts about the world. So and they are what make it meaningful.

43
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,640
And what Quine insists on and he says Duem insisted on before him. So if Duem insisted on it before

44
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,880
him, why is it called the Quine-Dewam thesis? Why not just call it the Duem thesis but I guess maybe

45
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,040
it had become famous as what Quine says and Quine wanted to say well this other guy said it before

46
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,480
me and I've just discovered that or anyway. The Quine-Dewam thesis is this idea that while

47
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:20,720
the only evidence we have for our theory, our grand theory of the world is observation of

48
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,480
the natural world, it is relevant only, it only confirms or dis confirms our theory as a whole

49
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:39,440
and and this is because no claim that we make about the world can be directly tested in isolation

50
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,200
from other claims like for example if I make a claim about the motion of a planet and I observe

51
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:55,440
through a telescope that my claim appears to be false, that would appear to mean that the evidence

52
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,680
dis confirms my specific claim about planetary motion but of course it doesn't because I could

53
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,000
say no no no my claim about planetary motion is correct, the only reason the observation appears

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,840
to dis confirm it is because there's something wrong with our theory of how this telescope works

55
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,280
or there's some other facts we don't know like there's another planet that we haven't seen yet

56
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,440
affecting the motion of the planet so I can I don't have to dis confirm my particular claim

57
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,640
there's no evidence that will directly dis confirm that claim alone it's always and this is Quine's

58
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:42,320
big contribution it's actually up to us to pick which claim we want to dis confirm it's not dictated

59
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,880
by the evidence it's our choice to decide okay I'm going to stick to my observational claim

60
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,520
and I'm going to claim that this telescope is faulty or something like that we make the choices

61
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,600
and nothing about our observation dictates that choice so all we know is that our current

62
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,280
observation doesn't fit with our whole theory but which of the elements of our theory we decide to

63
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,760
discard or maybe we decide to discard the observation itself it's up to us this is what

64
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:23,280
confirmation holism is and given that fact it looks like one of the projects that was particularly

65
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,760
dear to one of the logical positivists who had the longest career some logical positivists didn't

66
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:40,240
make it out of Vienna for example Marie Schlick was shot by a crazy ex-student on the steps of I

67
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,600
think the university but one who had a long and distinguished career in in America was Rudolph

68
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:56,480
Carnap and he sort of evolved out of logical positivism and started calling it logical empiricism

69
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:06,160
instead and sort of gave up some aspects of logical positivism but took the core insights and sort of

70
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,680
said no no no we can work with this and Carnap and Quine had a long going back and forth over the

71
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,440
decades in America and and Carnap was older than Quine and a great influence on Quine

72
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,320
so he risked Quine respected Carnap but said he was wrong about some things anyway Carnap

73
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:40,480
his big project was that he wanted to see if you could justify your theory by logically reducing it

74
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,320
to statement to these observation statements now observation statements which Quine remains

75
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:56,320
committed to are the kind of thing that people like Kuhn or more extreme or a more extreme

76
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,480
version is a guy called Paul Feierabend would say observation sentences are kind of a myth you

77
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:11,600
cannot have these sentences so Quine maintains that although in general it's the theory as a whole

78
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,800
that is confirmed or disconfirmed by the evidence he still maintains that there are very specific

79
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,720
sentences that can be confirmed or disconfirmed but these are very rare and right at the edge and

80
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
he says the reason why he says there has to be some of these is because he says otherwise

81
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,600
we would never be able to learn language here's where he and Wittgenstein would butt heads because

82
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Wittgenstein has that analysis of extensive definition where you point to something and say

83
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,240
that's a table or something like that and says that you in order to do that you have to already

84
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,960
be immersed in the language game of extensive definition Quine thinks you can do extensive

85
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,600
definition and in fact you have to be able to do that otherwise babies would never acquire language

86
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:12,160
there has to be an an entering wedge into language and it has to be these very basic claims about

87
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:22,080
the world that can be confirmed or disconfirmed by the evidence so Quine and Kahnab share this

88
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:30,880
belief in observation sentences and what the project that Kahnab is interested in is to try to

89
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:40,880
justify our theory of the world by showing that it reduces to our evidence for it now

90
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,240
Quine says this is an epistemological project because what we're trying to do is we're trying

91
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,840
to show how our view of how the world works which is sort of out you know might say like

92
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,320
our collective beliefs about the world is justified on the basis of the evidence we have for it and

93
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,800
that's very much like the old epistemological project of saying can I know that there's an

94
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,320
external world my evidence for it is what my senses are telling me but is that evidence enough to

95
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,360
justify the belief I have that there's a world out there and the skeptics say no

96
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,840
so this is just sort of on a larger scale so instead of talking about individual people's

97
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:38,160
beliefs we're talking about the human human Kahn's collective theory of the world is that

98
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:48,320
justified based on the basis of the kind of input or that we as humans have and Kahnab wants to try

99
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:57,040
and do that now because of the Quine duem thesis essentially Quine says you can't do that you

100
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,560
cannot reduce theoretical sentences individually to observational sentences and consequently

101
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:13,440
you can have and this is the indeterminacy of translation another one of Quine's key and

102
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:22,320
controversial theses you can have inconsistent theories of the world that are equally confirmed

103
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:32,560
by the evidence and there is no way to decide between them so we have to give up on this so

104
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,360
but epistemologies if there is such a thing as epistemology its job is to explain the

105
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,280
relationship between our theory of the world and the observational evidence well the logical

106
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,120
positivist thought it could be done this way it can't this kind of project is like in the beginning

107
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,000
of his article he compares it with what Frager and Russell were trying to do with math they were

108
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,040
trying to say well we have this we have math how can we justify our mathematical beliefs well

109
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,000
if we could reduce them to the claims of logic which is more basic and elementary and and self

110
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,560
evidently true then that would in some sense justify math well we couldn't that's one of the

111
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,520
things that for example girdle's incompleteness shows that this this project won't work and

112
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:31,680
quine is saying a similar thing we can't do the reduction of theory into observational sentences

113
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,880
where does that leave epistemology well quine says the only other option is to treat epistem is to

114
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:49,440
naturalize epistemology that is to treat epistemology as instead a study of what humans do in fact do

115
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:59,120
because humans as a matter of fact are constantly producing theories of the world on the basis of

116
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,360
our sensory stimulus and quine calls a late work of his from stimulus to science which is

117
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:16,000
he talks about us as sort of like bags of nerve endings and he says our nerve endings are stimulated

118
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,440
that's the input from this as he calls it meager input just electrical signals that we're getting

119
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:34,640
from our nerve endings we construct as he puts it this torrential this far more ornate and convoluted

120
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:43,440
description of the reality our theoretical view of of the explanation of our sensory stimulation

121
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,720
and and epistemology's job now according to quine given that it can't be reduced to

122
00:15:51,760 --> 00:16:02,400
in this way is to just say well how do humans do that how do humans produce this huge theoretical

123
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:10,960
output on the basis of sensory input so on a more a very basic example would be how is it

124
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:20,160
that we see in 3d given that our input is 2d that we're just getting stimulation that it doesn't

125
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,600
really have a dimension it's just electrical impulses reaching our brain and as far as we know

126
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,040
they're not caused by 3d objects and yet we see the world in 3d why is it that we see this world

127
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,640
in 3d how are we constructing 3d pictures of the world from 2d input that's an epistemological

128
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,400
issue how do we do it and so for example a naturalized epistemologist would be interested in something

129
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:58,400
called mars theory of vision which is a scientific study of how this works and that's what that's

130
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,440
the kind of thing that epistemologists should be interested in they shouldn't be interested in this

131
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,120
crusty old philosophical business of you know the kind of thing that getier wrote on you know

132
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,360
what are the conditions for knowing that p no you should get into the science because science

133
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:25,840
is all we have to go on so if knowledge knowledge is a natural phenomenon that can be studied our

134
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,440
knowledge is our picture of the world so here of course classical epistemologists would say well

135
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,800
we can't call it knowledge yet because we don't know if it meets the standards of knowledge

136
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,240
but to say that is to say that there's something above science that can judge what

137
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,440
the correct standards are and there aren't there isn't there's only science all we have to go on

138
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,840
is science quine is is very fond of quoting another logical positivist called Otto Neurath

139
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:02,400
uh who has an image of a ship and he says we're on this ship and we're building the ship at the

140
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:10,000
same time we're on it we're building the ship that we're floating on um and that's our relationship

141
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,520
to science that is we're using science at the same time we're thinking about science but you

142
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,520
there is no you can't get off the ship of science to look down on it and say oh we're doing it right

143
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,840
the only standards by which to judge science are science there or where science here is

144
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,920
taken broadly to include all of our theory of the world which includes philosophy but the method

145
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,960
science uh like natural science is the most successful and therefore preferable methodology

146
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,560
because as the positivist pointed out science was far more was advancing at a massively accelerated

147
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,200
rate in the early 20th century with Einstein and quantum mechanics and all of that stuff

148
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,600
so clearly science's methodology is is the one that we should be using okay so knowledge is a

149
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:11,680
natural phenomenon it resolves the issue of epistemological priority what's this well he says

150
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:22,720
uh prior a a fairly recent dispute in in epistemology that he says now is goes by the board

151
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,040
is um was brought up by the gestalt psychologists and gestalt psychologists say we don't actually

152
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:41,600
perceive in the way that classic philosophers like Descartes and Locke and in particular Locke

153
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,680
Barkley and Hume say they say we get we are directly aware of sense data first like patches of red

154
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,240
and patches of blue and then Locke in particular paints this picture we take these tiny little

155
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,480
Lego building blocks and then we construct them together to form objects so an object is constructed

156
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,520
in our mind from all of these tiny little individual very basic sense data um and the

157
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,920
gestalt psychologist says that's not true we just directly see the world in 3d we don't see the world

158
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:24,000
in 2d and then in further 3d world we directly perceive in 3d that's what we're or wherever

159
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,760
conscious of we're never conscious of the sensory stimulations that are uh sort of cause you might

160
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,480
say our 3d picture of the world we're never conscious of those what we're conscious of

161
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,640
immediately is a 3d picture of the world we see the world in color in 3d and that's what we're

162
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:52,080
conscious of so that's our first that should have epistemological priority over the unconscious stuff

163
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:00,640
that causes it um and quine says well once we see knowledge as a natural phenomenon we uh epistemological

164
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,120
priority is resolved by what should come first the conscious or the unconscious and he says it's

165
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,000
obviously the unconscious because if you're viewing things in a naturalistic way you look to the the

166
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,440
causal origin and the causal origin of our 3d picture of the world is the sensory stimulation

167
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,280
so that comes first and he suggests at the end of the article possible projects for epist for

168
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:34,240
naturalized epistemology is to look at our do humans have a certain limited number of epistemological

169
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,520
building blocks it and he draws the analogy with phonemes in in linguistics in linguistics there's

170
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:51,040
this idea of phonemes that there's a finite number of uh audible um sounds that can be the basis of

171
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:59,920
words and language if languages share the same set then humans we know something about languages of

172
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:06,720
which humans are capable of speaking you can't use you can't have more uh phonetic distinctions than

173
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,840
we're capable of perceiving and maybe there are you know we there's sort of uh humans have a limited

174
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,920
resolution you might say a limited pixel um density in our uh perception of the world

175
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,040
that will be something worth finding out and that would tell us that would tell us something about

176
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,920
what we can know or another suggestion is evolutionary epistemology why do we see the world

177
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:41,760
in color for example I imagine uh this is an example uh you know we have color in the center of our

178
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,960
retinas and black and white uh rods color cones color sensing cones and black and white sensing

179
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,480
rods on the periphery of our vision what this now the black and white ones are much more sensitive

180
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,560
to minute changes in light which is why in your peripheral vision you can detect motion

181
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,320
much better and the evolutionary uh suggestion for this is this is good if you're being hunted by

182
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,280
if you're a prey animal as we are uh this will enable you to detect the movement of tigers or

183
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,280
wolves uh off to the side and you can you will immediately see them you'll be much harder to

184
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,400
sneak up on but of course these features of our eyes while they serve an evolutionary purpose

185
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:36,080
uh dictate how we view the world so evolutionary epistemology would say the way we view the world

186
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:47,760
is a product of forces that enabled us to survive um now epistemology in general or

187
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,720
certainly before this suggestion was deemed to be normative that is epistemology this is why it

188
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,400
was first philosophy this is why Descartes starts with epistemology because he says we've got to give

189
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,720
produce standards to judge our knowledge claims in other spheres when we start making metaphysical

190
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:14,240
or ethical claims we judge them by the standards that epistemology has given us so epistemology

191
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,760
provides us with norms standards to judge knowledge in other spheres can naturalized epistemology

192
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,000
do that or is it just a descriptive enterprise uh does it just say this is how

193
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,200
we acquire our picture of the world is it the right picture of the world

194
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,760
i'm not interested in that it seems like it seems like and science is norm is often said

195
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,880
there's usually said to be a fact value distinction science is interested in the facts

196
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,440
you know like scientists would say it's just the fact that humans are violent

197
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,400
we don't say that it's a good thing we just tell you why humans are violent because you

198
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,800
know it helps in survival or it was evolutionary practical or something we're not saying it's a

199
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,520
good thing or that it should continue we're just telling you the facts we're not judging the facts

200
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,240
so if epistemology is now just part of science can it provide us with standards

201
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,960
coins is yes it can give us standards the standards of science the standards of scientific

202
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:25,840
rigor so if we want to know are we in a position to know this well uh you know science would say

203
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,400
you will be in a position to know it if you're in the kind of circumstances where the typical

204
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:41,280
human can provide a picture that is reliable um now but then is there any way to get outside of

205
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,840
science and say is science doing it right no uh there is no such thing for for quine as first

206
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,400
philosophy again back to noir earth's ship we can't get off the ship and look down on it and judge it

207
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,040
so although quine says it does provide us with norms the they're the norms of science and we

208
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:06,320
can't judge those um so other although quine says yes other people the critics would say no

209
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:16,400
uh naturalized epistemology has become an important part of um epistemology but it

210
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,320
hasn't killed off the old-fashioned epistemology either now it's just so epistemology is just a

211
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:30,320
larger animal quine would have had it kill off all the other kinds of epistemology he he would say

212
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,360
come on haven't you seen i've told you that uh uh the old-fashioned epistemology it's obvious

213
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:45,200
that it's a pointless exercise but epistemology goes on regardless uh it's just now there's a new

214
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,480
subsection of epistemology thanks to quine and people who are influenced by him

215
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,700
you

216
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,780
you

217
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,780
you

218
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,780
you

219
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,780
you

220
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,780
you

221
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,820
you

222
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:19,040
ghettier cases are pretty much uh they multiply these aren't rare ones these aren't specifically

223
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:28,320
very um very contrived cases it's it's fairly easy to come up with cases like this in fact

224
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,840
there's some suggestion that birch and russell uh came up with his own cases uh a long time

225
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,920
previously in a book of his so that's a little bit of controversy it's it's not necessarily clear

226
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,000
that ghettier was the first person to publish on this but certainly he did a good good job of

227
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:56,400
presenting the cases and they have led to a sort of sea change in um epistemology in this kind of

228
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,200
epistemology you can so the the ghettier problem is what's missing what is the extra element that

229
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,600
we need to add um so that if you meet one two three four then you do know something that's the

230
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,920
debate or there is some suggestion that this is okay and that we can fix this and respond to

231
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,960
ghettier cases but certainly ghettier presented a challenge that epistemologists then had to meet

232
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,560
which is why this article short as it is is so famous
