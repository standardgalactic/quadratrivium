00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
So we're going to talk now about one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century,

00:08.600 --> 00:20.720
certainly most important of the American philosophers, W. V. O. Willard Van Orman Quine.

00:20.720 --> 00:32.400
He is an interesting figure. He sort of marks the transition from logical positivism into

00:32.400 --> 00:40.720
post-positivism. In that, he has a lot of sympathies with the logical positivists. There

00:40.720 --> 00:48.200
are some assumptions that the positivists had that he shares, and some would say that makes

00:48.200 --> 00:56.360
his view archaic, because some of the things that he retains from logical positivism say

00:56.360 --> 01:06.440
his critics, you shouldn't. They should be rejected. But at the same time, his view, and in

01:06.440 --> 01:16.080
particular a very famous article, if you had to rank the top analytic philosophy articles of the

01:16.080 --> 01:24.240
20th century, two dogmas of empiricism by W. V. O. Quine would be in the top five. It certainly

01:24.240 --> 01:35.760
was seen as a huge bombshell and was cited and discussed massively in the years after its release

01:35.840 --> 01:47.640
in the 50s. And in that paper, he basically attacks logical positivism. Now, reading that

01:47.640 --> 01:57.160
paper is very difficult. Quine, in general, writes, I think, beautifully, but does not

01:57.160 --> 02:07.040
write clearly. He writes as if his audience is very knowledgeable. It's like coming in

02:07.040 --> 02:13.320
in the middle of a conversation, a very erudite conversation, and it's very easy to get lost.

02:13.640 --> 02:27.760
And what also makes it hard is that Quine's whole philosophy is a big system. There are some

02:27.760 --> 02:34.360
philosophical papers that just stand alone, that are talking about a specific topic and making

02:34.360 --> 02:38.680
specific points about this specific topic. In fact, probably the majority of philosophy papers

02:38.680 --> 02:47.640
in journals are like that. Whereas each of Quine's papers is just a small picture, a small window

02:47.640 --> 02:51.720
onto a giant picture, which is his whole theory. And it's got all of these elements to hang

02:51.720 --> 02:59.800
together. Probably the best thing to read to get his theory, or at least the theory, the most

02:59.880 --> 03:08.880
famous version of the theory, is his 1960 book, Word and Object, which, of course, came after

03:08.880 --> 03:14.720
two dogmas of empiricism, and perhaps goes even further down the road that two dogmas

03:14.720 --> 03:23.720
went down. But he writes articles, he writes books, and they're all sort of little pieces

03:23.720 --> 03:30.240
of this giant picture. The other thing that kind of makes him a distinctive figure about

03:30.240 --> 03:37.240
the 20th century is that he stretched almost exactly the length of the 20th century. He

03:37.240 --> 03:46.000
was born in 1908, died in 1999, I believe I'm right in saying, and was still publishing

03:46.000 --> 03:55.800
up until the end. For example, this book Pursuit of Truth, which is more accessible than many

03:55.800 --> 04:03.120
of his books, although it's a slim volume, was published in the early 90s, the second

04:03.120 --> 04:10.400
edition I think 1992. And it's still beautifully written. I think I'm going to read you the

04:10.400 --> 04:16.640
beginning sentence of this to give you some idea of, because it sort of hints at a lot

04:16.640 --> 04:23.440
of the themes in Quine. From impacts on our sensory surfaces, we in our collective and

04:23.440 --> 04:29.560
cumulative creativity down the generations have projected our systematic theory of the

04:29.560 --> 04:35.960
external world. Our system is proving successful in predicting subsequent sensory input. How

04:35.960 --> 04:44.560
have we done it? Okay, that hints at a lot of themes in Quine. One of them, and perhaps

04:44.560 --> 04:52.400
the most important, is naturalism. Now for Quine, naturalism is the idea that there is

04:52.400 --> 05:01.280
sort of a single theory of the world. There aren't really separate disciplines. So if

05:01.280 --> 05:09.040
you do philosophy of science, there's a debate about whether or not the hard sciences are

05:09.040 --> 05:18.160
doing something different in kind from the softer sciences. And is history a social science?

05:18.160 --> 05:22.240
Are social sciences sciences? You get into all these debates and people draw lines and

05:22.240 --> 05:30.680
so on. For Quine, it's much simpler than that. It's an overall theory of the world.

05:30.680 --> 05:38.960
Now so it's a matter of decree. Philosophy isn't a separate thing. It's part of this

05:38.960 --> 05:47.400
whole approach and the point of our total theory of the world is to work from inputs

05:47.400 --> 05:53.640
to make predictions, to explain the inputs and to make predictions about future inputs.

05:53.640 --> 06:01.200
And of course, this is something he shares with the logical positivists, a keenness for

06:01.200 --> 06:07.760
science. The logical positivists, as I said, were writing in a time when Einstein was alive

06:07.760 --> 06:13.360
and making new contributions, quantum mechanics, all that stuff. Incredibly exciting time where

06:13.360 --> 06:19.360
science was making advances by leaps and bounds and it seemed to the logical positivists that

06:19.400 --> 06:28.120
philosophy was kind of stultifying. It was stuck, it hadn't made progress. So that's why they came

06:28.120 --> 06:36.200
up with their verificationist criterion of meaning that in order to be meaningful, something must

06:36.200 --> 06:43.200
be, it must be clear what kind of sentences about the world, what kind of statements about the

06:43.200 --> 06:52.200
world, facts about the world, contributes to its truth or falsity. So if nothing about the world

06:52.200 --> 06:57.080
affects whether or not a sentence you're saying is true or false, then either, according to the

06:57.080 --> 07:04.080
logical positivists, you're stating an analytic truth that is true in virtue of the meanings of

07:04.080 --> 07:12.480
the words contained within, like all bachelors are unmarried, or you're stating nonsense. And as

07:12.560 --> 07:18.680
we saw, the logical positivists thought that huge swathes of what had been counted respectable

07:18.680 --> 07:25.800
academic discussion were in fact nonsense and bullshit and should be trashed. In this, they

07:25.800 --> 07:32.320
were following David Hume, who'd made a very similar claim centuries before. But for example,

07:32.320 --> 07:39.880
so to give an example, AJ Air, who was our sort of English language popularizer of logical

07:39.880 --> 07:48.280
positivism, says that he's not an atheist, because an atheist believe that God does not exist is a

07:48.280 --> 07:54.480
meaningful sentence, whereas he Air doesn't think that any talk of God is meaningful, because it

07:54.480 --> 08:03.400
fails the verification standard, you cannot, there are no facts about the world that would refute,

08:03.640 --> 08:14.560
that would affect either positively or negatively the truth of God exists. Okay, so part of the

08:15.240 --> 08:25.960
positivist project rests on these distinctions that we've, we've come across before. There's a set of

08:25.960 --> 08:33.080
pairs of distinctions that are have been seen as very significant down through the history of

08:33.080 --> 08:40.880
Western philosophy. There's analytic versus synthetic. This is to do with meaning. And for

08:40.880 --> 08:51.160
the logical positivists, as for thinkers before them, analytic sentences are ones that are true

08:51.160 --> 09:00.280
million virtue of the words involved. And that, so for example, Air would say, experience is

09:00.280 --> 09:07.000
relevant to the confirmation of individual synthetic statements, like grass is green, but

09:07.000 --> 09:17.680
not analytic sentences, like all bachelors are unmarried. So, in other words, synthetic statements

09:17.680 --> 09:27.120
are ones that are actually saying something about the world, because they can be verified or falsified

09:27.480 --> 09:36.080
by facts about the world, whereas analytic statements are not. So, this kind of robbs analytic

09:36.080 --> 09:45.280
statements of some significance, because they're like true by definition. Now, the positivists

09:45.280 --> 09:51.200
didn't think that this was necessarily a bad thing, because they thought that math, all the

09:51.240 --> 09:58.160
statements of math were analytic. And in fact, they said that what philosophy was doing was trying

09:58.160 --> 10:06.720
to find interesting analytic truths. So, philosophers still had a job to do. Philosophy wasn't

10:06.720 --> 10:13.520
nonsense, like theology, for example. But its role was limited to talking about analytic truths,

10:13.520 --> 10:19.560
because the scientists were dealing with synthetic truths. Scientists had the best equipment for

10:19.600 --> 10:26.840
testing the world and coming up with new claims about the world, like electrons exist or something

10:26.840 --> 10:39.480
like that. So, there's this clean divide between sentences whose meaning is unaffected by facts

10:39.480 --> 10:46.040
about the world, because its meaning is solely dependent on the words that make it up, true by

10:46.040 --> 10:51.120
definition, and sentences that are actually meaningful, because they're saying something

10:51.120 --> 10:56.640
about the world. This is the analytic synthetic distinction, and it is the first of the two

10:56.640 --> 11:09.920
dogmas of empiricism that Quine is attacking. But notice, as I said, he actually agrees with the

11:10.280 --> 11:17.600
positivists about a lot of things. For example, Quine is a huge fan of science. Science is perhaps

11:17.600 --> 11:26.600
the most important part of this total theory of the world. But where he disagrees with the

11:26.600 --> 11:32.320
logical positivists is this, in this idea that there's a clear dividing line. Here's science,

11:32.320 --> 11:39.440
here's philosophy. Science is doing empirical stuff, philosophy is doing analytic stuff. And in

11:39.440 --> 11:49.400
fact, because he denies that there's a distinction, Quine has interesting ideas about the way

11:49.400 --> 11:59.400
philosophy should proceed. A famous work of his is called epistemology naturalized. Epistemology

11:59.400 --> 12:05.000
is a branch of philosophy that typically has been concerned with questions of knowledge. That's

12:05.120 --> 12:14.520
what epistemology is about. What can we know? And a lot of epistemology before Quine was devoted

12:14.520 --> 12:20.320
to sort of analyzing the notion of knowledge. What is it to know something and coming up with a

12:20.320 --> 12:27.680
definition of knowledge? Quine is not interested in that in tall. He says that epistemology should

12:27.680 --> 12:36.600
be about sort of more nitty gritty issues like how it is that children learn a theory of the

12:36.600 --> 12:45.760
world. It should be like a branch of science where we're studying how humans acquire information. So

12:45.760 --> 12:54.400
it should be done like science. It is naturalized. In other words, it is a branch of what we would

12:54.440 --> 13:02.560
normally call science. And part of that follows from him denying that there is a clear distinction

13:02.560 --> 13:08.280
between analytic and synthetic. So that's one pair, analytic, synthetic. That's to do with,

13:08.280 --> 13:17.640
that's a semantic distinction between how the meanings of sentences are determined. According

13:17.640 --> 13:26.160
to the positivists with their verification standard, analytic sentences are not verified by

13:26.160 --> 13:32.600
experience. They're true by definition. Synthetic sentences are verified by experience. Okay,

13:32.600 --> 13:41.040
there are two other related distinctions. There's the a priori versus a posteriori. This is an

13:41.040 --> 13:47.720
epistemological distinction. That is, so knowledge a priori is supposedly knowledge that you have

13:47.720 --> 13:54.360
without any experience. Now, if you've taken an early modern class, you will notice that there's a

13:54.360 --> 14:03.600
big divide between the empiricists like Locke, Barkley and Hume, who minimize the amount of a

14:03.600 --> 14:10.120
priori truth to essentially nothing. They say we are born tabula rasa, which is Latin for blank

14:10.200 --> 14:18.440
slate. We don't know anything. And everything we all the knowledge we have is we have to have

14:18.440 --> 14:29.080
acquired by sensory inputs. So empiricism is the idea that the important knowledge comes from

14:29.080 --> 14:35.880
experience comes from sensory inputs. Quine is an empiricist, even though he's talking about two

14:35.880 --> 14:41.840
dogmas of empiricism, that doesn't mean that he's saying empiricism is what's bad. He's saying,

14:41.840 --> 14:47.640
these things that empiricists have believed have held back empiricism. And in fact, we should get

14:47.640 --> 14:55.560
rid of these dogmas and we will improve empiricism. So he's a big fan of empiricism. And that's clear

14:55.560 --> 15:03.800
actually from that opening sentence that I just read you. I will read it to you again. He says,

15:04.720 --> 15:13.720
from impacts on our sensory surfaces, we in our collective and cumulative creativity down the

15:13.720 --> 15:19.360
generations have projected our systematic theory of the external world. So you know,

15:19.360 --> 15:26.560
that's an empiricist statement. It says that where we get our information is impacts on our sensory

15:26.560 --> 15:37.360
surfaces. So a priori versus a posteriori seems to be it's a different distinction than

15:37.360 --> 15:43.960
analytic synthetic. Analytics synthetic is about meanings. A priori versus a posteriori is about

15:43.960 --> 15:54.680
knowledge, how we can know things. But with some rare exceptions like Kant, they're taken to track

15:54.720 --> 16:00.840
each other. So it was it was assumed that all a priori truths were at analytic truths and vice

16:00.840 --> 16:08.640
versa. And the third distinction is sometimes called a metaphysical distinction. It's a fact

16:08.640 --> 16:16.680
about the world. And it's a distinction between necessary and contingent. So a necessary truth

16:16.680 --> 16:23.320
is one that cannot possibly be false. And a contingent truth is one that is in fact true,

16:23.360 --> 16:29.880
but could be otherwise. So grass is green, of course, is is contingently true. It is true. But

16:29.880 --> 16:36.960
there is no contradiction in imagining blue grass that that isn't a contradiction in terms. So you

16:36.960 --> 16:43.920
can see that this is very close to the idea of analytic. A contradiction in terms is is how we

16:43.920 --> 16:50.840
would explain the denying an analytic truth. Alright, so we've got these three pairs. Analytics

16:50.880 --> 17:01.440
synthetic, a priori, a posteriori, and necessary and contingent. And the a post the synthetic,

17:01.440 --> 17:12.360
a posteriori and contingent are taken to all overlap. And the analytic, a priori, and necessary

17:12.360 --> 17:19.440
are taken to all overlap. But there has to be a distinction between them for the logical positive

17:19.480 --> 17:28.800
ists project to go through, because they want to make this clear dividing line between sentences

17:28.800 --> 17:34.400
that actually say stuff about the real world, and the kind of stuff that math and philosophy does.

17:34.400 --> 17:43.080
It's still valuable, but it's different in kind from what natural science does. So these claims

17:43.680 --> 17:55.000
are held by the logical positivists. The logical positivists actually make one further claim about

17:55.000 --> 18:02.640
these three pairs of concepts. They claim that the most basic of the three pairs is the analytic

18:02.640 --> 18:08.640
synthetic, and that you can explain the other two in terms of that. So all necessary and a

18:08.680 --> 18:15.160
priori truths are analytic. An analytic, analyticity is needed to explain necessity. In other words,

18:15.160 --> 18:22.920
so not only they're not just claiming that all three overlap, they're also claiming that one of

18:22.920 --> 18:32.160
them is explanatorily prior. So analyticity is the key that explains, it's the foundation that

18:32.200 --> 18:45.080
explains necessary and a priori. So if you believe that, then it better be the case that you can

18:45.080 --> 18:56.000
give an account of analyticity that is independent of your account of necessity and a priori city,

18:56.840 --> 19:04.360
because you're saying that what explains necessity and a priori city is analyticity. So you better

19:04.360 --> 19:10.200
not do it in reverse, otherwise you're doing circular reasoning. And that is exactly what

19:10.200 --> 19:17.560
Quine said is going on. Quine in the early sections of this paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism,

19:18.520 --> 19:27.200
actually says, okay, let's see if we can come up with the independent explanation of what it is to

19:27.200 --> 19:34.880
be analytic that the positivists need in order to explain the other two and in order to make this

19:34.880 --> 19:47.160
clear cut distinction. And he says, okay, analyticity, an analytic truth is one that, well,

19:47.240 --> 19:51.680
an obvious example of an analytic truth, particularly if you're a big fan of logic, which

19:51.680 --> 20:00.760
Quine was actually Quine wrote his dissertation on Russell and Whitehead's famous book,

20:00.760 --> 20:09.120
Principia Mathematica, which is practically all logic. So Quine was a made contributions to

20:09.120 --> 20:16.960
logic, and that's how he started out. So big fan of logic. He says, well, the best candidate for

20:17.160 --> 20:31.000
analyticity is logical truth, because it's clear that P or not P is true by definition. That is,

20:31.000 --> 20:39.800
P or not P is something that is true in all possible circumstances. Because if you assume as

20:40.760 --> 20:48.520
Quine does and as logic, certainly the logic that he was dealing with does, that P has to be true

20:48.520 --> 20:56.480
or false. Well, even if you don't know the truth of P, P has to be true or false, and not P has to

20:56.480 --> 21:02.880
be the opposite. And in a disjunction, if one of them is true, then the whole thing is true. But in

21:02.880 --> 21:09.440
P or not P, one of them has to be true, because P is either true, in which case, it's true and the

21:09.440 --> 21:14.800
whole disjunction is true, or P is false, in which case not P is true, in which case the whole

21:14.800 --> 21:22.640
disjunction is true. So that's known as a logical tautology, something that has to be true. If that's

21:22.640 --> 21:27.960
what analyticity was, then we do have a coherent notion of it. But the trouble is that's a very

21:27.960 --> 21:35.440
narrow set of sentences. And that doesn't include things like all bachelor's are unmarried, because

21:35.560 --> 21:46.880
that's not P or not P. So for that to count as also like a logical truth, you need to be able to

21:46.880 --> 21:54.120
translate statements like all bachelor's are unmarried into a logical truth, which it isn't so

21:54.120 --> 22:01.560
far. All bachelor's are unmarried is not on its face a logical truth, a tautology. But you, if you

22:01.560 --> 22:10.520
can translate it into one, then that logical truth or anything translatable into a logical truth

22:10.520 --> 22:19.120
would be the kind of explanation of analyticity that the positivists could use, and it would save

22:19.120 --> 22:26.160
their project. The trouble is, in order to translate something like all bachelor's are unmarried

22:26.200 --> 22:32.760
into a logical truth, you need the notion of synonymy. You need to be able to say, well,

22:33.000 --> 22:42.760
bachelor means the same as unmarried man. So you need a notion of synonymy. So in other words,

22:42.760 --> 22:49.080
before you can explain necessary and a priori in terms of analyticity, you need to explain

22:49.080 --> 22:55.880
analyticity in terms of synonymy. But it better not be the case that synonymy is relying on a

22:55.920 --> 23:00.400
notion of necessity and a priori. Otherwise, you've still got the circle going on, and you haven't

23:00.440 --> 23:10.200
explained any of them. It's a bit like there's a famous story about a dictionary that has a

23:10.200 --> 23:18.960
definition of grass that says grass is the stuff that grazing animals eat. So suppose you want

23:18.960 --> 23:23.240
to know, is wheat a grass? I better look up the definition of grass. So you look up the definition

23:23.240 --> 23:31.720
of grass. Grass is what grazing animals eat. Have you learned what grass is yet? Well, it depends

23:31.720 --> 23:38.040
on the definition of grazing. So you look up grazing and it says eating grass. You haven't

23:38.040 --> 23:43.320
learned anything because it's circular. If the same thing is happening with analyticity and

23:43.320 --> 23:50.720
necessity and a priori, a priori city, then none of them have been explained and they're empty

23:50.720 --> 23:58.640
concepts, according to quite. Okay, so here's the suggestion. We can explain analyticity as logic

23:58.760 --> 24:04.640
cultures or sentences that can be translated into logical truths. Well, the idea of translation

24:04.640 --> 24:08.880
requires synonymy, because if you're going to translate one sentence into another, they have to

24:08.880 --> 24:17.480
be synonymous. Okay, what's synonymy? Well, here's a promising suggestion for synonymy. Synonymy is

24:17.480 --> 24:28.720
intersubstitutivity salva veritate. This is Leibniz's phrase. It means two phrases are are

24:28.720 --> 24:35.880
synonymous. If for any sentence that is true, you can replace one of the phrases with the other

24:35.960 --> 24:42.480
without affecting the truth value of the sentences. So all unmarried men are unmarried. Take out

24:42.600 --> 24:47.640
unmarried man replaced by bachelor and you get all bachelor's unmarried. And it looks like you

24:47.640 --> 24:53.280
don't change the truth value of the sentence. So it looks like, hey, we've got we've got something

24:53.280 --> 25:00.240
here. We've got a standard for explaining synonymy, which we can then use to explain analyticity,

25:00.240 --> 25:05.800
which we can use to explain these other two. The trouble is, as coin says, you've got to make a

25:05.800 --> 25:12.240
distinction between sentences of what's called an extensional language, like logic, logic is an

25:12.280 --> 25:24.280
extensional language. That is, extensional means, well, it just meaning is explained in terms of

25:24.320 --> 25:33.240
reference. So for example, logic explains what green is, extensionally. So if you talk about a

25:33.240 --> 25:40.800
predicate in logic, like green, all that there is to the predicate green is not some notion of

25:40.800 --> 25:46.320
greenness, but rather all the green things. So what is the meaning of green in an extensional

25:46.320 --> 25:54.960
language? It's all the green things. The trouble with that is two terms that we would say are not

25:55.000 --> 26:04.760
synonymous, have the same extension, that is, the same group of objects are covered by them. So

26:04.760 --> 26:13.120
according to an extensional theory, they mean the same. But renate, which means having kidneys and

26:13.120 --> 26:18.440
coordinate, which means having a heart, are true of the same group of animals. All the animals that

26:18.440 --> 26:27.800
are renate are coordinate. So this notion of synonymy would produce the result that renate is

26:27.800 --> 26:33.000
synonymous with coordinate. And of course, it isn't. We know that renate and coordinate mean two

26:33.000 --> 26:40.200
different things. Creature with a heart is different from creature with a kidneys. So this

26:40.440 --> 26:45.600
would if this worked, it would solve the problem because this is an independent non circular

26:45.600 --> 26:52.840
definition of synonymy. Trouble is, it doesn't explain our concept of synonymy. Well, so you an

26:52.840 --> 27:00.920
extensional language doesn't work. What about an intentional language? Extensional intentional, it's

27:00.920 --> 27:05.760
like the distinction like Frager's distinction between sense and reference. Reference is

27:05.760 --> 27:12.200
extensional, sense is intentional. Well, intentional languages like English, English is

27:12.200 --> 27:22.240
intentional, have these contexts called modal contexts that use like it is necessary that. So if

27:22.240 --> 27:31.480
we're allowed to use intersubstitutivity into intentional languages, then renate and coordinate

27:31.520 --> 27:41.040
are not intersubstitutional salva veritate. Because it is not true, it is true that it is

27:41.040 --> 27:45.760
necessary that all coordinates are coordinate. That's true. But if you take out coordinate and

27:45.760 --> 27:51.880
replace it with renate, it is not true that it is necessary that all renates are coordinate. Because

27:51.920 --> 27:57.960
it's possible, we can imagine an animal with a heart but no kidneys. There aren't any in the real

27:57.960 --> 28:06.480
world, which is what an extensional language deals with, but we can imagine one possibly. So this,

28:06.520 --> 28:13.400
if we're allowed to use intentional concepts, then not only does synonymy is intersubstitutivity

28:13.440 --> 28:20.280
salva veritate appear to give an independent definition of, of analyticity, which we need. But

28:20.280 --> 28:25.080
it also appears to match our notion, our intuitive notion of synonymy, because it says, it says the

28:25.080 --> 28:30.160
bachelor and unmarried man are synonymous, but renate and coordinate aren't, gives the right

28:30.160 --> 28:39.080
results. But of course, it uses the notion of necessity, which is supposedly being explained by

28:39.080 --> 28:49.160
analyticity. So it's circular. So you're, you face a dilemma in trying to explain synonymy. Either

28:49.160 --> 28:55.080
you come up with this version of synonymy that doesn't match what we want it to, which Quine is

28:55.080 --> 29:00.480
going to say, actually, that's your best bet. This, if we're going to use the notion of synonymy, this

29:00.480 --> 29:07.600
is the best you can do, which is going to produce some very radical effects that is related to as

29:07.640 --> 29:14.760
indeterminacy of translation, as we'll see in a second. Or you, you try and get it closer to our

29:14.760 --> 29:20.200
intuitive notion, but then you've still got the circle. So consequently, we should abandon this

29:20.200 --> 29:29.080
analytic-synthetic distinction. We cannot make a clear distinction. Now, Grace and Strawson, whom

29:29.080 --> 29:38.240
we've come across, this is Paul Grace and Peter Strawson, or HP Grace and PF Strawson, as they're

29:38.240 --> 29:45.000
usually known, who are part of the ordinary language school, which is flourishing in Oxford at the

29:45.000 --> 29:51.440
same time that Quine is writing. Now, the ordinary language school in Oxford is influenced by the

29:51.440 --> 29:58.800
later Wittgenstein. The later Wittgenstein of the philosophical investigations in the Blue and

29:58.800 --> 30:08.800
Brown books and various others rejects most of what the early Wittgenstein of the Traktatus says.

30:09.680 --> 30:15.360
But it's the early Wittgenstein of the Traktatus who is very influential on the logical positivists. So

30:15.360 --> 30:21.840
if you follow all that, you can see that Grace and Strawson are no fans of logical positivism. However,

30:22.720 --> 30:31.360
they retain these claims of logical positivism, because even though they reject the verificationist

30:31.360 --> 30:38.880
theory of meaning, and for example, Grace has his account of meaning in terms of Uttara's intentions,

30:41.440 --> 30:47.360
and in general, they talk about meaning as something that humans do. That's Strawson's notion of

30:47.360 --> 30:53.760
referring rather than denoting, where Russell talks about denoting, which is what sentences do.

30:53.760 --> 30:59.760
Strawson talks about referring, which is what people do. So they're no fans of logical positivism,

30:59.760 --> 31:08.000
and yet they do share these two claims. I'm drawing on the work of Scott Somes in saying this. In fact,

31:08.960 --> 31:14.240
I'm presenting you Scott Somes' analysis from his book on analytic philosophy.

31:18.160 --> 31:27.760
I'll say a little bit about his suggestion for an alternative version of synonymy that appears to

31:28.720 --> 31:34.400
not rely on necessity, and therefore might appear to dodge the circle. We can talk about that in a

31:34.400 --> 31:40.480
minute. But anyway, Grace and Strawson write this famous paper, A Defense of a Dogma, and the dogma

31:40.480 --> 31:47.680
they're talking about is the first one, the analytic-synthetic distinction. Because when

31:49.200 --> 31:55.120
Quine produces this argument against analytic-synthetic distinction, it's incredibly radical,

31:55.120 --> 32:02.400
because this is a distinction that it has been agreed on for hundreds of years, and hundreds of

32:02.400 --> 32:08.160
very different philosophers, the empiricists and the rationalists, have agreed on this distinction,

32:09.040 --> 32:14.000
that you can distinguish clearly between analytic truths and synthetic truths. It's just

32:14.880 --> 32:22.720
there's an obvious and very useful distinction. And they say, look, so now all you've done, Quine,

32:22.720 --> 32:28.880
is you've shown at best what you've shown is that you can't define analytic without using

32:28.880 --> 32:37.040
necessary or vice versa, and the same for a priori-city. In other words, they're sort of in

32:37.040 --> 32:43.120
a circle. But just because you can't define them without getting out of a circle doesn't mean

32:45.040 --> 32:51.680
that there aren't obvious examples of analytic truths and obvious examples of necessary truths.

32:51.680 --> 32:58.400
So maybe we can't define them, but we can point to, okay, I can't give a good definition of it,

32:58.400 --> 33:05.440
but I know that that's one and that's the other. This is very similar to a classic quote from a

33:05.440 --> 33:14.240
Supreme Court justice, where a case came up about whether a particular piece of artwork was art or

33:14.240 --> 33:19.600
pornography. And if it's art, it's protected by the First Amendment, and if it's pornography,

33:19.600 --> 33:24.400
it's not protected. So you need to be able to distinguish between art and pornography. Both

33:24.480 --> 33:30.080
of them can involve nudity, both of them can involve depicting sex acts. So how do you distinguish

33:30.080 --> 33:37.040
it? And famously, the Supreme Court justice says, I know it when I see it. So what he's saying is

33:37.040 --> 33:42.000
exactly what Gries and Strawson are saying, even if we can't give a good definition of it, that

33:42.000 --> 33:46.240
doesn't mean there isn't a difference. I know that that's pornography and that's art. I know that

33:46.240 --> 33:52.320
that's analytic and that's synthetic. And they point to not just the fact that there has been

33:52.320 --> 33:59.040
consistent usage of these, but also that you can teach them to students and say this is an analytic

33:59.040 --> 34:04.160
and this is synthetic. Got it now? Okay, and then you can give them new examples that they haven't

34:04.160 --> 34:11.040
encountered before, and they all sort them into the same groups. So clearly, they have mastered

34:11.040 --> 34:19.280
a concept that they can apply to novel instances, and they all reproduce the same results, which is

34:19.280 --> 34:24.240
good evidence that it's a genuine concept. Because if it was just made up bullshit,

34:24.240 --> 34:28.480
then they would be getting it ran, they wouldn't get the same distinctions, they would just

34:29.200 --> 34:35.120
process them randomly. But they have mastered something. And of course, this is very important

34:35.120 --> 34:40.400
if you believe as the later Wittgenstein did, and so Gries and Strawson were influenced by that,

34:40.400 --> 34:45.520
that meaning is use. If they can use it in the same way, then it is a meaningful distinction.

34:46.080 --> 34:54.240
And the other point that they make is that if you get rid of the notion of synonymy,

34:54.240 --> 34:58.320
as Quine is doing here, as part of his attack on analyticity,

34:59.280 --> 35:06.080
this is much more radical than Quine lets on in two dogmas, because it appears to undermine

35:06.080 --> 35:13.760
the very notion of meaning itself. Because if you can't say, what is it to say that

35:13.760 --> 35:21.760
two things are synonymous, they mean the same. If there is no notion of synonymy,

35:21.760 --> 35:27.200
then there is no notion of means the same as. And if there's no notion of means the same as,

35:27.200 --> 35:33.680
then we can't say what something means. Because if we could say what something means,

35:33.680 --> 35:38.320
then there would be a notion of means the same as. Because if we can say what this means,

35:39.280 --> 35:45.360
what this means, then we could explain synonymy in the terms of, well those things both mean

35:45.360 --> 35:50.880
the same. So if we haven't got synonymy, that shows that we can't have meaning, because if we

35:50.880 --> 35:58.720
did have meaning, we'd have synonymy. So if there's no synonymy, there is no meaning, and that's just

35:58.720 --> 36:04.480
absurd, say Gries and Strawson. So there must be something wrong with your argument attacking

36:04.480 --> 36:11.680
this distinction, quine. Well, hold my beer, says quine, except he didn't, because that

36:12.320 --> 36:20.000
cliche hadn't come up then. And quine's more of a martini drinker. He was a pretty heavy drinker,

36:20.000 --> 36:25.680
I'm told, but yeah, it would have been martinis. I mean, he's picked your quine as the madman

36:26.000 --> 36:32.400
era. He was very much into wearing suits and drinking martinis. Anyway,

36:34.880 --> 36:43.440
after, so two dogmas comes out early 50s, this comes out as a response. And then in 1960,

36:43.440 --> 36:52.400
quine publishes Word and Object, where he makes clear his theory of indeterminacy of translation.

36:52.400 --> 37:00.400
We'll talk about that in a little bit. But let me just, before we leave this

37:01.680 --> 37:07.120
attack on the first dogma, Somes, in the chapter where he's talking about the first

37:07.120 --> 37:14.560
chapter, where the chapter where he's talking about this dogma, he suggests quine has ignored a

37:14.560 --> 37:20.320
possible definition of synonymy. Instead of using the context, it is necessary that, which of course

37:20.320 --> 37:27.840
relies on necessary and maintains the circle, you could say x believes that. So for example,

37:30.160 --> 37:39.360
the other thing with it is necessary that is some necessary truths don't appear to be

37:39.760 --> 37:52.000
the analytic truths, because analytic truths appear to be narrower than necessary truth. Now,

37:52.000 --> 38:01.440
in saying this, Somes is denying that analyticity and necessity match up exactly. So he's abandoning

38:01.440 --> 38:12.240
these. And the reason why quine didn't consider this is because he and the positivists basically

38:12.240 --> 38:19.360
shared these assumptions. But what Somes is suggesting is that if we give up the idea that

38:19.360 --> 38:29.280
analyticity and necessity perfectly match up, then we can come up with a definition in terms of

38:29.280 --> 38:37.520
believes that. I should give some context here. Quine publishes where an object in 1960. Quine

38:37.520 --> 38:45.760
basically rules the 60s, but in 1970, Kripke comes on the scene and Kripke in the lectures

38:46.400 --> 38:50.800
that he gives in 1970 that are published in 1980 as the book naming a necessity,

38:51.440 --> 38:58.080
gives an account of necessity that marks it as completely independent from analyticity and

38:58.080 --> 39:05.440
a priori. And in fact, Kripke argues that they don't line up neatly and argues that you can have

39:06.080 --> 39:13.280
a posteriori necessary truths. So that goes across the divide. Like, for example,

39:13.280 --> 39:19.760
Hesperus is phosphorus. That is, the morning star, the thing that the Greeks named Hesperus,

39:19.760 --> 39:24.800
which is the evening star, is the same thing that the Greeks named phosphorus, which is the

39:24.800 --> 39:30.640
morning star. They're both the planet Venus. That is something that has to be learned a posteriori.

39:30.640 --> 39:36.560
You can't know that a priori without experience. And yet it is a necessary truth according to

39:36.560 --> 39:42.080
Kripke's account. And Kripke's account was very influential and Somes clearly agrees with it.

39:43.040 --> 39:51.040
So it's no problem if we end up with a concept of analyticity that is narrower than necessity.

39:51.920 --> 40:01.200
Now, he says X believes blank. So if, is it true that X believes that renate,

40:02.880 --> 40:09.280
that, you know, X believes that renates are renate? That's true. X believes that renates

40:09.280 --> 40:15.360
are chordate. That's false. So that produces the right result that renate and chordate are not

40:16.160 --> 40:25.520
synonymous. But the trouble with this is, if we allow X believes that, these are called

40:25.520 --> 40:35.360
propositional attitude contexts, it will remove a lot of the truths of mathematics from being

40:35.360 --> 40:42.320
analytic truths. And it will also remove anything interesting as an analytic truth because X is

40:42.320 --> 40:49.920
only going to believe that, you know, something is substituted, you're only going to get exactly

40:49.920 --> 40:57.360
the same result in these contexts for things that the average person can instantly see are the same.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.920
So in other words, you're not even going to get like two to the power eight and 256 as

41:06.640 --> 41:16.160
synonymous, because not everybody can understand that. So they don't, they understand 256, but

41:16.160 --> 41:23.360
they won't know that that's replaceable in all instances with two to the power eight.

41:24.240 --> 41:30.400
So this is going to produce a much narrower range of analytic truths. And as the positivists

41:30.400 --> 41:37.200
wanted to reserve a lot of interesting and surprising analytic truths as the province of

41:37.200 --> 41:43.280
philosophy, all of those would kind of disappear under this version of analyticity and philosophy,

41:43.280 --> 41:49.120
the role that was set aside for philosophy would just vanish under this definition.

41:51.040 --> 41:59.200
Okay, dogma number two, the second of the two dogmas of empiricism, radical reductionism.

42:00.800 --> 42:06.080
And it's very much related to the idea of synthetic truths. So a synthetic truth

42:06.080 --> 42:14.720
is one that can be falsified by experience. Now, this will include a lot of the generalizations

42:14.720 --> 42:27.840
of science, which are not necessarily immediately falsifiable. So obviously, testable synthetic

42:27.840 --> 42:38.400
propositions are, you know, that that dog is brown, because you can go and examine the dog

42:38.400 --> 42:46.560
closely to see what color it is. But generalizations of science, f equals ma are going to require

42:48.240 --> 42:54.720
a set of other conditions that specify the appropriate conditions for experimentally

42:54.720 --> 43:00.800
testing them. And it's only when you add all of those assumptions to the claim f equals ma

43:00.800 --> 43:12.240
that you that it becomes testable. However, what what the positivists thought is that basically

43:12.240 --> 43:18.160
you could take a synthetic claim, add a bunch of other analytic claims. So have the synthetic

43:18.160 --> 43:24.880
claim plus a bunch of other things. And it will logically imply something that if we can observe

43:24.880 --> 43:32.000
the negation of that, then that will falsify the synthetic claim. And because it can be falsified

43:32.000 --> 43:38.160
or confirmed, it is a synthetic truth, it is susceptible to being tested by experience.

43:39.200 --> 43:44.880
So someone like air would say, and this is again taken from Somes, experience is relevant to the

43:44.880 --> 43:53.120
confirmation of individual synthetic but not analytic sentences. Now, Quine says, Quine points out

43:53.120 --> 43:59.200
that the logical positivists are the heirs of the empiricists, the British empiricists like

43:59.200 --> 44:07.440
Locke, Barkley and Hume. And the British empiricist says the meanings of individual terms are our

44:07.440 --> 44:14.000
sensory experiences. So something like red is explained in terms of our sensory experiences.

44:14.000 --> 44:22.160
What the logical positivists did that was an advance on those 18th century thinkers is say that

44:22.160 --> 44:32.240
it's not the individual words that are testable, that are the meaning of which we learn from our

44:32.240 --> 44:41.760
experience, it's sentences. And that's important, because an obvious problem for empiricists is

44:41.760 --> 44:49.680
what about words that don't talk about the world, what about and and or and things like that. If

44:49.680 --> 44:54.960
you're going to say to be meaningful, they have to be susceptible, they have to be testable by

44:54.960 --> 45:05.920
experience, what do you do with that? So the logical positivists and under the influence of

45:05.920 --> 45:14.640
someone like Russell have come up with ways to explain the meanings, an extra way to explain the

45:14.640 --> 45:22.080
meanings, role that they play in in sentences. But still, the unit of meaning is the sentence.

45:22.080 --> 45:28.320
So according to the logical positivists, words have meaning merely because of the role they play

45:28.320 --> 45:35.600
in a sentence. And if you remember Russell's theory of descriptions said that his analysis of a

45:35.600 --> 45:42.880
definite description like the king of France didn't have meaning by itself in abstraction,

45:44.000 --> 45:50.560
because it doesn't actually pick out anything in the real world. It only had meaning when it you

45:50.560 --> 45:57.920
put it in a sentence. So in other words, the meaning of a term is acquired from the sentence.

45:57.920 --> 46:06.080
It's the sentence that is the vehicle of meaning. Quine says good advance logical positivists on

46:06.080 --> 46:11.440
going from words as the unit of meaning to sentences as the unit of meaning, but you didn't go far

46:11.440 --> 46:17.520
enough. In fact, the unit of meaning is not individual sentences. It's our entire theory of

46:17.520 --> 46:22.720
the world. That is the thing that's meaningful and sentences insofar as they're meaningful

46:23.360 --> 46:28.800
acquire that meaning in the context of the entire theory. So just as the positivists said

46:28.800 --> 46:35.440
words acquire meaning in the context of a sentence. So Quine says sentences acquire meaning in the

46:35.440 --> 46:42.320
context of the theory itself. This is part of his holism, which I'm going to explain in a bit more

46:42.320 --> 46:47.840
detail. All right. So Ayer says experience the relevance to the confirmation of individual

46:47.840 --> 46:53.600
synthetic but not analytic sentences. Quine, of course, has said that we can't make this

46:53.600 --> 47:03.600
distinction. And in fact, it is it is never experienced is never relevant to the confirmation

47:03.600 --> 47:10.960
of individual sentences. Experiences relevant to the confirmation of the total theory. So we have

47:10.960 --> 47:18.960
a total theory of the world that makes predictions about the world. And experience is relevant to

47:18.960 --> 47:29.040
the confirmation of that, but not to individual sentences. What does he mean? Well, you might

47:29.040 --> 47:37.200
think, okay, look, I can imagine a must be right, because think of a synthetic sentence like,

47:37.920 --> 47:46.800
I don't know, that dog is brown or whatever. Surely that is confirmable or deniable by sensory

47:46.800 --> 47:51.760
experience going over and looking at the damn dog. Surely that will determine whether or not

47:51.760 --> 47:58.960
that individual sentence by itself is true or false. Quine says no, it's not that simple,

47:58.960 --> 48:09.840
because our experience now, except in very rare sentences. Actually, here's Quine says that there

48:09.840 --> 48:18.800
are. So there are sentences that are like what Ayer says, are all synthetic sentences. They're

48:18.800 --> 48:25.760
called observation sentences. And they're very specific. And they're at the sort of periphery

48:25.760 --> 48:34.640
of our theory. Quine has this analogy that our theory is like an upturned bowl. Actually,

48:34.640 --> 48:41.760
he uses the analogy of web, where if you take a bowl and you turn upside down, and the edge of

48:41.760 --> 48:49.680
the bowl is where our theory of the world interacts with the world. So the world is the table, the

48:49.760 --> 48:56.400
bowl is our theory of it. There's an edge where they interact. And that is observation sentences,

48:56.400 --> 49:03.920
where they are directly confirmable or deniable. But they are very specific and very narrow.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.960
They wouldn't even be things like there is a brown dog there. They would be,

49:08.240 --> 49:13.120
depending on your theory, they would be having a certain kind of experience.

49:14.000 --> 49:23.680
So, you know, having read, actually, Quine disagrees with the classic empiricist because

49:23.680 --> 49:29.680
he's a Gestalt empiricist. He doesn't believe that we have like 2D experiences. We can have

49:29.680 --> 49:37.440
3D experiences at once. So he disagrees in the content of sensory input. But he does agree

49:37.520 --> 49:44.480
that observation sentences are confirmed or denied by our sensory experience.

49:45.280 --> 49:52.400
Okay, the vast majority of all of our statements are going to be not observation sentences.

49:52.400 --> 49:57.280
They're going to be part of the bowl. At the top of the bowl, at the most furthest removed from the

49:57.280 --> 50:04.960
edge, are our most theoretic sentences, like Aristotle's Laws of Thought, like the Law of

50:04.960 --> 50:14.080
Non-Contradiction. Now, Quine thinks that any non-observation sentence, which is the vast

50:14.080 --> 50:20.000
majority of them, can be held true or can be rejected on the basis of any experience.

50:20.560 --> 50:25.760
What the hell is he talking about? Well, here is an example that is making a slightly different

50:25.760 --> 50:32.800
point. But I've always loved this example because it's a really good illustration of why it is

50:32.800 --> 50:40.400
that sensory experience isn't directly relevant to specific claims. It's relevant to a bunch of

50:40.400 --> 50:48.880
claims, any one of which we can choose to reject. We are not forced to say, okay, that experience

50:48.880 --> 50:57.120
made us reject that statement. That experience might be definitely inconsistent with our current

50:57.120 --> 51:02.880
theory, but we can make our current theory consistent with that experience by changing

51:02.880 --> 51:09.760
any one of a number of claims within our theory, not necessarily that that isn't a brown dot.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.160
And this example is due to a philosopher of science called Imri Lakatos.

51:15.760 --> 51:20.400
The story is about an imaginary case of planetary misbehavior. A physicist of the

51:20.400 --> 51:25.920
pre-Einsteinian era takes Newton mechanics and his Law of Gravitation, the accepted initial

51:25.920 --> 51:30.320
conditions, and calculates with their help the path of a newly discovered small planet.

51:31.440 --> 51:37.760
But, so he says, according to Newton's science, the planet should move like this. It doesn't.

51:38.800 --> 51:45.200
Now, you might say, okay, we have to change something. Now, already you could say, well,

51:45.200 --> 51:51.360
do I change my theory? Do I reject Newton's theory and look for a new one like Einstein's,

51:51.360 --> 51:57.680
or do I assume that I've measured it wrong? Well, actually, those aren't your only choices.

51:58.240 --> 52:02.880
But the planet deviates from the calculated path. Does our Newtonian physicist consider that the

52:02.880 --> 52:07.440
deviation was forbidden by Newton's theory and therefore that once established it refutes Newton's

52:07.440 --> 52:14.880
theory? No. He suggests that there must be a hitherto unknown planet, P star, which perturbs

52:14.880 --> 52:21.040
the path of P, the original planet. He calculates the mass orbit, etc., of this hypothetical

52:21.040 --> 52:26.880
planet, and then asks an experimental astronomer to test his hypothesis. The planet P star is so

52:26.880 --> 52:31.120
small that even the biggest available telescopes cannot possibly observe it. The experimental

52:31.120 --> 52:35.280
astronomer applies for a search grant to build yet a bigger one. In three years' time, the new

52:35.280 --> 52:40.080
telescope is ready. Were the unknown planet P star to be discovered, it would be held as a new

52:40.080 --> 52:45.680
victory of Newtonian science? But it is not. Does our scientist abandon Newton's theory and his

52:45.680 --> 52:50.960
idea of the perturbing planet? No. He suggests that a cloud of cosmic dust hides the planet from

52:50.960 --> 52:55.840
Earth's. He calculates the location and property of this cloud and asks for a search grant to send a

52:55.840 --> 53:00.480
satellite to test his calculation. You can see that this goes on and on. In other words,

53:01.360 --> 53:12.880
what he's doing is he's making a decision which of his sentences about the external world to hold

53:12.880 --> 53:19.440
true and which to revise. He is unwilling to reject Newtonian science despite evidence that

53:19.440 --> 53:28.560
appears to contradict it. And that's perfectly okay according to Quine because you cannot say

53:28.560 --> 53:34.240
that some of the sentences are synthetic and have to be the ones that are revised,

53:34.240 --> 53:40.320
and some are analytic. Any sentence can be revised according to experience. Even

53:41.200 --> 53:46.960
classic examples of analytic sentences like you can't have P and not P, the law of non-contradiction.

53:47.600 --> 53:52.720
Quine points out, and this was actually a legitimate argument, that some discoveries of

53:52.720 --> 53:59.600
quantum mechanics appear to threaten the law of non-contradiction. Like in the two-slit experiment,

53:59.600 --> 54:05.520
electrons appear to be in two places at once. The same electron appears to be in two places at once.

54:06.080 --> 54:12.560
What do we decide? We could say, well, it's possible for something to both be and not be in a place

54:12.560 --> 54:21.360
like Schrodinger's Cat and all that stuff. And so that is a possible conclusion we could draw.

54:21.360 --> 54:27.840
We could say, given this experimental result, the two-slit experiment, we can revise one of our

54:27.840 --> 54:34.160
most central, isolated from experience is sentences about the world that the logical

54:34.160 --> 54:40.080
positivists would have called analytic and therefore true by definition and immune to revision.

54:40.080 --> 54:45.920
There is no such thing, says Quine. Everything can be revised. Any non-observation sentence can

54:45.920 --> 54:53.840
be held true. Any changes, so analytic sentences can be held true in face of all evidence. So they

54:53.840 --> 54:59.440
would say no evidence. Someone like Ayer would say no evidence would cause us to reject the law of

54:59.440 --> 55:07.360
contradiction, non-contradiction. But Quine said no. Any sentence, even ones that you regard as

55:07.360 --> 55:15.440
synthetic can be held true. What are our guidelines in deciding which sentences to reject or hold

55:15.440 --> 55:22.480
true, like in the case of the planetary observation? They're pragmatic. They're entirely pragmatic

55:22.480 --> 55:30.640
considerations. We try and minimize the damage to our theory. Now, if enough observations happen

55:31.200 --> 55:36.640
that are inconsistent with our theory, then to make our theory consistent with the observations,

55:36.640 --> 55:43.040
we will have to make central changes to our theory. But what we do is we try and we make

55:43.040 --> 55:48.320
pragmatic considerations about which to give up, which is exactly what that scientist was doing

55:48.320 --> 55:54.800
in the case of the planet. He's saying, shall I give up my theory of the path of the planet,

55:54.800 --> 56:02.480
which requires rejecting Newton's physics, or shall I give up my theory that there wasn't

56:02.480 --> 56:07.120
another planet affecting them, which was an assumption? Shall I reject that assumption?

56:08.080 --> 56:15.920
So, Quine has the theory of the web of belief that our entire theory of the world is interconnected

56:16.480 --> 56:29.280
statements that we try and maintain consistency among, but our goal is to produce a theory that

56:29.280 --> 56:37.040
takes input, which is sensory because he's an empiricist, and produces the output of predictions

56:37.760 --> 56:50.000
about future experiences. Our goal is to maintain peak success in this. But what do we do in the face

56:50.000 --> 56:56.880
of evidence that appears to contradict claims within our total theory? Well, we make changes

56:56.880 --> 57:01.840
that minimize the damage to our theory or keep the theory simple and powerful.

57:02.240 --> 57:12.560
Indeterminacy of translation. This is another core argument of Quine's that isn't talked about

57:12.560 --> 57:17.360
in two dogmas of empiricism, but it's worth mentioning because it's one of the key claims

57:17.360 --> 57:24.640
of Quine's that made him such a radical and interesting philosopher. The indeterminacy

57:24.640 --> 57:33.200
of translation is sort of, as I said, Quine saying, in response to critics like Grayson

57:33.200 --> 57:39.440
Strawson saying, your attack on synonymy is an attack on meaning, Quine says, well, yeah,

57:40.480 --> 57:48.640
there is no such thing as synonymy, and let's do a little thought experiment that illustrates

57:48.640 --> 57:57.760
the real situation we're in. Quine is a behaviorist. Now, not a behaviorist in the sense of skinner,

57:57.760 --> 58:03.680
behavioral psychology, although he probably was at the time because skinnerian psychology was

58:03.680 --> 58:11.200
in the air. But what he definitely is to his dying day was a behaviorist about language learning.

58:11.200 --> 58:18.160
Now, in this, he differs from Chomsky. Chomsky, of course, famously says we're hardwired.

58:18.240 --> 58:25.920
Chomsky is like the descendant of the rationalists who say that certain things are known a priori.

58:27.200 --> 58:32.720
Chomsky would basically say, yeah, our language talent is hardwired into us. We don't require

58:32.720 --> 58:37.360
experience to acquire that skill. It's already there. And so there's this sort of underlying

58:37.360 --> 58:44.400
structure that all languages share. Quine is going to reject that. He's a classic empiricist who says

58:44.480 --> 58:52.160
we're blank-sates, we acquire information. Except in that he's a naturalist, he says if

58:52.160 --> 58:58.720
science chose that that's true, he would have to accept that. But he is a behaviorist about

58:58.720 --> 59:06.400
language acquisition. And we'll see the importance of that in his indeterminacy of translation.

59:07.600 --> 59:13.840
So what is indeterminacy of translation? Well, the most famous illustration of this is in Word

59:13.840 --> 59:23.200
and Object. And it involves a term that Quine invented, which is gather guy.

59:28.480 --> 59:35.440
So remember, Quine is a behaviorist, certainly about language acquisition. And he says,

59:36.320 --> 59:44.560
and he asks us to imagine a field linguist. This is kind of the linguists equivalent of

59:44.560 --> 59:53.120
Indiana Jones. What the field linguist has to do is parachute into a remote area where we've

59:53.120 --> 59:58.560
discovered a previously undiscovered tribe who speak a language that has never been exposed to

59:58.560 --> 01:00:04.800
the outside world. And the field linguist's job is to visit this tribe and come away with a translation

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:17.040
manual that can translate anything that they say into English, let's say. This is a good analogy

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:27.200
for essentially any language acquisition. Because on Quine on empiricist assumptions,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.920
we come into the world without language, and we have to acquire language. So

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:39.760
if that is possible, it certainly must be possible for a field linguist who is someone who already

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:48.400
has a language to acquire a different language, this isolated tribes language. Okay, so the field

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:57.760
linguist parachutes in. And how does he go about this? How does he go about learning the language?

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:05.440
Well, all he can do if you're an empiricist, or the only evidence he's got to go on

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:16.960
for the meanings of the words that he hears is empirical and is sensory input. So it involves

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:25.040
pointing at things and looking at the reaction of speakers of this language. Now Quine kind of

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:37.600
cheats a little, because he says the linguist already knows what gestures are affirmation

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:48.960
and denial. So what he can do then is test hypotheses about the meanings of words in exactly the way

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:55.280
that a scientist tests hypotheses about any theory he has by looking at the evidence,

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:07.040
because you know, everything is like is science in in Quine's terms. So a rabbit hops by and

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:13.680
the natives, one of the native's points at the rabbit and says gavagai. Okay, now you might think

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:22.560
great. Now, our field linguist knows that gavagai is rabbit, not so fast. First of all,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.400
it's only going to he's only going to acquire the language sentences at a time because sentences

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:41.360
are the kind of things that are have truth value that can be affirmed or denied. So gavagai could

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:48.240
be just an abbreviated sentence, just like a single word, or it could itself be an entire sentence.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:55.040
So that's one complication. But the other complication is indeterminacy of reference, that is.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:05.360
Well, before I get to that, the how would you confirm how would our field linguist confirm

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:11.040
that gavagai means rabbit? Well, you can't just take one instance and assume that means rabbit,

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.760
because of course, there are many alternatives that are consistent with the evidence that he

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:24.320
now has. So so far, he's got a piece of evidence, which is a native pointing at a rabbit and saying

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:31.440
gavagai. That is consistent with a whole bunch of translation manuals. It you could translate

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.520
gavagai as rabbit, you could translate gavagai as complete sentence, that's a rabbit.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:44.880
Gavagai could be the name of that specific rabbit. Gavagai could be oh, there goes lunch.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:52.640
Gavagai could be my kids let his pet out again. All of these are entirely consistent with the

01:03:52.640 --> 01:04:01.600
evidence that we've got so far. Now, presumably, it should be possible for the trans the field

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:09.040
linguist to narrow it down to eliminate many of these possibilities. What quines thesis is

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:17.360
essentially that well, however many eliminates, there is still going to be and literally an

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:25.920
infinite number of interpretations of the language translation manuals of the language

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.160
that are consistent with the all the information that he's acquired, but that are contradictory

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:39.680
to each other. So in other words, you can get at least, let's say just two, two translation

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:46.000
manuals, each of which is equally confirmed by the evidence, which includes, of course,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.400
the only evidence we've got so far is this one piece of evidence pointing at a rabbit and saying

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.680
Gavagai, you could have two translation manuals that are consistent with all not only all the

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:02.000
evidence that the field man linguist ever acquires, but that the field linguist could acquire.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.680
It is still going to be the case that you have two translation manuals that are inconsistent

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.520
with each other, but entirely consistent within with the effect with the facts, which of them is

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:20.160
the right one. Quine says, that's an empty question. There is no such thing as the right one,

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:27.280
which is obviously something like what Gries and Struessen were afraid of because we want to say,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.560
well, look, their language means something. And if it means something, it can't mean both of these

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.600
things because they're inconsistent with each other. So Quine would say, then let's drop the

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:45.440
notion of meaning. Both of these work. Our theory of the world is about what works. And so each of

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:51.440
these, we could, we can choose between each of these by pragmatic terms. If this one is easier

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.320
to use than this one, let's pick this one. Does this mean that one's true? No, it just means it's

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:04.400
easier for us to use. Now, what kind of things would we do to eliminate alternatives? Like,

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.040
obviously, you think, well, look, there's going to be evidence that eliminates

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.840
Gavagai as the name of that one particular rabbit. You find another rabbit and you point to the other

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:20.720
rabbit and presumably, again, this assumes that we know how to ask a question. It assumes that,

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.280
you know, questions go up at the end of the sentence. We don't know that in this other person's

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.480
language. So these are even more difficulties that Quine doesn't get into. But suppose you can say,

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:37.440
point in another rabbit and say, Gavagai. And if they say yes, then that appears to eliminate the

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:43.280
claim that Gavagai is a proper name because they can't both be Gavagai. So it looks like we can

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:49.920
do more and more of this. And finally, narrow it down. But what Quine points out with a thesis

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:58.800
called indeterminacy of reference is there are some things that we can never eliminate,

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.920
such as Gavagai could mean rabbit or it could mean undetached rabbit part because

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.200
wherever it's a bit like the Renate Cordate problem, every time you're pointing at a rabbit,

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:21.440
you're pointing at an undetached rabbit part. So every time it's true to say that he is referring

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.880
to a rabbit, it is true to say that he is referring to an undetached rabbit part and every time it's

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.600
false of one, it's false of the other. So in other words, they're like extensionally equivalent.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.480
And given that we have to be a behaviorist in language acquisition because we're not telepathic,

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.800
the only thing that we have to go on in learning a language is the evidence. And if the evidence

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:52.080
cannot decide between two inconsistent translation manuals, then there is indeterminacy of translation.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:59.280
You cannot say one is the correct one. And of course, there's examples that you might say,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.600
illustrate this, in that there are genuinely inconsistent translations of, say, the Bible.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:14.960
The further away from us a language is written in, the greater leeway there is in translating

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.440
in what's the correct translation of it. But it's worse than that because

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:29.920
Quine says indeterminacy of translation happens within a language. I am translating what you mean

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:38.240
by your words into what makes sense for me. And somebody else could take by your words

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.480
you to mean something inconsistent with what I take it. And both of them are consistent with

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.080
the evidence. And we can't say that one of them is wrong. And the other one is right. So

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.360
this is a very radical kind of skepticism about notion of meaning as we normally understand

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:05.840
it. We're replacing meaning with some kind of behaviorist stand in that doesn't do what we

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:12.560
think meaning should. But Quine says, if we're honest, this is the best we can do. And this brought

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:19.280
a storm of criticism and commentary on Quine, which is one of the reasons he's so famous,

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:25.520
because he's making radical claims. He's also pretty cool. Everybody should go through a Quine

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:31.200
phase of thinking that Quine's right about something. Now, most philosophers, there aren't

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:40.480
many Quineans left, probably, maybe not as few as there are logical positivists left, but he still

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:51.680
has his defenders. And but his his view has, he's not sort of as current as he was in the mid

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.160
century. In the mid century, everybody was talking if they weren't agreeing with Quine, they were

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.400
disagreeing with Quine, they were talking about Quine. So that's why I have to know about him.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.920
He was such an important figure.
