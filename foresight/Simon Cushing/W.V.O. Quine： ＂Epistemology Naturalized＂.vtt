00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
Here we are again with our old pal, Willard Van Orman Quine, another famous article, not

00:08.240 --> 00:16.080
as famous and influential as Two Dogmas of Empiricism, but definitely well known and

00:16.080 --> 00:18.880
that's called Epistemology Naturalized.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.680
Okay, well what does the title mean for the first thing?

00:24.080 --> 00:31.680
Well Epistemology since, epistemological issues have been with us since the dawn of philosophy.

00:32.480 --> 00:41.440
Plato talks about what we can know and what knowing does for the knower and things like that.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.400
In the era of modern philosophy of course we have Descartes, Descartes' Meditations and

00:48.400 --> 00:56.000
their epistemology is as what is sometimes called first philosophy, that is before you can

00:56.000 --> 01:05.680
start philosophizing about anything like what the world is like, what things exist, what is right

01:05.680 --> 01:14.560
and what is wrong, you need to first know what it is to know anything and then once you establish

01:14.640 --> 01:24.560
that you have some criterion to judge whether or not we can claim to know things about the

01:24.560 --> 01:31.120
external world, things about ethics, things like that. So you've got to settle our standards of

01:31.120 --> 01:44.320
knowing first and they give you guidelines that affect the way that you reason in all

01:44.320 --> 01:50.800
other areas of philosophy. So epistemology in that sense is what you handle first and that's

01:50.800 --> 01:58.560
evident in the way Descartes structures the meditations where he talks about what we can know

01:58.560 --> 02:11.840
right up front. Quine is a big fan of science and in fact Quine doesn't make a clear distinction

02:11.840 --> 02:20.480
between epistemology and the rest of philosophy or between philosophy and science. He just talks

02:20.480 --> 02:27.520
in terms of our theory of the world and our theory of the world includes all of science and philosophy

02:27.600 --> 02:38.160
and there's no clear boundaries between them. So this very much prevents us sort of taking a

02:38.800 --> 02:43.840
placing philosophy above science and saying, whoa science you can't make claims to know

02:43.840 --> 02:49.440
something because you're not meeting our strict philosophical standards so therefore your scientific

02:49.440 --> 02:55.920
results fall short or something like that. That would be the sort of old-fashioned way of looking

02:55.920 --> 03:02.000
at epistemology is sort of above science and providing standards that science must reach,

03:02.720 --> 03:10.720
must meet. Once you naturalize epistemology you say epistemology is part of science

03:10.720 --> 03:20.400
and can use the scientific method. Now this would be quite radical because then you could,

03:20.640 --> 03:29.120
how is it that you're supposed to judge the standards that you use? How is it that you're

03:29.120 --> 03:34.880
supposed to, that you can judge whether or not the products of science are things that we can

03:34.880 --> 03:45.360
actually know or that are in some sense theory-laden or whatever? Well as is usual with a Quine article

03:45.360 --> 03:55.360
it's very dense and it's written in a way that seems to require us having a huge amount of

03:55.360 --> 04:03.360
background information. Quine's articles tend to read as if they're for an audience of buddies that

04:03.360 --> 04:12.800
he's already in the middle of conversations with. So it's hard to make sense of it which is why

04:13.280 --> 04:20.000
as the reading I gave a version of epistemology naturalized that has sort of a commentary on it

04:22.800 --> 04:29.760
and chunks cut out. So let's talk about some of his assumptions. The first and major assumption

04:29.760 --> 04:35.440
that he makes clear is something that he calls the Quine-Dewam thesis. This is he talks about in

04:35.680 --> 04:43.760
two dogmas of empiricism. I don't think he calls it that there. He starts calling it maybe in Word

04:43.760 --> 04:54.080
and Objects which is his book that comes out in 1960 and it's a little arrogant. Pierre Duem was a

04:54.080 --> 05:03.200
French physicist who made this claim about science that it's basically, you can call it

05:03.200 --> 05:09.360
confirmation holism and I talked about it in talking about two dogmas from empiricism. That is

05:09.360 --> 05:14.080
contrary to what the logical positivists say, the logical positivist says that every sentence

05:14.800 --> 05:22.080
if it is meaningful and is not just true by the definition of the words involved, if it is meaningful

05:22.720 --> 05:34.320
then it has clear criteria of testability that is it is relevant to specific

05:36.000 --> 05:40.560
facts about the world. So and they are what make it meaningful.

05:43.200 --> 05:50.640
And what Quine insists on and he says Duem insisted on before him. So if Duem insisted on it before

05:50.800 --> 05:56.880
him, why is it called the Quine-Dewam thesis? Why not just call it the Duem thesis but I guess maybe

05:56.880 --> 06:03.040
it had become famous as what Quine says and Quine wanted to say well this other guy said it before

06:03.040 --> 06:10.480
me and I've just discovered that or anyway. The Quine-Dewam thesis is this idea that while

06:11.040 --> 06:20.720
the only evidence we have for our theory, our grand theory of the world is observation of

06:21.840 --> 06:30.480
the natural world, it is relevant only, it only confirms or dis confirms our theory as a whole

06:30.480 --> 06:39.440
and and this is because no claim that we make about the world can be directly tested in isolation

06:39.440 --> 06:47.200
from other claims like for example if I make a claim about the motion of a planet and I observe

06:47.200 --> 06:55.440
through a telescope that my claim appears to be false, that would appear to mean that the evidence

06:55.440 --> 07:01.680
dis confirms my specific claim about planetary motion but of course it doesn't because I could

07:01.680 --> 07:08.000
say no no no my claim about planetary motion is correct, the only reason the observation appears

07:08.000 --> 07:13.840
to dis confirm it is because there's something wrong with our theory of how this telescope works

07:13.840 --> 07:19.280
or there's some other facts we don't know like there's another planet that we haven't seen yet

07:19.280 --> 07:25.440
affecting the motion of the planet so I can I don't have to dis confirm my particular claim

07:25.440 --> 07:32.640
there's no evidence that will directly dis confirm that claim alone it's always and this is Quine's

07:32.640 --> 07:42.320
big contribution it's actually up to us to pick which claim we want to dis confirm it's not dictated

07:42.320 --> 07:48.880
by the evidence it's our choice to decide okay I'm going to stick to my observational claim

07:48.880 --> 07:55.520
and I'm going to claim that this telescope is faulty or something like that we make the choices

07:55.520 --> 08:01.600
and nothing about our observation dictates that choice so all we know is that our current

08:01.600 --> 08:07.280
observation doesn't fit with our whole theory but which of the elements of our theory we decide to

08:07.280 --> 08:13.760
discard or maybe we decide to discard the observation itself it's up to us this is what

08:13.760 --> 08:23.280
confirmation holism is and given that fact it looks like one of the projects that was particularly

08:23.280 --> 08:31.760
dear to one of the logical positivists who had the longest career some logical positivists didn't

08:31.760 --> 08:40.240
make it out of Vienna for example Marie Schlick was shot by a crazy ex-student on the steps of I

08:40.240 --> 08:47.600
think the university but one who had a long and distinguished career in in America was Rudolph

08:47.600 --> 08:56.480
Carnap and he sort of evolved out of logical positivism and started calling it logical empiricism

08:56.480 --> 09:06.160
instead and sort of gave up some aspects of logical positivism but took the core insights and sort of

09:06.160 --> 09:13.680
said no no no we can work with this and Carnap and Quine had a long going back and forth over the

09:13.760 --> 09:19.440
decades in America and and Carnap was older than Quine and a great influence on Quine

09:20.160 --> 09:26.320
so he risked Quine respected Carnap but said he was wrong about some things anyway Carnap

09:27.520 --> 09:40.480
his big project was that he wanted to see if you could justify your theory by logically reducing it

09:40.480 --> 09:46.320
to statement to these observation statements now observation statements which Quine remains

09:46.320 --> 09:56.320
committed to are the kind of thing that people like Kuhn or more extreme or a more extreme

09:56.320 --> 10:02.480
version is a guy called Paul Feierabend would say observation sentences are kind of a myth you

10:02.480 --> 10:11.600
cannot have these sentences so Quine maintains that although in general it's the theory as a whole

10:11.600 --> 10:16.800
that is confirmed or disconfirmed by the evidence he still maintains that there are very specific

10:16.800 --> 10:24.720
sentences that can be confirmed or disconfirmed but these are very rare and right at the edge and

10:24.720 --> 10:29.600
he says the reason why he says there has to be some of these is because he says otherwise

10:29.600 --> 10:37.600
we would never be able to learn language here's where he and Wittgenstein would butt heads because

10:37.600 --> 10:44.800
Wittgenstein has that analysis of extensive definition where you point to something and say

10:44.800 --> 10:50.240
that's a table or something like that and says that you in order to do that you have to already

10:50.240 --> 10:56.960
be immersed in the language game of extensive definition Quine thinks you can do extensive

10:56.960 --> 11:03.600
definition and in fact you have to be able to do that otherwise babies would never acquire language

11:03.600 --> 11:12.160
there has to be an an entering wedge into language and it has to be these very basic claims about

11:12.160 --> 11:22.080
the world that can be confirmed or disconfirmed by the evidence so Quine and Kahnab share this

11:22.080 --> 11:30.880
belief in observation sentences and what the project that Kahnab is interested in is to try to

11:31.440 --> 11:40.880
justify our theory of the world by showing that it reduces to our evidence for it now

11:40.880 --> 11:48.240
Quine says this is an epistemological project because what we're trying to do is we're trying

11:48.240 --> 11:55.840
to show how our view of how the world works which is sort of out you know might say like

11:55.840 --> 12:02.320
our collective beliefs about the world is justified on the basis of the evidence we have for it and

12:02.320 --> 12:08.800
that's very much like the old epistemological project of saying can I know that there's an

12:08.800 --> 12:16.320
external world my evidence for it is what my senses are telling me but is that evidence enough to

12:16.320 --> 12:21.360
justify the belief I have that there's a world out there and the skeptics say no

12:23.680 --> 12:29.840
so this is just sort of on a larger scale so instead of talking about individual people's

12:29.840 --> 12:38.160
beliefs we're talking about the human human Kahn's collective theory of the world is that

12:38.160 --> 12:48.320
justified based on the basis of the kind of input or that we as humans have and Kahnab wants to try

12:48.320 --> 12:57.040
and do that now because of the Quine duem thesis essentially Quine says you can't do that you

12:57.040 --> 13:04.560
cannot reduce theoretical sentences individually to observational sentences and consequently

13:04.560 --> 13:13.440
you can have and this is the indeterminacy of translation another one of Quine's key and

13:13.440 --> 13:22.320
controversial theses you can have inconsistent theories of the world that are equally confirmed

13:22.320 --> 13:32.560
by the evidence and there is no way to decide between them so we have to give up on this so

13:32.560 --> 13:37.360
but epistemologies if there is such a thing as epistemology its job is to explain the

13:37.360 --> 13:43.280
relationship between our theory of the world and the observational evidence well the logical

13:43.280 --> 13:51.120
positivist thought it could be done this way it can't this kind of project is like in the beginning

13:51.120 --> 13:56.000
of his article he compares it with what Frager and Russell were trying to do with math they were

13:56.000 --> 14:05.040
trying to say well we have this we have math how can we justify our mathematical beliefs well

14:05.040 --> 14:10.000
if we could reduce them to the claims of logic which is more basic and elementary and and self

14:10.000 --> 14:16.560
evidently true then that would in some sense justify math well we couldn't that's one of the

14:16.560 --> 14:23.520
things that for example girdle's incompleteness shows that this this project won't work and

14:23.520 --> 14:31.680
quine is saying a similar thing we can't do the reduction of theory into observational sentences

14:31.680 --> 14:38.880
where does that leave epistemology well quine says the only other option is to treat epistem is to

14:38.880 --> 14:49.440
naturalize epistemology that is to treat epistemology as instead a study of what humans do in fact do

14:49.440 --> 14:59.120
because humans as a matter of fact are constantly producing theories of the world on the basis of

15:00.160 --> 15:07.360
our sensory stimulus and quine calls a late work of his from stimulus to science which is

15:08.400 --> 15:16.000
he talks about us as sort of like bags of nerve endings and he says our nerve endings are stimulated

15:16.000 --> 15:25.440
that's the input from this as he calls it meager input just electrical signals that we're getting

15:25.440 --> 15:34.640
from our nerve endings we construct as he puts it this torrential this far more ornate and convoluted

15:35.360 --> 15:43.440
description of the reality our theoretical view of of the explanation of our sensory stimulation

15:44.400 --> 15:50.720
and and epistemology's job now according to quine given that it can't be reduced to

15:51.760 --> 16:02.400
in this way is to just say well how do humans do that how do humans produce this huge theoretical

16:02.400 --> 16:10.960
output on the basis of sensory input so on a more a very basic example would be how is it

16:10.960 --> 16:20.160
that we see in 3d given that our input is 2d that we're just getting stimulation that it doesn't

16:20.160 --> 16:27.600
really have a dimension it's just electrical impulses reaching our brain and as far as we know

16:27.600 --> 16:35.040
they're not caused by 3d objects and yet we see the world in 3d why is it that we see this world

16:35.040 --> 16:42.640
in 3d how are we constructing 3d pictures of the world from 2d input that's an epistemological

16:42.640 --> 16:50.400
issue how do we do it and so for example a naturalized epistemologist would be interested in something

16:50.400 --> 16:58.400
called mars theory of vision which is a scientific study of how this works and that's what that's

16:58.400 --> 17:03.440
the kind of thing that epistemologists should be interested in they shouldn't be interested in this

17:03.520 --> 17:11.120
crusty old philosophical business of you know the kind of thing that getier wrote on you know

17:11.120 --> 17:17.360
what are the conditions for knowing that p no you should get into the science because science

17:17.360 --> 17:25.840
is all we have to go on so if knowledge knowledge is a natural phenomenon that can be studied our

17:25.840 --> 17:31.440
knowledge is our picture of the world so here of course classical epistemologists would say well

17:32.080 --> 17:36.800
we can't call it knowledge yet because we don't know if it meets the standards of knowledge

17:36.800 --> 17:42.240
but to say that is to say that there's something above science that can judge what

17:42.240 --> 17:47.440
the correct standards are and there aren't there isn't there's only science all we have to go on

17:47.440 --> 17:53.840
is science quine is is very fond of quoting another logical positivist called Otto Neurath

17:54.800 --> 18:02.400
uh who has an image of a ship and he says we're on this ship and we're building the ship at the

18:02.400 --> 18:10.000
same time we're on it we're building the ship that we're floating on um and that's our relationship

18:10.000 --> 18:17.520
to science that is we're using science at the same time we're thinking about science but you

18:17.520 --> 18:23.520
there is no you can't get off the ship of science to look down on it and say oh we're doing it right

18:24.160 --> 18:29.840
the only standards by which to judge science are science there or where science here is

18:29.840 --> 18:35.920
taken broadly to include all of our theory of the world which includes philosophy but the method

18:35.920 --> 18:42.960
science uh like natural science is the most successful and therefore preferable methodology

18:42.960 --> 18:50.560
because as the positivist pointed out science was far more was advancing at a massively accelerated

18:50.560 --> 18:55.200
rate in the early 20th century with Einstein and quantum mechanics and all of that stuff

18:56.640 --> 19:03.600
so clearly science's methodology is is the one that we should be using okay so knowledge is a

19:03.600 --> 19:11.680
natural phenomenon it resolves the issue of epistemological priority what's this well he says

19:11.760 --> 19:22.720
uh prior a a fairly recent dispute in in epistemology that he says now is goes by the board

19:23.440 --> 19:31.040
is um was brought up by the gestalt psychologists and gestalt psychologists say we don't actually

19:31.920 --> 19:41.600
perceive in the way that classic philosophers like Descartes and Locke and in particular Locke

19:41.600 --> 19:49.680
Barkley and Hume say they say we get we are directly aware of sense data first like patches of red

19:49.680 --> 19:56.240
and patches of blue and then Locke in particular paints this picture we take these tiny little

19:56.320 --> 20:02.480
Lego building blocks and then we construct them together to form objects so an object is constructed

20:02.480 --> 20:09.520
in our mind from all of these tiny little individual very basic sense data um and the

20:09.520 --> 20:15.920
gestalt psychologist says that's not true we just directly see the world in 3d we don't see the world

20:15.920 --> 20:24.000
in 2d and then in further 3d world we directly perceive in 3d that's what we're or wherever

20:24.000 --> 20:33.760
conscious of we're never conscious of the sensory stimulations that are uh sort of cause you might

20:33.760 --> 20:38.480
say our 3d picture of the world we're never conscious of those what we're conscious of

20:38.480 --> 20:44.640
immediately is a 3d picture of the world we see the world in color in 3d and that's what we're

20:44.640 --> 20:52.080
conscious of so that's our first that should have epistemological priority over the unconscious stuff

20:52.080 --> 21:00.640
that causes it um and quine says well once we see knowledge as a natural phenomenon we uh epistemological

21:00.640 --> 21:07.120
priority is resolved by what should come first the conscious or the unconscious and he says it's

21:07.120 --> 21:14.000
obviously the unconscious because if you're viewing things in a naturalistic way you look to the the

21:14.000 --> 21:19.440
causal origin and the causal origin of our 3d picture of the world is the sensory stimulation

21:19.440 --> 21:25.280
so that comes first and he suggests at the end of the article possible projects for epist for

21:25.280 --> 21:34.240
naturalized epistemology is to look at our do humans have a certain limited number of epistemological

21:34.240 --> 21:41.520
building blocks it and he draws the analogy with phonemes in in linguistics in linguistics there's

21:41.520 --> 21:51.040
this idea of phonemes that there's a finite number of uh audible um sounds that can be the basis of

21:51.040 --> 21:59.920
words and language if languages share the same set then humans we know something about languages of

21:59.920 --> 22:06.720
which humans are capable of speaking you can't use you can't have more uh phonetic distinctions than

22:06.720 --> 22:13.840
we're capable of perceiving and maybe there are you know we there's sort of uh humans have a limited

22:13.840 --> 22:21.920
resolution you might say a limited pixel um density in our uh perception of the world

22:21.920 --> 22:27.040
that will be something worth finding out and that would tell us that would tell us something about

22:27.040 --> 22:33.920
what we can know or another suggestion is evolutionary epistemology why do we see the world

22:33.920 --> 22:41.760
in color for example I imagine uh this is an example uh you know we have color in the center of our

22:41.760 --> 22:48.960
retinas and black and white uh rods color cones color sensing cones and black and white sensing

22:48.960 --> 22:54.480
rods on the periphery of our vision what this now the black and white ones are much more sensitive

22:54.480 --> 23:00.560
to minute changes in light which is why in your peripheral vision you can detect motion

23:00.560 --> 23:08.320
much better and the evolutionary uh suggestion for this is this is good if you're being hunted by

23:08.320 --> 23:15.280
if you're a prey animal as we are uh this will enable you to detect the movement of tigers or

23:15.280 --> 23:21.280
wolves uh off to the side and you can you will immediately see them you'll be much harder to

23:21.280 --> 23:28.400
sneak up on but of course these features of our eyes while they serve an evolutionary purpose

23:28.800 --> 23:36.080
uh dictate how we view the world so evolutionary epistemology would say the way we view the world

23:36.080 --> 23:47.760
is a product of forces that enabled us to survive um now epistemology in general or

23:47.760 --> 23:54.720
certainly before this suggestion was deemed to be normative that is epistemology this is why it

23:54.720 --> 24:00.400
was first philosophy this is why Descartes starts with epistemology because he says we've got to give

24:00.400 --> 24:06.720
produce standards to judge our knowledge claims in other spheres when we start making metaphysical

24:06.720 --> 24:14.240
or ethical claims we judge them by the standards that epistemology has given us so epistemology

24:14.240 --> 24:21.760
provides us with norms standards to judge knowledge in other spheres can naturalized epistemology

24:21.840 --> 24:28.000
do that or is it just a descriptive enterprise uh does it just say this is how

24:29.920 --> 24:33.200
we acquire our picture of the world is it the right picture of the world

24:34.000 --> 24:39.760
i'm not interested in that it seems like it seems like and science is norm is often said

24:39.760 --> 24:44.880
there's usually said to be a fact value distinction science is interested in the facts

24:45.520 --> 24:49.440
you know like scientists would say it's just the fact that humans are violent

24:49.440 --> 24:54.400
we don't say that it's a good thing we just tell you why humans are violent because you

24:54.400 --> 24:58.800
know it helps in survival or it was evolutionary practical or something we're not saying it's a

24:58.800 --> 25:03.520
good thing or that it should continue we're just telling you the facts we're not judging the facts

25:04.080 --> 25:10.240
so if epistemology is now just part of science can it provide us with standards

25:11.200 --> 25:16.960
coins is yes it can give us standards the standards of science the standards of scientific

25:16.960 --> 25:25.840
rigor so if we want to know are we in a position to know this well uh you know science would say

25:27.040 --> 25:32.400
you will be in a position to know it if you're in the kind of circumstances where the typical

25:32.400 --> 25:41.280
human can provide a picture that is reliable um now but then is there any way to get outside of

25:41.280 --> 25:47.840
science and say is science doing it right no uh there is no such thing for for quine as first

25:47.840 --> 25:54.400
philosophy again back to noir earth's ship we can't get off the ship and look down on it and judge it

25:54.400 --> 25:59.040
so although quine says it does provide us with norms the they're the norms of science and we

25:59.040 --> 26:06.320
can't judge those um so other although quine says yes other people the critics would say no

26:07.120 --> 26:16.400
uh naturalized epistemology has become an important part of um epistemology but it

26:16.400 --> 26:22.320
hasn't killed off the old-fashioned epistemology either now it's just so epistemology is just a

26:22.320 --> 26:30.320
larger animal quine would have had it kill off all the other kinds of epistemology he he would say

26:30.400 --> 26:37.360
come on haven't you seen i've told you that uh uh the old-fashioned epistemology it's obvious

26:37.360 --> 26:45.200
that it's a pointless exercise but epistemology goes on regardless uh it's just now there's a new

26:46.000 --> 26:52.480
subsection of epistemology thanks to quine and people who are influenced by him

27:00.320 --> 27:01.700
you

27:30.320 --> 27:31.780
you

28:00.320 --> 28:01.780
you

28:30.320 --> 28:31.780
you

29:00.320 --> 29:01.780
you

29:30.320 --> 29:31.780
you

30:00.320 --> 30:00.820
you

30:08.960 --> 30:19.040
ghettier cases are pretty much uh they multiply these aren't rare ones these aren't specifically

30:19.920 --> 30:28.320
very um very contrived cases it's it's fairly easy to come up with cases like this in fact

30:28.320 --> 30:33.840
there's some suggestion that birch and russell uh came up with his own cases uh a long time

30:33.840 --> 30:39.920
previously in a book of his so that's a little bit of controversy it's it's not necessarily clear

30:39.920 --> 30:46.000
that ghettier was the first person to publish on this but certainly he did a good good job of

30:46.000 --> 30:56.400
presenting the cases and they have led to a sort of sea change in um epistemology in this kind of

30:56.400 --> 31:03.200
epistemology you can so the the ghettier problem is what's missing what is the extra element that

31:03.200 --> 31:11.600
we need to add um so that if you meet one two three four then you do know something that's the

31:11.600 --> 31:17.920
debate or there is some suggestion that this is okay and that we can fix this and respond to

31:17.920 --> 31:24.960
ghettier cases but certainly ghettier presented a challenge that epistemologists then had to meet

31:24.960 --> 31:30.560
which is why this article short as it is is so famous
