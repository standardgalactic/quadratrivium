0	2480	The stage is yours.
2480	3560	Thank you, Zlatko.
4480	7040	Well, in this talk, what I want to do
7040	10760	is to ask the following question.
10760	12800	What does quantum mechanics mean?
13960	16160	Well, without further ado,
16160	18880	let me just skip to my conclusions.
18880	20320	Nobody knows.
20320	23560	Thanks for coming to my talk, I'll take questions.
23560	27240	Well, okay, actually, I do have a few other things to add.
27240	31200	The first is that if you read a book or an article
31200	33440	that asks this question
33440	36760	and it doesn't, at some stage, acknowledge this basic fact
36760	39880	that we really don't know what quantum mechanics means,
39880	42800	then I advise you to read it
42800	44680	as you might say a book review.
44680	48280	That's to say, don't imagine that the position it is giving
48280	52000	is one that will necessarily be either right or wrong.
52000	54840	Judge it instead by whether it seems to offer
54840	59600	a stimulating and productive way to think about its subject.
59600	63720	I think this at the moment is the best approach we can take
63720	65960	to trying to answer this question
65960	67600	of what quantum mechanics means.
67600	69880	Now, you don't need to take my word for it
69880	72680	that this ignorance about quantum mechanics exists
72680	74840	because I'm sure that many of you will know
74840	77440	this popular quote from Richard Feynman,
77440	79440	who said, I think I can safely say
79440	82800	that nobody understands quantum mechanics.
82800	87600	And let me remind you that he actually said this in 1965.
87600	91120	And that was the year that Feynman shared the Nobel Prize
91120	95360	in physics for his work on quantum mechanics.
95360	99040	So at that point, there was probably no one alive
99040	102480	who knew more than Feynman did about quantum mechanics.
102480	104800	And if this is the conclusion that he reached,
104800	108400	you might well ask what hope is there for the rest of us.
108400	110760	But I think today there's another way
110760	114360	to answer the question of what quantum mechanics means.
114360	117360	You see, one would be justified in giving an answer
117360	120960	to that question like this.
120960	124120	This, of course, is IBM's quantum computer.
124120	128120	And in other words, quantum mechanics must surely tell us
128120	132680	something about the world because we can now use it.
132680	136640	We can use its principles to build machines like this one,
136640	139440	which in fact Feynman himself first envisaged
139440	143760	in the early 1980s, in which quantum objects are manipulated
143760	148200	so as to let us do something real and useful.
148200	150880	If quantum mechanics was not in some sense
150880	153040	a valid description of the world,
153040	157520	then quantum computers would not do what they're supposed to do.
157520	161360	But as you'll see, I think that today's quantum information
161360	163760	technologies like this, tell us something else
163760	167840	about the possible answer to the question I started by asking.
167880	170800	Because what they embody and in fact illustrate
170800	174240	is an emerging sense among many, perhaps not all,
174240	177640	but many of the people who ponder the meaning of quantum mechanics
177640	182320	that it has something to say about the fundamental rules
182320	186800	of what information is and how it can be encoded,
186800	191440	moved and transformed in the world.
191440	194400	Now, quantum mechanics has, of course, a reputation
194400	197000	among laypeople, in fact, among many scientists,
197040	199440	particularly those who don't make use of it,
199440	201800	for being impossibly hard.
201800	203680	So here's some quantum maths for you,
203680	206800	but it's not the mathematics that's the problem,
206800	209840	or at least it wasn't the problem for Feynman.
209840	212680	He could do the maths just fine.
212680	215720	The problem was that's all he could do.
215720	219120	What he couldn't understand is what the maths meant,
219120	222880	what it tells us about the nature of the world.
222880	225880	Now, Feynman himself didn't seem too troubled by that.
225880	228360	He said, you know, we've got a theory that works.
228360	231000	It gives amazingly accurate predictions
231000	232800	about how stuff will behave.
232800	236000	In fact, it's potentially the most accurate theory
236000	237800	in science at all.
237800	239960	So what more can you want than that,
239960	242320	an accurate theory that works?
242320	244840	Well, some scientists feel the same way today,
244840	248000	but usually we do want more because we want to know
248000	250360	what our scientific theories tell us
250360	252760	about what the world is like.
252760	254920	And it wasn't clear to Feynman
254920	257560	that quantum mechanics lets us do that,
257560	259840	and it's still not clear today.
260720	263360	But I want to suggest to you that we can do better
263360	265720	than Feynman's admission of bafflement,
265720	267400	or defeats, I might say.
267400	270200	We don't have all the answers to what quantum mechanics means,
270200	272600	but we do have better questions.
272600	275640	We have a clearer sense than we did in the 1960s,
275640	279600	or even in the 1980s, of what's important and what is not.
279600	281560	And I want to try to give you a sense
281560	283520	of what those things might be.
283520	285760	So let me start with some things
285760	288160	that everyone knows about quantum mechanics.
288160	291440	And when I say everyone, I believe that this audience
291440	293480	is a diverse mixture of experts
293480	295920	who know much more about quantum mechanics than I do,
295920	298480	and non-experts, perhaps non-scientists,
298480	300800	who are nevertheless interested in the subject
300800	302320	and everything in between.
302320	305040	So if you didn't know any of these things yourself,
305040	307720	don't worry, all I mean is that these are notions
307720	309600	that you'll encounter pretty quickly
309600	311920	the moment you start looking at what at least
311920	315120	has been popularly written about quantum mechanics.
315120	319760	First of all, we're told that quantum mechanics is weird.
319760	322200	Things don't behave in the quantum world
322200	324080	in ways that we're familiar with,
324080	326240	and they don't quite make sense.
326240	329200	And here are some of the ways in which they're weird.
329200	333000	So quantum mechanics can be both waves and particles.
333000	335280	This is called wave particle duality.
335280	338160	Quantum objects can be in more than one state at once,
338160	340840	and they can be both here and there, say,
340840	343040	this is called superposition.
343040	345840	You can't simultaneously know exactly
345840	348000	two properties of a quantum object.
348000	350840	This is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
350840	353000	Quantum objects can affect one another
353000	355240	instantly over huge distances,
355240	357800	and this is often called spooky action at a distance,
357800	361120	and it arises from a phenomenon called entanglement.
362080	365560	You can't exactly measure anything without disturbing it,
365560	370040	and so the human observer can't be excluded from the theory.
370040	372440	It becomes unavoidably subjective.
373360	377360	Everything that can happen, or that can possibly happen,
377360	380000	does happen, and there are two separate reasons
380000	381040	why this claim is made.
381040	382920	One is rooted in Feynman's work itself,
382920	384920	which says that quantum objects
384920	388560	take all possible paths through space.
388560	390440	The other comes from the controversial
390440	392840	many-words interpretation of quantum mechanics,
392840	394880	which says that every time a quantum system
394880	397920	faces a choice, it takes both choices,
397920	400040	splitting into separate worlds.
401400	403800	Okay, now here's the thing.
403800	408800	Quantum mechanics itself doesn't say any of these things.
409160	411680	They are all attempts to say
411680	413960	what quantum mechanics might mean.
413960	415760	Some of them are misleading.
415760	419000	Some of them, I think, are plain wrong.
419000	422520	Others are just unproven interpretations.
422520	425920	So I'm saying that we need to change the record
425920	427480	when we talk about quantum mechanics.
427480	429080	We need to stop falling back
429080	432080	on these tired old cliches and metaphors
432080	434600	and to look more closely and more carefully
434600	438920	at what quantum mechanics does and doesn't permit us to say.
439800	440960	And the first point to realize
440960	443280	is that there's a big difference between quantum theory,
443280	447480	the maths and the mechanics that scientists use daily
447480	451200	to predict stuff and to make devices like laptops and phones
451200	453320	and indeed quantum computers.
453320	455320	There's a difference between that
455320	458880	and the interpretation of that theory.
458880	460920	And this is what's so hard to grasp
460920	464080	because normally the interpretation of a scientific theory
464080	466840	seems obvious from the theory itself.
466840	470200	Newtonian mechanics, the old classical mechanics
470200	471920	that works for everyday objects
471920	474760	like tennis balls and spaceships.
474760	479760	This tells us what paths objects take
479760	482000	as forces act on them.
482000	485520	And we don't have to ask, what do you mean by object?
485520	487440	What do you mean by path?
487440	489040	It's obvious.
489040	491240	That's not so for quantum mechanics.
491240	493480	And let me give you a glimpse of why.
493480	496320	To predict what a quantum object will do,
496320	498600	in place of Newton's equations of motion,
498600	500840	scientists generally use an equation
500840	503680	devised by Erwin Schrodinger in 1924
503680	506800	to describe the idea that quantum particles
506800	509200	might act like waves.
509200	511400	The Schrodinger equation doesn't give us
511400	513520	a trajectory for the particle,
513520	516400	but instead something called a wave function.
516400	518840	And the wave function can be used to figure out
518840	522160	where we might find the object in space.
522160	525400	So the shape of a typical wave function in space
525400	527760	might look something like this.
527760	529880	So what does this mean?
529880	531440	Well, it's often said that it means
531440	534360	the particle is smeared out over space.
534360	537200	And it does look that way, doesn't it, from this.
537200	540080	But this isn't showing the density
540080	542560	of the particle over space.
542560	543840	This is the wave function,
543840	546880	and it's a purely mathematical thing.
546880	549920	And what the wave function lets us deduce
549920	553120	is all the possible outcomes of measurements
553120	554800	of the particle's properties,
554800	557440	along with their relative probabilities.
557440	561920	So to find the position where we'll observe the particle,
561920	564600	then we simply calculate some number
564600	567640	from the wave function at that point in space,
567640	569920	and that gives us the probability
569920	572680	that we will see the particle at that point.
572680	574560	So the wave function doesn't tell us
574560	576360	where we'll find the particle.
576360	579720	It tells us the chance that we might find it
579720	583960	at any particular position if we look.
583960	586080	And this is what's so odd about quantum mechanics
586080	588880	because it seems to point in the wrong direction
588880	590720	compared to other scientific theories,
590720	593640	not down towards the system we're studying,
593640	597280	but up towards our experience of it.
597280	599760	It says nothing, or perhaps I should say,
599760	601320	it says nothing obvious
601320	605520	about what the quantum system itself is like.
605520	607600	In other words, the wave function
607600	609880	is not a description of the quantum object.
609880	612880	It is a prescription for what to expect
612880	615320	when we make measurements on that object.
616640	618080	But it's even more peculiar than this
618080	620000	because the wave function doesn't tell us
620000	622600	where the particle is likely to be at any instant,
622600	626640	which we can then verify by making measurements on it.
626640	627960	Rather, what the wave function,
627960	630680	well, the wave function tells us nothing
630680	634920	about where the particle is until we make a measurement.
634920	636920	Strictly speaking, we shouldn't talk
636920	638920	about the particle at all,
638920	642840	except in terms of measurements we might make on it.
642840	644640	And this account of quantum mechanics
644640	646120	is more or less the one that was given
646120	648320	by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr
648320	650960	and his collaborators, such as Heisenberg.
650960	654600	And it's known today as the Copenhagen interpretation.
654600	657080	And I'm not saying that the Copenhagen interpretation
657080	659480	is right, but what's valuable, I think, about it
659480	661960	is that it tells us where our confidence
661960	665080	about the meaning of the theory has to stop.
665080	668040	As it stands, quantum mechanics doesn't permit us
668040	672040	to say anything with confidence about reality
672040	674560	beyond what we can measure of it.
675520	677520	And here's what I mean by that.
677520	679760	One way of speaking about this measurement
679760	681760	of a quantum particle goes like this.
681760	683280	We say that before the measurement,
683280	686680	a wave function is typically this broad spread out thing.
686680	689560	But when we make a measurement
689560	692280	and find the particle to be in a particular place,
692280	694680	then the wave function switches suddenly
694680	698520	to being a sharp spike at that single place.
698520	701560	And this is generally called collapse of the wave function.
701560	702720	And let me just mention that,
702720	704480	contrary to popular belief,
704480	706880	wave function collapse was never actually a part
706880	708840	of the Copenhagen interpretation,
708880	711280	at least as far as Bohr expressed it.
711280	713840	Now, the problem here is that there's absolutely
713840	717760	no mathematical prescription in the theory itself
717760	720400	for how this collapse happens.
720400	721600	You just have to assume it.
721600	723720	You have to put it in by hand.
723720	726720	That doesn't seem very satisfactory.
726720	728280	But wave function collapse doesn't mean
728280	731520	that the particle goes from being smeared out
731520	735320	to being sharply defined once we make a measurement on it.
735320	738760	All we can say is that before the measurement was made,
738760	740520	there were different probabilities
740520	742520	that a measurement would reveal it,
742520	744800	in particular in different places.
744800	746360	Whereas after the measurement,
746360	750640	we can say for sure that it is here and not there.
750640	753520	It's our knowledge that has changed.
753520	755600	And some researchers think that this, in fact,
755600	757440	is really what quantum mechanics is.
757440	760360	It's a theory that describes how our knowledge
760360	764240	about the world changes when we intervene in it.
764240	766280	And we can't deduce from that anything
766280	768880	about what the world was really like
768880	771720	before we had that knowledge of it.
771720	775000	So you see, it's misleading to talk about this situation
775000	778360	as the particle being in many places at once.
778360	781880	The situation tells us only what the possible outcomes
781880	783720	of a measurement will be.
785040	788720	And it's the same with quantum superpositions.
788720	791160	Now, it's often said of superpositions
791160	792760	that the odd thing about quantum objects
792760	795080	is that they can be not only in two places at once,
795080	797400	but in two states at once.
797400	801600	For example, quantum objects have a property called spin.
801600	803840	And all you need to know about it for now
803840	806440	is that for some particles,
806440	810200	it's a property that can have two possible orientations
810200	811040	when you measure it.
811040	813720	The spin, you could find that the spin of the particle
813720	816040	points up or it points down.
816040	818080	And so this is a property that could be used
818080	821240	to encode bits of binary information.
821240	824880	Up could represent a one, down could represent a zero,
824880	828680	and that's the basis of all quantum information technologies
828680	830000	such as quantum computers,
830000	833240	because it means that spins or other quantum states
833240	836200	can act as quantum bits or qubits.
837080	840560	But you see spins at these quantum objects
840560	842080	could be not just up or down,
842080	845520	that's to say a qubit of encoding a one or a zero,
845520	849560	they can be in a superposition of up and down states.
849560	852800	And this is a property that somehow expands
852800	856200	the space of possible states for quantum bits
856200	859280	and allows quantum computers to do some calculations
859280	862400	much more quickly than classical machines.
862400	863680	Now, I've written it like this
863680	866000	with these odd looking brackets
866000	868920	to stress that this is just a formal way
868920	871720	of writing a superposition.
871720	874640	It's not a picture of reality.
874640	877640	You see, although a spin qubit placed
877640	879600	in a quantum superposition is often said
879600	881360	to be into the two states at once,
881400	884120	simultaneously a one and a zero, let's say,
884120	885640	that's not really right.
885640	887600	Because remember that the wave function
887600	890640	tells us only what we can expect when we make a measurement.
890640	891960	And so in this case,
891960	894320	it says that a measurement on the qubit
894320	897080	could yield a one or a zero.
897080	899520	Both, in this case, are possible outcomes.
899520	902120	And in fact, they're the only possible outcomes.
902120	905800	But what's the qubit like before we make the measurement?
905800	908960	Well, quantum mechanics doesn't really tell us that.
909880	913320	Well, now you see, I'm talking not about smeared out particles
913320	914760	or collapsing waves,
914760	918720	but about how information can be encoded in quantum systems
918720	920320	and how it can be read out.
920320	922200	And this is the basis offered
922200	924720	by quantum information technology,
924720	926600	which isn't just a basis,
926600	930200	which isn't just the basis of these amazing new technologies
930200	933440	like quantum computing or quantum cryptography.
933440	937960	It's also a new way of talking about quantum mechanics itself
937960	941120	and potentially talking about quantum information
941120	943520	might allow us to see past
943520	947800	all this old style paraphernalia of wave functions
947800	951280	and Schrodinger equations and quantum jumps
951280	952600	and to get to the core
952600	955960	of what the theory really seems to be telling us.
955960	958040	And there's an example of what I mean by that
958040	961240	in one of the most perplexing features of quantum mechanics,
961240	964080	which is that the outcomes of measurements
964080	966520	or observations seem to depend
966520	971160	on how much information we gather about the system.
971160	973320	And this is something that's commonly illustrated
973320	975840	by the quantum double slit experiment.
975840	979880	So if we send water waves or light waves
979880	983560	through two closely spaced slits,
983560	986840	then the waves emerging from each will spread out
986840	988280	and interfere with one another
988280	992680	and create a pattern where they alternately reinforce
992680	994000	or cancel each other.
994000	995520	So for light, if you do this,
995520	998480	you find a series of bright and dark bands
998480	1001400	on a screen that's placed behind the slits.
1001400	1003760	If you do it for electrons,
1003760	1005400	which according to quantum mechanics
1005400	1007520	can also show these wave-like properties,
1007520	1009280	then you'll find the same thing.
1009280	1013000	You don't just get two images of the slits as you would
1013000	1015480	if you were firing sand grains through a mask
1015480	1017080	from a sand blaster.
1017080	1020040	So, you know, as you would in the top case here,
1020040	1022000	you get wavy interference.
1022000	1023840	You get this interference pattern,
1023840	1028560	these many bands of more or less electrons hitting the screen.
1028560	1030640	And this interference persists,
1030640	1033840	even if the intensity of the beam is so low
1033840	1035320	that you know that the electrons
1035320	1037760	will be going through the slits one at a time.
1037760	1041960	It's as if each electron goes through both slits at once
1041960	1043440	and interferes with itself.
1044320	1048040	But now, if you put a detector close to one slit,
1048040	1049480	which can detect the electron
1049480	1051640	and see which slit it went through,
1051640	1054000	then you'll find indeed that the detector
1054000	1056480	will tell you it goes through one and not the other.
1056480	1058560	The detector might click or it might not.
1059880	1062840	But then, if you find out that information,
1062840	1067840	what you find is that the electron,
1068360	1071080	this interference pattern goes away
1071080	1073920	and the electron behaves like a regular particle.
1073920	1078000	And crucially, it's not that the detection itself
1078000	1080840	is somehow disturbing the electron's motion
1080840	1083040	and getting rid of this wavy behavior.
1083040	1085680	It seems to be the very fact of knowing
1085680	1087320	which slit it goes through
1087320	1090400	that destroys the quantum-like waviness.
1090400	1091760	And you can see that that's so
1091760	1094320	in what's called a delayed choice experiment
1094320	1096560	where you set up a detection scheme in a clever way.
1096560	1099920	So you only detect the particle's path
1099920	1104760	sometime after you're sure it has passed through the slits.
1104760	1107280	So then, you can be sure that the detection itself
1107320	1111680	isn't physically influencing the passage through the slits.
1111680	1114840	Nevertheless, finding out that information
1114840	1117720	will again destroy the interference pattern.
1117720	1120640	The particle will behave like a particle.
1120640	1123680	But if you leave the detector there and just turn it off
1123680	1125800	so that you don't know which slit it went through,
1125800	1127560	then the interference returns.
1127560	1130720	It's as if the particles spookily know
1130720	1134920	whether or not your eavesdropping on which path they took.
1134920	1137560	It's behavior like this that led Niels Bohr
1137560	1139000	to assert that there's something special
1139000	1140880	about measurement of quantum systems
1140880	1143120	that compels a quantum object
1143120	1146400	to make a choice about the properties that it has.
1146400	1148960	And until we do that, or unless we do that,
1148960	1152480	the property that the object has is undefined
1152480	1155480	and we simply can't talk meaningfully about it.
1156480	1161480	Now, famously, that idea was at the core of the dispute
1161480	1164920	that grew up between Bohr and Einstein.
1164920	1167680	For Einstein, this notion that the world is somehow
1167680	1171440	indeterminate until we looked seemed absurd.
1171440	1174760	It seemed like the antithesis of science itself.
1174760	1177840	And in 1935, Einstein and two younger colleagues,
1177840	1179920	Boris Podolski and Nathan Rosen,
1179920	1181720	came up with a thought experiment
1181720	1186720	which they believed showed why Bohr's view had to be wrong.
1186720	1190560	Now, this experiment was later put in a slightly clearer form
1190560	1191880	by the physicist David Bowman.
1191880	1193280	That's how I'll describe it here.
1193280	1194800	So this is how it goes.
1194800	1198960	You have a box that spits out two quantum particles
1198960	1201200	that are in an entangled state.
1201200	1204920	And this means that their properties are interdependent.
1204920	1208960	So let's say that they have spins
1208960	1210960	which can only have two values when measured,
1210960	1212880	like I said, spin up or spin down.
1212880	1214600	Okay, so if they're entangled,
1214600	1217080	this means that the measurement outcomes
1217080	1219600	must be correlated between the two particles.
1219600	1222440	Typically, if one has a spin that points up,
1222440	1224720	then the other one has to point down.
1225600	1227720	We can't specify which is which,
1227720	1230360	but we know for sure that they must be correlated
1230360	1232040	because of the way we produce them.
1232040	1235200	So then if we measure the spin on one particle
1235200	1238200	and we find that it's a spin up particle,
1238200	1242280	then we know that the other particle must have spin down.
1242280	1244360	Okay, now this correlation in itself
1244360	1245560	might seem unremarkable
1245560	1248560	because you could say the same thing about two gloves,
1248560	1252320	let's say if someone sent them separately,
1252320	1255080	one glove to me, one glove to you through the mail.
1255080	1258400	If I open my package and I see I've got the right hand glove,
1258400	1261320	then I know instantly without even having to ask you
1261320	1264000	that you have got the left hand one.
1264000	1265320	But here's the crucial thing
1265320	1267320	because according to Bohr's interpretation
1267320	1270400	of quantum mechanics, the direction of the spins,
1270400	1273360	unlike the handedness of those two gloves,
1273360	1275600	isn't determined in advance.
1275600	1278600	It isn't determined until we, one of us,
1278600	1282000	actually observes what they've got.
1283000	1284320	Now, if that's so,
1284320	1286520	then this so-called EPR experiment
1286520	1288400	seemed to be saying that making a measurement
1288400	1291360	on one particle instantaneously
1291360	1295080	fixes the direction of the arrow or the spin for the other.
1295080	1299360	It's as if there's some spooky communication
1299360	1300400	passing between them.
1300400	1304400	And this is what Einstein called spooky action at a distance.
1304400	1305960	It was Erwin Schrödinger
1305960	1308640	who shared Einstein's skepticism
1308640	1311160	about the Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics.
1311160	1314280	It was Schrödinger who named it instead entanglement.
1315840	1318960	This kind of instantaneous communication or action
1318960	1322000	between two objects separating in space
1322000	1323840	was known to be impossible.
1323840	1326240	It was forbidden by Einstein's own
1326240	1327920	special theory of relativity.
1327920	1330680	So Einstein argued that quantum mechanics
1330680	1332520	couldn't be the whole story here.
1332560	1334480	There must be some missing ingredient,
1334480	1336920	which he said was some property,
1336920	1339520	which we now call a hidden variable,
1339520	1341320	that we couldn't measure,
1341320	1345560	but that somehow gives definite values
1345560	1348040	to these properties, the spins say,
1348040	1350120	to the particles all along.
1351400	1354040	The problem is that simply measuring particles
1354040	1356520	like in an experiment like this,
1356520	1358720	measuring two entangled particles
1358720	1360160	isn't gonna tell you who's right,
1360360	1362880	or Einstein, because that won't reveal anything
1362880	1364840	about what the particles were like
1364840	1366360	before you measured them.
1366360	1370200	So no one knew how to deal with this apparent EPR paradox,
1370200	1371080	as it was called.
1371080	1374080	And for decades, it was just brushed under the rug.
1374080	1376200	But all that changed in 1964
1376200	1379040	when the Irish physicist John Bell,
1379040	1383680	whose day job was as a particle physicist at CERN in Geneva,
1383680	1386080	reformulated the EPR experiment
1386080	1389520	in a way that suggested that it could be conducted for real.
1389520	1391560	So in short, Bell's experiment
1391560	1393600	involved a clever way of combining measurements
1393600	1398560	made by two observers on pairs of entangled particles,
1398560	1400560	where the observers themselves
1400560	1403280	decided how they'd make the measurement.
1403280	1406160	And the setup is actually what's sketched
1406160	1408520	behind the blackboard here with Bell,
1408520	1411700	but here's maybe a clearer depiction of it.
1412560	1416960	So what you do is you look at how strong the correlations
1416960	1419080	between pairs of entangled particles are
1419120	1421680	for different choices of how you make the measurement.
1421680	1425360	And Bell showed that if the particles were either classical
1425360	1428480	or were governed by Einstein's hidden variables,
1428480	1430200	so that either way their properties
1430200	1432280	were actually fixed all along,
1432280	1434720	then the strength of the correlations
1434720	1437600	that you get in many repeated experiments here
1437600	1441920	added up in a certain way couldn't exceed a certain value.
1441920	1444040	But if they were governed by quantum mechanics,
1444040	1448100	as Bohr put it, and Bohr was right to say
1448100	1450820	that we couldn't see anything about the properties
1450820	1451980	before we measured them,
1451980	1456500	then this correlation would be larger than that threshold.
1456500	1459220	So these experiments were first done in the 1970s
1459220	1461140	by John Clouser and Stuart Friedman
1461140	1462860	at the University of California at Berkeley
1462860	1466260	using laser photons as the entangled object.
1466260	1469020	And they've been repeated many, many times since,
1469020	1470900	then made ever more rigorous
1470900	1473820	and ever more able to rule out possible loop holes
1473820	1475340	in Bell's argument.
1475340	1479140	Every single time they've given the same very clear result,
1479140	1482740	which is that quantum mechanics alone is right.
1482740	1484700	Bohr's argument seems to be right
1484700	1489540	and there's no need, no argument for Einstein's hidden variables.
1489540	1490540	So how can this be?
1490540	1493480	What was wrong with the EPR argument?
1493480	1495180	Well, Einstein and his colleagues
1495180	1498660	made the perfectly reasonable assumption of locality,
1498660	1501360	which is really saying that the properties of a particle
1501360	1504180	are localized on that particle itself
1504180	1507080	and that what happens to this particle here
1507080	1509980	can't affect what happens to another particle there
1509980	1511540	in some different part of space
1511540	1514300	without some way of transmitting an effect
1514300	1517140	across the intervening space between them.
1517140	1520300	But it seems that nature doesn't work that way
1520300	1521620	at the quantum level.
1521620	1525540	We can't regard the two particles in the EPR experiment
1525540	1529180	as separate entities, even though they're separated in space.
1529180	1531180	When they are quantum entangled,
1531180	1532020	they can be both,
1532020	1534220	they have to be both considered in some sense
1534220	1537860	a single non-local entity.
1537860	1540700	And in fact, it's only if we accept Einstein's assumption
1540700	1543580	of locality that we need to tell the story
1543580	1545620	in terms of particle one,
1545620	1548200	somehow influencing the spin of particle two
1548200	1549340	when we make the measurement,
1549340	1551540	this spooky action at a distance.
1551540	1555080	The alternative view is that we have to invoke
1555080	1557460	quantum non-locality,
1557460	1560780	this idea that somehow quantum properties
1560780	1565780	can be delocalized between two or more objects.
1566100	1568260	So here again, we seem to find this issue
1568260	1570500	of how measurement and information
1570500	1572420	and the re-information we get from it
1572420	1575500	seem to affect the outcomes itself.
1575500	1577380	As with the double slit experiment,
1577380	1579020	you can show in a belt test
1579020	1582060	that it's not the physical act of making the measurement
1582060	1584540	on one particle that somehow seems to fix
1584540	1586740	the property of the other.
1586740	1589460	It's the matter of whether that measurement
1589500	1593700	unambiguously tells you what the state of your particle is.
1593700	1596460	So it's the knowledge that matters.
1596460	1599500	Measurement has become something of a dirty word
1599500	1601900	in quantum mechanics because it seems to bring up
1601900	1603380	all these peculiarities.
1603380	1607260	In fact, John Bell placed it on a list of bad words
1607260	1610220	which incidentally also included information
1610220	1611580	that he thought should be banned
1611580	1613540	from talking about quantum mechanics.
1613540	1616420	But these days, measurement isn't quite the mystery
1616420	1617360	that it once was.
1617360	1620520	Even though it's not fully understood yet either.
1620520	1622720	I see in Boar's view, a measurement was necessarily
1622720	1624680	something governed by classical physics
1624680	1627760	because ultimately it needed classical scale stuff,
1627760	1631080	you know, a piece of apparatus and us to look at it.
1631080	1633640	And so for him, that was the end of the mystery
1633640	1635880	because he said that quantum and classical
1635880	1637720	were just distinct regimes.
1637720	1639960	And we shouldn't expect to be able to pronounce
1639960	1641920	about what went on in the quantum world
1641920	1644280	from the perspective of the classical one.
1644280	1647240	In effect, he declared that there was a fundamental divide
1647280	1648440	between them.
1648440	1651000	Now, it's not surprising that that seemed
1651000	1654280	a deeply unsatisfactory answer to some researchers,
1654280	1655800	including Einstein.
1655800	1659080	But today we can do somewhat better than that.
1659080	1662560	We know, for example, that a measurement involving,
1662560	1665640	any measurement involving the interaction of a quantum system
1665640	1670320	with some classical environment like a measuring device
1670320	1672960	that aims to extract information about it.
1672960	1676400	Any measurement like that involves entanglement.
1676400	1680920	Entanglement happens whenever one particle encounters another.
1680920	1683240	In fact, quantum mechanics says if they interact,
1683240	1685000	that's the only thing that can happen.
1685000	1686680	They have to become entangled.
1686680	1689680	And if you make a measurement so that more and more
1689680	1692760	of these interactions with the environment accumulate,
1692760	1696800	the quantum system itself becomes more and more entangled
1696800	1697960	with its environment.
1697960	1700920	You might say that what this means is that the process
1700920	1705000	spreads out the quantumness of the original object
1705000	1706840	into its surroundings.
1706840	1709640	And in that process, the quantumness
1709640	1711880	kind of gets diluted into the environment.
1711880	1714240	And here's what I mean by that.
1714240	1717240	Let's say you have a quantum bit, a qubit, in a superposition,
1717240	1719440	and then you make a measurement on it,
1719440	1721600	and it becomes entangled with its environment.
1721600	1726760	So the superposition then spreads into those particles, too.
1726760	1729080	And if you want to demonstrate that you still
1729080	1731080	have a superposition there at all,
1731080	1735200	then you have to look for it in all those entangled particles.
1735200	1737040	And that quickly becomes impossible.
1737040	1738960	It will be a bit like trying to keep track
1738960	1742840	of every single gas molecule that you just breathed out
1742840	1745200	as it collides with and mixes with all of those
1745200	1746960	in the air around it.
1746960	1751080	So this process is a real physical process.
1751080	1753720	It's called decoherence, and it leads
1753720	1757000	to the apparent disappearance of quantum properties
1757000	1760520	like superposition in the original quantum object
1760520	1763280	when it's observed and when its properties are measured.
1763280	1767080	And it's possible to calculate how fast decoherence should
1767080	1770560	happen when a quantum system interacts with its environment.
1770560	1773200	And we find that generally, it's so fast,
1773200	1775080	it's almost instantaneous.
1775080	1776560	So for example, if you could somehow
1776560	1780280	put a dust grain in the air in a quantum superposition
1780280	1782440	of states, you can calculate that it
1782440	1786680	would decoher in this room in about 10 to the minus 31
1786680	1789520	seconds, faster than anything we can measure.
1789520	1791440	And what you're left with when that happens
1791440	1794640	is classical behavior, definite properties
1794640	1799080	with fixed values, such as a well-defined position
1799080	1800120	in space.
1800120	1802440	In fact, according to one theory that
1802440	1806840	describes how this decoherence changes quantum to classical,
1806840	1809720	it's a theory called quantum Darwinism.
1809720	1814200	This process not only gives objects fixed definite values
1814200	1816680	of their properties, but it actually picks out
1816680	1821160	from all the quantum features precisely those properties
1821160	1823600	that are meaningful in the classical world,
1823600	1828160	properties like position and speed and charge.
1828160	1831720	So only certain quantum features, the theory says,
1831720	1836360	have the right characteristics to survive the filtering
1836360	1838720	process of decoherence.
1838720	1840480	And they do that.
1840480	1843880	They have those properties because they are particularly
1843880	1848760	good at making many imprints or copies of themselves
1848760	1850080	in their environment.
1850080	1854000	That's where the Darwinism part of the theory comes in.
1854000	1857000	You see, when we make an observation of an object,
1857000	1859760	what we're really doing is detecting the traces
1859760	1862480	that it imprints on its environment.
1862480	1865400	You can only see me now because of the photons that
1865400	1867760	have scattered from my particles and made their way
1867760	1869240	into the camera.
1869240	1871320	This all gets a bit more complicated
1871320	1873120	when we're talking about virtual talks,
1873120	1874520	but it sort of works.
1874520	1876600	And you can only hear me because of the imprint
1876600	1880200	that my particles have made on the air molecules,
1880200	1882320	the movements of the air molecules.
1882320	1884960	In fact, you could reconstruct everything
1884960	1888040	you can say about an object, like a dust grain,
1888040	1892520	say, from those imprints, like the photons of light
1892520	1894400	that are bouncing off it here.
1894400	1897320	And you could reconstruct all of that,
1897320	1902000	even if just after those photons have bounced off,
1902000	1906040	the object itself was somehow to magically vanish from space.
1906040	1908720	You could still see it from the imprint
1908720	1911880	that it's left for a short time.
1911880	1915480	And you can all agree on my properties, my position,
1915480	1917920	the color of my shirt, what I'm saying,
1917920	1919440	classical properties like this.
1919440	1921360	You can agree on them because there
1921360	1924280	are lots of the imprints that I'm making on the environment.
1924280	1926160	They're highly redundant imprints.
1926160	1928360	There are loads of scattered photons from me,
1928360	1930160	enough for all of you to share.
1930160	1935080	If one of you was somehow able to harvest every photon I scatter,
1935080	1939760	no one else could see me and make any observation of me.
1939760	1943360	And it's this creation of many copies or imprints
1943360	1946640	via interactions and entanglement with the environment
1946640	1949120	that is described by quantum Darwinism,
1949120	1952400	and that in this theory, at least, that
1952400	1955480	is how quantum becomes classical.
1955480	1958920	Now, there seems to be no avoiding decoherent for objects
1958920	1961760	the size of a dust grain, even in a vacuum.
1961760	1965360	Interactions with thermal radiation, infrared photons
1965360	1967480	from the warmth of the room, would still
1967480	1971720	cause it to decoher in about 10 to the minus 18 seconds.
1971720	1974320	Even if you put that grain of dust
1974320	1977880	in the cold emptiness of interstellar space,
1977880	1980680	it would still decoher in about a second
1980680	1983800	because of the microwave photons out there
1983800	1987760	from the cosmic background radiation.
1987800	1989960	So in other words, the reason we can't generally
1989960	1992880	observe quantum effects like superposition in objects
1992880	1996040	of everyday scale is not because there's
1996040	2000200	some law of nature that forbids quantumness at those scales,
2000200	2004440	but because decoherence will destroy it almost instantly.
2004440	2007720	And it does so because of quantum entanglement itself.
2007720	2010800	If we could figure out how to put a tennis ball in some
2010800	2012560	well-defined superposition of states
2012560	2016600	and to isolate it completely from sources of decoherence,
2016600	2019120	and yet this is a tricky bit, somehow,
2019120	2021800	still monitor its state accurately enough,
2021800	2023720	quantum mechanics says there's no reason
2023720	2026960	why such a superposition should be impossible.
2026960	2029680	Now some physicists think that there might be other factors
2029680	2032080	in that situation that will come into play
2032080	2034360	that will destroy quantum coherence anyway,
2034360	2036760	some think that gravity will do it.
2036760	2039760	But it's not clear that anything extra is needed
2039760	2044200	to effectively banish quantum phenomena at everyday scales.
2044200	2048480	In other words, the world is quantum all the way up,
2048480	2051080	and classical physics is pretty much just what
2051080	2055040	quantum physics looks like when you're six feet tall.
2055040	2058480	And that's really what I mean by the title of my talk.
2058480	2061200	And I should just add for this audience that decoherence
2061200	2063960	is the enemy of quantum computing.
2063960	2066720	Computing with qubits relies on keeping them
2066720	2068680	in a collective state of superposition
2068680	2070800	while the computation proceeds.
2070800	2073360	Decoherence will mess that up.
2073360	2075840	And that's why quantum circuits have to be cooled
2075840	2077800	to such extremely low temperatures
2077800	2079960	within a whisker of absolute zero,
2079960	2083000	because this suppresses all the thermal jiggling
2083000	2085160	that would otherwise disrupt the qubits.
2085160	2088400	And it's the difficulty of maintaining this coherence
2088400	2092440	and suppressing decoherence in ever greater numbers
2092440	2096120	of entangled qubits that explains why quantum computers
2096120	2099840	so far don't have more than around 70 qubits or so
2099840	2101440	to play with.
2101440	2106120	But it's a testament to how much power quantum rules give you
2106120	2110040	that already quantum computers can do in seconds
2110040	2112280	with just that number of qubits,
2112280	2114800	some calculations that would take today's
2114800	2118400	classical supercomputers a billion years or so.
2120000	2122600	Now, there's a curious thing about Bell's experiments
2122600	2124040	that's often not remarked upon.
2124040	2126840	I remember I said that the quantum mechanics allows
2126840	2128920	correlations between entangled particles
2128920	2132440	to be stronger than they would be in classical physics
2132440	2134480	or for hidden variables.
2134480	2136640	But quantum mechanics too sets a limit
2136640	2138680	on how strong those correlations can be.
2138680	2141600	And it's not obvious why they couldn't be stronger.
2141600	2144520	We don't know why that is, why the world isn't,
2144520	2147600	if you like, even more quantum than it is.
2147600	2151000	But one useful way to think about what's going on there
2151000	2152720	is that there seems to be a limit
2152720	2156960	on how much sharing of information quantum mechanics
2156960	2160280	permits between entangled particles.
2160280	2164000	So here again, what makes quantum mechanics what it is,
2164000	2166040	seems at root to have nothing to do
2166040	2167800	with mathematical notions.
2176600	2178840	And this is precisely where some scientists
2178840	2182600	think we should start in trying to reconstruct
2182600	2184840	quantum mechanics from scratch,
2184840	2187560	not from these ad hoc guesses,
2187560	2189160	as they really were to begin with,
2189160	2192880	about waves and particles and Schrodinger equations,
2192880	2196320	but from some simple axioms, some simple assumptions
2196320	2198760	about what is permitted with information,
2198760	2201600	how it can be encoded, how it can be transferred,
2201600	2202960	how it can be read out.
2202960	2204720	And I want to give you just a flavor
2204720	2207640	of what this sort of reconstruction would look like.
2207640	2209600	There are many of them that have been suggested.
2209600	2211720	They all are somewhat similar.
2211720	2213120	And I've taken one at random
2213120	2217360	that was suggested in 2009 by Borovoye Dakic
2217360	2221560	and Chaslav Bruckner at the University of Vienna in Austria.
2221560	2225360	They proposed what they said were three reasonable axioms
2225360	2227040	about how the world might be.
2227040	2228960	And this is what the axioms were,
2228960	2233160	that first of all, the most elementary components
2233160	2235480	of the world, whatever those are,
2235480	2240480	can carry no more than one bit of information within them.
2241040	2243960	They assumed secondly, that the state of,
2243960	2245920	what they called locality.
2245920	2248720	So the way they expressed it was a state of a composite system
2248720	2251560	made of many subsystems is completely determined
2251560	2254600	by measurements made on its subsystems.
2254600	2259600	What that really means is that there are no secret mechanisms
2261000	2263760	like hidden variables manipulating what's going on.
2263760	2267360	Thirdly, they assumed that this property of reversibility,
2267360	2270600	that you can convert any pure states
2270600	2272720	from one to the other and back again,
2272720	2276200	like a coin toss flipping heads and tails.
2276200	2279880	So Dakic and Bruckner showed that with these assumptions alone
2279880	2282080	about information really,
2282080	2284640	that they will lead you inevitably
2284640	2287080	to only two sets of possible rules
2287080	2289200	about how things can happen.
2289200	2291440	And those are the rules that are described
2291440	2295120	by classical mechanics and by quantum mechanics.
2295120	2298560	And what's more, if you modify this third axiom
2298560	2303480	to assume that states can be interconverted gradually,
2303480	2306600	little by little, rather than in one big jump,
2306600	2311600	then you only get rules that conform to quantum mechanics.
2312200	2314920	So for a classical coin toss, for example,
2314920	2317760	a head and a tail interconvert sort of abruptly
2317760	2320120	in one big jump, it's either heads or it's tails.
2320120	2323000	In a quantum system, you could have a situation
2323000	2325040	where you've got your hand down on the coin
2325040	2328800	and it can gradually, as you hold it down,
2328800	2330360	interconvert from the heads or tails
2330360	2332320	without having to pick it up and flip it over.
2332320	2336240	Okay, so the point is that these axioms about information
2336240	2339360	can by themselves lead to quantum behavior
2339360	2340240	that we're familiar with,
2340240	2342360	like superpositions and entanglement.
2342360	2345320	And some researchers think that these efforts,
2345320	2347040	quantum reconstruction,
2347040	2349560	might lead to a completely different perspective
2349560	2353540	on quantum theory, one in which the physical meaning
2353540	2356300	of all the seemingly strange behaviors
2356300	2358260	at last becomes clear.
2358260	2360980	Now, it remains to be seen whether that will happen,
2360980	2363620	but I think it's already illuminating
2363620	2366100	that they all focus on information,
2366100	2369260	on how answers or measurement outcomes
2369260	2374020	are contingent on the questions we ask and how we ask them.
2374020	2376260	And I think this is the most productive way to think
2376260	2379380	about what quantum mechanics seems to be telling us.
2379380	2384140	And it's a perspective that I think is illustrated
2384140	2387100	really nicely by a metaphor
2387100	2389580	that the American physicist John Wheeler,
2389580	2392260	who studied under Bohr and who had Feynman
2392260	2394260	as one of his students, incidentally,
2394260	2397860	he suggests that maybe we should think about quantum mechanics
2397860	2400260	as like this.
2400260	2404060	Let's think of it as being a bit like the game of 20 questions.
2404060	2405540	So I'm sure you know this game.
2405540	2408820	So it's the one where one player leaves the room
2408820	2412900	and everyone else in the room agrees on a certain person,
2412900	2414900	a historical figure, a well-known person.
2414900	2418460	And then the person outside has to come back in
2418460	2423540	and they start to ask each person in turn a question
2423540	2426100	to try to find out who it is that they've chosen.
2426100	2427540	And they have to be questions
2427540	2430820	that can only be answered yes or no.
2430820	2434100	So you see, they're really quantum questions.
2434100	2436580	Now, imagine you're the questioner here.
2436580	2438580	So you come back in, you start to ask questions
2438580	2440180	and you get your answers.
2440180	2442260	You start off, is the person male?
2442260	2444500	And the first person says, yes.
2444500	2448260	And then you go to the second person, is he alive?
2448260	2451300	No. OK. And you carry on.
2451300	2454380	But you start to find an odd thing
2454380	2457420	that as you go on asking more and more people,
2457420	2460580	it takes them longer and longer to answer your question.
2460580	2462900	You know, they're having to think about it.
2462900	2466060	Well, that's odd because if they've agreed on a person,
2466060	2467860	it's either the answer is either yes or no.
2467860	2469180	What is there to think about?
2469180	2471100	Anyway, you carry on playing this game
2471100	2474060	and eventually you think you're zeroing in on who it is.
2474060	2476180	And finally you think, I've got it.
2476180	2478260	And you say, it's Richard Feynman.
2478260	2480420	And everyone laughs and tells you that you're right.
2480420	2482260	It's Richard Feynman.
2482260	2484540	And then you say, well, what was going on?
2484540	2487540	Why were you taking so long to think about the answer?
2487540	2490860	And they explain how they decided to play this.
2490860	2494500	So instead of deciding on a particular person
2494500	2495860	when you were out of the room,
2495900	2500300	what they decided to do was to say that the answer
2500300	2503420	that anyone gave to the question you asked
2503420	2506220	had to be consistent with all of the answers
2506220	2507700	that had been given before.
2507700	2510300	They didn't decide on anyone,
2510300	2514180	but the answer that they gave had to correspond
2514180	2516220	to all the answers that have been given so far,
2516220	2520420	had to correspond to a famous person of some sort or another.
2520420	2522580	And so of course, you know, as the answers went on,
2522580	2524060	it became harder and harder to think,
2524060	2525420	well, who does that apply to then?
2525460	2527340	The male, they're dead and so on.
2527340	2529620	They're a physicist and so on.
2529620	2531420	You have to think harder and harder.
2531420	2536420	And what happens is that as the questions are asked,
2536860	2540460	the possible answers get narrowed down.
2540460	2542940	And in the end, there's only one person it can be.
2542940	2544620	It has to be Richard Feynman.
2544620	2547380	But everyone was forced by the nature
2547380	2550180	of the questions themselves to converge
2550180	2552260	on that same person.
2552260	2554260	If you had asked different questions,
2554300	2556660	you'd have ended up with a different person,
2556660	2558300	a different answer.
2558300	2561700	So the answer you got depended on the context.
2561700	2564460	There never was a preordained answer.
2564460	2567260	You brought that answer into being
2567260	2569180	in a way that is fully consistent
2569180	2570900	with the questions you asked.
2570900	2573460	And what's more, the very notion of an answer at all
2573460	2576500	only makes sense when you play the game.
2576500	2578020	You know, if you'd come back in and said,
2578020	2579620	oh, I can't be bothered to go through this,
2579620	2581220	just tell me who you chose.
2581220	2583340	There would be no answer to that question.
2583340	2588020	You have to do the inquiring before an answer
2588020	2589740	will be forthcoming.
2589740	2592140	So quantum mechanics is like this.
2592140	2595980	It seems to be a theory of what is and isn't knowable
2595980	2598980	and how those knowns are related.
2598980	2601620	And I like to think of this in terms of a distinction
2601620	2606100	between a theory of is-ness and a theory of if-ness.
2607020	2610180	Quantum mechanics doesn't tell us how a thing is
2610180	2612140	or how a quantum thing is.
2612140	2616540	It tells us what and with what calculable probability
2616540	2620900	it could be, along with a logic of the relationships
2620900	2622660	between the various coulds.
2622660	2624900	If this, then that.
2624900	2627340	And what this means is that to truly describe
2627340	2628780	the features of quantum mechanics
2628780	2630500	as far as we currently can,
2630500	2634580	we should replace all the conventional isms with ifms.
2634580	2638140	So for example, we shouldn't say here it is a particle,
2638140	2639380	there it is a wave.
2639380	2642620	We should say, if we measure things like this,
2642620	2644260	the quantum object behaves in a manner
2644260	2645620	that we associate with particles.
2645620	2647620	But if we measure it like that,
2647620	2649780	it behaves as if it's a wave.
2649780	2653260	We shouldn't say the particle is in two states at once.
2653260	2655540	We should say, if we measure it,
2655540	2658260	we will detect this state with probability x
2658260	2660660	and that state with probability y.
2661940	2663860	This if-ness is perplexing
2663860	2665940	because it's not what we've come to associate with science.
2665940	2668860	We used to tell it to the science telling us how things are.
2668860	2670620	And if there are ifs at all,
2670620	2673620	it's because we're partially ignorant about that.
2673620	2674860	But in quantum mechanics,
2674860	2676260	as far as we can tell at the moment,
2676260	2679220	the ifs seem to be fundamental.
2679220	2680420	Well, okay, you might say,
2680420	2684740	but what's the stuff that this if-ness is referring to?
2684740	2687860	Quantum mechanics doesn't obviously tell us much about that.
2687860	2690740	And all we have right now are hints and guesses.
2690740	2693100	And to try to bring them into sharper focus
2693100	2694260	is a tricky business.
2694260	2697980	It seems to demand an almost poetic level of expression,
2698020	2701180	which will send some physicists scurrying for cover.
2701180	2704140	So here, for example, is an attempt to do that,
2704140	2707020	that the physicist Chris Fuchs suggested.
2707020	2710060	He said, maybe quantum mechanics is telling us
2710060	2712820	that the world is sensitive to our touch.
2712820	2715780	It has a kind of zing that makes it fly off
2715780	2718580	in ways that were not imaginable classically.
2718580	2720700	The whole structure of quantum mechanics
2720700	2723340	may be nothing more than the optimal method
2723340	2726340	of reasoning and processing information
2726340	2731020	in the light of such a fundamental, wonderful sensitivity.
2731020	2734220	And what Fuchs means here is not the mundane truism
2734220	2736340	that the human observer disturbs the world.
2736340	2738220	That's true in classical physics.
2738220	2741180	Rather, quantum mechanics may be the machinery
2741180	2742980	that we humans need,
2742980	2745580	we humans pitched at a scale midway
2745580	2748620	between the subatomic and the galactic
2748620	2753620	to try to compile and quantify information about a world
2753860	2756700	that has this incredibly sensitive character.
2756700	2758620	It embodies what we've learnt
2758620	2761820	about how to navigate in such a world.
2762740	2764220	And I think it's vital at any rate
2764220	2767260	that we understand that this if-ness
2767260	2771660	doesn't imply that the world, our world, our home,
2771660	2774260	is holding anything back from us.
2774260	2775900	It's just that classical physics
2775900	2778420	has primed us to expect too much from it.
2778420	2781620	We've become accustomed to asking questions
2781620	2783700	and getting definite answers.
2783700	2784940	What colour is it?
2784940	2787940	How heavy is it? How fast is it moving?
2787940	2791580	Forgetting the almost ludicrous amount about
2791580	2795060	that we don't know about everyday objects,
2795060	2797860	we figured that we could go on forever,
2797860	2802620	asking questions and being answered at ever finer scales.
2802620	2805020	When we discovered that we can't,
2805020	2809940	we felt shortchanged by nature and we pronounced it weird.
2809940	2812060	I don't think that will do anymore.
2812060	2816380	Nature does its best and we need to adjust our expectations.
2816380	2818900	So we need to go beyond weird.
2819820	2820780	Thanks very much.
2823020	2824540	Thank you, Phillip.
2824540	2827260	Thank you, Phillip, for the wonderful talk
2827260	2831340	and I can relay to you a few comments
2831340	2833100	before I get to questions from the audience
2833100	2834260	and folks in the audience.
2834260	2837740	Please feel free to post questions again in the chat.
2837740	2839180	The chat is very active right now,
2839180	2843220	so I'll try to pull them out of the stream here.
2844940	2848180	We have, by the way, a few folks I would just like
2848180	2850540	to relay to you since you can't see the chat yourself,
2850540	2852180	you know, said this is, you know, nice stuff,
2852180	2853420	enlightening and mesmerizing,
2853420	2856820	so I thought I should relay that.
2856820	2860580	We had quite a few discussions and questions,
2860580	2865020	I think, that spawned off of the discussion as to,
2865020	2867820	let's see, hopefully you can see me now, there we go,
2868260	2872780	as to why is quantum weird
2872780	2875140	in the sense of deterministic?
2875140	2876660	Is it, you know, is it because we're used
2876660	2877860	to deterministic theories?
2877860	2880220	And I think you touched on this throughout the talk
2880220	2882820	and this is one of the essential points.
2882820	2885980	But maybe if we kind of come back to that,
2885980	2889460	there was the locality that deterministic
2889460	2892020	versus maybe non-causal potential,
2893700	2896540	maybe if we could sort of get your thoughts again
2896540	2901460	in a bit of a summary here of the discussion
2901460	2903020	that is going on in the chat.
2904140	2907020	Yeah, okay, well, I mean, certainly, you know,
2907020	2910660	it seems to me that as far as we can say at the moment,
2911580	2913460	quantum mechanics isn't deterministic.
2913460	2916180	There are ways of interpreting quantum theory
2916180	2921180	that are deterministic, that in fact do return us
2921380	2924860	to some sort of picture of there being real particles
2924900	2927580	that have real properties and real places out there.
2927580	2932060	There are interpretations that suggest that.
2932060	2934300	And if you like all the quantumness
2934300	2937380	or what we've conventionally called the weirdness
2937380	2941140	is kind of put onto another aspect of the theory,
2941140	2943380	but we recover the particles.
2943380	2948380	So that's possible, but it's, you know, it's unproven
2948620	2951740	and it's just one interpretation.
2951740	2955300	And at the moment, it seems to me it's safe us to say
2955300	2958500	that, you know, that there does seem to be
2958500	2961820	this fundamental indeterminacy in quantum mechanics
2961820	2964620	so that if we make a measurement on a system,
2964620	2968500	all we can meaningfully say is what the probabilities
2968500	2969820	of the outcomes will be.
2969820	2973780	We could, that perhaps we can never say more than that.
2973780	2977760	So we can ever exactly predict what we're going to find.
2978760	2981120	That's very interesting.
2983280	2984760	And I think, folks, I'm sorry,
2984760	2986360	we were going to have to leave the videos off,
2986360	2988240	but hopefully you can still hear us just fine.
2988240	2990360	We're having some bandwidth issues today.
2991560	2995600	Yes, so, interesting.
2995600	2998240	And maybe a follow up question from the audience here.
2998240	3001960	In the classical world, you know, are we perhaps too used
3001960	3004160	to trying to write down deterministic laws?
3004160	3007400	Could the classical world be modeled under any probability
3007400	3009120	or a probabilistic theory, perhaps,
3009120	3011280	to rephrase the question here?
3011280	3013320	And should that really be the comparison
3013320	3016840	between the quantum world and the classical?
3019240	3022560	Well, I'm certainly not an expert on this,
3022560	3026600	but what I can say in response to that is that
3026600	3029240	these efforts at quantum reconstruction
3029240	3032920	that I talked about, one way of looking at that
3032920	3037840	is that really, quantum mechanics is simply
3037840	3040120	a kind of probability theory.
3040120	3043040	It's just a different sort of probability.
3043040	3045000	You know, probabilities work a bit differently
3045000	3047680	from how we used to them in the classical world.
3047680	3050400	And that, you know, one way of looking at it is that,
3053040	3057960	is that, you know, we should be thinking probabilistically,
3057960	3059800	you know, more generally.
3059800	3061400	And, you know, there are a whole set
3061400	3064520	of possible probabilistic theories
3064520	3065920	or theories of probability,
3065920	3070520	and one of them corresponds to quantum type rules.
3071400	3075520	So, you know, here again, we sort of come back
3075520	3080520	to quantum mechanics being a theory about noability
3081120	3084120	and how much the world is really knowable.
3084120	3087080	I mean, the way that I think about it,
3087080	3092080	that makes sense to me, is to suggest
3092640	3095680	that quantum mechanics seems to be telling us
3095680	3100680	that we are, it's possible for us to ask more questions
3102360	3106840	that nature can have answers, can have definite answers for.
3106840	3109680	That seems to me to be really the point.
3109680	3112720	And that doesn't seem to be such an unreasonable thing
3112720	3113560	to propose.
3113560	3116000	Why should every question that we compose
3116600	3119960	that we could pose necessarily have a definite answer?
3119960	3122920	Quantum mechanics seems to be saying it doesn't.
3122920	3124280	And so you have a choice.
3124280	3126840	If you choose to ask these questions,
3126840	3128840	you'll get this set of responses.
3128840	3130840	If you can choose to ask this set of questions,
3130840	3132040	you'll get a different one.
3132040	3134200	And they may not be compatible with each other
3134200	3136040	because you ask different questions.
3136040	3140080	So it depends on the context of the questions
3140080	3141120	that you're asking.
3142760	3144720	I think that's enlightening, yeah.
3144720	3147840	And maybe that reminds me a bit of this game
3147840	3149800	you brought up earlier, which was very nice.
3149800	3152320	And I think you concluded by something along the lines
3152320	3155120	of you brought that answer into being of,
3155120	3159760	oh, it's Feynman by asking that particular set of questions.
3159760	3161280	And I think it was Sash Kurodkov
3161280	3164200	as a physicist who also says, in quantum mechanics,
3164200	3167000	you don't see what you get, you get what you see.
3168400	3172760	And that brings me to maybe your perspective
3172760	3176440	or thoughts or opinion on no ability, right?
3176440	3179920	So in these more recent experiments,
3179920	3182600	the quantum trajectory type of experiments,
3184280	3186960	those experiments can't always,
3186960	3188560	they usually can't tell you the future,
3188560	3189520	they can't predict the future,
3189520	3191920	but they can always tell you exactly what,
3191920	3194920	in a way the state is, the quantum description,
3194920	3196280	the quantum state is doing,
3197440	3201280	as you are subjecting the system
3201280	3206280	to an ongoing interrogation, a measurement.
3206280	3208440	And there seems to be this very close
3208440	3210360	one-to-one direct correspondence.
3210360	3215120	In a sense, the randomness only comes
3215120	3217400	if you now suddenly change your measurement
3217400	3221560	to something else, but you have a knowledge
3221560	3223840	about the system that is conditioned
3223840	3226760	on what you're measuring and you can update that.
3226760	3228640	And there's always, in the case
3228640	3230440	that you can do that update perfectly,
3230440	3234760	which you can get close to these days for some experiments,
3234760	3237400	there are always not a complete set of questions
3237400	3238320	you can answer perfectly.
3238320	3240440	Like you said, there are always more questions in quantum
3240440	3243000	than perhaps you can always get a deterministic answer for.
3243000	3244520	But there is a subset of those questions
3244520	3247640	that you can always know that if you ask the question,
3247640	3250720	is the qubit along the x direction?
3250720	3252320	Let's say you always get a perfect one,
3252320	3254840	even though you've been injecting randomness
3254840	3257620	into the system throughout with your measurement.
3258060	3261260	Maybe that was a bit long of a question,
3261260	3264180	so I apologize for that, Phil.
3264180	3266780	But perhaps if we can get your thoughts on QTT
3266780	3268580	and a bit of that, that would be great.
3270260	3272540	Well, I mean, of course, Lako,
3272540	3276300	you're the one who knows about this rather than me.
3276300	3279740	I was absolutely fascinated by those experiments
3280660	3284540	for various reasons, but I think that perhaps
3285100	3288940	the main one was that it seemed to me
3288940	3293940	that you were really starting to zero in
3294140	3298140	on what is happening when we make a measurement.
3298140	3301540	And in particular, to dispel this idea
3301540	3304700	that measurement is this mysterious black box
3304700	3308580	that suddenly turns all the quantum vagueness
3308580	3310220	into something concrete.
3311860	3313740	What really excited me about them
3313740	3317060	was that you can see that process happening
3317900	3319980	and that there are laws to it.
3321660	3324420	That it's not just magical and unpredictable
3324420	3327500	and everything else, that as you say,
3327500	3331220	if you are able to follow it with sufficient time resolution
3331220	3332620	in sufficient detail,
3332620	3335940	knowing almost everything about what is happening
3335940	3338220	in the system, then you can see something
3338220	3340340	that does look like a trajectory
3340340	3344460	that is taking the system from one state to another.
3345620	3350620	And this is why, I mean, it certainly convinced me
3351460	3354540	that this notion of wave function collapse
3354540	3358020	as a mysterious thing that suddenly snaps
3358020	3362020	a wave into a particle, that we really,
3362020	3364380	it's never really been needed in quantum mechanics.
3364380	3366140	I understand why it got there,
3366140	3368140	but it's time to get it back out again
3368140	3370460	because we don't need it.
3370460	3375460	And it seems to me that that is getting much closer
3375660	3378060	to having a proper understanding
3378060	3381580	of what it is that happens when we make a measurement.
3381580	3384220	Perhaps the one thing, and I'd be interested
3384220	3385940	in whether you have thoughts about this,
3385940	3390940	because the one thing that it doesn't seem to explain,
3394660	3397060	and this is really the sort of fundamental mystery
3397180	3400460	of quantum mechanics, why do you only ever get one thing?
3400460	3402140	And of course, there are some interpretations
3402140	3403060	that say, well, you don't,
3403060	3405380	you just get both in different universes.
3405380	3410380	But as far as we can ever see, quantum measurements are unique.
3411620	3414420	So where does that uniqueness come from,
3414420	3417020	given that we know in principle,
3417020	3419100	more than one outcome is possible?
3420260	3421620	That's a really deep question.
3421620	3425100	I think, in fact, I got asked a similar question
3425100	3430100	at my dissertation defense in the private dissertation part
3430980	3433420	where they take you aside to a room and quiz you
3433420	3437940	for until you come to a point of, anyway.
3437940	3440300	So I don't know that I have a great answer,
3440300	3442820	but maybe a few thoughts that are probably something
3442820	3444260	you've written about quite a bit,
3444260	3446580	as well as this notion you brought up earlier,
3446580	3449820	and I think you said Bell maybe had introduced it,
3449820	3454820	or of two different disconnected worlds,
3454980	3458220	the world of the quantum and the world of the classical.
3458220	3461300	And there's this notion of Heisenberg's cut,
3461300	3463260	the boundary between these two.
3464500	3468780	And there's no prescription in any textbook
3468780	3470900	or in any paper that I know of that you can find
3470900	3475900	that really pins down where does this difference occur
3476580	3479140	between what you call a measurement apparatus
3479140	3484140	and where you get classical results out of the system?
3484420	3486100	And what is the quantum system?
3486100	3487940	So for example, coming back to this,
3487940	3491700	to the quantum jumps nature paper you brought up earlier,
3492580	3495180	you could model, you could take that Heisenberg cut
3495180	3498100	at different stages of the experiment
3498100	3499660	and pretend like, for instance,
3499660	3501260	just the qubit itself is quantum,
3501260	3503140	and it's being subjected to a particular
3503140	3504820	classical measurement apparatus
3504820	3507900	that has this particular type of question
3507900	3509660	it's interrogating the system with,
3509660	3512260	kind of like the game that you mentioned earlier.
3513260	3516380	But it turns out that in what we had to do
3516380	3519740	for the experiment is we moved the cut one step further,
3519740	3522620	that apparatus was a particular type
3522620	3524860	of superconducting cavity.
3524860	3529020	And we model all of the quantum behavior of it as well.
3529020	3534020	Now that particular cavity is then followed
3534180	3535980	by another quantum amplifier.
3535980	3538780	And we could actually include the quantum amplifier itself
3538780	3541260	and also make this very large now quantum system.
3541500	3543300	You have three different quantum systems
3543300	3545140	that are all coupled together.
3545140	3547180	And you have this kind of matroshka doll
3547180	3550620	of nested larger systems that are increasingly
3550620	3552860	becoming more classical in a sense,
3552860	3554940	because at each stage you're amplifying
3554940	3558820	and in a sense the signal there's more quantum excitation
3558820	3560160	that are getting involved.
3560160	3562420	And perhaps with that, once you have,
3562420	3567420	like you said, the grain of dust that's floating in the air,
3567580	3570260	when you have so many quanta, so many excitations,
3570260	3573100	then you tend to couple more strongly
3573100	3578100	to this, well, decoherence, right?
3578700	3581260	Whatever that is precisely in itself.
3581260	3585780	And you tend to move already in the limit of where
3585780	3589700	a lot of the quantum nature tends to seem to get erased
3589700	3591180	or washed out in a sense.
3592340	3594460	At that stage though, it's still purely quantum system.
3594460	3597100	You could reverse and undo the measurement
3597100	3599380	in the sense of taking that information
3599380	3600380	because you're keeping track of it
3600380	3602020	and sort of feed it back into the system.
3602020	3604140	You still have all those degrees of freedom.
3604140	3606220	And then after that following amplifier
3606220	3607740	that comes after the cavity,
3607740	3610740	then we kind of don't know where to draw that Heisenberg cut.
3610740	3613980	In terms of the empirical experimental world,
3613980	3617620	that's roughly as far as our models are able to get us.
3617620	3619940	After that, we don't really have an equation or model
3619940	3622980	we could write down that we're currently able to say,
3622980	3623940	oh, now it's quantum.
3623940	3627940	So empirically we see that, okay, it occurs somewhere there,
3627980	3631020	is that a limitation of our ability to express it or not?
3632700	3634020	So-
3634020	3636020	Is this, I mean, it sounds to me as though
3636020	3638340	this is again really about information,
3638340	3641060	but in this notion of a cut,
3641060	3643220	it sounds as though what that really means
3643220	3646140	is where do you decide the point comes
3646140	3648020	where you're not going to any longer
3648020	3649580	or you can't any longer,
3649580	3652740	gather pretty much comprehensive information
3652740	3654740	about everything in the system.
3655140	3658860	And once you relinquish that attempt,
3658860	3661180	that's where the cut happens
3661180	3662940	because you have imperfect information.
3662940	3664860	Is that the right way to look at it?
3666980	3670060	I think that is definitely a practical way
3670060	3673540	to look at it that seems to work in practice.
3673540	3674700	Is it the ultimate solution?
3674700	3675860	I couldn't say.
3680380	3682740	And sorry, I'm gonna go on.
3683740	3685620	No, no, no, that's fine.
3685620	3687220	That's just what occurred to me
3687220	3688980	as you were describing the experiment.
3688980	3691340	It seemed to be a matter of,
3691340	3695700	well, how far out can you keep going in your apparatus
3695700	3699500	and still retain the ability to monitor
3699500	3702820	more or less everything that is happening
3702820	3705140	at the sort of quantum level?
3705140	3705980	Exactly.
3706940	3710220	And we've been able to now push that further and further out
3710220	3711860	and see that as you kind of climb up
3711860	3715420	the matresca dollar, the chain of nestedness here,
3715420	3720220	that you can move that Heisenberg cut quite far out
3720220	3721900	and still model things.
3721900	3722980	But at the end of the day,
3722980	3724620	we've simply moved the cut further away,
3724620	3726540	but we still have the cut.
3727420	3729300	So is it a fundamental cut or not?
3729300	3732380	I think that's an open question as far as it could tell.
3734260	3736540	But another way that people think about,
3736540	3737620	and I think we'd mentioned this,
3737620	3742020	is that you could say that to the contrary,
3742020	3747020	I think of what Bell had said.
3747500	3749660	John Bell, I think you said had band measurement
3749660	3750780	is a bad word.
3750780	3753820	I think to more experimentally-minded people like myself,
3753820	3756020	measurement is actually probably the essence
3756020	3756860	of the whole theory.
3756860	3758820	It's what we do, it's what we model,
3758820	3760580	it's what we describe.
3760580	3761980	That should actually be the core of it.
3761980	3763140	So perhaps we should start,
3763140	3764460	not with Schrodinger's equation,
3764460	3767100	which describes what the state of the system
3767740	3770580	if that even exists in of itself out there is,
3770580	3772140	but maybe we should start with a description
3772140	3772980	of the measurement.
3772980	3775780	So I could say closer along the lines of Q2T.
3776860	3779500	You could take that interaction between
3779500	3781780	what you call a system and the actual measurement,
3781780	3784100	because the problem is that in Schrodinger's equation,
3784100	3785780	a measurement is completely absent.
3785780	3788580	So Schrodinger's equation is linear, deterministic.
3788580	3793260	There's nothing really weird in Schrodinger's equation,
3793260	3795620	in a sense, the randomness,
3795620	3798180	if you want the weirdness of the quantum randomness
3798180	3800060	that comes into play,
3800060	3802580	only occurs at the stage of the actual measurement
3802580	3805500	when you have von Neumann's postulate and so on.
3805500	3808180	So it's that process that I think you so nicely pointed out
3808180	3811420	is what, now the field of physics is being able
3811420	3814180	to kind of open the hood on and describe.
3815060	3818420	But I think we've maybe said a lot on this.
3821620	3823460	Perhaps if you'd like to share this question
3823500	3825100	from the audience here on,
3825100	3827460	and you'd let me know if you'd like to take this one,
3827460	3829340	if you could, could you share your thoughts
3829340	3833900	on Maxwell's demon and perhaps how that relates
3833900	3838900	to all of quantum mechanics in the sense that you have,
3840740	3842900	I'm kind of reading into the question here,
3845460	3850460	when it comes to know ability and trying to kind of sift
3851420	3855460	or parse and sort of beat the laws of thermodynamics
3855460	3857780	in a way, but now at the level of quantum.
3857780	3860820	So perhaps if you'd like to offer some thoughts on that.
3860820	3862900	Yeah, yeah, well, very timely.
3862900	3866020	I've just been writing about Maxwell's demon today
3866020	3868460	and have done previously.
3868460	3873460	And everything that is discussed within the context
3874940	3877980	of Maxwell's demon is classical,
3878060	3881340	although there is a quantum Maxwell's demon as well,
3881340	3882700	there is a quantum version.
3882700	3885100	But, you know, classically, again,
3885100	3889460	it illustrates how so much seems to come down
3889460	3892460	to information, the quest of information.
3892460	3897460	So, and in essence, what Maxwell's demon tells us
3899180	3903180	is that information itself is a kind of resource
3903180	3905620	that we can use to do stuff with,
3905620	3908020	which I just find extraordinary.
3908020	3910820	I mean, it may be that not everyone knows
3910820	3912420	what Maxwell's demon is, so that, you know,
3912420	3914140	very, very briefly, it's a way,
3914140	3917460	it was a way that James Clark Maxwell in 1867
3917460	3921220	suggested of subverting the second law of thermodynamics.
3921220	3925180	The second law says, you can express it in many ways.
3925180	3928500	I mean, the simplest is just that heat always flows
3928500	3931000	from hot to cold and never the other way around.
3932000	3937000	But what it also implies is that there's no,
3937960	3940200	you can never get energy for free.
3940200	3942320	You can't, there's no perpetual motion.
3942320	3947120	That any system that does work,
3947120	3949920	it's always, some energy is always going to be wasted
3949920	3952600	and lost as sort of random motions to the system
3952600	3954320	as entropy, in fact.
3954320	3956840	So the entropy of the universe always increases.
3956840	3960080	And Maxwell didn't like this partly for religious reasons.
3960120	3962640	And so he came up with this idea of a little demon
3962640	3964560	that could actually reverse this
3964560	3968280	by having a trapdoor between two compartments
3968280	3970880	with gas in them, both with gas in them.
3970880	3973200	Gas starts at the same temperature in both.
3973200	3975480	But the hotter molecules are the ones
3975480	3977160	that are moving faster in the gas.
3977160	3979920	So the molecule, the demon looks at the molecules
3979920	3982720	and sees if a fast molecule is approaching
3982720	3985480	from one direction, he opens a trapdoor and lets it through.
3985480	3987680	If a cold molecule is approaching
3987680	3990200	from the other direction, he opens it and lets it through.
3990200	3991760	And so all the hot ones go one way
3991760	3992960	or the cold ones go the other.
3992960	3995320	And he ends up with hot gas on one side,
3995320	3997880	cold gas on the other, which is basically then
3997880	4000560	there's a thermal gradient that you can tap
4000560	4003880	in as some sort of power source to do some useful work.
4003880	4006320	So you've got energy essentially from nothing,
4006320	4010040	from just an ordinary gas.
4010040	4013400	So for a long time, people figured,
4013400	4014720	there must be something wrong with this.
4014720	4017240	How can it subvert the second law?
4017240	4019800	And it turns out that the answer is it can't
4019800	4021040	because of information.
4021040	4023000	And in this case, it's the information
4023000	4025640	that is recorded in the demon's mind,
4025640	4029000	that every, you know, it has to be gathering information
4029000	4032920	about those gas particles in order to do what it does.
4032920	4036840	And eventually that information, its mind is finite
4036840	4039560	and it has to erase that information.
4039560	4042080	Otherwise it's just too full and it can't do anymore.
4042080	4045720	And erasing that information costs energy.
4045720	4049080	And in effect, you get back all the energy
4049080	4052120	that you thought you'd got from the operation of a demon.
4052120	4054960	So there's, you know, you still don't get anything for free,
4054960	4056880	any energy for free.
4056880	4058280	So this is about information.
4058280	4060680	And people have realized that actually what this means
4060680	4063880	is that what looks to be sort of randomness,
4063880	4067000	statistical randomness, you know, at one level,
4067000	4070160	if you can zero in and get detailed information
4070160	4073720	about what is going on, then you can use that information
4073720	4077480	to mine the sort of random fluctuations in there
4077480	4079440	and get energy out.
4079440	4081560	And there have been experiments recently
4081560	4083440	that have shown this, that have actually shown
4083440	4086640	that you can do work on an object.
4086640	4088640	In this case, it was sort of raising up
4088640	4093520	a tiny little particle that was sort of floating about
4093520	4095680	in a liquid, if I remember rightly,
4095680	4097520	by making observations on it,
4097520	4099640	gathering information about its movements
4099640	4101900	and using that in some clever way,
4101900	4105100	you can actually do work and raise it up against gravity.
4105100	4109140	So information becomes a resource.
4109140	4112140	So, you know, again, there's this fundamental idea
4112140	4114580	and then the quantum version of it,
4114580	4116100	which I won't go into, you know,
4116100	4118620	is just sort of enacting that same idea
4118620	4120620	in terms of quantum information.
4120620	4124020	So it's really interesting how, you know, yet again,
4124020	4127820	so many ideas, fundamental ideas in physics,
4127820	4130460	but we also see it happening, of course, in biology,
4130460	4133820	are coming down to this question of what information is,
4133820	4138060	how it is embodied, how it can be used and manipulated,
4138060	4142220	and how it can become a resource that we can exploit.
4144900	4145980	Thank you, Phil.
4145980	4147300	That's wonderful.
4147300	4150140	I see that we are, we have a few more questions.
4150140	4151660	I won't be able to get to all of them
4151660	4154140	since I see we're about 15 minutes over,
4154140	4157420	but perhaps let's take one more final question
4157420	4159380	from Pranav here.
4159380	4162940	If, of course, Phil, you would be happy to share with us
4162940	4166900	on, you know, how did you decide to go into physics?
4166900	4169340	And then if you could tell us a little bit about your transition
4169340	4172860	into becoming a science writer and editor,
4172860	4175660	I think it seems like there's interest from the audience
4175660	4177980	if you'd like to share with us.
4177980	4179540	Well, talk about random walks.
4179540	4181140	I mean, this was certainly one of them
4181140	4185100	because I began my first degree was in chemistry
4185100	4188180	and it was at Oxford where the final year
4188180	4191980	you have to do a research year, which was fantastic.
4191980	4194220	It was by far my favorite part of the course.
4194220	4196860	And I did it on, in physical chemistry,
4196860	4201380	on the, actually the quantum mechanical behavior
4201380	4203460	of molecules absorbed on surfaces,
4203460	4205340	which is right at the sort of borderline, really,
4205340	4206300	of physics and chemistry.
4206300	4208340	And so when I came to do a PhD,
4208340	4211020	I just so happened that I ended up in a physics department
4211020	4214380	looking at similar stuff, condensed matter
4214380	4219380	and behavior of objects and fluids at surfaces.
4220180	4222300	And so that brought me into physics,
4222300	4224260	but I figured at the end of that,
4224260	4227180	this was going back a long way, I can tell you,
4227180	4231020	that unlike most people, I'd actually enjoyed writing up
4231020	4233180	my thesis and I enjoyed writing the papers
4233180	4235900	that came out of this, out of the PhD.
4235900	4237460	And so I thought, well, you know,
4237460	4238500	I'd never thought about this before.
4238500	4239780	I'd always enjoyed writing,
4239780	4242420	but I'd never thought about combining my enjoyment
4242420	4245340	of writing with science, but you can.
4245340	4249700	And I decided I'd see if I could do that in science editing.
4249700	4252380	And I was very lucky that just at the right moment,
4252380	4255060	a place came up at nature, which in those days,
4255060	4257660	this was the late 1980s, was just a journal.
4257660	4259860	It wasn't this big publishing empire.
4259860	4261820	It was just a single journal in a little office,
4261820	4264540	a crammed office, you know, piled with paper.
4264540	4268180	And I got a job there as an editor of physical sciences
4268180	4269780	and had stayed there for a long time.
4269780	4271540	It was a fantastic place to work.
4271540	4274580	It meant I got exposed to all areas of science.
4274580	4276740	It was a very, very steep learning curve.
4276740	4278980	And it also opened up other opportunities
4278980	4281420	to do writing for newspapers and so on.
4281420	4284060	And eventually I decided, maybe I'll write a book.
4284060	4284900	And I did.
4284900	4287380	And it was an awful experience in the sense
4287380	4289260	that I was working full-time at nature,
4289260	4292620	which was already, you know, working,
4292620	4294620	it was already an intense job.
4294620	4296380	So I figured I don't want to do that again,
4296380	4297380	but I want to write more.
4297380	4300740	And I gradually became more and more part-time at nature
4300740	4302060	until I finally stepped down.
4302060	4303020	I forget when it was,
4303020	4304740	but it was probably about 20 years ago now.
4304740	4307940	I stepped away from nature
4307940	4310260	and I'd still write for them regularly as a freelancer,
4310260	4311980	but I became completely freelance.
4311980	4314140	And now I split my time writing,
4314140	4317020	I guess pretty much 50-50 between writing books,
4317020	4318740	generally on scientific subjects,
4318740	4323580	often about how science interacts with the wider culture
4323580	4325900	and writing scientific journalism.
4326900	4328780	Thank you, Phil.
4328780	4331020	That's an inspiring story.
4332220	4337220	I think with that, I'll take maybe any final words
4338140	4339140	you'd like to share with us
4339140	4342420	before we thank the audience and yourself
4342420	4343820	for joining us here today.
4345460	4348020	Well, well, just to thank you again,
4349140	4352300	Zlacko, for inviting me to give this talk.
4352300	4353620	It was a great fun.
4353660	4357180	It's always been a lot of fun having any interactions
4357180	4358940	with IBM generally
4358940	4363940	and with the IBM quantum computing efforts in particular.
4364820	4368980	So it's very nice to be able to sustain that relationship.
4368980	4373980	And I'm always fascinated to see where quantum computing
4374380	4376740	and IBM and quantum technologies at IBM
4376740	4378220	have advanced to next.
4378220	4381460	So keep me in the loop about that.
4382460	4383300	Wonderful.
4383300	4384620	And I think we all look forward to
4384620	4387340	rereading many more books and articles from you, Phil.
4387340	4389220	This was an absolute delight.
4389220	4391780	Thank you everyone for tuning in today.
4391780	4394740	I still see we have over 130 folks tuned in,
4394740	4396020	20 minutes over time.
4396020	4397900	So I appreciate your time.
4397900	4398740	Thank you very much.
4398740	4400700	This talk will stay recorded and live
4400700	4401900	on the Kisken YouTube channel.
4401900	4404700	So feel free to subscribe to hear about future updates.
4406020	4408900	Thank you, Phil, for taking our invitation.
4408900	4411100	It has been a real privilege and pleasure
4411140	4412980	to have you here today.
4412980	4414920	And thank you, everyone.
4414920	4418420	We will see you next Friday at noon Eastern time.
