WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
The stage is yours.

00:02.480 --> 00:03.560
Thank you, Zlatko.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.040
Well, in this talk, what I want to do

00:07.040 --> 00:10.760
is to ask the following question.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.800
What does quantum mechanics mean?

00:13.960 --> 00:16.160
Well, without further ado,

00:16.160 --> 00:18.880
let me just skip to my conclusions.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.320
Nobody knows.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.560
Thanks for coming to my talk, I'll take questions.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.240
Well, okay, actually, I do have a few other things to add.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.200
The first is that if you read a book or an article

00:31.200 --> 00:33.440
that asks this question

00:33.440 --> 00:36.760
and it doesn't, at some stage, acknowledge this basic fact

00:36.760 --> 00:39.880
that we really don't know what quantum mechanics means,

00:39.880 --> 00:42.800
then I advise you to read it

00:42.800 --> 00:44.680
as you might say a book review.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.280
That's to say, don't imagine that the position it is giving

00:48.280 --> 00:52.000
is one that will necessarily be either right or wrong.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.840
Judge it instead by whether it seems to offer

00:54.840 --> 00:59.600
a stimulating and productive way to think about its subject.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.720
I think this at the moment is the best approach we can take

01:03.720 --> 01:05.960
to trying to answer this question

01:05.960 --> 01:07.600
of what quantum mechanics means.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.880
Now, you don't need to take my word for it

01:09.880 --> 01:12.680
that this ignorance about quantum mechanics exists

01:12.680 --> 01:14.840
because I'm sure that many of you will know

01:14.840 --> 01:17.440
this popular quote from Richard Feynman,

01:17.440 --> 01:19.440
who said, I think I can safely say

01:19.440 --> 01:22.800
that nobody understands quantum mechanics.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.600
And let me remind you that he actually said this in 1965.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.120
And that was the year that Feynman shared the Nobel Prize

01:31.120 --> 01:35.360
in physics for his work on quantum mechanics.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.040
So at that point, there was probably no one alive

01:39.040 --> 01:42.480
who knew more than Feynman did about quantum mechanics.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.800
And if this is the conclusion that he reached,

01:44.800 --> 01:48.400
you might well ask what hope is there for the rest of us.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.760
But I think today there's another way

01:50.760 --> 01:54.360
to answer the question of what quantum mechanics means.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.360
You see, one would be justified in giving an answer

01:57.360 --> 02:00.960
to that question like this.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.120
This, of course, is IBM's quantum computer.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.120
And in other words, quantum mechanics must surely tell us

02:08.120 --> 02:12.680
something about the world because we can now use it.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.640
We can use its principles to build machines like this one,

02:16.640 --> 02:19.440
which in fact Feynman himself first envisaged

02:19.440 --> 02:23.760
in the early 1980s, in which quantum objects are manipulated

02:23.760 --> 02:28.200
so as to let us do something real and useful.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.880
If quantum mechanics was not in some sense

02:30.880 --> 02:33.040
a valid description of the world,

02:33.040 --> 02:37.520
then quantum computers would not do what they're supposed to do.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.360
But as you'll see, I think that today's quantum information

02:41.360 --> 02:43.760
technologies like this, tell us something else

02:43.760 --> 02:47.840
about the possible answer to the question I started by asking.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.800
Because what they embody and in fact illustrate

02:50.800 --> 02:54.240
is an emerging sense among many, perhaps not all,

02:54.240 --> 02:57.640
but many of the people who ponder the meaning of quantum mechanics

02:57.640 --> 03:02.320
that it has something to say about the fundamental rules

03:02.320 --> 03:06.800
of what information is and how it can be encoded,

03:06.800 --> 03:11.440
moved and transformed in the world.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.400
Now, quantum mechanics has, of course, a reputation

03:14.400 --> 03:17.000
among laypeople, in fact, among many scientists,

03:17.040 --> 03:19.440
particularly those who don't make use of it,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.800
for being impossibly hard.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.680
So here's some quantum maths for you,

03:23.680 --> 03:26.800
but it's not the mathematics that's the problem,

03:26.800 --> 03:29.840
or at least it wasn't the problem for Feynman.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.680
He could do the maths just fine.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.720
The problem was that's all he could do.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.120
What he couldn't understand is what the maths meant,

03:39.120 --> 03:42.880
what it tells us about the nature of the world.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.880
Now, Feynman himself didn't seem too troubled by that.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.360
He said, you know, we've got a theory that works.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.000
It gives amazingly accurate predictions

03:51.000 --> 03:52.800
about how stuff will behave.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.000
In fact, it's potentially the most accurate theory

03:56.000 --> 03:57.800
in science at all.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.960
So what more can you want than that,

03:59.960 --> 04:02.320
an accurate theory that works?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.840
Well, some scientists feel the same way today,

04:04.840 --> 04:08.000
but usually we do want more because we want to know

04:08.000 --> 04:10.360
what our scientific theories tell us

04:10.360 --> 04:12.760
about what the world is like.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.920
And it wasn't clear to Feynman

04:14.920 --> 04:17.560
that quantum mechanics lets us do that,

04:17.560 --> 04:19.840
and it's still not clear today.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.360
But I want to suggest to you that we can do better

04:23.360 --> 04:25.720
than Feynman's admission of bafflement,

04:25.720 --> 04:27.400
or defeats, I might say.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.200
We don't have all the answers to what quantum mechanics means,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.600
but we do have better questions.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.640
We have a clearer sense than we did in the 1960s,

04:35.640 --> 04:39.600
or even in the 1980s, of what's important and what is not.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.560
And I want to try to give you a sense

04:41.560 --> 04:43.520
of what those things might be.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.760
So let me start with some things

04:45.760 --> 04:48.160
that everyone knows about quantum mechanics.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.440
And when I say everyone, I believe that this audience

04:51.440 --> 04:53.480
is a diverse mixture of experts

04:53.480 --> 04:55.920
who know much more about quantum mechanics than I do,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.480
and non-experts, perhaps non-scientists,

04:58.480 --> 05:00.800
who are nevertheless interested in the subject

05:00.800 --> 05:02.320
and everything in between.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.040
So if you didn't know any of these things yourself,

05:05.040 --> 05:07.720
don't worry, all I mean is that these are notions

05:07.720 --> 05:09.600
that you'll encounter pretty quickly

05:09.600 --> 05:11.920
the moment you start looking at what at least

05:11.920 --> 05:15.120
has been popularly written about quantum mechanics.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.760
First of all, we're told that quantum mechanics is weird.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.200
Things don't behave in the quantum world

05:22.200 --> 05:24.080
in ways that we're familiar with,

05:24.080 --> 05:26.240
and they don't quite make sense.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.200
And here are some of the ways in which they're weird.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.000
So quantum mechanics can be both waves and particles.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.280
This is called wave particle duality.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.160
Quantum objects can be in more than one state at once,

05:38.160 --> 05:40.840
and they can be both here and there, say,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.040
this is called superposition.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.840
You can't simultaneously know exactly

05:45.840 --> 05:48.000
two properties of a quantum object.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.840
This is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.000
Quantum objects can affect one another

05:53.000 --> 05:55.240
instantly over huge distances,

05:55.240 --> 05:57.800
and this is often called spooky action at a distance,

05:57.800 --> 06:01.120
and it arises from a phenomenon called entanglement.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.560
You can't exactly measure anything without disturbing it,

06:05.560 --> 06:10.040
and so the human observer can't be excluded from the theory.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.440
It becomes unavoidably subjective.

06:13.360 --> 06:17.360
Everything that can happen, or that can possibly happen,

06:17.360 --> 06:20.000
does happen, and there are two separate reasons

06:20.000 --> 06:21.040
why this claim is made.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.920
One is rooted in Feynman's work itself,

06:22.920 --> 06:24.920
which says that quantum objects

06:24.920 --> 06:28.560
take all possible paths through space.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.440
The other comes from the controversial

06:30.440 --> 06:32.840
many-words interpretation of quantum mechanics,

06:32.840 --> 06:34.880
which says that every time a quantum system

06:34.880 --> 06:37.920
faces a choice, it takes both choices,

06:37.920 --> 06:40.040
splitting into separate worlds.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.800
Okay, now here's the thing.

06:43.800 --> 06:48.800
Quantum mechanics itself doesn't say any of these things.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.680
They are all attempts to say

06:51.680 --> 06:53.960
what quantum mechanics might mean.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.760
Some of them are misleading.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.000
Some of them, I think, are plain wrong.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.520
Others are just unproven interpretations.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.920
So I'm saying that we need to change the record

07:05.920 --> 07:07.480
when we talk about quantum mechanics.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.080
We need to stop falling back

07:09.080 --> 07:12.080
on these tired old cliches and metaphors

07:12.080 --> 07:14.600
and to look more closely and more carefully

07:14.600 --> 07:18.920
at what quantum mechanics does and doesn't permit us to say.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.960
And the first point to realize

07:20.960 --> 07:23.280
is that there's a big difference between quantum theory,

07:23.280 --> 07:27.480
the maths and the mechanics that scientists use daily

07:27.480 --> 07:31.200
to predict stuff and to make devices like laptops and phones

07:31.200 --> 07:33.320
and indeed quantum computers.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.320
There's a difference between that

07:35.320 --> 07:38.880
and the interpretation of that theory.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.920
And this is what's so hard to grasp

07:40.920 --> 07:44.080
because normally the interpretation of a scientific theory

07:44.080 --> 07:46.840
seems obvious from the theory itself.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.200
Newtonian mechanics, the old classical mechanics

07:50.200 --> 07:51.920
that works for everyday objects

07:51.920 --> 07:54.760
like tennis balls and spaceships.

07:54.760 --> 07:59.760
This tells us what paths objects take

07:59.760 --> 08:02.000
as forces act on them.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.520
And we don't have to ask, what do you mean by object?

08:05.520 --> 08:07.440
What do you mean by path?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.040
It's obvious.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.240
That's not so for quantum mechanics.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.480
And let me give you a glimpse of why.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.320
To predict what a quantum object will do,

08:16.320 --> 08:18.600
in place of Newton's equations of motion,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.840
scientists generally use an equation

08:20.840 --> 08:23.680
devised by Erwin Schrodinger in 1924

08:23.680 --> 08:26.800
to describe the idea that quantum particles

08:26.800 --> 08:29.200
might act like waves.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.400
The Schrodinger equation doesn't give us

08:31.400 --> 08:33.520
a trajectory for the particle,

08:33.520 --> 08:36.400
but instead something called a wave function.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.840
And the wave function can be used to figure out

08:38.840 --> 08:42.160
where we might find the object in space.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.400
So the shape of a typical wave function in space

08:45.400 --> 08:47.760
might look something like this.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.880
So what does this mean?

08:49.880 --> 08:51.440
Well, it's often said that it means

08:51.440 --> 08:54.360
the particle is smeared out over space.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.200
And it does look that way, doesn't it, from this.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.080
But this isn't showing the density

09:00.080 --> 09:02.560
of the particle over space.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.840
This is the wave function,

09:03.840 --> 09:06.880
and it's a purely mathematical thing.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.920
And what the wave function lets us deduce

09:09.920 --> 09:13.120
is all the possible outcomes of measurements

09:13.120 --> 09:14.800
of the particle's properties,

09:14.800 --> 09:17.440
along with their relative probabilities.

09:17.440 --> 09:21.920
So to find the position where we'll observe the particle,

09:21.920 --> 09:24.600
then we simply calculate some number

09:24.600 --> 09:27.640
from the wave function at that point in space,

09:27.640 --> 09:29.920
and that gives us the probability

09:29.920 --> 09:32.680
that we will see the particle at that point.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.560
So the wave function doesn't tell us

09:34.560 --> 09:36.360
where we'll find the particle.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.720
It tells us the chance that we might find it

09:39.720 --> 09:43.960
at any particular position if we look.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.080
And this is what's so odd about quantum mechanics

09:46.080 --> 09:48.880
because it seems to point in the wrong direction

09:48.880 --> 09:50.720
compared to other scientific theories,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.640
not down towards the system we're studying,

09:53.640 --> 09:57.280
but up towards our experience of it.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.760
It says nothing, or perhaps I should say,

09:59.760 --> 10:01.320
it says nothing obvious

10:01.320 --> 10:05.520
about what the quantum system itself is like.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.600
In other words, the wave function

10:07.600 --> 10:09.880
is not a description of the quantum object.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.880
It is a prescription for what to expect

10:12.880 --> 10:15.320
when we make measurements on that object.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.080
But it's even more peculiar than this

10:18.080 --> 10:20.000
because the wave function doesn't tell us

10:20.000 --> 10:22.600
where the particle is likely to be at any instant,

10:22.600 --> 10:26.640
which we can then verify by making measurements on it.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.960
Rather, what the wave function,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.680
well, the wave function tells us nothing

10:30.680 --> 10:34.920
about where the particle is until we make a measurement.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
Strictly speaking, we shouldn't talk

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
about the particle at all,

10:38.920 --> 10:42.840
except in terms of measurements we might make on it.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.640
And this account of quantum mechanics

10:44.640 --> 10:46.120
is more or less the one that was given

10:46.120 --> 10:48.320
by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr

10:48.320 --> 10:50.960
and his collaborators, such as Heisenberg.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.600
And it's known today as the Copenhagen interpretation.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.080
And I'm not saying that the Copenhagen interpretation

10:57.080 --> 10:59.480
is right, but what's valuable, I think, about it

10:59.480 --> 11:01.960
is that it tells us where our confidence

11:01.960 --> 11:05.080
about the meaning of the theory has to stop.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.040
As it stands, quantum mechanics doesn't permit us

11:08.040 --> 11:12.040
to say anything with confidence about reality

11:12.040 --> 11:14.560
beyond what we can measure of it.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.520
And here's what I mean by that.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.760
One way of speaking about this measurement

11:19.760 --> 11:21.760
of a quantum particle goes like this.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.280
We say that before the measurement,

11:23.280 --> 11:26.680
a wave function is typically this broad spread out thing.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.560
But when we make a measurement

11:29.560 --> 11:32.280
and find the particle to be in a particular place,

11:32.280 --> 11:34.680
then the wave function switches suddenly

11:34.680 --> 11:38.520
to being a sharp spike at that single place.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.560
And this is generally called collapse of the wave function.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.720
And let me just mention that,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.480
contrary to popular belief,

11:44.480 --> 11:46.880
wave function collapse was never actually a part

11:46.880 --> 11:48.840
of the Copenhagen interpretation,

11:48.880 --> 11:51.280
at least as far as Bohr expressed it.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.840
Now, the problem here is that there's absolutely

11:53.840 --> 11:57.760
no mathematical prescription in the theory itself

11:57.760 --> 12:00.400
for how this collapse happens.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.600
You just have to assume it.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.720
You have to put it in by hand.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.720
That doesn't seem very satisfactory.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.280
But wave function collapse doesn't mean

12:08.280 --> 12:11.520
that the particle goes from being smeared out

12:11.520 --> 12:15.320
to being sharply defined once we make a measurement on it.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.760
All we can say is that before the measurement was made,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.520
there were different probabilities

12:20.520 --> 12:22.520
that a measurement would reveal it,

12:22.520 --> 12:24.800
in particular in different places.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.360
Whereas after the measurement,

12:26.360 --> 12:30.640
we can say for sure that it is here and not there.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.520
It's our knowledge that has changed.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.600
And some researchers think that this, in fact,

12:35.600 --> 12:37.440
is really what quantum mechanics is.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.360
It's a theory that describes how our knowledge

12:40.360 --> 12:44.240
about the world changes when we intervene in it.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.280
And we can't deduce from that anything

12:46.280 --> 12:48.880
about what the world was really like

12:48.880 --> 12:51.720
before we had that knowledge of it.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.000
So you see, it's misleading to talk about this situation

12:55.000 --> 12:58.360
as the particle being in many places at once.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.880
The situation tells us only what the possible outcomes

13:01.880 --> 13:03.720
of a measurement will be.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.720
And it's the same with quantum superpositions.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.160
Now, it's often said of superpositions

13:11.160 --> 13:12.760
that the odd thing about quantum objects

13:12.760 --> 13:15.080
is that they can be not only in two places at once,

13:15.080 --> 13:17.400
but in two states at once.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.600
For example, quantum objects have a property called spin.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.840
And all you need to know about it for now

13:23.840 --> 13:26.440
is that for some particles,

13:26.440 --> 13:30.200
it's a property that can have two possible orientations

13:30.200 --> 13:31.040
when you measure it.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.720
The spin, you could find that the spin of the particle

13:33.720 --> 13:36.040
points up or it points down.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.080
And so this is a property that could be used

13:38.080 --> 13:41.240
to encode bits of binary information.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.880
Up could represent a one, down could represent a zero,

13:44.880 --> 13:48.680
and that's the basis of all quantum information technologies

13:48.680 --> 13:50.000
such as quantum computers,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.240
because it means that spins or other quantum states

13:53.240 --> 13:56.200
can act as quantum bits or qubits.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.560
But you see spins at these quantum objects

14:00.560 --> 14:02.080
could be not just up or down,

14:02.080 --> 14:05.520
that's to say a qubit of encoding a one or a zero,

14:05.520 --> 14:09.560
they can be in a superposition of up and down states.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.800
And this is a property that somehow expands

14:12.800 --> 14:16.200
the space of possible states for quantum bits

14:16.200 --> 14:19.280
and allows quantum computers to do some calculations

14:19.280 --> 14:22.400
much more quickly than classical machines.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.680
Now, I've written it like this

14:23.680 --> 14:26.000
with these odd looking brackets

14:26.000 --> 14:28.920
to stress that this is just a formal way

14:28.920 --> 14:31.720
of writing a superposition.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.640
It's not a picture of reality.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.640
You see, although a spin qubit placed

14:37.640 --> 14:39.600
in a quantum superposition is often said

14:39.600 --> 14:41.360
to be into the two states at once,

14:41.400 --> 14:44.120
simultaneously a one and a zero, let's say,

14:44.120 --> 14:45.640
that's not really right.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.600
Because remember that the wave function

14:47.600 --> 14:50.640
tells us only what we can expect when we make a measurement.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.960
And so in this case,

14:51.960 --> 14:54.320
it says that a measurement on the qubit

14:54.320 --> 14:57.080
could yield a one or a zero.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.520
Both, in this case, are possible outcomes.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.120
And in fact, they're the only possible outcomes.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.800
But what's the qubit like before we make the measurement?

15:05.800 --> 15:08.960
Well, quantum mechanics doesn't really tell us that.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.320
Well, now you see, I'm talking not about smeared out particles

15:13.320 --> 15:14.760
or collapsing waves,

15:14.760 --> 15:18.720
but about how information can be encoded in quantum systems

15:18.720 --> 15:20.320
and how it can be read out.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.200
And this is the basis offered

15:22.200 --> 15:24.720
by quantum information technology,

15:24.720 --> 15:26.600
which isn't just a basis,

15:26.600 --> 15:30.200
which isn't just the basis of these amazing new technologies

15:30.200 --> 15:33.440
like quantum computing or quantum cryptography.

15:33.440 --> 15:37.960
It's also a new way of talking about quantum mechanics itself

15:37.960 --> 15:41.120
and potentially talking about quantum information

15:41.120 --> 15:43.520
might allow us to see past

15:43.520 --> 15:47.800
all this old style paraphernalia of wave functions

15:47.800 --> 15:51.280
and Schrodinger equations and quantum jumps

15:51.280 --> 15:52.600
and to get to the core

15:52.600 --> 15:55.960
of what the theory really seems to be telling us.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.040
And there's an example of what I mean by that

15:58.040 --> 16:01.240
in one of the most perplexing features of quantum mechanics,

16:01.240 --> 16:04.080
which is that the outcomes of measurements

16:04.080 --> 16:06.520
or observations seem to depend

16:06.520 --> 16:11.160
on how much information we gather about the system.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.320
And this is something that's commonly illustrated

16:13.320 --> 16:15.840
by the quantum double slit experiment.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.880
So if we send water waves or light waves

16:19.880 --> 16:23.560
through two closely spaced slits,

16:23.560 --> 16:26.840
then the waves emerging from each will spread out

16:26.840 --> 16:28.280
and interfere with one another

16:28.280 --> 16:32.680
and create a pattern where they alternately reinforce

16:32.680 --> 16:34.000
or cancel each other.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.520
So for light, if you do this,

16:35.520 --> 16:38.480
you find a series of bright and dark bands

16:38.480 --> 16:41.400
on a screen that's placed behind the slits.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.760
If you do it for electrons,

16:43.760 --> 16:45.400
which according to quantum mechanics

16:45.400 --> 16:47.520
can also show these wave-like properties,

16:47.520 --> 16:49.280
then you'll find the same thing.

16:49.280 --> 16:53.000
You don't just get two images of the slits as you would

16:53.000 --> 16:55.480
if you were firing sand grains through a mask

16:55.480 --> 16:57.080
from a sand blaster.

16:57.080 --> 17:00.040
So, you know, as you would in the top case here,

17:00.040 --> 17:02.000
you get wavy interference.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.840
You get this interference pattern,

17:03.840 --> 17:08.560
these many bands of more or less electrons hitting the screen.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.640
And this interference persists,

17:10.640 --> 17:13.840
even if the intensity of the beam is so low

17:13.840 --> 17:15.320
that you know that the electrons

17:15.320 --> 17:17.760
will be going through the slits one at a time.

17:17.760 --> 17:21.960
It's as if each electron goes through both slits at once

17:21.960 --> 17:23.440
and interferes with itself.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.040
But now, if you put a detector close to one slit,

17:28.040 --> 17:29.480
which can detect the electron

17:29.480 --> 17:31.640
and see which slit it went through,

17:31.640 --> 17:34.000
then you'll find indeed that the detector

17:34.000 --> 17:36.480
will tell you it goes through one and not the other.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.560
The detector might click or it might not.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.840
But then, if you find out that information,

17:42.840 --> 17:47.840
what you find is that the electron,

17:48.360 --> 17:51.080
this interference pattern goes away

17:51.080 --> 17:53.920
and the electron behaves like a regular particle.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.000
And crucially, it's not that the detection itself

17:58.000 --> 18:00.840
is somehow disturbing the electron's motion

18:00.840 --> 18:03.040
and getting rid of this wavy behavior.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.680
It seems to be the very fact of knowing

18:05.680 --> 18:07.320
which slit it goes through

18:07.320 --> 18:10.400
that destroys the quantum-like waviness.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.760
And you can see that that's so

18:11.760 --> 18:14.320
in what's called a delayed choice experiment

18:14.320 --> 18:16.560
where you set up a detection scheme in a clever way.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.920
So you only detect the particle's path

18:19.920 --> 18:24.760
sometime after you're sure it has passed through the slits.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.280
So then, you can be sure that the detection itself

18:27.320 --> 18:31.680
isn't physically influencing the passage through the slits.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.840
Nevertheless, finding out that information

18:34.840 --> 18:37.720
will again destroy the interference pattern.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.640
The particle will behave like a particle.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.680
But if you leave the detector there and just turn it off

18:43.680 --> 18:45.800
so that you don't know which slit it went through,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.560
then the interference returns.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.720
It's as if the particles spookily know

18:50.720 --> 18:54.920
whether or not your eavesdropping on which path they took.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.560
It's behavior like this that led Niels Bohr

18:57.560 --> 18:59.000
to assert that there's something special

18:59.000 --> 19:00.880
about measurement of quantum systems

19:00.880 --> 19:03.120
that compels a quantum object

19:03.120 --> 19:06.400
to make a choice about the properties that it has.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.960
And until we do that, or unless we do that,

19:08.960 --> 19:12.480
the property that the object has is undefined

19:12.480 --> 19:15.480
and we simply can't talk meaningfully about it.

19:16.480 --> 19:21.480
Now, famously, that idea was at the core of the dispute

19:21.480 --> 19:24.920
that grew up between Bohr and Einstein.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.680
For Einstein, this notion that the world is somehow

19:27.680 --> 19:31.440
indeterminate until we looked seemed absurd.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.760
It seemed like the antithesis of science itself.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.840
And in 1935, Einstein and two younger colleagues,

19:37.840 --> 19:39.920
Boris Podolski and Nathan Rosen,

19:39.920 --> 19:41.720
came up with a thought experiment

19:41.720 --> 19:46.720
which they believed showed why Bohr's view had to be wrong.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.560
Now, this experiment was later put in a slightly clearer form

19:50.560 --> 19:51.880
by the physicist David Bowman.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.280
That's how I'll describe it here.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.800
So this is how it goes.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.960
You have a box that spits out two quantum particles

19:58.960 --> 20:01.200
that are in an entangled state.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.920
And this means that their properties are interdependent.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.960
So let's say that they have spins

20:08.960 --> 20:10.960
which can only have two values when measured,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.880
like I said, spin up or spin down.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.600
Okay, so if they're entangled,

20:14.600 --> 20:17.080
this means that the measurement outcomes

20:17.080 --> 20:19.600
must be correlated between the two particles.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.440
Typically, if one has a spin that points up,

20:22.440 --> 20:24.720
then the other one has to point down.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.720
We can't specify which is which,

20:27.720 --> 20:30.360
but we know for sure that they must be correlated

20:30.360 --> 20:32.040
because of the way we produce them.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.200
So then if we measure the spin on one particle

20:35.200 --> 20:38.200
and we find that it's a spin up particle,

20:38.200 --> 20:42.280
then we know that the other particle must have spin down.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.360
Okay, now this correlation in itself

20:44.360 --> 20:45.560
might seem unremarkable

20:45.560 --> 20:48.560
because you could say the same thing about two gloves,

20:48.560 --> 20:52.320
let's say if someone sent them separately,

20:52.320 --> 20:55.080
one glove to me, one glove to you through the mail.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.400
If I open my package and I see I've got the right hand glove,

20:58.400 --> 21:01.320
then I know instantly without even having to ask you

21:01.320 --> 21:04.000
that you have got the left hand one.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.320
But here's the crucial thing

21:05.320 --> 21:07.320
because according to Bohr's interpretation

21:07.320 --> 21:10.400
of quantum mechanics, the direction of the spins,

21:10.400 --> 21:13.360
unlike the handedness of those two gloves,

21:13.360 --> 21:15.600
isn't determined in advance.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.600
It isn't determined until we, one of us,

21:18.600 --> 21:22.000
actually observes what they've got.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.320
Now, if that's so,

21:24.320 --> 21:26.520
then this so-called EPR experiment

21:26.520 --> 21:28.400
seemed to be saying that making a measurement

21:28.400 --> 21:31.360
on one particle instantaneously

21:31.360 --> 21:35.080
fixes the direction of the arrow or the spin for the other.

21:35.080 --> 21:39.360
It's as if there's some spooky communication

21:39.360 --> 21:40.400
passing between them.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.400
And this is what Einstein called spooky action at a distance.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.960
It was Erwin Schrödinger

21:45.960 --> 21:48.640
who shared Einstein's skepticism

21:48.640 --> 21:51.160
about the Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.280
It was Schrödinger who named it instead entanglement.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.960
This kind of instantaneous communication or action

21:58.960 --> 22:02.000
between two objects separating in space

22:02.000 --> 22:03.840
was known to be impossible.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.240
It was forbidden by Einstein's own

22:06.240 --> 22:07.920
special theory of relativity.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.680
So Einstein argued that quantum mechanics

22:10.680 --> 22:12.520
couldn't be the whole story here.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.480
There must be some missing ingredient,

22:14.480 --> 22:16.920
which he said was some property,

22:16.920 --> 22:19.520
which we now call a hidden variable,

22:19.520 --> 22:21.320
that we couldn't measure,

22:21.320 --> 22:25.560
but that somehow gives definite values

22:25.560 --> 22:28.040
to these properties, the spins say,

22:28.040 --> 22:30.120
to the particles all along.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.040
The problem is that simply measuring particles

22:34.040 --> 22:36.520
like in an experiment like this,

22:36.520 --> 22:38.720
measuring two entangled particles

22:38.720 --> 22:40.160
isn't gonna tell you who's right,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.880
or Einstein, because that won't reveal anything

22:42.880 --> 22:44.840
about what the particles were like

22:44.840 --> 22:46.360
before you measured them.

22:46.360 --> 22:50.200
So no one knew how to deal with this apparent EPR paradox,

22:50.200 --> 22:51.080
as it was called.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.080
And for decades, it was just brushed under the rug.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.200
But all that changed in 1964

22:56.200 --> 22:59.040
when the Irish physicist John Bell,

22:59.040 --> 23:03.680
whose day job was as a particle physicist at CERN in Geneva,

23:03.680 --> 23:06.080
reformulated the EPR experiment

23:06.080 --> 23:09.520
in a way that suggested that it could be conducted for real.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.560
So in short, Bell's experiment

23:11.560 --> 23:13.600
involved a clever way of combining measurements

23:13.600 --> 23:18.560
made by two observers on pairs of entangled particles,

23:18.560 --> 23:20.560
where the observers themselves

23:20.560 --> 23:23.280
decided how they'd make the measurement.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.160
And the setup is actually what's sketched

23:26.160 --> 23:28.520
behind the blackboard here with Bell,

23:28.520 --> 23:31.700
but here's maybe a clearer depiction of it.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.960
So what you do is you look at how strong the correlations

23:36.960 --> 23:39.080
between pairs of entangled particles are

23:39.120 --> 23:41.680
for different choices of how you make the measurement.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.360
And Bell showed that if the particles were either classical

23:45.360 --> 23:48.480
or were governed by Einstein's hidden variables,

23:48.480 --> 23:50.200
so that either way their properties

23:50.200 --> 23:52.280
were actually fixed all along,

23:52.280 --> 23:54.720
then the strength of the correlations

23:54.720 --> 23:57.600
that you get in many repeated experiments here

23:57.600 --> 24:01.920
added up in a certain way couldn't exceed a certain value.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.040
But if they were governed by quantum mechanics,

24:04.040 --> 24:08.100
as Bohr put it, and Bohr was right to say

24:08.100 --> 24:10.820
that we couldn't see anything about the properties

24:10.820 --> 24:11.980
before we measured them,

24:11.980 --> 24:16.500
then this correlation would be larger than that threshold.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.220
So these experiments were first done in the 1970s

24:19.220 --> 24:21.140
by John Clouser and Stuart Friedman

24:21.140 --> 24:22.860
at the University of California at Berkeley

24:22.860 --> 24:26.260
using laser photons as the entangled object.

24:26.260 --> 24:29.020
And they've been repeated many, many times since,

24:29.020 --> 24:30.900
then made ever more rigorous

24:30.900 --> 24:33.820
and ever more able to rule out possible loop holes

24:33.820 --> 24:35.340
in Bell's argument.

24:35.340 --> 24:39.140
Every single time they've given the same very clear result,

24:39.140 --> 24:42.740
which is that quantum mechanics alone is right.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.700
Bohr's argument seems to be right

24:44.700 --> 24:49.540
and there's no need, no argument for Einstein's hidden variables.

24:49.540 --> 24:50.540
So how can this be?

24:50.540 --> 24:53.480
What was wrong with the EPR argument?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.180
Well, Einstein and his colleagues

24:55.180 --> 24:58.660
made the perfectly reasonable assumption of locality,

24:58.660 --> 25:01.360
which is really saying that the properties of a particle

25:01.360 --> 25:04.180
are localized on that particle itself

25:04.180 --> 25:07.080
and that what happens to this particle here

25:07.080 --> 25:09.980
can't affect what happens to another particle there

25:09.980 --> 25:11.540
in some different part of space

25:11.540 --> 25:14.300
without some way of transmitting an effect

25:14.300 --> 25:17.140
across the intervening space between them.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.300
But it seems that nature doesn't work that way

25:20.300 --> 25:21.620
at the quantum level.

25:21.620 --> 25:25.540
We can't regard the two particles in the EPR experiment

25:25.540 --> 25:29.180
as separate entities, even though they're separated in space.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.180
When they are quantum entangled,

25:31.180 --> 25:32.020
they can be both,

25:32.020 --> 25:34.220
they have to be both considered in some sense

25:34.220 --> 25:37.860
a single non-local entity.

25:37.860 --> 25:40.700
And in fact, it's only if we accept Einstein's assumption

25:40.700 --> 25:43.580
of locality that we need to tell the story

25:43.580 --> 25:45.620
in terms of particle one,

25:45.620 --> 25:48.200
somehow influencing the spin of particle two

25:48.200 --> 25:49.340
when we make the measurement,

25:49.340 --> 25:51.540
this spooky action at a distance.

25:51.540 --> 25:55.080
The alternative view is that we have to invoke

25:55.080 --> 25:57.460
quantum non-locality,

25:57.460 --> 26:00.780
this idea that somehow quantum properties

26:00.780 --> 26:05.780
can be delocalized between two or more objects.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.260
So here again, we seem to find this issue

26:08.260 --> 26:10.500
of how measurement and information

26:10.500 --> 26:12.420
and the re-information we get from it

26:12.420 --> 26:15.500
seem to affect the outcomes itself.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.380
As with the double slit experiment,

26:17.380 --> 26:19.020
you can show in a belt test

26:19.020 --> 26:22.060
that it's not the physical act of making the measurement

26:22.060 --> 26:24.540
on one particle that somehow seems to fix

26:24.540 --> 26:26.740
the property of the other.

26:26.740 --> 26:29.460
It's the matter of whether that measurement

26:29.500 --> 26:33.700
unambiguously tells you what the state of your particle is.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.460
So it's the knowledge that matters.

26:36.460 --> 26:39.500
Measurement has become something of a dirty word

26:39.500 --> 26:41.900
in quantum mechanics because it seems to bring up

26:41.900 --> 26:43.380
all these peculiarities.

26:43.380 --> 26:47.260
In fact, John Bell placed it on a list of bad words

26:47.260 --> 26:50.220
which incidentally also included information

26:50.220 --> 26:51.580
that he thought should be banned

26:51.580 --> 26:53.540
from talking about quantum mechanics.

26:53.540 --> 26:56.420
But these days, measurement isn't quite the mystery

26:56.420 --> 26:57.360
that it once was.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.520
Even though it's not fully understood yet either.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.720
I see in Boar's view, a measurement was necessarily

27:02.720 --> 27:04.680
something governed by classical physics

27:04.680 --> 27:07.760
because ultimately it needed classical scale stuff,

27:07.760 --> 27:11.080
you know, a piece of apparatus and us to look at it.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.640
And so for him, that was the end of the mystery

27:13.640 --> 27:15.880
because he said that quantum and classical

27:15.880 --> 27:17.720
were just distinct regimes.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.960
And we shouldn't expect to be able to pronounce

27:19.960 --> 27:21.920
about what went on in the quantum world

27:21.920 --> 27:24.280
from the perspective of the classical one.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.240
In effect, he declared that there was a fundamental divide

27:27.280 --> 27:28.440
between them.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.000
Now, it's not surprising that that seemed

27:31.000 --> 27:34.280
a deeply unsatisfactory answer to some researchers,

27:34.280 --> 27:35.800
including Einstein.

27:35.800 --> 27:39.080
But today we can do somewhat better than that.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.560
We know, for example, that a measurement involving,

27:42.560 --> 27:45.640
any measurement involving the interaction of a quantum system

27:45.640 --> 27:50.320
with some classical environment like a measuring device

27:50.320 --> 27:52.960
that aims to extract information about it.

27:52.960 --> 27:56.400
Any measurement like that involves entanglement.

27:56.400 --> 28:00.920
Entanglement happens whenever one particle encounters another.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.240
In fact, quantum mechanics says if they interact,

28:03.240 --> 28:05.000
that's the only thing that can happen.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.680
They have to become entangled.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.680
And if you make a measurement so that more and more

28:09.680 --> 28:12.760
of these interactions with the environment accumulate,

28:12.760 --> 28:16.800
the quantum system itself becomes more and more entangled

28:16.800 --> 28:17.960
with its environment.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.920
You might say that what this means is that the process

28:20.920 --> 28:25.000
spreads out the quantumness of the original object

28:25.000 --> 28:26.840
into its surroundings.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.640
And in that process, the quantumness

28:29.640 --> 28:31.880
kind of gets diluted into the environment.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.240
And here's what I mean by that.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.240
Let's say you have a quantum bit, a qubit, in a superposition,

28:37.240 --> 28:39.440
and then you make a measurement on it,

28:39.440 --> 28:41.600
and it becomes entangled with its environment.

28:41.600 --> 28:46.760
So the superposition then spreads into those particles, too.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.080
And if you want to demonstrate that you still

28:49.080 --> 28:51.080
have a superposition there at all,

28:51.080 --> 28:55.200
then you have to look for it in all those entangled particles.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.040
And that quickly becomes impossible.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.960
It will be a bit like trying to keep track

28:58.960 --> 29:02.840
of every single gas molecule that you just breathed out

29:02.840 --> 29:05.200
as it collides with and mixes with all of those

29:05.200 --> 29:06.960
in the air around it.

29:06.960 --> 29:11.080
So this process is a real physical process.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.720
It's called decoherence, and it leads

29:13.720 --> 29:17.000
to the apparent disappearance of quantum properties

29:17.000 --> 29:20.520
like superposition in the original quantum object

29:20.520 --> 29:23.280
when it's observed and when its properties are measured.

29:23.280 --> 29:27.080
And it's possible to calculate how fast decoherence should

29:27.080 --> 29:30.560
happen when a quantum system interacts with its environment.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.200
And we find that generally, it's so fast,

29:33.200 --> 29:35.080
it's almost instantaneous.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.560
So for example, if you could somehow

29:36.560 --> 29:40.280
put a dust grain in the air in a quantum superposition

29:40.280 --> 29:42.440
of states, you can calculate that it

29:42.440 --> 29:46.680
would decoher in this room in about 10 to the minus 31

29:46.680 --> 29:49.520
seconds, faster than anything we can measure.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.440
And what you're left with when that happens

29:51.440 --> 29:54.640
is classical behavior, definite properties

29:54.640 --> 29:59.080
with fixed values, such as a well-defined position

29:59.080 --> 30:00.120
in space.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.440
In fact, according to one theory that

30:02.440 --> 30:06.840
describes how this decoherence changes quantum to classical,

30:06.840 --> 30:09.720
it's a theory called quantum Darwinism.

30:09.720 --> 30:14.200
This process not only gives objects fixed definite values

30:14.200 --> 30:16.680
of their properties, but it actually picks out

30:16.680 --> 30:21.160
from all the quantum features precisely those properties

30:21.160 --> 30:23.600
that are meaningful in the classical world,

30:23.600 --> 30:28.160
properties like position and speed and charge.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.720
So only certain quantum features, the theory says,

30:31.720 --> 30:36.360
have the right characteristics to survive the filtering

30:36.360 --> 30:38.720
process of decoherence.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.480
And they do that.

30:40.480 --> 30:43.880
They have those properties because they are particularly

30:43.880 --> 30:48.760
good at making many imprints or copies of themselves

30:48.760 --> 30:50.080
in their environment.

30:50.080 --> 30:54.000
That's where the Darwinism part of the theory comes in.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
You see, when we make an observation of an object,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.760
what we're really doing is detecting the traces

30:59.760 --> 31:02.480
that it imprints on its environment.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.400
You can only see me now because of the photons that

31:05.400 --> 31:07.760
have scattered from my particles and made their way

31:07.760 --> 31:09.240
into the camera.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.320
This all gets a bit more complicated

31:11.320 --> 31:13.120
when we're talking about virtual talks,

31:13.120 --> 31:14.520
but it sort of works.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.600
And you can only hear me because of the imprint

31:16.600 --> 31:20.200
that my particles have made on the air molecules,

31:20.200 --> 31:22.320
the movements of the air molecules.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.960
In fact, you could reconstruct everything

31:24.960 --> 31:28.040
you can say about an object, like a dust grain,

31:28.040 --> 31:32.520
say, from those imprints, like the photons of light

31:32.520 --> 31:34.400
that are bouncing off it here.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.320
And you could reconstruct all of that,

31:37.320 --> 31:42.000
even if just after those photons have bounced off,

31:42.000 --> 31:46.040
the object itself was somehow to magically vanish from space.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.720
You could still see it from the imprint

31:48.720 --> 31:51.880
that it's left for a short time.

31:51.880 --> 31:55.480
And you can all agree on my properties, my position,

31:55.480 --> 31:57.920
the color of my shirt, what I'm saying,

31:57.920 --> 31:59.440
classical properties like this.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.360
You can agree on them because there

32:01.360 --> 32:04.280
are lots of the imprints that I'm making on the environment.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.160
They're highly redundant imprints.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.360
There are loads of scattered photons from me,

32:08.360 --> 32:10.160
enough for all of you to share.

32:10.160 --> 32:15.080
If one of you was somehow able to harvest every photon I scatter,

32:15.080 --> 32:19.760
no one else could see me and make any observation of me.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.360
And it's this creation of many copies or imprints

32:23.360 --> 32:26.640
via interactions and entanglement with the environment

32:26.640 --> 32:29.120
that is described by quantum Darwinism,

32:29.120 --> 32:32.400
and that in this theory, at least, that

32:32.400 --> 32:35.480
is how quantum becomes classical.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.920
Now, there seems to be no avoiding decoherent for objects

32:38.920 --> 32:41.760
the size of a dust grain, even in a vacuum.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.360
Interactions with thermal radiation, infrared photons

32:45.360 --> 32:47.480
from the warmth of the room, would still

32:47.480 --> 32:51.720
cause it to decoher in about 10 to the minus 18 seconds.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.320
Even if you put that grain of dust

32:54.320 --> 32:57.880
in the cold emptiness of interstellar space,

32:57.880 --> 33:00.680
it would still decoher in about a second

33:00.680 --> 33:03.800
because of the microwave photons out there

33:03.800 --> 33:07.760
from the cosmic background radiation.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.960
So in other words, the reason we can't generally

33:09.960 --> 33:12.880
observe quantum effects like superposition in objects

33:12.880 --> 33:16.040
of everyday scale is not because there's

33:16.040 --> 33:20.200
some law of nature that forbids quantumness at those scales,

33:20.200 --> 33:24.440
but because decoherence will destroy it almost instantly.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.720
And it does so because of quantum entanglement itself.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.800
If we could figure out how to put a tennis ball in some

33:30.800 --> 33:32.560
well-defined superposition of states

33:32.560 --> 33:36.600
and to isolate it completely from sources of decoherence,

33:36.600 --> 33:39.120
and yet this is a tricky bit, somehow,

33:39.120 --> 33:41.800
still monitor its state accurately enough,

33:41.800 --> 33:43.720
quantum mechanics says there's no reason

33:43.720 --> 33:46.960
why such a superposition should be impossible.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.680
Now some physicists think that there might be other factors

33:49.680 --> 33:52.080
in that situation that will come into play

33:52.080 --> 33:54.360
that will destroy quantum coherence anyway,

33:54.360 --> 33:56.760
some think that gravity will do it.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.760
But it's not clear that anything extra is needed

33:59.760 --> 34:04.200
to effectively banish quantum phenomena at everyday scales.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.480
In other words, the world is quantum all the way up,

34:08.480 --> 34:11.080
and classical physics is pretty much just what

34:11.080 --> 34:15.040
quantum physics looks like when you're six feet tall.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.480
And that's really what I mean by the title of my talk.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.200
And I should just add for this audience that decoherence

34:21.200 --> 34:23.960
is the enemy of quantum computing.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.720
Computing with qubits relies on keeping them

34:26.720 --> 34:28.680
in a collective state of superposition

34:28.680 --> 34:30.800
while the computation proceeds.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.360
Decoherence will mess that up.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.840
And that's why quantum circuits have to be cooled

34:35.840 --> 34:37.800
to such extremely low temperatures

34:37.800 --> 34:39.960
within a whisker of absolute zero,

34:39.960 --> 34:43.000
because this suppresses all the thermal jiggling

34:43.000 --> 34:45.160
that would otherwise disrupt the qubits.

34:45.160 --> 34:48.400
And it's the difficulty of maintaining this coherence

34:48.400 --> 34:52.440
and suppressing decoherence in ever greater numbers

34:52.440 --> 34:56.120
of entangled qubits that explains why quantum computers

34:56.120 --> 34:59.840
so far don't have more than around 70 qubits or so

34:59.840 --> 35:01.440
to play with.

35:01.440 --> 35:06.120
But it's a testament to how much power quantum rules give you

35:06.120 --> 35:10.040
that already quantum computers can do in seconds

35:10.040 --> 35:12.280
with just that number of qubits,

35:12.280 --> 35:14.800
some calculations that would take today's

35:14.800 --> 35:18.400
classical supercomputers a billion years or so.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.600
Now, there's a curious thing about Bell's experiments

35:22.600 --> 35:24.040
that's often not remarked upon.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.840
I remember I said that the quantum mechanics allows

35:26.840 --> 35:28.920
correlations between entangled particles

35:28.920 --> 35:32.440
to be stronger than they would be in classical physics

35:32.440 --> 35:34.480
or for hidden variables.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.640
But quantum mechanics too sets a limit

35:36.640 --> 35:38.680
on how strong those correlations can be.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.600
And it's not obvious why they couldn't be stronger.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.520
We don't know why that is, why the world isn't,

35:44.520 --> 35:47.600
if you like, even more quantum than it is.

35:47.600 --> 35:51.000
But one useful way to think about what's going on there

35:51.000 --> 35:52.720
is that there seems to be a limit

35:52.720 --> 35:56.960
on how much sharing of information quantum mechanics

35:56.960 --> 36:00.280
permits between entangled particles.

36:00.280 --> 36:04.000
So here again, what makes quantum mechanics what it is,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.040
seems at root to have nothing to do

36:06.040 --> 36:07.800
with mathematical notions.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.840
And this is precisely where some scientists

36:18.840 --> 36:22.600
think we should start in trying to reconstruct

36:22.600 --> 36:24.840
quantum mechanics from scratch,

36:24.840 --> 36:27.560
not from these ad hoc guesses,

36:27.560 --> 36:29.160
as they really were to begin with,

36:29.160 --> 36:32.880
about waves and particles and Schrodinger equations,

36:32.880 --> 36:36.320
but from some simple axioms, some simple assumptions

36:36.320 --> 36:38.760
about what is permitted with information,

36:38.760 --> 36:41.600
how it can be encoded, how it can be transferred,

36:41.600 --> 36:42.960
how it can be read out.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.720
And I want to give you just a flavor

36:44.720 --> 36:47.640
of what this sort of reconstruction would look like.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.600
There are many of them that have been suggested.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.720
They all are somewhat similar.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.120
And I've taken one at random

36:53.120 --> 36:57.360
that was suggested in 2009 by Borovoye Dakic

36:57.360 --> 37:01.560
and Chaslav Bruckner at the University of Vienna in Austria.

37:01.560 --> 37:05.360
They proposed what they said were three reasonable axioms

37:05.360 --> 37:07.040
about how the world might be.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.960
And this is what the axioms were,

37:08.960 --> 37:13.160
that first of all, the most elementary components

37:13.160 --> 37:15.480
of the world, whatever those are,

37:15.480 --> 37:20.480
can carry no more than one bit of information within them.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.960
They assumed secondly, that the state of,

37:23.960 --> 37:25.920
what they called locality.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.720
So the way they expressed it was a state of a composite system

37:28.720 --> 37:31.560
made of many subsystems is completely determined

37:31.560 --> 37:34.600
by measurements made on its subsystems.

37:34.600 --> 37:39.600
What that really means is that there are no secret mechanisms

37:41.000 --> 37:43.760
like hidden variables manipulating what's going on.

37:43.760 --> 37:47.360
Thirdly, they assumed that this property of reversibility,

37:47.360 --> 37:50.600
that you can convert any pure states

37:50.600 --> 37:52.720
from one to the other and back again,

37:52.720 --> 37:56.200
like a coin toss flipping heads and tails.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.880
So Dakic and Bruckner showed that with these assumptions alone

37:59.880 --> 38:02.080
about information really,

38:02.080 --> 38:04.640
that they will lead you inevitably

38:04.640 --> 38:07.080
to only two sets of possible rules

38:07.080 --> 38:09.200
about how things can happen.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.440
And those are the rules that are described

38:11.440 --> 38:15.120
by classical mechanics and by quantum mechanics.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.560
And what's more, if you modify this third axiom

38:18.560 --> 38:23.480
to assume that states can be interconverted gradually,

38:23.480 --> 38:26.600
little by little, rather than in one big jump,

38:26.600 --> 38:31.600
then you only get rules that conform to quantum mechanics.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.920
So for a classical coin toss, for example,

38:34.920 --> 38:37.760
a head and a tail interconvert sort of abruptly

38:37.760 --> 38:40.120
in one big jump, it's either heads or it's tails.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.000
In a quantum system, you could have a situation

38:43.000 --> 38:45.040
where you've got your hand down on the coin

38:45.040 --> 38:48.800
and it can gradually, as you hold it down,

38:48.800 --> 38:50.360
interconvert from the heads or tails

38:50.360 --> 38:52.320
without having to pick it up and flip it over.

38:52.320 --> 38:56.240
Okay, so the point is that these axioms about information

38:56.240 --> 38:59.360
can by themselves lead to quantum behavior

38:59.360 --> 39:00.240
that we're familiar with,

39:00.240 --> 39:02.360
like superpositions and entanglement.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.320
And some researchers think that these efforts,

39:05.320 --> 39:07.040
quantum reconstruction,

39:07.040 --> 39:09.560
might lead to a completely different perspective

39:09.560 --> 39:13.540
on quantum theory, one in which the physical meaning

39:13.540 --> 39:16.300
of all the seemingly strange behaviors

39:16.300 --> 39:18.260
at last becomes clear.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.980
Now, it remains to be seen whether that will happen,

39:20.980 --> 39:23.620
but I think it's already illuminating

39:23.620 --> 39:26.100
that they all focus on information,

39:26.100 --> 39:29.260
on how answers or measurement outcomes

39:29.260 --> 39:34.020
are contingent on the questions we ask and how we ask them.

39:34.020 --> 39:36.260
And I think this is the most productive way to think

39:36.260 --> 39:39.380
about what quantum mechanics seems to be telling us.

39:39.380 --> 39:44.140
And it's a perspective that I think is illustrated

39:44.140 --> 39:47.100
really nicely by a metaphor

39:47.100 --> 39:49.580
that the American physicist John Wheeler,

39:49.580 --> 39:52.260
who studied under Bohr and who had Feynman

39:52.260 --> 39:54.260
as one of his students, incidentally,

39:54.260 --> 39:57.860
he suggests that maybe we should think about quantum mechanics

39:57.860 --> 40:00.260
as like this.

40:00.260 --> 40:04.060
Let's think of it as being a bit like the game of 20 questions.

40:04.060 --> 40:05.540
So I'm sure you know this game.

40:05.540 --> 40:08.820
So it's the one where one player leaves the room

40:08.820 --> 40:12.900
and everyone else in the room agrees on a certain person,

40:12.900 --> 40:14.900
a historical figure, a well-known person.

40:14.900 --> 40:18.460
And then the person outside has to come back in

40:18.460 --> 40:23.540
and they start to ask each person in turn a question

40:23.540 --> 40:26.100
to try to find out who it is that they've chosen.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.540
And they have to be questions

40:27.540 --> 40:30.820
that can only be answered yes or no.

40:30.820 --> 40:34.100
So you see, they're really quantum questions.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.580
Now, imagine you're the questioner here.

40:36.580 --> 40:38.580
So you come back in, you start to ask questions

40:38.580 --> 40:40.180
and you get your answers.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.260
You start off, is the person male?

40:42.260 --> 40:44.500
And the first person says, yes.

40:44.500 --> 40:48.260
And then you go to the second person, is he alive?

40:48.260 --> 40:51.300
No. OK. And you carry on.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.380
But you start to find an odd thing

40:54.380 --> 40:57.420
that as you go on asking more and more people,

40:57.420 --> 41:00.580
it takes them longer and longer to answer your question.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.900
You know, they're having to think about it.

41:02.900 --> 41:06.060
Well, that's odd because if they've agreed on a person,

41:06.060 --> 41:07.860
it's either the answer is either yes or no.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.180
What is there to think about?

41:09.180 --> 41:11.100
Anyway, you carry on playing this game

41:11.100 --> 41:14.060
and eventually you think you're zeroing in on who it is.

41:14.060 --> 41:16.180
And finally you think, I've got it.

41:16.180 --> 41:18.260
And you say, it's Richard Feynman.

41:18.260 --> 41:20.420
And everyone laughs and tells you that you're right.

41:20.420 --> 41:22.260
It's Richard Feynman.

41:22.260 --> 41:24.540
And then you say, well, what was going on?

41:24.540 --> 41:27.540
Why were you taking so long to think about the answer?

41:27.540 --> 41:30.860
And they explain how they decided to play this.

41:30.860 --> 41:34.500
So instead of deciding on a particular person

41:34.500 --> 41:35.860
when you were out of the room,

41:35.900 --> 41:40.300
what they decided to do was to say that the answer

41:40.300 --> 41:43.420
that anyone gave to the question you asked

41:43.420 --> 41:46.220
had to be consistent with all of the answers

41:46.220 --> 41:47.700
that had been given before.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.300
They didn't decide on anyone,

41:50.300 --> 41:54.180
but the answer that they gave had to correspond

41:54.180 --> 41:56.220
to all the answers that have been given so far,

41:56.220 --> 42:00.420
had to correspond to a famous person of some sort or another.

42:00.420 --> 42:02.580
And so of course, you know, as the answers went on,

42:02.580 --> 42:04.060
it became harder and harder to think,

42:04.060 --> 42:05.420
well, who does that apply to then?

42:05.460 --> 42:07.340
The male, they're dead and so on.

42:07.340 --> 42:09.620
They're a physicist and so on.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.420
You have to think harder and harder.

42:11.420 --> 42:16.420
And what happens is that as the questions are asked,

42:16.860 --> 42:20.460
the possible answers get narrowed down.

42:20.460 --> 42:22.940
And in the end, there's only one person it can be.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.620
It has to be Richard Feynman.

42:24.620 --> 42:27.380
But everyone was forced by the nature

42:27.380 --> 42:30.180
of the questions themselves to converge

42:30.180 --> 42:32.260
on that same person.

42:32.260 --> 42:34.260
If you had asked different questions,

42:34.300 --> 42:36.660
you'd have ended up with a different person,

42:36.660 --> 42:38.300
a different answer.

42:38.300 --> 42:41.700
So the answer you got depended on the context.

42:41.700 --> 42:44.460
There never was a preordained answer.

42:44.460 --> 42:47.260
You brought that answer into being

42:47.260 --> 42:49.180
in a way that is fully consistent

42:49.180 --> 42:50.900
with the questions you asked.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.460
And what's more, the very notion of an answer at all

42:53.460 --> 42:56.500
only makes sense when you play the game.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.020
You know, if you'd come back in and said,

42:58.020 --> 42:59.620
oh, I can't be bothered to go through this,

42:59.620 --> 43:01.220
just tell me who you chose.

43:01.220 --> 43:03.340
There would be no answer to that question.

43:03.340 --> 43:08.020
You have to do the inquiring before an answer

43:08.020 --> 43:09.740
will be forthcoming.

43:09.740 --> 43:12.140
So quantum mechanics is like this.

43:12.140 --> 43:15.980
It seems to be a theory of what is and isn't knowable

43:15.980 --> 43:18.980
and how those knowns are related.

43:18.980 --> 43:21.620
And I like to think of this in terms of a distinction

43:21.620 --> 43:26.100
between a theory of is-ness and a theory of if-ness.

43:27.020 --> 43:30.180
Quantum mechanics doesn't tell us how a thing is

43:30.180 --> 43:32.140
or how a quantum thing is.

43:32.140 --> 43:36.540
It tells us what and with what calculable probability

43:36.540 --> 43:40.900
it could be, along with a logic of the relationships

43:40.900 --> 43:42.660
between the various coulds.

43:42.660 --> 43:44.900
If this, then that.

43:44.900 --> 43:47.340
And what this means is that to truly describe

43:47.340 --> 43:48.780
the features of quantum mechanics

43:48.780 --> 43:50.500
as far as we currently can,

43:50.500 --> 43:54.580
we should replace all the conventional isms with ifms.

43:54.580 --> 43:58.140
So for example, we shouldn't say here it is a particle,

43:58.140 --> 43:59.380
there it is a wave.

43:59.380 --> 44:02.620
We should say, if we measure things like this,

44:02.620 --> 44:04.260
the quantum object behaves in a manner

44:04.260 --> 44:05.620
that we associate with particles.

44:05.620 --> 44:07.620
But if we measure it like that,

44:07.620 --> 44:09.780
it behaves as if it's a wave.

44:09.780 --> 44:13.260
We shouldn't say the particle is in two states at once.

44:13.260 --> 44:15.540
We should say, if we measure it,

44:15.540 --> 44:18.260
we will detect this state with probability x

44:18.260 --> 44:20.660
and that state with probability y.

44:21.940 --> 44:23.860
This if-ness is perplexing

44:23.860 --> 44:25.940
because it's not what we've come to associate with science.

44:25.940 --> 44:28.860
We used to tell it to the science telling us how things are.

44:28.860 --> 44:30.620
And if there are ifs at all,

44:30.620 --> 44:33.620
it's because we're partially ignorant about that.

44:33.620 --> 44:34.860
But in quantum mechanics,

44:34.860 --> 44:36.260
as far as we can tell at the moment,

44:36.260 --> 44:39.220
the ifs seem to be fundamental.

44:39.220 --> 44:40.420
Well, okay, you might say,

44:40.420 --> 44:44.740
but what's the stuff that this if-ness is referring to?

44:44.740 --> 44:47.860
Quantum mechanics doesn't obviously tell us much about that.

44:47.860 --> 44:50.740
And all we have right now are hints and guesses.

44:50.740 --> 44:53.100
And to try to bring them into sharper focus

44:53.100 --> 44:54.260
is a tricky business.

44:54.260 --> 44:57.980
It seems to demand an almost poetic level of expression,

44:58.020 --> 45:01.180
which will send some physicists scurrying for cover.

45:01.180 --> 45:04.140
So here, for example, is an attempt to do that,

45:04.140 --> 45:07.020
that the physicist Chris Fuchs suggested.

45:07.020 --> 45:10.060
He said, maybe quantum mechanics is telling us

45:10.060 --> 45:12.820
that the world is sensitive to our touch.

45:12.820 --> 45:15.780
It has a kind of zing that makes it fly off

45:15.780 --> 45:18.580
in ways that were not imaginable classically.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.700
The whole structure of quantum mechanics

45:20.700 --> 45:23.340
may be nothing more than the optimal method

45:23.340 --> 45:26.340
of reasoning and processing information

45:26.340 --> 45:31.020
in the light of such a fundamental, wonderful sensitivity.

45:31.020 --> 45:34.220
And what Fuchs means here is not the mundane truism

45:34.220 --> 45:36.340
that the human observer disturbs the world.

45:36.340 --> 45:38.220
That's true in classical physics.

45:38.220 --> 45:41.180
Rather, quantum mechanics may be the machinery

45:41.180 --> 45:42.980
that we humans need,

45:42.980 --> 45:45.580
we humans pitched at a scale midway

45:45.580 --> 45:48.620
between the subatomic and the galactic

45:48.620 --> 45:53.620
to try to compile and quantify information about a world

45:53.860 --> 45:56.700
that has this incredibly sensitive character.

45:56.700 --> 45:58.620
It embodies what we've learnt

45:58.620 --> 46:01.820
about how to navigate in such a world.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.220
And I think it's vital at any rate

46:04.220 --> 46:07.260
that we understand that this if-ness

46:07.260 --> 46:11.660
doesn't imply that the world, our world, our home,

46:11.660 --> 46:14.260
is holding anything back from us.

46:14.260 --> 46:15.900
It's just that classical physics

46:15.900 --> 46:18.420
has primed us to expect too much from it.

46:18.420 --> 46:21.620
We've become accustomed to asking questions

46:21.620 --> 46:23.700
and getting definite answers.

46:23.700 --> 46:24.940
What colour is it?

46:24.940 --> 46:27.940
How heavy is it? How fast is it moving?

46:27.940 --> 46:31.580
Forgetting the almost ludicrous amount about

46:31.580 --> 46:35.060
that we don't know about everyday objects,

46:35.060 --> 46:37.860
we figured that we could go on forever,

46:37.860 --> 46:42.620
asking questions and being answered at ever finer scales.

46:42.620 --> 46:45.020
When we discovered that we can't,

46:45.020 --> 46:49.940
we felt shortchanged by nature and we pronounced it weird.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.060
I don't think that will do anymore.

46:52.060 --> 46:56.380
Nature does its best and we need to adjust our expectations.

46:56.380 --> 46:58.900
So we need to go beyond weird.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.780
Thanks very much.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.540
Thank you, Phillip.

47:04.540 --> 47:07.260
Thank you, Phillip, for the wonderful talk

47:07.260 --> 47:11.340
and I can relay to you a few comments

47:11.340 --> 47:13.100
before I get to questions from the audience

47:13.100 --> 47:14.260
and folks in the audience.

47:14.260 --> 47:17.740
Please feel free to post questions again in the chat.

47:17.740 --> 47:19.180
The chat is very active right now,

47:19.180 --> 47:23.220
so I'll try to pull them out of the stream here.

47:24.940 --> 47:28.180
We have, by the way, a few folks I would just like

47:28.180 --> 47:30.540
to relay to you since you can't see the chat yourself,

47:30.540 --> 47:32.180
you know, said this is, you know, nice stuff,

47:32.180 --> 47:33.420
enlightening and mesmerizing,

47:33.420 --> 47:36.820
so I thought I should relay that.

47:36.820 --> 47:40.580
We had quite a few discussions and questions,

47:40.580 --> 47:45.020
I think, that spawned off of the discussion as to,

47:45.020 --> 47:47.820
let's see, hopefully you can see me now, there we go,

47:48.260 --> 47:52.780
as to why is quantum weird

47:52.780 --> 47:55.140
in the sense of deterministic?

47:55.140 --> 47:56.660
Is it, you know, is it because we're used

47:56.660 --> 47:57.860
to deterministic theories?

47:57.860 --> 48:00.220
And I think you touched on this throughout the talk

48:00.220 --> 48:02.820
and this is one of the essential points.

48:02.820 --> 48:05.980
But maybe if we kind of come back to that,

48:05.980 --> 48:09.460
there was the locality that deterministic

48:09.460 --> 48:12.020
versus maybe non-causal potential,

48:13.700 --> 48:16.540
maybe if we could sort of get your thoughts again

48:16.540 --> 48:21.460
in a bit of a summary here of the discussion

48:21.460 --> 48:23.020
that is going on in the chat.

48:24.140 --> 48:27.020
Yeah, okay, well, I mean, certainly, you know,

48:27.020 --> 48:30.660
it seems to me that as far as we can say at the moment,

48:31.580 --> 48:33.460
quantum mechanics isn't deterministic.

48:33.460 --> 48:36.180
There are ways of interpreting quantum theory

48:36.180 --> 48:41.180
that are deterministic, that in fact do return us

48:41.380 --> 48:44.860
to some sort of picture of there being real particles

48:44.900 --> 48:47.580
that have real properties and real places out there.

48:47.580 --> 48:52.060
There are interpretations that suggest that.

48:52.060 --> 48:54.300
And if you like all the quantumness

48:54.300 --> 48:57.380
or what we've conventionally called the weirdness

48:57.380 --> 49:01.140
is kind of put onto another aspect of the theory,

49:01.140 --> 49:03.380
but we recover the particles.

49:03.380 --> 49:08.380
So that's possible, but it's, you know, it's unproven

49:08.620 --> 49:11.740
and it's just one interpretation.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.300
And at the moment, it seems to me it's safe us to say

49:15.300 --> 49:18.500
that, you know, that there does seem to be

49:18.500 --> 49:21.820
this fundamental indeterminacy in quantum mechanics

49:21.820 --> 49:24.620
so that if we make a measurement on a system,

49:24.620 --> 49:28.500
all we can meaningfully say is what the probabilities

49:28.500 --> 49:29.820
of the outcomes will be.

49:29.820 --> 49:33.780
We could, that perhaps we can never say more than that.

49:33.780 --> 49:37.760
So we can ever exactly predict what we're going to find.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.120
That's very interesting.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.760
And I think, folks, I'm sorry,

49:44.760 --> 49:46.360
we were going to have to leave the videos off,

49:46.360 --> 49:48.240
but hopefully you can still hear us just fine.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.360
We're having some bandwidth issues today.

49:51.560 --> 49:55.600
Yes, so, interesting.

49:55.600 --> 49:58.240
And maybe a follow up question from the audience here.

49:58.240 --> 50:01.960
In the classical world, you know, are we perhaps too used

50:01.960 --> 50:04.160
to trying to write down deterministic laws?

50:04.160 --> 50:07.400
Could the classical world be modeled under any probability

50:07.400 --> 50:09.120
or a probabilistic theory, perhaps,

50:09.120 --> 50:11.280
to rephrase the question here?

50:11.280 --> 50:13.320
And should that really be the comparison

50:13.320 --> 50:16.840
between the quantum world and the classical?

50:19.240 --> 50:22.560
Well, I'm certainly not an expert on this,

50:22.560 --> 50:26.600
but what I can say in response to that is that

50:26.600 --> 50:29.240
these efforts at quantum reconstruction

50:29.240 --> 50:32.920
that I talked about, one way of looking at that

50:32.920 --> 50:37.840
is that really, quantum mechanics is simply

50:37.840 --> 50:40.120
a kind of probability theory.

50:40.120 --> 50:43.040
It's just a different sort of probability.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.000
You know, probabilities work a bit differently

50:45.000 --> 50:47.680
from how we used to them in the classical world.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.400
And that, you know, one way of looking at it is that,

50:53.040 --> 50:57.960
is that, you know, we should be thinking probabilistically,

50:57.960 --> 50:59.800
you know, more generally.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.400
And, you know, there are a whole set

51:01.400 --> 51:04.520
of possible probabilistic theories

51:04.520 --> 51:05.920
or theories of probability,

51:05.920 --> 51:10.520
and one of them corresponds to quantum type rules.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.520
So, you know, here again, we sort of come back

51:15.520 --> 51:20.520
to quantum mechanics being a theory about noability

51:21.120 --> 51:24.120
and how much the world is really knowable.

51:24.120 --> 51:27.080
I mean, the way that I think about it,

51:27.080 --> 51:32.080
that makes sense to me, is to suggest

51:32.640 --> 51:35.680
that quantum mechanics seems to be telling us

51:35.680 --> 51:40.680
that we are, it's possible for us to ask more questions

51:42.360 --> 51:46.840
that nature can have answers, can have definite answers for.

51:46.840 --> 51:49.680
That seems to me to be really the point.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.720
And that doesn't seem to be such an unreasonable thing

51:52.720 --> 51:53.560
to propose.

51:53.560 --> 51:56.000
Why should every question that we compose

51:56.600 --> 51:59.960
that we could pose necessarily have a definite answer?

51:59.960 --> 52:02.920
Quantum mechanics seems to be saying it doesn't.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.280
And so you have a choice.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.840
If you choose to ask these questions,

52:06.840 --> 52:08.840
you'll get this set of responses.

52:08.840 --> 52:10.840
If you can choose to ask this set of questions,

52:10.840 --> 52:12.040
you'll get a different one.

52:12.040 --> 52:14.200
And they may not be compatible with each other

52:14.200 --> 52:16.040
because you ask different questions.

52:16.040 --> 52:20.080
So it depends on the context of the questions

52:20.080 --> 52:21.120
that you're asking.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.720
I think that's enlightening, yeah.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.840
And maybe that reminds me a bit of this game

52:27.840 --> 52:29.800
you brought up earlier, which was very nice.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.320
And I think you concluded by something along the lines

52:32.320 --> 52:35.120
of you brought that answer into being of,

52:35.120 --> 52:39.760
oh, it's Feynman by asking that particular set of questions.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.280
And I think it was Sash Kurodkov

52:41.280 --> 52:44.200
as a physicist who also says, in quantum mechanics,

52:44.200 --> 52:47.000
you don't see what you get, you get what you see.

52:48.400 --> 52:52.760
And that brings me to maybe your perspective

52:52.760 --> 52:56.440
or thoughts or opinion on no ability, right?

52:56.440 --> 52:59.920
So in these more recent experiments,

52:59.920 --> 53:02.600
the quantum trajectory type of experiments,

53:04.280 --> 53:06.960
those experiments can't always,

53:06.960 --> 53:08.560
they usually can't tell you the future,

53:08.560 --> 53:09.520
they can't predict the future,

53:09.520 --> 53:11.920
but they can always tell you exactly what,

53:11.920 --> 53:14.920
in a way the state is, the quantum description,

53:14.920 --> 53:16.280
the quantum state is doing,

53:17.440 --> 53:21.280
as you are subjecting the system

53:21.280 --> 53:26.280
to an ongoing interrogation, a measurement.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.440
And there seems to be this very close

53:28.440 --> 53:30.360
one-to-one direct correspondence.

53:30.360 --> 53:35.120
In a sense, the randomness only comes

53:35.120 --> 53:37.400
if you now suddenly change your measurement

53:37.400 --> 53:41.560
to something else, but you have a knowledge

53:41.560 --> 53:43.840
about the system that is conditioned

53:43.840 --> 53:46.760
on what you're measuring and you can update that.

53:46.760 --> 53:48.640
And there's always, in the case

53:48.640 --> 53:50.440
that you can do that update perfectly,

53:50.440 --> 53:54.760
which you can get close to these days for some experiments,

53:54.760 --> 53:57.400
there are always not a complete set of questions

53:57.400 --> 53:58.320
you can answer perfectly.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.440
Like you said, there are always more questions in quantum

54:00.440 --> 54:03.000
than perhaps you can always get a deterministic answer for.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.520
But there is a subset of those questions

54:04.520 --> 54:07.640
that you can always know that if you ask the question,

54:07.640 --> 54:10.720
is the qubit along the x direction?

54:10.720 --> 54:12.320
Let's say you always get a perfect one,

54:12.320 --> 54:14.840
even though you've been injecting randomness

54:14.840 --> 54:17.620
into the system throughout with your measurement.

54:18.060 --> 54:21.260
Maybe that was a bit long of a question,

54:21.260 --> 54:24.180
so I apologize for that, Phil.

54:24.180 --> 54:26.780
But perhaps if we can get your thoughts on QTT

54:26.780 --> 54:28.580
and a bit of that, that would be great.

54:30.260 --> 54:32.540
Well, I mean, of course, Lako,

54:32.540 --> 54:36.300
you're the one who knows about this rather than me.

54:36.300 --> 54:39.740
I was absolutely fascinated by those experiments

54:40.660 --> 54:44.540
for various reasons, but I think that perhaps

54:45.100 --> 54:48.940
the main one was that it seemed to me

54:48.940 --> 54:53.940
that you were really starting to zero in

54:54.140 --> 54:58.140
on what is happening when we make a measurement.

54:58.140 --> 55:01.540
And in particular, to dispel this idea

55:01.540 --> 55:04.700
that measurement is this mysterious black box

55:04.700 --> 55:08.580
that suddenly turns all the quantum vagueness

55:08.580 --> 55:10.220
into something concrete.

55:11.860 --> 55:13.740
What really excited me about them

55:13.740 --> 55:17.060
was that you can see that process happening

55:17.900 --> 55:19.980
and that there are laws to it.

55:21.660 --> 55:24.420
That it's not just magical and unpredictable

55:24.420 --> 55:27.500
and everything else, that as you say,

55:27.500 --> 55:31.220
if you are able to follow it with sufficient time resolution

55:31.220 --> 55:32.620
in sufficient detail,

55:32.620 --> 55:35.940
knowing almost everything about what is happening

55:35.940 --> 55:38.220
in the system, then you can see something

55:38.220 --> 55:40.340
that does look like a trajectory

55:40.340 --> 55:44.460
that is taking the system from one state to another.

55:45.620 --> 55:50.620
And this is why, I mean, it certainly convinced me

55:51.460 --> 55:54.540
that this notion of wave function collapse

55:54.540 --> 55:58.020
as a mysterious thing that suddenly snaps

55:58.020 --> 56:02.020
a wave into a particle, that we really,

56:02.020 --> 56:04.380
it's never really been needed in quantum mechanics.

56:04.380 --> 56:06.140
I understand why it got there,

56:06.140 --> 56:08.140
but it's time to get it back out again

56:08.140 --> 56:10.460
because we don't need it.

56:10.460 --> 56:15.460
And it seems to me that that is getting much closer

56:15.660 --> 56:18.060
to having a proper understanding

56:18.060 --> 56:21.580
of what it is that happens when we make a measurement.

56:21.580 --> 56:24.220
Perhaps the one thing, and I'd be interested

56:24.220 --> 56:25.940
in whether you have thoughts about this,

56:25.940 --> 56:30.940
because the one thing that it doesn't seem to explain,

56:34.660 --> 56:37.060
and this is really the sort of fundamental mystery

56:37.180 --> 56:40.460
of quantum mechanics, why do you only ever get one thing?

56:40.460 --> 56:42.140
And of course, there are some interpretations

56:42.140 --> 56:43.060
that say, well, you don't,

56:43.060 --> 56:45.380
you just get both in different universes.

56:45.380 --> 56:50.380
But as far as we can ever see, quantum measurements are unique.

56:51.620 --> 56:54.420
So where does that uniqueness come from,

56:54.420 --> 56:57.020
given that we know in principle,

56:57.020 --> 56:59.100
more than one outcome is possible?

57:00.260 --> 57:01.620
That's a really deep question.

57:01.620 --> 57:05.100
I think, in fact, I got asked a similar question

57:05.100 --> 57:10.100
at my dissertation defense in the private dissertation part

57:10.980 --> 57:13.420
where they take you aside to a room and quiz you

57:13.420 --> 57:17.940
for until you come to a point of, anyway.

57:17.940 --> 57:20.300
So I don't know that I have a great answer,

57:20.300 --> 57:22.820
but maybe a few thoughts that are probably something

57:22.820 --> 57:24.260
you've written about quite a bit,

57:24.260 --> 57:26.580
as well as this notion you brought up earlier,

57:26.580 --> 57:29.820
and I think you said Bell maybe had introduced it,

57:29.820 --> 57:34.820
or of two different disconnected worlds,

57:34.980 --> 57:38.220
the world of the quantum and the world of the classical.

57:38.220 --> 57:41.300
And there's this notion of Heisenberg's cut,

57:41.300 --> 57:43.260
the boundary between these two.

57:44.500 --> 57:48.780
And there's no prescription in any textbook

57:48.780 --> 57:50.900
or in any paper that I know of that you can find

57:50.900 --> 57:55.900
that really pins down where does this difference occur

57:56.580 --> 57:59.140
between what you call a measurement apparatus

57:59.140 --> 58:04.140
and where you get classical results out of the system?

58:04.420 --> 58:06.100
And what is the quantum system?

58:06.100 --> 58:07.940
So for example, coming back to this,

58:07.940 --> 58:11.700
to the quantum jumps nature paper you brought up earlier,

58:12.580 --> 58:15.180
you could model, you could take that Heisenberg cut

58:15.180 --> 58:18.100
at different stages of the experiment

58:18.100 --> 58:19.660
and pretend like, for instance,

58:19.660 --> 58:21.260
just the qubit itself is quantum,

58:21.260 --> 58:23.140
and it's being subjected to a particular

58:23.140 --> 58:24.820
classical measurement apparatus

58:24.820 --> 58:27.900
that has this particular type of question

58:27.900 --> 58:29.660
it's interrogating the system with,

58:29.660 --> 58:32.260
kind of like the game that you mentioned earlier.

58:33.260 --> 58:36.380
But it turns out that in what we had to do

58:36.380 --> 58:39.740
for the experiment is we moved the cut one step further,

58:39.740 --> 58:42.620
that apparatus was a particular type

58:42.620 --> 58:44.860
of superconducting cavity.

58:44.860 --> 58:49.020
And we model all of the quantum behavior of it as well.

58:49.020 --> 58:54.020
Now that particular cavity is then followed

58:54.180 --> 58:55.980
by another quantum amplifier.

58:55.980 --> 58:58.780
And we could actually include the quantum amplifier itself

58:58.780 --> 59:01.260
and also make this very large now quantum system.

59:01.500 --> 59:03.300
You have three different quantum systems

59:03.300 --> 59:05.140
that are all coupled together.

59:05.140 --> 59:07.180
And you have this kind of matroshka doll

59:07.180 --> 59:10.620
of nested larger systems that are increasingly

59:10.620 --> 59:12.860
becoming more classical in a sense,

59:12.860 --> 59:14.940
because at each stage you're amplifying

59:14.940 --> 59:18.820
and in a sense the signal there's more quantum excitation

59:18.820 --> 59:20.160
that are getting involved.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.420
And perhaps with that, once you have,

59:22.420 --> 59:27.420
like you said, the grain of dust that's floating in the air,

59:27.580 --> 59:30.260
when you have so many quanta, so many excitations,

59:30.260 --> 59:33.100
then you tend to couple more strongly

59:33.100 --> 59:38.100
to this, well, decoherence, right?

59:38.700 --> 59:41.260
Whatever that is precisely in itself.

59:41.260 --> 59:45.780
And you tend to move already in the limit of where

59:45.780 --> 59:49.700
a lot of the quantum nature tends to seem to get erased

59:49.700 --> 59:51.180
or washed out in a sense.

59:52.340 --> 59:54.460
At that stage though, it's still purely quantum system.

59:54.460 --> 59:57.100
You could reverse and undo the measurement

59:57.100 --> 59:59.380
in the sense of taking that information

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380
because you're keeping track of it

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.020
and sort of feed it back into the system.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.140
You still have all those degrees of freedom.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.220
And then after that following amplifier

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.740
that comes after the cavity,

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.740
then we kind of don't know where to draw that Heisenberg cut.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.980
In terms of the empirical experimental world,

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.620
that's roughly as far as our models are able to get us.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.940
After that, we don't really have an equation or model

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.980
we could write down that we're currently able to say,

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.940
oh, now it's quantum.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.940
So empirically we see that, okay, it occurs somewhere there,

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.020
is that a limitation of our ability to express it or not?

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.020
So-

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.020
Is this, I mean, it sounds to me as though

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.340
this is again really about information,

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.060
but in this notion of a cut,

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.220
it sounds as though what that really means

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.140
is where do you decide the point comes

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.020
where you're not going to any longer

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.580
or you can't any longer,

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.740
gather pretty much comprehensive information

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.740
about everything in the system.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.860
And once you relinquish that attempt,

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.180
that's where the cut happens

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.940
because you have imperfect information.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.860
Is that the right way to look at it?

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.060
I think that is definitely a practical way

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.540
to look at it that seems to work in practice.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.700
Is it the ultimate solution?

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.860
I couldn't say.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.740
And sorry, I'm gonna go on.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.620
No, no, no, that's fine.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.220
That's just what occurred to me

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.980
as you were describing the experiment.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.340
It seemed to be a matter of,

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:35.700
well, how far out can you keep going in your apparatus

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:39.500
and still retain the ability to monitor

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.820
more or less everything that is happening

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.140
at the sort of quantum level?

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:45.980
Exactly.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.220
And we've been able to now push that further and further out

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.860
and see that as you kind of climb up

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.420
the matresca dollar, the chain of nestedness here,

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:00.220
that you can move that Heisenberg cut quite far out

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.900
and still model things.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.980
But at the end of the day,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.620
we've simply moved the cut further away,

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.540
but we still have the cut.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.300
So is it a fundamental cut or not?

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.380
I think that's an open question as far as it could tell.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.540
But another way that people think about,

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.620
and I think we'd mentioned this,

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.020
is that you could say that to the contrary,

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:27.020
I think of what Bell had said.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.660
John Bell, I think you said had band measurement

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.780
is a bad word.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.820
I think to more experimentally-minded people like myself,

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.020
measurement is actually probably the essence

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:36.860
of the whole theory.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.820
It's what we do, it's what we model,

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.580
it's what we describe.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.980
That should actually be the core of it.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.140
So perhaps we should start,

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.460
not with Schrodinger's equation,

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.100
which describes what the state of the system

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.580
if that even exists in of itself out there is,

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.140
but maybe we should start with a description

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:52.980
of the measurement.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.780
So I could say closer along the lines of Q2T.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.500
You could take that interaction between

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.780
what you call a system and the actual measurement,

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.100
because the problem is that in Schrodinger's equation,

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.780
a measurement is completely absent.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.580
So Schrodinger's equation is linear, deterministic.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:13.260
There's nothing really weird in Schrodinger's equation,

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.620
in a sense, the randomness,

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:18.180
if you want the weirdness of the quantum randomness

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.060
that comes into play,

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.580
only occurs at the stage of the actual measurement

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.500
when you have von Neumann's postulate and so on.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.180
So it's that process that I think you so nicely pointed out

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.420
is what, now the field of physics is being able

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.180
to kind of open the hood on and describe.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.420
But I think we've maybe said a lot on this.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.460
Perhaps if you'd like to share this question

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.100
from the audience here on,

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.460
and you'd let me know if you'd like to take this one,

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.340
if you could, could you share your thoughts

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.900
on Maxwell's demon and perhaps how that relates

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:58.900
to all of quantum mechanics in the sense that you have,

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.900
I'm kind of reading into the question here,

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:10.460
when it comes to know ability and trying to kind of sift

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:15.460
or parse and sort of beat the laws of thermodynamics

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.780
in a way, but now at the level of quantum.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.820
So perhaps if you'd like to offer some thoughts on that.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.900
Yeah, yeah, well, very timely.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.020
I've just been writing about Maxwell's demon today

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.460
and have done previously.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:33.460
And everything that is discussed within the context

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.980
of Maxwell's demon is classical,

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.340
although there is a quantum Maxwell's demon as well,

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.700
there is a quantum version.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.100
But, you know, classically, again,

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.460
it illustrates how so much seems to come down

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.460
to information, the quest of information.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.460
So, and in essence, what Maxwell's demon tells us

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.180
is that information itself is a kind of resource

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.620
that we can use to do stuff with,

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:08.020
which I just find extraordinary.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.820
I mean, it may be that not everyone knows

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.420
what Maxwell's demon is, so that, you know,

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.140
very, very briefly, it's a way,

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.460
it was a way that James Clark Maxwell in 1867

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.220
suggested of subverting the second law of thermodynamics.

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:25.180
The second law says, you can express it in many ways.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.500
I mean, the simplest is just that heat always flows

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.000
from hot to cold and never the other way around.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But what it also implies is that there's no,

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.200
you can never get energy for free.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.320
You can't, there's no perpetual motion.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.120
That any system that does work,

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.920
it's always, some energy is always going to be wasted

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.600
and lost as sort of random motions to the system

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.320
as entropy, in fact.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.840
So the entropy of the universe always increases.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.080
And Maxwell didn't like this partly for religious reasons.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.640
And so he came up with this idea of a little demon

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.560
that could actually reverse this

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.280
by having a trapdoor between two compartments

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.880
with gas in them, both with gas in them.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.200
Gas starts at the same temperature in both.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.480
But the hotter molecules are the ones

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.160
that are moving faster in the gas.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.920
So the molecule, the demon looks at the molecules

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.720
and sees if a fast molecule is approaching

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.480
from one direction, he opens a trapdoor and lets it through.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.680
If a cold molecule is approaching

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.200
from the other direction, he opens it and lets it through.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.760
And so all the hot ones go one way

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.960
or the cold ones go the other.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.320
And he ends up with hot gas on one side,

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.880
cold gas on the other, which is basically then

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.560
there's a thermal gradient that you can tap

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.880
in as some sort of power source to do some useful work.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.320
So you've got energy essentially from nothing,

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.040
from just an ordinary gas.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.400
So for a long time, people figured,

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.720
there must be something wrong with this.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.240
How can it subvert the second law?

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.800
And it turns out that the answer is it can't

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.040
because of information.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.000
And in this case, it's the information

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.640
that is recorded in the demon's mind,

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.000
that every, you know, it has to be gathering information

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.920
about those gas particles in order to do what it does.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.840
And eventually that information, its mind is finite

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.560
and it has to erase that information.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.080
Otherwise it's just too full and it can't do anymore.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.720
And erasing that information costs energy.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.080
And in effect, you get back all the energy

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.120
that you thought you'd got from the operation of a demon.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.960
So there's, you know, you still don't get anything for free,

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.880
any energy for free.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.280
So this is about information.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.680
And people have realized that actually what this means

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.880
is that what looks to be sort of randomness,

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.000
statistical randomness, you know, at one level,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.160
if you can zero in and get detailed information

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.720
about what is going on, then you can use that information

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.480
to mine the sort of random fluctuations in there

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.440
and get energy out.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.560
And there have been experiments recently

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.440
that have shown this, that have actually shown

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.640
that you can do work on an object.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640
In this case, it was sort of raising up

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:13.520
a tiny little particle that was sort of floating about

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.680
in a liquid, if I remember rightly,

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.520
by making observations on it,

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.640
gathering information about its movements

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.900
and using that in some clever way,

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.100
you can actually do work and raise it up against gravity.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.140
So information becomes a resource.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:32.140
So, you know, again, there's this fundamental idea

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.580
and then the quantum version of it,

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.100
which I won't go into, you know,

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.620
is just sort of enacting that same idea

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.620
in terms of quantum information.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.020
So it's really interesting how, you know, yet again,

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.820
so many ideas, fundamental ideas in physics,

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.460
but we also see it happening, of course, in biology,

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.820
are coming down to this question of what information is,

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:58.060
how it is embodied, how it can be used and manipulated,

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.220
and how it can become a resource that we can exploit.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.980
Thank you, Phil.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.300
That's wonderful.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.140
I see that we are, we have a few more questions.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.660
I won't be able to get to all of them

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.140
since I see we're about 15 minutes over,

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.420
but perhaps let's take one more final question

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.380
from Pranav here.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:22.940
If, of course, Phil, you would be happy to share with us

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.900
on, you know, how did you decide to go into physics?

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.340
And then if you could tell us a little bit about your transition

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:32.860
into becoming a science writer and editor,

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.660
I think it seems like there's interest from the audience

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.980
if you'd like to share with us.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.540
Well, talk about random walks.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.140
I mean, this was certainly one of them

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.100
because I began my first degree was in chemistry

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.180
and it was at Oxford where the final year

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.980
you have to do a research year, which was fantastic.

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.220
It was by far my favorite part of the course.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.860
And I did it on, in physical chemistry,

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:01.380
on the, actually the quantum mechanical behavior

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.460
of molecules absorbed on surfaces,

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.340
which is right at the sort of borderline, really,

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.300
of physics and chemistry.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.340
And so when I came to do a PhD,

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.020
I just so happened that I ended up in a physics department

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.380
looking at similar stuff, condensed matter

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:19.380
and behavior of objects and fluids at surfaces.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.300
And so that brought me into physics,

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.260
but I figured at the end of that,

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.180
this was going back a long way, I can tell you,

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:31.020
that unlike most people, I'd actually enjoyed writing up

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.180
my thesis and I enjoyed writing the papers

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.900
that came out of this, out of the PhD.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.460
And so I thought, well, you know,

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.500
I'd never thought about this before.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.780
I'd always enjoyed writing,

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.420
but I'd never thought about combining my enjoyment

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.340
of writing with science, but you can.

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.700
And I decided I'd see if I could do that in science editing.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.380
And I was very lucky that just at the right moment,

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.060
a place came up at nature, which in those days,

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:57.660
this was the late 1980s, was just a journal.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.860
It wasn't this big publishing empire.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.820
It was just a single journal in a little office,

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.540
a crammed office, you know, piled with paper.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.180
And I got a job there as an editor of physical sciences

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.780
and had stayed there for a long time.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:11.540
It was a fantastic place to work.

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.580
It meant I got exposed to all areas of science.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.740
It was a very, very steep learning curve.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.980
And it also opened up other opportunities

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.420
to do writing for newspapers and so on.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.060
And eventually I decided, maybe I'll write a book.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:24.900
And I did.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.380
And it was an awful experience in the sense

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.260
that I was working full-time at nature,

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.620
which was already, you know, working,

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620
it was already an intense job.

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.380
So I figured I don't want to do that again,

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.380
but I want to write more.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.740
And I gradually became more and more part-time at nature

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.060
until I finally stepped down.

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.020
I forget when it was,

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.740
but it was probably about 20 years ago now.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.940
I stepped away from nature

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.260
and I'd still write for them regularly as a freelancer,

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.980
but I became completely freelance.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:54.140
And now I split my time writing,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.020
I guess pretty much 50-50 between writing books,

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.740
generally on scientific subjects,

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:03.580
often about how science interacts with the wider culture

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.900
and writing scientific journalism.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.780
Thank you, Phil.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.020
That's an inspiring story.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:17.220
I think with that, I'll take maybe any final words

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.140
you'd like to share with us

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:22.420
before we thank the audience and yourself

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.820
for joining us here today.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.020
Well, well, just to thank you again,

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:32.300
Zlacko, for inviting me to give this talk.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.620
It was a great fun.

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:37.180
It's always been a lot of fun having any interactions

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.940
with IBM generally

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:43.940
and with the IBM quantum computing efforts in particular.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.980
So it's very nice to be able to sustain that relationship.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:53.980
And I'm always fascinated to see where quantum computing

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.740
and IBM and quantum technologies at IBM

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.220
have advanced to next.

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.460
So keep me in the loop about that.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.300
Wonderful.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.620
And I think we all look forward to

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.340
rereading many more books and articles from you, Phil.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.220
This was an absolute delight.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.780
Thank you everyone for tuning in today.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.740
I still see we have over 130 folks tuned in,

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.020
20 minutes over time.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.900
So I appreciate your time.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.740
Thank you very much.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.700
This talk will stay recorded and live

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.900
on the Kisken YouTube channel.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.700
So feel free to subscribe to hear about future updates.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.900
Thank you, Phil, for taking our invitation.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.100
It has been a real privilege and pleasure

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.980
to have you here today.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.920
And thank you, everyone.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.420
We will see you next Friday at noon Eastern time.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:40.900
Thank you.
