Checking Qiskit/Quantum Mechanics Isn't Weird, We're Just Too Big - Phillip Ball Lecture.txt
Philosopher (Phil) Jones shared his journey from a chemistry background to becoming a science writer and editor, emphasizing the importance of finding a niche where personal interests and skillsets converge. He discussed his experience working as an editor for Nature, which led him to write both scientific journalism and books on scientific topics, particularly those exploring the intersection between science and culture. Jones highlighted that his transition from full-time editing to freelance writing was gradual and voluntary, allowing him to balance his workload and pursue various writing projects. He encouraged maintaining connections with organizations like IBM, which he finds stimulating and insightful, especially in the context of quantum computing advancements. The session concluded with thanks to Phil for his engaging talk and a reminder to the audience that the recording would be available on YouTube for future reference, inviting everyone to subscribe and join for more discussions.

Checking Qiskit/Quantum-probabilistic Generative Models and Variational Quantum Thermalization - Guillaume Verdon.txt
1. **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**: QML is an emerging field that combines quantum computing with machine learning to potentially solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers. It leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process and analyze data in novel ways.

2. **Eigenmodes and Quantum Modular Hamiltonians**: In a system described by a Hamiltonian, the eigenmodes represent the natural vibrational or excitation modes of the system. For a thermal state of such a system, the relevant modes would be the Fourier modes, as they are the eigenmodes of the Hamiltonian.

3. **Research Direction**: To pursue research in quantum machine learning, one should start with a solid foundation in classical machine learning theory, understand the core concepts from the foundational papers of the 80s, and then work their way up to current developments. There are also resources like online courses, summer schools (e.g., KISSKAT), and textbooks available for learning.

4. **Educational Resources**: Some specific educational materials mentioned include open-source massive online courses (MOOCs), Goodfellow's deep learning book, Kevin Murphy's work on probabilistic machine learning, and coursework from universities like Waterloo.

5. **Summer Schools and Community Engagement**: There are summer schools focusing on quantum information and machine learning, such as the Quantum Chemistry School by VQE Inc., which could provide valuable insights into application areas of QML.

6. **Staying Informed and Connected**: Following experts in the field on social media (like @quantumbird on Twitter), attending seminars, and staying engaged with the quantum computing community can help researchers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and network with peers.

7. **Final Notes**: The speaker expressed gratitude for the opportunity to share insights on QML and emphasized the importance of both theoretical understanding and practical applications in advancing the field. The next QML seminar is planned for the following week, featuring a talk by Antonia Cappelli from Idea.

In summary, to engage with quantum machine learning, one should build a foundation in classical machine learning, delve into the principles of quantum mechanics, and stay informed about the latest research through courses, textbooks, and community events. The field is rapidly evolving, and staying engaged with both theoretical and practical aspects will be key to contributing to its advancement.
