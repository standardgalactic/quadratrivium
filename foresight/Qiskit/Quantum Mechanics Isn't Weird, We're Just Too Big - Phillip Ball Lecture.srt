1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
The stage is yours.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,560
Thank you, Zlatko.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,040
Well, in this talk, what I want to do

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,760
is to ask the following question.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,800
What does quantum mechanics mean?

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,160
Well, without further ado,

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
let me just skip to my conclusions.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,320
Nobody knows.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,560
Thanks for coming to my talk, I'll take questions.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,240
Well, okay, actually, I do have a few other things to add.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,200
The first is that if you read a book or an article

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,440
that asks this question

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,760
and it doesn't, at some stage, acknowledge this basic fact

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,880
that we really don't know what quantum mechanics means,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,800
then I advise you to read it

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,680
as you might say a book review.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,280
That's to say, don't imagine that the position it is giving

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,000
is one that will necessarily be either right or wrong.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Judge it instead by whether it seems to offer

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,600
a stimulating and productive way to think about its subject.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,720
I think this at the moment is the best approach we can take

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,960
to trying to answer this question

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,600
of what quantum mechanics means.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,880
Now, you don't need to take my word for it

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,680
that this ignorance about quantum mechanics exists

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,840
because I'm sure that many of you will know

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,440
this popular quote from Richard Feynman,

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
who said, I think I can safely say

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,800
that nobody understands quantum mechanics.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,600
And let me remind you that he actually said this in 1965.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,120
And that was the year that Feynman shared the Nobel Prize

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,360
in physics for his work on quantum mechanics.

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,040
So at that point, there was probably no one alive

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,480
who knew more than Feynman did about quantum mechanics.

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,800
And if this is the conclusion that he reached,

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,400
you might well ask what hope is there for the rest of us.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,760
But I think today there's another way

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,360
to answer the question of what quantum mechanics means.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
You see, one would be justified in giving an answer

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
to that question like this.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,120
This, of course, is IBM's quantum computer.

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,120
And in other words, quantum mechanics must surely tell us

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,680
something about the world because we can now use it.

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,640
We can use its principles to build machines like this one,

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
which in fact Feynman himself first envisaged

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,760
in the early 1980s, in which quantum objects are manipulated

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,200
so as to let us do something real and useful.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,880
If quantum mechanics was not in some sense

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,040
a valid description of the world,

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,520
then quantum computers would not do what they're supposed to do.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,360
But as you'll see, I think that today's quantum information

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
technologies like this, tell us something else

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,840
about the possible answer to the question I started by asking.

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,800
Because what they embody and in fact illustrate

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,240
is an emerging sense among many, perhaps not all,

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,640
but many of the people who ponder the meaning of quantum mechanics

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,320
that it has something to say about the fundamental rules

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,800
of what information is and how it can be encoded,

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,440
moved and transformed in the world.

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,400
Now, quantum mechanics has, of course, a reputation

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,000
among laypeople, in fact, among many scientists,

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
particularly those who don't make use of it,

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,800
for being impossibly hard.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,680
So here's some quantum maths for you,

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,800
but it's not the mathematics that's the problem,

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,840
or at least it wasn't the problem for Feynman.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,680
He could do the maths just fine.

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,720
The problem was that's all he could do.

69
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,120
What he couldn't understand is what the maths meant,

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,880
what it tells us about the nature of the world.

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Now, Feynman himself didn't seem too troubled by that.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,360
He said, you know, we've got a theory that works.

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,000
It gives amazingly accurate predictions

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,800
about how stuff will behave.

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,000
In fact, it's potentially the most accurate theory

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
in science at all.

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
So what more can you want than that,

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,320
an accurate theory that works?

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,840
Well, some scientists feel the same way today,

80
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,000
but usually we do want more because we want to know

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,360
what our scientific theories tell us

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,760
about what the world is like.

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,920
And it wasn't clear to Feynman

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,560
that quantum mechanics lets us do that,

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,840
and it's still not clear today.

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
But I want to suggest to you that we can do better

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,720
than Feynman's admission of bafflement,

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
or defeats, I might say.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
We don't have all the answers to what quantum mechanics means,

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,600
but we do have better questions.

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,640
We have a clearer sense than we did in the 1960s,

92
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,600
or even in the 1980s, of what's important and what is not.

93
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,560
And I want to try to give you a sense

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,520
of what those things might be.

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,760
So let me start with some things

96
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,160
that everyone knows about quantum mechanics.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,440
And when I say everyone, I believe that this audience

98
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,480
is a diverse mixture of experts

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,920
who know much more about quantum mechanics than I do,

100
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
and non-experts, perhaps non-scientists,

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,800
who are nevertheless interested in the subject

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
and everything in between.

103
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,040
So if you didn't know any of these things yourself,

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,720
don't worry, all I mean is that these are notions

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,600
that you'll encounter pretty quickly

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,920
the moment you start looking at what at least

107
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,120
has been popularly written about quantum mechanics.

108
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,760
First of all, we're told that quantum mechanics is weird.

109
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,200
Things don't behave in the quantum world

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,080
in ways that we're familiar with,

111
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
and they don't quite make sense.

112
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,200
And here are some of the ways in which they're weird.

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,000
So quantum mechanics can be both waves and particles.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,280
This is called wave particle duality.

115
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
Quantum objects can be in more than one state at once,

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,840
and they can be both here and there, say,

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,040
this is called superposition.

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,840
You can't simultaneously know exactly

119
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
two properties of a quantum object.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,840
This is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

121
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,000
Quantum objects can affect one another

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
instantly over huge distances,

123
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,800
and this is often called spooky action at a distance,

124
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,120
and it arises from a phenomenon called entanglement.

125
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,560
You can't exactly measure anything without disturbing it,

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,040
and so the human observer can't be excluded from the theory.

127
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,440
It becomes unavoidably subjective.

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Everything that can happen, or that can possibly happen,

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
does happen, and there are two separate reasons

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,040
why this claim is made.

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
One is rooted in Feynman's work itself,

132
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
which says that quantum objects

133
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,560
take all possible paths through space.

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,440
The other comes from the controversial

135
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
many-words interpretation of quantum mechanics,

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,880
which says that every time a quantum system

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,920
faces a choice, it takes both choices,

138
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,040
splitting into separate worlds.

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,800
Okay, now here's the thing.

140
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Quantum mechanics itself doesn't say any of these things.

141
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,680
They are all attempts to say

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,960
what quantum mechanics might mean.

143
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,760
Some of them are misleading.

144
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,000
Some of them, I think, are plain wrong.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,520
Others are just unproven interpretations.

146
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,920
So I'm saying that we need to change the record

147
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
when we talk about quantum mechanics.

148
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,080
We need to stop falling back

149
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
on these tired old cliches and metaphors

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,600
and to look more closely and more carefully

151
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,920
at what quantum mechanics does and doesn't permit us to say.

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,960
And the first point to realize

153
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
is that there's a big difference between quantum theory,

154
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,480
the maths and the mechanics that scientists use daily

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,200
to predict stuff and to make devices like laptops and phones

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,320
and indeed quantum computers.

157
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
There's a difference between that

158
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,880
and the interpretation of that theory.

159
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,920
And this is what's so hard to grasp

160
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,080
because normally the interpretation of a scientific theory

161
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,840
seems obvious from the theory itself.

162
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,200
Newtonian mechanics, the old classical mechanics

163
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,920
that works for everyday objects

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,760
like tennis balls and spaceships.

165
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,760
This tells us what paths objects take

166
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,000
as forces act on them.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,520
And we don't have to ask, what do you mean by object?

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
What do you mean by path?

169
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,040
It's obvious.

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,240
That's not so for quantum mechanics.

171
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,480
And let me give you a glimpse of why.

172
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,320
To predict what a quantum object will do,

173
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,600
in place of Newton's equations of motion,

174
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,840
scientists generally use an equation

175
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,680
devised by Erwin Schrodinger in 1924

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
to describe the idea that quantum particles

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,200
might act like waves.

178
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,400
The Schrodinger equation doesn't give us

179
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,520
a trajectory for the particle,

180
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,400
but instead something called a wave function.

181
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,840
And the wave function can be used to figure out

182
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,160
where we might find the object in space.

183
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,400
So the shape of a typical wave function in space

184
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,760
might look something like this.

185
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,880
So what does this mean?

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
Well, it's often said that it means

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,360
the particle is smeared out over space.

188
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,200
And it does look that way, doesn't it, from this.

189
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,080
But this isn't showing the density

190
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
of the particle over space.

191
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,840
This is the wave function,

192
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,880
and it's a purely mathematical thing.

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
And what the wave function lets us deduce

194
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
is all the possible outcomes of measurements

195
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
of the particle's properties,

196
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
along with their relative probabilities.

197
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
So to find the position where we'll observe the particle,

198
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,600
then we simply calculate some number

199
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,640
from the wave function at that point in space,

200
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,920
and that gives us the probability

201
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,680
that we will see the particle at that point.

202
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
So the wave function doesn't tell us

203
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
where we'll find the particle.

204
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,720
It tells us the chance that we might find it

205
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,960
at any particular position if we look.

206
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,080
And this is what's so odd about quantum mechanics

207
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
because it seems to point in the wrong direction

208
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
compared to other scientific theories,

209
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,640
not down towards the system we're studying,

210
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,280
but up towards our experience of it.

211
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,760
It says nothing, or perhaps I should say,

212
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,320
it says nothing obvious

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,520
about what the quantum system itself is like.

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,600
In other words, the wave function

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,880
is not a description of the quantum object.

216
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
It is a prescription for what to expect

217
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,320
when we make measurements on that object.

218
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,080
But it's even more peculiar than this

219
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,000
because the wave function doesn't tell us

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,600
where the particle is likely to be at any instant,

221
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,640
which we can then verify by making measurements on it.

222
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
Rather, what the wave function,

223
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,680
well, the wave function tells us nothing

224
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,920
about where the particle is until we make a measurement.

225
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Strictly speaking, we shouldn't talk

226
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
about the particle at all,

227
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,840
except in terms of measurements we might make on it.

228
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,640
And this account of quantum mechanics

229
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,120
is more or less the one that was given

230
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,320
by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr

231
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,960
and his collaborators, such as Heisenberg.

232
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,600
And it's known today as the Copenhagen interpretation.

233
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,080
And I'm not saying that the Copenhagen interpretation

234
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,480
is right, but what's valuable, I think, about it

235
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,960
is that it tells us where our confidence

236
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,080
about the meaning of the theory has to stop.

237
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,040
As it stands, quantum mechanics doesn't permit us

238
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,040
to say anything with confidence about reality

239
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,560
beyond what we can measure of it.

240
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
And here's what I mean by that.

241
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,760
One way of speaking about this measurement

242
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
of a quantum particle goes like this.

243
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,280
We say that before the measurement,

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,680
a wave function is typically this broad spread out thing.

245
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,560
But when we make a measurement

246
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,280
and find the particle to be in a particular place,

247
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,680
then the wave function switches suddenly

248
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,520
to being a sharp spike at that single place.

249
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,560
And this is generally called collapse of the wave function.

250
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,720
And let me just mention that,

251
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,480
contrary to popular belief,

252
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
wave function collapse was never actually a part

253
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,840
of the Copenhagen interpretation,

254
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,280
at least as far as Bohr expressed it.

255
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,840
Now, the problem here is that there's absolutely

256
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,760
no mathematical prescription in the theory itself

257
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,400
for how this collapse happens.

258
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
You just have to assume it.

259
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,720
You have to put it in by hand.

260
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
That doesn't seem very satisfactory.

261
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,280
But wave function collapse doesn't mean

262
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,520
that the particle goes from being smeared out

263
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,320
to being sharply defined once we make a measurement on it.

264
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,760
All we can say is that before the measurement was made,

265
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,520
there were different probabilities

266
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
that a measurement would reveal it,

267
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,800
in particular in different places.

268
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
Whereas after the measurement,

269
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,640
we can say for sure that it is here and not there.

270
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,520
It's our knowledge that has changed.

271
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,600
And some researchers think that this, in fact,

272
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
is really what quantum mechanics is.

273
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,360
It's a theory that describes how our knowledge

274
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,240
about the world changes when we intervene in it.

275
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,280
And we can't deduce from that anything

276
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,880
about what the world was really like

277
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,720
before we had that knowledge of it.

278
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,000
So you see, it's misleading to talk about this situation

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,360
as the particle being in many places at once.

280
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,880
The situation tells us only what the possible outcomes

281
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,720
of a measurement will be.

282
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,720
And it's the same with quantum superpositions.

283
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,160
Now, it's often said of superpositions

284
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,760
that the odd thing about quantum objects

285
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,080
is that they can be not only in two places at once,

286
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,400
but in two states at once.

287
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,600
For example, quantum objects have a property called spin.

288
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,840
And all you need to know about it for now

289
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,440
is that for some particles,

290
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,200
it's a property that can have two possible orientations

291
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
when you measure it.

292
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,720
The spin, you could find that the spin of the particle

293
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,040
points up or it points down.

294
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,080
And so this is a property that could be used

295
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,240
to encode bits of binary information.

296
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,880
Up could represent a one, down could represent a zero,

297
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,680
and that's the basis of all quantum information technologies

298
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,000
such as quantum computers,

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,240
because it means that spins or other quantum states

300
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,200
can act as quantum bits or qubits.

301
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,560
But you see spins at these quantum objects

302
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,080
could be not just up or down,

303
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,520
that's to say a qubit of encoding a one or a zero,

304
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,560
they can be in a superposition of up and down states.

305
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,800
And this is a property that somehow expands

306
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,200
the space of possible states for quantum bits

307
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,280
and allows quantum computers to do some calculations

308
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,400
much more quickly than classical machines.

309
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Now, I've written it like this

310
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
with these odd looking brackets

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,920
to stress that this is just a formal way

312
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,720
of writing a superposition.

313
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,640
It's not a picture of reality.

314
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
You see, although a spin qubit placed

315
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,600
in a quantum superposition is often said

316
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
to be into the two states at once,

317
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,120
simultaneously a one and a zero, let's say,

318
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,640
that's not really right.

319
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,600
Because remember that the wave function

320
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,640
tells us only what we can expect when we make a measurement.

321
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,960
And so in this case,

322
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,320
it says that a measurement on the qubit

323
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,080
could yield a one or a zero.

324
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,520
Both, in this case, are possible outcomes.

325
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,120
And in fact, they're the only possible outcomes.

326
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,800
But what's the qubit like before we make the measurement?

327
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,960
Well, quantum mechanics doesn't really tell us that.

328
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,320
Well, now you see, I'm talking not about smeared out particles

329
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
or collapsing waves,

330
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,720
but about how information can be encoded in quantum systems

331
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
and how it can be read out.

332
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
And this is the basis offered

333
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,720
by quantum information technology,

334
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,600
which isn't just a basis,

335
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,200
which isn't just the basis of these amazing new technologies

336
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,440
like quantum computing or quantum cryptography.

337
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,960
It's also a new way of talking about quantum mechanics itself

338
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,120
and potentially talking about quantum information

339
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,520
might allow us to see past

340
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,800
all this old style paraphernalia of wave functions

341
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,280
and Schrodinger equations and quantum jumps

342
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,600
and to get to the core

343
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,960
of what the theory really seems to be telling us.

344
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,040
And there's an example of what I mean by that

345
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,240
in one of the most perplexing features of quantum mechanics,

346
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,080
which is that the outcomes of measurements

347
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,520
or observations seem to depend

348
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,160
on how much information we gather about the system.

349
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,320
And this is something that's commonly illustrated

350
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,840
by the quantum double slit experiment.

351
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,880
So if we send water waves or light waves

352
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,560
through two closely spaced slits,

353
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,840
then the waves emerging from each will spread out

354
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,280
and interfere with one another

355
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,680
and create a pattern where they alternately reinforce

356
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,000
or cancel each other.

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,520
So for light, if you do this,

358
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,480
you find a series of bright and dark bands

359
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,400
on a screen that's placed behind the slits.

360
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,760
If you do it for electrons,

361
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,400
which according to quantum mechanics

362
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,520
can also show these wave-like properties,

363
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,280
then you'll find the same thing.

364
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't just get two images of the slits as you would

365
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,480
if you were firing sand grains through a mask

366
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
from a sand blaster.

367
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,040
So, you know, as you would in the top case here,

368
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,000
you get wavy interference.

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
You get this interference pattern,

370
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,560
these many bands of more or less electrons hitting the screen.

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,640
And this interference persists,

372
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,840
even if the intensity of the beam is so low

373
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,320
that you know that the electrons

374
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,760
will be going through the slits one at a time.

375
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,960
It's as if each electron goes through both slits at once

376
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
and interferes with itself.

377
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,040
But now, if you put a detector close to one slit,

378
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,480
which can detect the electron

379
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,640
and see which slit it went through,

380
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
then you'll find indeed that the detector

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
will tell you it goes through one and not the other.

382
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,560
The detector might click or it might not.

383
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,840
But then, if you find out that information,

384
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,840
what you find is that the electron,

385
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,080
this interference pattern goes away

386
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,920
and the electron behaves like a regular particle.

387
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,000
And crucially, it's not that the detection itself

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,840
is somehow disturbing the electron's motion

389
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,040
and getting rid of this wavy behavior.

390
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,680
It seems to be the very fact of knowing

391
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,320
which slit it goes through

392
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,400
that destroys the quantum-like waviness.

393
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,760
And you can see that that's so

394
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,320
in what's called a delayed choice experiment

395
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,560
where you set up a detection scheme in a clever way.

396
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,920
So you only detect the particle's path

397
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,760
sometime after you're sure it has passed through the slits.

398
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,280
So then, you can be sure that the detection itself

399
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,680
isn't physically influencing the passage through the slits.

400
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,840
Nevertheless, finding out that information

401
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,720
will again destroy the interference pattern.

402
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,640
The particle will behave like a particle.

403
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,680
But if you leave the detector there and just turn it off

404
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,800
so that you don't know which slit it went through,

405
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,560
then the interference returns.

406
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,720
It's as if the particles spookily know

407
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,920
whether or not your eavesdropping on which path they took.

408
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,560
It's behavior like this that led Niels Bohr

409
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,000
to assert that there's something special

410
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,880
about measurement of quantum systems

411
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,120
that compels a quantum object

412
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,400
to make a choice about the properties that it has.

413
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
And until we do that, or unless we do that,

414
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
the property that the object has is undefined

415
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
and we simply can't talk meaningfully about it.

416
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Now, famously, that idea was at the core of the dispute

417
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,920
that grew up between Bohr and Einstein.

418
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,680
For Einstein, this notion that the world is somehow

419
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,440
indeterminate until we looked seemed absurd.

420
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,760
It seemed like the antithesis of science itself.

421
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,840
And in 1935, Einstein and two younger colleagues,

422
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,920
Boris Podolski and Nathan Rosen,

423
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,720
came up with a thought experiment

424
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,720
which they believed showed why Bohr's view had to be wrong.

425
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,560
Now, this experiment was later put in a slightly clearer form

426
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,880
by the physicist David Bowman.

427
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,280
That's how I'll describe it here.

428
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,800
So this is how it goes.

429
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,960
You have a box that spits out two quantum particles

430
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
that are in an entangled state.

431
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,920
And this means that their properties are interdependent.

432
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,960
So let's say that they have spins

433
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
which can only have two values when measured,

434
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
like I said, spin up or spin down.

435
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,600
Okay, so if they're entangled,

436
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,080
this means that the measurement outcomes

437
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,600
must be correlated between the two particles.

438
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,440
Typically, if one has a spin that points up,

439
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,720
then the other one has to point down.

440
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,720
We can't specify which is which,

441
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,360
but we know for sure that they must be correlated

442
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,040
because of the way we produce them.

443
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,200
So then if we measure the spin on one particle

444
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
and we find that it's a spin up particle,

445
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,280
then we know that the other particle must have spin down.

446
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,360
Okay, now this correlation in itself

447
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,560
might seem unremarkable

448
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,560
because you could say the same thing about two gloves,

449
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,320
let's say if someone sent them separately,

450
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,080
one glove to me, one glove to you through the mail.

451
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,400
If I open my package and I see I've got the right hand glove,

452
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,320
then I know instantly without even having to ask you

453
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,000
that you have got the left hand one.

454
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,320
But here's the crucial thing

455
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
because according to Bohr's interpretation

456
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,400
of quantum mechanics, the direction of the spins,

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,360
unlike the handedness of those two gloves,

458
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
isn't determined in advance.

459
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
It isn't determined until we, one of us,

460
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,000
actually observes what they've got.

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,320
Now, if that's so,

462
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,520
then this so-called EPR experiment

463
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,400
seemed to be saying that making a measurement

464
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,360
on one particle instantaneously

465
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,080
fixes the direction of the arrow or the spin for the other.

466
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,360
It's as if there's some spooky communication

467
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,400
passing between them.

468
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
And this is what Einstein called spooky action at a distance.

469
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
It was Erwin Schrödinger

470
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,640
who shared Einstein's skepticism

471
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,160
about the Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics.

472
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,280
It was Schrödinger who named it instead entanglement.

473
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,960
This kind of instantaneous communication or action

474
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,000
between two objects separating in space

475
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
was known to be impossible.

476
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
It was forbidden by Einstein's own

477
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,920
special theory of relativity.

478
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,680
So Einstein argued that quantum mechanics

479
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,520
couldn't be the whole story here.

480
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,480
There must be some missing ingredient,

481
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,920
which he said was some property,

482
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,520
which we now call a hidden variable,

483
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,320
that we couldn't measure,

484
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,560
but that somehow gives definite values

485
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,040
to these properties, the spins say,

486
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,120
to the particles all along.

487
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,040
The problem is that simply measuring particles

488
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,520
like in an experiment like this,

489
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,720
measuring two entangled particles

490
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
isn't gonna tell you who's right,

491
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,880
or Einstein, because that won't reveal anything

492
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,840
about what the particles were like

493
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,360
before you measured them.

494
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,200
So no one knew how to deal with this apparent EPR paradox,

495
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,080
as it was called.

496
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,080
And for decades, it was just brushed under the rug.

497
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,200
But all that changed in 1964

498
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,040
when the Irish physicist John Bell,

499
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,680
whose day job was as a particle physicist at CERN in Geneva,

500
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,080
reformulated the EPR experiment

501
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,520
in a way that suggested that it could be conducted for real.

502
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,560
So in short, Bell's experiment

503
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,600
involved a clever way of combining measurements

504
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,560
made by two observers on pairs of entangled particles,

505
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
where the observers themselves

506
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,280
decided how they'd make the measurement.

507
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,160
And the setup is actually what's sketched

508
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,520
behind the blackboard here with Bell,

509
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,700
but here's maybe a clearer depiction of it.

510
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,960
So what you do is you look at how strong the correlations

511
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,080
between pairs of entangled particles are

512
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,680
for different choices of how you make the measurement.

513
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,360
And Bell showed that if the particles were either classical

514
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,480
or were governed by Einstein's hidden variables,

515
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,200
so that either way their properties

516
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,280
were actually fixed all along,

517
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,720
then the strength of the correlations

518
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,600
that you get in many repeated experiments here

519
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,920
added up in a certain way couldn't exceed a certain value.

520
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,040
But if they were governed by quantum mechanics,

521
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,100
as Bohr put it, and Bohr was right to say

522
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,820
that we couldn't see anything about the properties

523
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,980
before we measured them,

524
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,500
then this correlation would be larger than that threshold.

525
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,220
So these experiments were first done in the 1970s

526
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,140
by John Clouser and Stuart Friedman

527
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,860
at the University of California at Berkeley

528
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,260
using laser photons as the entangled object.

529
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,020
And they've been repeated many, many times since,

530
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,900
then made ever more rigorous

531
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,820
and ever more able to rule out possible loop holes

532
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,340
in Bell's argument.

533
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,140
Every single time they've given the same very clear result,

534
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,740
which is that quantum mechanics alone is right.

535
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,700
Bohr's argument seems to be right

536
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,540
and there's no need, no argument for Einstein's hidden variables.

537
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
So how can this be?

538
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,480
What was wrong with the EPR argument?

539
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,180
Well, Einstein and his colleagues

540
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,660
made the perfectly reasonable assumption of locality,

541
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,360
which is really saying that the properties of a particle

542
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,180
are localized on that particle itself

543
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,080
and that what happens to this particle here

544
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,980
can't affect what happens to another particle there

545
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,540
in some different part of space

546
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,300
without some way of transmitting an effect

547
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,140
across the intervening space between them.

548
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,300
But it seems that nature doesn't work that way

549
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,620
at the quantum level.

550
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,540
We can't regard the two particles in the EPR experiment

551
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,180
as separate entities, even though they're separated in space.

552
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
When they are quantum entangled,

553
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,020
they can be both,

554
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,220
they have to be both considered in some sense

555
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,860
a single non-local entity.

556
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,700
And in fact, it's only if we accept Einstein's assumption

557
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,580
of locality that we need to tell the story

558
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,620
in terms of particle one,

559
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,200
somehow influencing the spin of particle two

560
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,340
when we make the measurement,

561
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,540
this spooky action at a distance.

562
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,080
The alternative view is that we have to invoke

563
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,460
quantum non-locality,

564
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,780
this idea that somehow quantum properties

565
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,780
can be delocalized between two or more objects.

566
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,260
So here again, we seem to find this issue

567
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,500
of how measurement and information

568
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,420
and the re-information we get from it

569
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,500
seem to affect the outcomes itself.

570
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,380
As with the double slit experiment,

571
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,020
you can show in a belt test

572
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,060
that it's not the physical act of making the measurement

573
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,540
on one particle that somehow seems to fix

574
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,740
the property of the other.

575
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,460
It's the matter of whether that measurement

576
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,700
unambiguously tells you what the state of your particle is.

577
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,460
So it's the knowledge that matters.

578
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,500
Measurement has become something of a dirty word

579
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,900
in quantum mechanics because it seems to bring up

580
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,380
all these peculiarities.

581
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,260
In fact, John Bell placed it on a list of bad words

582
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,220
which incidentally also included information

583
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,580
that he thought should be banned

584
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,540
from talking about quantum mechanics.

585
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,420
But these days, measurement isn't quite the mystery

586
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,360
that it once was.

587
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,520
Even though it's not fully understood yet either.

588
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,720
I see in Boar's view, a measurement was necessarily

589
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,680
something governed by classical physics

590
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,760
because ultimately it needed classical scale stuff,

591
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,080
you know, a piece of apparatus and us to look at it.

592
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,640
And so for him, that was the end of the mystery

593
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,880
because he said that quantum and classical

594
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,720
were just distinct regimes.

595
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,960
And we shouldn't expect to be able to pronounce

596
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
about what went on in the quantum world

597
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,280
from the perspective of the classical one.

598
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,240
In effect, he declared that there was a fundamental divide

599
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,440
between them.

600
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,000
Now, it's not surprising that that seemed

601
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,280
a deeply unsatisfactory answer to some researchers,

602
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,800
including Einstein.

603
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,080
But today we can do somewhat better than that.

604
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,560
We know, for example, that a measurement involving,

605
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,640
any measurement involving the interaction of a quantum system

606
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,320
with some classical environment like a measuring device

607
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,960
that aims to extract information about it.

608
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,400
Any measurement like that involves entanglement.

609
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,920
Entanglement happens whenever one particle encounters another.

610
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,240
In fact, quantum mechanics says if they interact,

611
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,000
that's the only thing that can happen.

612
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,680
They have to become entangled.

613
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,680
And if you make a measurement so that more and more

614
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,760
of these interactions with the environment accumulate,

615
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,800
the quantum system itself becomes more and more entangled

616
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,960
with its environment.

617
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,920
You might say that what this means is that the process

618
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,000
spreads out the quantumness of the original object

619
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,840
into its surroundings.

620
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,640
And in that process, the quantumness

621
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,880
kind of gets diluted into the environment.

622
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,240
And here's what I mean by that.

623
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Let's say you have a quantum bit, a qubit, in a superposition,

624
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,440
and then you make a measurement on it,

625
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
and it becomes entangled with its environment.

626
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,760
So the superposition then spreads into those particles, too.

627
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,080
And if you want to demonstrate that you still

628
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
have a superposition there at all,

629
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,200
then you have to look for it in all those entangled particles.

630
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,040
And that quickly becomes impossible.

631
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
It will be a bit like trying to keep track

632
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,840
of every single gas molecule that you just breathed out

633
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,200
as it collides with and mixes with all of those

634
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
in the air around it.

635
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,080
So this process is a real physical process.

636
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,720
It's called decoherence, and it leads

637
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,000
to the apparent disappearance of quantum properties

638
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,520
like superposition in the original quantum object

639
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,280
when it's observed and when its properties are measured.

640
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,080
And it's possible to calculate how fast decoherence should

641
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,560
happen when a quantum system interacts with its environment.

642
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,200
And we find that generally, it's so fast,

643
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,080
it's almost instantaneous.

644
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,560
So for example, if you could somehow

645
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,280
put a dust grain in the air in a quantum superposition

646
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,440
of states, you can calculate that it

647
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,680
would decoher in this room in about 10 to the minus 31

648
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,520
seconds, faster than anything we can measure.

649
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,440
And what you're left with when that happens

650
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,640
is classical behavior, definite properties

651
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,080
with fixed values, such as a well-defined position

652
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,120
in space.

653
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,440
In fact, according to one theory that

654
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,840
describes how this decoherence changes quantum to classical,

655
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,720
it's a theory called quantum Darwinism.

656
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,200
This process not only gives objects fixed definite values

657
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,680
of their properties, but it actually picks out

658
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,160
from all the quantum features precisely those properties

659
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,600
that are meaningful in the classical world,

660
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,160
properties like position and speed and charge.

661
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,720
So only certain quantum features, the theory says,

662
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,360
have the right characteristics to survive the filtering

663
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,720
process of decoherence.

664
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,480
And they do that.

665
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,880
They have those properties because they are particularly

666
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,760
good at making many imprints or copies of themselves

667
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,080
in their environment.

668
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,000
That's where the Darwinism part of the theory comes in.

669
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You see, when we make an observation of an object,

670
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,760
what we're really doing is detecting the traces

671
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,480
that it imprints on its environment.

672
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,400
You can only see me now because of the photons that

673
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,760
have scattered from my particles and made their way

674
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,240
into the camera.

675
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,320
This all gets a bit more complicated

676
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,120
when we're talking about virtual talks,

677
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,520
but it sort of works.

678
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,600
And you can only hear me because of the imprint

679
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,200
that my particles have made on the air molecules,

680
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,320
the movements of the air molecules.

681
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
In fact, you could reconstruct everything

682
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,040
you can say about an object, like a dust grain,

683
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,520
say, from those imprints, like the photons of light

684
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,400
that are bouncing off it here.

685
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,320
And you could reconstruct all of that,

686
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,000
even if just after those photons have bounced off,

687
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,040
the object itself was somehow to magically vanish from space.

688
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,720
You could still see it from the imprint

689
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,880
that it's left for a short time.

690
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,480
And you can all agree on my properties, my position,

691
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,920
the color of my shirt, what I'm saying,

692
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,440
classical properties like this.

693
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
You can agree on them because there

694
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,280
are lots of the imprints that I'm making on the environment.

695
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,160
They're highly redundant imprints.

696
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,360
There are loads of scattered photons from me,

697
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,160
enough for all of you to share.

698
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,080
If one of you was somehow able to harvest every photon I scatter,

699
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,760
no one else could see me and make any observation of me.

700
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
And it's this creation of many copies or imprints

701
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,640
via interactions and entanglement with the environment

702
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,120
that is described by quantum Darwinism,

703
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,400
and that in this theory, at least, that

704
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,480
is how quantum becomes classical.

705
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,920
Now, there seems to be no avoiding decoherent for objects

706
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,760
the size of a dust grain, even in a vacuum.

707
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
Interactions with thermal radiation, infrared photons

708
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,480
from the warmth of the room, would still

709
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,720
cause it to decoher in about 10 to the minus 18 seconds.

710
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,320
Even if you put that grain of dust

711
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,880
in the cold emptiness of interstellar space,

712
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,680
it would still decoher in about a second

713
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,800
because of the microwave photons out there

714
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,760
from the cosmic background radiation.

715
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,960
So in other words, the reason we can't generally

716
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,880
observe quantum effects like superposition in objects

717
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,040
of everyday scale is not because there's

718
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,200
some law of nature that forbids quantumness at those scales,

719
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,440
but because decoherence will destroy it almost instantly.

720
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
And it does so because of quantum entanglement itself.

721
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,800
If we could figure out how to put a tennis ball in some

722
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,560
well-defined superposition of states

723
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,600
and to isolate it completely from sources of decoherence,

724
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,120
and yet this is a tricky bit, somehow,

725
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,800
still monitor its state accurately enough,

726
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,720
quantum mechanics says there's no reason

727
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,960
why such a superposition should be impossible.

728
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,680
Now some physicists think that there might be other factors

729
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,080
in that situation that will come into play

730
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,360
that will destroy quantum coherence anyway,

731
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,760
some think that gravity will do it.

732
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,760
But it's not clear that anything extra is needed

733
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,200
to effectively banish quantum phenomena at everyday scales.

734
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,480
In other words, the world is quantum all the way up,

735
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,080
and classical physics is pretty much just what

736
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,040
quantum physics looks like when you're six feet tall.

737
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,480
And that's really what I mean by the title of my talk.

738
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,200
And I should just add for this audience that decoherence

739
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,960
is the enemy of quantum computing.

740
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,720
Computing with qubits relies on keeping them

741
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,680
in a collective state of superposition

742
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,800
while the computation proceeds.

743
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,360
Decoherence will mess that up.

744
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,840
And that's why quantum circuits have to be cooled

745
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
to such extremely low temperatures

746
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
within a whisker of absolute zero,

747
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,000
because this suppresses all the thermal jiggling

748
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,160
that would otherwise disrupt the qubits.

749
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,400
And it's the difficulty of maintaining this coherence

750
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,440
and suppressing decoherence in ever greater numbers

751
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,120
of entangled qubits that explains why quantum computers

752
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,840
so far don't have more than around 70 qubits or so

753
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,440
to play with.

754
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,120
But it's a testament to how much power quantum rules give you

755
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,040
that already quantum computers can do in seconds

756
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,280
with just that number of qubits,

757
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,800
some calculations that would take today's

758
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,400
classical supercomputers a billion years or so.

759
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,600
Now, there's a curious thing about Bell's experiments

760
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,040
that's often not remarked upon.

761
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,840
I remember I said that the quantum mechanics allows

762
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,920
correlations between entangled particles

763
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,440
to be stronger than they would be in classical physics

764
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,480
or for hidden variables.

765
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
But quantum mechanics too sets a limit

766
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,680
on how strong those correlations can be.

767
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,600
And it's not obvious why they couldn't be stronger.

768
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,520
We don't know why that is, why the world isn't,

769
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,600
if you like, even more quantum than it is.

770
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,000
But one useful way to think about what's going on there

771
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,720
is that there seems to be a limit

772
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,960
on how much sharing of information quantum mechanics

773
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,280
permits between entangled particles.

774
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,000
So here again, what makes quantum mechanics what it is,

775
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,040
seems at root to have nothing to do

776
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,800
with mathematical notions.

777
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,840
And this is precisely where some scientists

778
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,600
think we should start in trying to reconstruct

779
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,840
quantum mechanics from scratch,

780
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,560
not from these ad hoc guesses,

781
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,160
as they really were to begin with,

782
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,880
about waves and particles and Schrodinger equations,

783
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,320
but from some simple axioms, some simple assumptions

784
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,760
about what is permitted with information,

785
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,600
how it can be encoded, how it can be transferred,

786
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,960
how it can be read out.

787
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
And I want to give you just a flavor

788
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,640
of what this sort of reconstruction would look like.

789
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,600
There are many of them that have been suggested.

790
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,720
They all are somewhat similar.

791
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,120
And I've taken one at random

792
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,360
that was suggested in 2009 by Borovoye Dakic

793
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,560
and Chaslav Bruckner at the University of Vienna in Austria.

794
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,360
They proposed what they said were three reasonable axioms

795
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,040
about how the world might be.

796
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,960
And this is what the axioms were,

797
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,160
that first of all, the most elementary components

798
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,480
of the world, whatever those are,

799
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,480
can carry no more than one bit of information within them.

800
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,960
They assumed secondly, that the state of,

801
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,920
what they called locality.

802
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,720
So the way they expressed it was a state of a composite system

803
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,560
made of many subsystems is completely determined

804
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,600
by measurements made on its subsystems.

805
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,600
What that really means is that there are no secret mechanisms

806
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,760
like hidden variables manipulating what's going on.

807
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,360
Thirdly, they assumed that this property of reversibility,

808
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,600
that you can convert any pure states

809
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,720
from one to the other and back again,

810
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,200
like a coin toss flipping heads and tails.

811
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,880
So Dakic and Bruckner showed that with these assumptions alone

812
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,080
about information really,

813
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,640
that they will lead you inevitably

814
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,080
to only two sets of possible rules

815
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,200
about how things can happen.

816
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,440
And those are the rules that are described

817
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,120
by classical mechanics and by quantum mechanics.

818
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,560
And what's more, if you modify this third axiom

819
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,480
to assume that states can be interconverted gradually,

820
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,600
little by little, rather than in one big jump,

821
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,600
then you only get rules that conform to quantum mechanics.

822
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,920
So for a classical coin toss, for example,

823
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,760
a head and a tail interconvert sort of abruptly

824
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,120
in one big jump, it's either heads or it's tails.

825
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,000
In a quantum system, you could have a situation

826
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,040
where you've got your hand down on the coin

827
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,800
and it can gradually, as you hold it down,

828
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,360
interconvert from the heads or tails

829
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,320
without having to pick it up and flip it over.

830
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,240
Okay, so the point is that these axioms about information

831
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,360
can by themselves lead to quantum behavior

832
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,240
that we're familiar with,

833
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,360
like superpositions and entanglement.

834
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,320
And some researchers think that these efforts,

835
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,040
quantum reconstruction,

836
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,560
might lead to a completely different perspective

837
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,540
on quantum theory, one in which the physical meaning

838
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,300
of all the seemingly strange behaviors

839
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,260
at last becomes clear.

840
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,980
Now, it remains to be seen whether that will happen,

841
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,620
but I think it's already illuminating

842
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,100
that they all focus on information,

843
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,260
on how answers or measurement outcomes

844
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,020
are contingent on the questions we ask and how we ask them.

845
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,260
And I think this is the most productive way to think

846
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,380
about what quantum mechanics seems to be telling us.

847
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,140
And it's a perspective that I think is illustrated

848
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,100
really nicely by a metaphor

849
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,580
that the American physicist John Wheeler,

850
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,260
who studied under Bohr and who had Feynman

851
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
as one of his students, incidentally,

852
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,860
he suggests that maybe we should think about quantum mechanics

853
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,260
as like this.

854
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,060
Let's think of it as being a bit like the game of 20 questions.

855
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,540
So I'm sure you know this game.

856
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,820
So it's the one where one player leaves the room

857
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,900
and everyone else in the room agrees on a certain person,

858
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
a historical figure, a well-known person.

859
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,460
And then the person outside has to come back in

860
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,540
and they start to ask each person in turn a question

861
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,100
to try to find out who it is that they've chosen.

862
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,540
And they have to be questions

863
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,820
that can only be answered yes or no.

864
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,100
So you see, they're really quantum questions.

865
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,580
Now, imagine you're the questioner here.

866
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
So you come back in, you start to ask questions

867
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,180
and you get your answers.

868
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,260
You start off, is the person male?

869
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,500
And the first person says, yes.

870
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,260
And then you go to the second person, is he alive?

871
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,300
No. OK. And you carry on.

872
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,380
But you start to find an odd thing

873
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,420
that as you go on asking more and more people,

874
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,580
it takes them longer and longer to answer your question.

875
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,900
You know, they're having to think about it.

876
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,060
Well, that's odd because if they've agreed on a person,

877
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,860
it's either the answer is either yes or no.

878
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,180
What is there to think about?

879
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,100
Anyway, you carry on playing this game

880
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,060
and eventually you think you're zeroing in on who it is.

881
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,180
And finally you think, I've got it.

882
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,260
And you say, it's Richard Feynman.

883
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,420
And everyone laughs and tells you that you're right.

884
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,260
It's Richard Feynman.

885
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,540
And then you say, well, what was going on?

886
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,540
Why were you taking so long to think about the answer?

887
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,860
And they explain how they decided to play this.

888
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,500
So instead of deciding on a particular person

889
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,860
when you were out of the room,

890
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,300
what they decided to do was to say that the answer

891
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,420
that anyone gave to the question you asked

892
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,220
had to be consistent with all of the answers

893
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,700
that had been given before.

894
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,300
They didn't decide on anyone,

895
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,180
but the answer that they gave had to correspond

896
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,220
to all the answers that have been given so far,

897
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,420
had to correspond to a famous person of some sort or another.

898
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,580
And so of course, you know, as the answers went on,

899
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,060
it became harder and harder to think,

900
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,420
well, who does that apply to then?

901
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,340
The male, they're dead and so on.

902
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,620
They're a physicist and so on.

903
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,420
You have to think harder and harder.

904
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,420
And what happens is that as the questions are asked,

905
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,460
the possible answers get narrowed down.

906
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,940
And in the end, there's only one person it can be.

907
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,620
It has to be Richard Feynman.

908
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,380
But everyone was forced by the nature

909
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,180
of the questions themselves to converge

910
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,260
on that same person.

911
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,260
If you had asked different questions,

912
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,660
you'd have ended up with a different person,

913
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,300
a different answer.

914
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,700
So the answer you got depended on the context.

915
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,460
There never was a preordained answer.

916
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,260
You brought that answer into being

917
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,180
in a way that is fully consistent

918
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,900
with the questions you asked.

919
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,460
And what's more, the very notion of an answer at all

920
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,500
only makes sense when you play the game.

921
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,020
You know, if you'd come back in and said,

922
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,620
oh, I can't be bothered to go through this,

923
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,220
just tell me who you chose.

924
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,340
There would be no answer to that question.

925
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,020
You have to do the inquiring before an answer

926
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,740
will be forthcoming.

927
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,140
So quantum mechanics is like this.

928
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,980
It seems to be a theory of what is and isn't knowable

929
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,980
and how those knowns are related.

930
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,620
And I like to think of this in terms of a distinction

931
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,100
between a theory of is-ness and a theory of if-ness.

932
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,180
Quantum mechanics doesn't tell us how a thing is

933
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,140
or how a quantum thing is.

934
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,540
It tells us what and with what calculable probability

935
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,900
it could be, along with a logic of the relationships

936
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,660
between the various coulds.

937
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,900
If this, then that.

938
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,340
And what this means is that to truly describe

939
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,780
the features of quantum mechanics

940
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,500
as far as we currently can,

941
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,580
we should replace all the conventional isms with ifms.

942
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,140
So for example, we shouldn't say here it is a particle,

943
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,380
there it is a wave.

944
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,620
We should say, if we measure things like this,

945
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,260
the quantum object behaves in a manner

946
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,620
that we associate with particles.

947
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,620
But if we measure it like that,

948
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,780
it behaves as if it's a wave.

949
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,260
We shouldn't say the particle is in two states at once.

950
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,540
We should say, if we measure it,

951
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,260
we will detect this state with probability x

952
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,660
and that state with probability y.

953
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,860
This if-ness is perplexing

954
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,940
because it's not what we've come to associate with science.

955
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,860
We used to tell it to the science telling us how things are.

956
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,620
And if there are ifs at all,

957
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,620
it's because we're partially ignorant about that.

958
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,860
But in quantum mechanics,

959
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,260
as far as we can tell at the moment,

960
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,220
the ifs seem to be fundamental.

961
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,420
Well, okay, you might say,

962
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,740
but what's the stuff that this if-ness is referring to?

963
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,860
Quantum mechanics doesn't obviously tell us much about that.

964
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,740
And all we have right now are hints and guesses.

965
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,100
And to try to bring them into sharper focus

966
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,260
is a tricky business.

967
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,980
It seems to demand an almost poetic level of expression,

968
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,180
which will send some physicists scurrying for cover.

969
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,140
So here, for example, is an attempt to do that,

970
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,020
that the physicist Chris Fuchs suggested.

971
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,060
He said, maybe quantum mechanics is telling us

972
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,820
that the world is sensitive to our touch.

973
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,780
It has a kind of zing that makes it fly off

974
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,580
in ways that were not imaginable classically.

975
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,700
The whole structure of quantum mechanics

976
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,340
may be nothing more than the optimal method

977
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,340
of reasoning and processing information

978
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,020
in the light of such a fundamental, wonderful sensitivity.

979
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,220
And what Fuchs means here is not the mundane truism

980
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,340
that the human observer disturbs the world.

981
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,220
That's true in classical physics.

982
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,180
Rather, quantum mechanics may be the machinery

983
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,980
that we humans need,

984
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,580
we humans pitched at a scale midway

985
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,620
between the subatomic and the galactic

986
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,620
to try to compile and quantify information about a world

987
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,700
that has this incredibly sensitive character.

988
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,620
It embodies what we've learnt

989
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,820
about how to navigate in such a world.

990
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,220
And I think it's vital at any rate

991
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,260
that we understand that this if-ness

992
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,660
doesn't imply that the world, our world, our home,

993
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,260
is holding anything back from us.

994
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,900
It's just that classical physics

995
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,420
has primed us to expect too much from it.

996
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,620
We've become accustomed to asking questions

997
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,700
and getting definite answers.

998
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,940
What colour is it?

999
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,940
How heavy is it? How fast is it moving?

1000
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,580
Forgetting the almost ludicrous amount about

1001
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,060
that we don't know about everyday objects,

1002
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,860
we figured that we could go on forever,

1003
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,620
asking questions and being answered at ever finer scales.

1004
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,020
When we discovered that we can't,

1005
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,940
we felt shortchanged by nature and we pronounced it weird.

1006
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,060
I don't think that will do anymore.

1007
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,380
Nature does its best and we need to adjust our expectations.

1008
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,900
So we need to go beyond weird.

1009
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,780
Thanks very much.

1010
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,540
Thank you, Phillip.

1011
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,260
Thank you, Phillip, for the wonderful talk

1012
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,340
and I can relay to you a few comments

1013
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,100
before I get to questions from the audience

1014
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,260
and folks in the audience.

1015
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,740
Please feel free to post questions again in the chat.

1016
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,180
The chat is very active right now,

1017
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,220
so I'll try to pull them out of the stream here.

1018
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,180
We have, by the way, a few folks I would just like

1019
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,540
to relay to you since you can't see the chat yourself,

1020
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,180
you know, said this is, you know, nice stuff,

1021
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,420
enlightening and mesmerizing,

1022
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,820
so I thought I should relay that.

1023
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,580
We had quite a few discussions and questions,

1024
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,020
I think, that spawned off of the discussion as to,

1025
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,820
let's see, hopefully you can see me now, there we go,

1026
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:52,780
as to why is quantum weird

1027
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,140
in the sense of deterministic?

1028
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,660
Is it, you know, is it because we're used

1029
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,860
to deterministic theories?

1030
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,220
And I think you touched on this throughout the talk

1031
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,820
and this is one of the essential points.

1032
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,980
But maybe if we kind of come back to that,

1033
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,460
there was the locality that deterministic

1034
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,020
versus maybe non-causal potential,

1035
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,540
maybe if we could sort of get your thoughts again

1036
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,460
in a bit of a summary here of the discussion

1037
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,020
that is going on in the chat.

1038
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,020
Yeah, okay, well, I mean, certainly, you know,

1039
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,660
it seems to me that as far as we can say at the moment,

1040
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,460
quantum mechanics isn't deterministic.

1041
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,180
There are ways of interpreting quantum theory

1042
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,180
that are deterministic, that in fact do return us

1043
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,860
to some sort of picture of there being real particles

1044
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,580
that have real properties and real places out there.

1045
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,060
There are interpretations that suggest that.

1046
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,300
And if you like all the quantumness

1047
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,380
or what we've conventionally called the weirdness

1048
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,140
is kind of put onto another aspect of the theory,

1049
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,380
but we recover the particles.

1050
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,380
So that's possible, but it's, you know, it's unproven

1051
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,740
and it's just one interpretation.

1052
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,300
And at the moment, it seems to me it's safe us to say

1053
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,500
that, you know, that there does seem to be

1054
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,820
this fundamental indeterminacy in quantum mechanics

1055
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,620
so that if we make a measurement on a system,

1056
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,500
all we can meaningfully say is what the probabilities

1057
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,820
of the outcomes will be.

1058
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,780
We could, that perhaps we can never say more than that.

1059
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,760
So we can ever exactly predict what we're going to find.

1060
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,120
That's very interesting.

1061
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,760
And I think, folks, I'm sorry,

1062
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,360
we were going to have to leave the videos off,

1063
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,240
but hopefully you can still hear us just fine.

1064
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,360
We're having some bandwidth issues today.

1065
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,600
Yes, so, interesting.

1066
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,240
And maybe a follow up question from the audience here.

1067
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,960
In the classical world, you know, are we perhaps too used

1068
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,160
to trying to write down deterministic laws?

1069
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,400
Could the classical world be modeled under any probability

1070
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,120
or a probabilistic theory, perhaps,

1071
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,280
to rephrase the question here?

1072
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,320
And should that really be the comparison

1073
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,840
between the quantum world and the classical?

1074
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,560
Well, I'm certainly not an expert on this,

1075
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,600
but what I can say in response to that is that

1076
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,240
these efforts at quantum reconstruction

1077
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,920
that I talked about, one way of looking at that

1078
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,840
is that really, quantum mechanics is simply

1079
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,120
a kind of probability theory.

1080
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,040
It's just a different sort of probability.

1081
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,000
You know, probabilities work a bit differently

1082
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,680
from how we used to them in the classical world.

1083
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,400
And that, you know, one way of looking at it is that,

1084
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,960
is that, you know, we should be thinking probabilistically,

1085
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,800
you know, more generally.

1086
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,400
And, you know, there are a whole set

1087
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,520
of possible probabilistic theories

1088
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,920
or theories of probability,

1089
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,520
and one of them corresponds to quantum type rules.

1090
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,520
So, you know, here again, we sort of come back

1091
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,520
to quantum mechanics being a theory about noability

1092
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,120
and how much the world is really knowable.

1093
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,080
I mean, the way that I think about it,

1094
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,080
that makes sense to me, is to suggest

1095
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,680
that quantum mechanics seems to be telling us

1096
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,680
that we are, it's possible for us to ask more questions

1097
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,840
that nature can have answers, can have definite answers for.

1098
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,680
That seems to me to be really the point.

1099
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,720
And that doesn't seem to be such an unreasonable thing

1100
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,560
to propose.

1101
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,000
Why should every question that we compose

1102
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,960
that we could pose necessarily have a definite answer?

1103
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,920
Quantum mechanics seems to be saying it doesn't.

1104
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,280
And so you have a choice.

1105
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,840
If you choose to ask these questions,

1106
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
you'll get this set of responses.

1107
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
If you can choose to ask this set of questions,

1108
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,040
you'll get a different one.

1109
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,200
And they may not be compatible with each other

1110
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,040
because you ask different questions.

1111
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,080
So it depends on the context of the questions

1112
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,120
that you're asking.

1113
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,720
I think that's enlightening, yeah.

1114
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,840
And maybe that reminds me a bit of this game

1115
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,800
you brought up earlier, which was very nice.

1116
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,320
And I think you concluded by something along the lines

1117
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,120
of you brought that answer into being of,

1118
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,760
oh, it's Feynman by asking that particular set of questions.

1119
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,280
And I think it was Sash Kurodkov

1120
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,200
as a physicist who also says, in quantum mechanics,

1121
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,000
you don't see what you get, you get what you see.

1122
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,760
And that brings me to maybe your perspective

1123
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,440
or thoughts or opinion on no ability, right?

1124
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,920
So in these more recent experiments,

1125
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,600
the quantum trajectory type of experiments,

1126
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,960
those experiments can't always,

1127
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,560
they usually can't tell you the future,

1128
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,520
they can't predict the future,

1129
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,920
but they can always tell you exactly what,

1130
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,920
in a way the state is, the quantum description,

1131
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,280
the quantum state is doing,

1132
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,280
as you are subjecting the system

1133
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,280
to an ongoing interrogation, a measurement.

1134
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,440
And there seems to be this very close

1135
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,360
one-to-one direct correspondence.

1136
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:35,120
In a sense, the randomness only comes

1137
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,400
if you now suddenly change your measurement

1138
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,560
to something else, but you have a knowledge

1139
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,840
about the system that is conditioned

1140
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,760
on what you're measuring and you can update that.

1141
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,640
And there's always, in the case

1142
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,440
that you can do that update perfectly,

1143
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,760
which you can get close to these days for some experiments,

1144
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,400
there are always not a complete set of questions

1145
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,320
you can answer perfectly.

1146
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,440
Like you said, there are always more questions in quantum

1147
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,000
than perhaps you can always get a deterministic answer for.

1148
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,520
But there is a subset of those questions

1149
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,640
that you can always know that if you ask the question,

1150
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,720
is the qubit along the x direction?

1151
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,320
Let's say you always get a perfect one,

1152
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,840
even though you've been injecting randomness

1153
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,620
into the system throughout with your measurement.

1154
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,260
Maybe that was a bit long of a question,

1155
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,180
so I apologize for that, Phil.

1156
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,780
But perhaps if we can get your thoughts on QTT

1157
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,580
and a bit of that, that would be great.

1158
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,540
Well, I mean, of course, Lako,

1159
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,300
you're the one who knows about this rather than me.

1160
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,740
I was absolutely fascinated by those experiments

1161
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,540
for various reasons, but I think that perhaps

1162
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,940
the main one was that it seemed to me

1163
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,940
that you were really starting to zero in

1164
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,140
on what is happening when we make a measurement.

1165
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,540
And in particular, to dispel this idea

1166
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,700
that measurement is this mysterious black box

1167
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,580
that suddenly turns all the quantum vagueness

1168
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,220
into something concrete.

1169
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,740
What really excited me about them

1170
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,060
was that you can see that process happening

1171
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,980
and that there are laws to it.

1172
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,420
That it's not just magical and unpredictable

1173
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,500
and everything else, that as you say,

1174
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,220
if you are able to follow it with sufficient time resolution

1175
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,620
in sufficient detail,

1176
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,940
knowing almost everything about what is happening

1177
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,220
in the system, then you can see something

1178
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,340
that does look like a trajectory

1179
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,460
that is taking the system from one state to another.

1180
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:50,620
And this is why, I mean, it certainly convinced me

1181
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,540
that this notion of wave function collapse

1182
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,020
as a mysterious thing that suddenly snaps

1183
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:02,020
a wave into a particle, that we really,

1184
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,380
it's never really been needed in quantum mechanics.

1185
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,140
I understand why it got there,

1186
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,140
but it's time to get it back out again

1187
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,460
because we don't need it.

1188
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:15,460
And it seems to me that that is getting much closer

1189
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,060
to having a proper understanding

1190
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,580
of what it is that happens when we make a measurement.

1191
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,220
Perhaps the one thing, and I'd be interested

1192
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,940
in whether you have thoughts about this,

1193
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,940
because the one thing that it doesn't seem to explain,

1194
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,060
and this is really the sort of fundamental mystery

1195
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,460
of quantum mechanics, why do you only ever get one thing?

1196
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,140
And of course, there are some interpretations

1197
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,060
that say, well, you don't,

1198
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,380
you just get both in different universes.

1199
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:50,380
But as far as we can ever see, quantum measurements are unique.

1200
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,420
So where does that uniqueness come from,

1201
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,020
given that we know in principle,

1202
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,100
more than one outcome is possible?

1203
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,620
That's a really deep question.

1204
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,100
I think, in fact, I got asked a similar question

1205
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,100
at my dissertation defense in the private dissertation part

1206
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,420
where they take you aside to a room and quiz you

1207
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,940
for until you come to a point of, anyway.

1208
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,300
So I don't know that I have a great answer,

1209
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,820
but maybe a few thoughts that are probably something

1210
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,260
you've written about quite a bit,

1211
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,580
as well as this notion you brought up earlier,

1212
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,820
and I think you said Bell maybe had introduced it,

1213
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,820
or of two different disconnected worlds,

1214
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,220
the world of the quantum and the world of the classical.

1215
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,300
And there's this notion of Heisenberg's cut,

1216
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,260
the boundary between these two.

1217
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,780
And there's no prescription in any textbook

1218
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,900
or in any paper that I know of that you can find

1219
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,900
that really pins down where does this difference occur

1220
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,140
between what you call a measurement apparatus

1221
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:04,140
and where you get classical results out of the system?

1222
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,100
And what is the quantum system?

1223
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,940
So for example, coming back to this,

1224
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,700
to the quantum jumps nature paper you brought up earlier,

1225
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,180
you could model, you could take that Heisenberg cut

1226
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,100
at different stages of the experiment

1227
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,660
and pretend like, for instance,

1228
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,260
just the qubit itself is quantum,

1229
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,140
and it's being subjected to a particular

1230
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,820
classical measurement apparatus

1231
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,900
that has this particular type of question

1232
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,660
it's interrogating the system with,

1233
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,260
kind of like the game that you mentioned earlier.

1234
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,380
But it turns out that in what we had to do

1235
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,740
for the experiment is we moved the cut one step further,

1236
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,620
that apparatus was a particular type

1237
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,860
of superconducting cavity.

1238
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,020
And we model all of the quantum behavior of it as well.

1239
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:54,020
Now that particular cavity is then followed

1240
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,980
by another quantum amplifier.

1241
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,780
And we could actually include the quantum amplifier itself

1242
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,260
and also make this very large now quantum system.

1243
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,300
You have three different quantum systems

1244
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,140
that are all coupled together.

1245
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,180
And you have this kind of matroshka doll

1246
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,620
of nested larger systems that are increasingly

1247
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,860
becoming more classical in a sense,

1248
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,940
because at each stage you're amplifying

1249
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,820
and in a sense the signal there's more quantum excitation

1250
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,160
that are getting involved.

1251
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,420
And perhaps with that, once you have,

1252
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:27,420
like you said, the grain of dust that's floating in the air,

1253
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,260
when you have so many quanta, so many excitations,

1254
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,100
then you tend to couple more strongly

1255
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:38,100
to this, well, decoherence, right?

1256
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,260
Whatever that is precisely in itself.

1257
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,780
And you tend to move already in the limit of where

1258
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,700
a lot of the quantum nature tends to seem to get erased

1259
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,180
or washed out in a sense.

1260
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,460
At that stage though, it's still purely quantum system.

1261
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,100
You could reverse and undo the measurement

1262
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,380
in the sense of taking that information

1263
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,380
because you're keeping track of it

1264
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,020
and sort of feed it back into the system.

1265
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,140
You still have all those degrees of freedom.

1266
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,220
And then after that following amplifier

1267
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,740
that comes after the cavity,

1268
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,740
then we kind of don't know where to draw that Heisenberg cut.

1269
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,980
In terms of the empirical experimental world,

1270
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,620
that's roughly as far as our models are able to get us.

1271
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,940
After that, we don't really have an equation or model

1272
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,980
we could write down that we're currently able to say,

1273
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,940
oh, now it's quantum.

1274
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,940
So empirically we see that, okay, it occurs somewhere there,

1275
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,020
is that a limitation of our ability to express it or not?

1276
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,020
So-

1277
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,020
Is this, I mean, it sounds to me as though

1278
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,340
this is again really about information,

1279
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,060
but in this notion of a cut,

1280
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,220
it sounds as though what that really means

1281
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,140
is where do you decide the point comes

1282
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,020
where you're not going to any longer

1283
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,580
or you can't any longer,

1284
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,740
gather pretty much comprehensive information

1285
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,740
about everything in the system.

1286
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,860
And once you relinquish that attempt,

1287
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,180
that's where the cut happens

1288
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,940
because you have imperfect information.

1289
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,860
Is that the right way to look at it?

1290
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,060
I think that is definitely a practical way

1291
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,540
to look at it that seems to work in practice.

1292
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,700
Is it the ultimate solution?

1293
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,860
I couldn't say.

1294
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,740
And sorry, I'm gonna go on.

1295
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,620
No, no, no, that's fine.

1296
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,220
That's just what occurred to me

1297
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,980
as you were describing the experiment.

1298
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,340
It seemed to be a matter of,

1299
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,700
well, how far out can you keep going in your apparatus

1300
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,500
and still retain the ability to monitor

1301
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,820
more or less everything that is happening

1302
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,140
at the sort of quantum level?

1303
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:45,980
Exactly.

1304
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:50,220
And we've been able to now push that further and further out

1305
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,860
and see that as you kind of climb up

1306
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,420
the matresca dollar, the chain of nestedness here,

1307
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:00,220
that you can move that Heisenberg cut quite far out

1308
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,900
and still model things.

1309
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:02,980
But at the end of the day,

1310
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,620
we've simply moved the cut further away,

1311
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,540
but we still have the cut.

1312
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,300
So is it a fundamental cut or not?

1313
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,380
I think that's an open question as far as it could tell.

1314
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,540
But another way that people think about,

1315
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,620
and I think we'd mentioned this,

1316
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:22,020
is that you could say that to the contrary,

1317
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:27,020
I think of what Bell had said.

1318
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,660
John Bell, I think you said had band measurement

1319
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,780
is a bad word.

1320
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,820
I think to more experimentally-minded people like myself,

1321
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,020
measurement is actually probably the essence

1322
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,860
of the whole theory.

1323
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,820
It's what we do, it's what we model,

1324
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,580
it's what we describe.

1325
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,980
That should actually be the core of it.

1326
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,140
So perhaps we should start,

1327
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,460
not with Schrodinger's equation,

1328
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,100
which describes what the state of the system

1329
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,580
if that even exists in of itself out there is,

1330
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,140
but maybe we should start with a description

1331
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,980
of the measurement.

1332
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,780
So I could say closer along the lines of Q2T.

1333
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,500
You could take that interaction between

1334
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,780
what you call a system and the actual measurement,

1335
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,100
because the problem is that in Schrodinger's equation,

1336
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,780
a measurement is completely absent.

1337
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,580
So Schrodinger's equation is linear, deterministic.

1338
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,260
There's nothing really weird in Schrodinger's equation,

1339
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,620
in a sense, the randomness,

1340
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,180
if you want the weirdness of the quantum randomness

1341
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,060
that comes into play,

1342
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,580
only occurs at the stage of the actual measurement

1343
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,500
when you have von Neumann's postulate and so on.

1344
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,180
So it's that process that I think you so nicely pointed out

1345
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,420
is what, now the field of physics is being able

1346
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,180
to kind of open the hood on and describe.

1347
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,420
But I think we've maybe said a lot on this.

1348
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,460
Perhaps if you'd like to share this question

1349
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,100
from the audience here on,

1350
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,460
and you'd let me know if you'd like to take this one,

1351
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,340
if you could, could you share your thoughts

1352
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:53,900
on Maxwell's demon and perhaps how that relates

1353
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,900
to all of quantum mechanics in the sense that you have,

1354
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,900
I'm kind of reading into the question here,

1355
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,460
when it comes to know ability and trying to kind of sift

1356
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:15,460
or parse and sort of beat the laws of thermodynamics

1357
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,780
in a way, but now at the level of quantum.

1358
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,820
So perhaps if you'd like to offer some thoughts on that.

1359
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,900
Yeah, yeah, well, very timely.

1360
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,020
I've just been writing about Maxwell's demon today

1361
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,460
and have done previously.

1362
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:33,460
And everything that is discussed within the context

1363
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,980
of Maxwell's demon is classical,

1364
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,340
although there is a quantum Maxwell's demon as well,

1365
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,700
there is a quantum version.

1366
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,100
But, you know, classically, again,

1367
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:49,460
it illustrates how so much seems to come down

1368
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,460
to information, the quest of information.

1369
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,460
So, and in essence, what Maxwell's demon tells us

1370
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,180
is that information itself is a kind of resource

1371
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,620
that we can use to do stuff with,

1372
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,020
which I just find extraordinary.

1373
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,820
I mean, it may be that not everyone knows

1374
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,420
what Maxwell's demon is, so that, you know,

1375
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,140
very, very briefly, it's a way,

1376
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,460
it was a way that James Clark Maxwell in 1867

1377
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,220
suggested of subverting the second law of thermodynamics.

1378
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:25,180
The second law says, you can express it in many ways.

1379
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,500
I mean, the simplest is just that heat always flows

1380
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,000
from hot to cold and never the other way around.

1381
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
But what it also implies is that there's no,

1382
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,200
you can never get energy for free.

1383
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,320
You can't, there's no perpetual motion.

1384
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:47,120
That any system that does work,

1385
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,920
it's always, some energy is always going to be wasted

1386
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,600
and lost as sort of random motions to the system

1387
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,320
as entropy, in fact.

1388
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,840
So the entropy of the universe always increases.

1389
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,080
And Maxwell didn't like this partly for religious reasons.

1390
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,640
And so he came up with this idea of a little demon

1391
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,560
that could actually reverse this

1392
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,280
by having a trapdoor between two compartments

1393
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,880
with gas in them, both with gas in them.

1394
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,200
Gas starts at the same temperature in both.

1395
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,480
But the hotter molecules are the ones

1396
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,160
that are moving faster in the gas.

1397
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,920
So the molecule, the demon looks at the molecules

1398
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,720
and sees if a fast molecule is approaching

1399
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,480
from one direction, he opens a trapdoor and lets it through.

1400
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,680
If a cold molecule is approaching

1401
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,200
from the other direction, he opens it and lets it through.

1402
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,760
And so all the hot ones go one way

1403
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,960
or the cold ones go the other.

1404
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,320
And he ends up with hot gas on one side,

1405
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,880
cold gas on the other, which is basically then

1406
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,560
there's a thermal gradient that you can tap

1407
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,880
in as some sort of power source to do some useful work.

1408
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,320
So you've got energy essentially from nothing,

1409
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,040
from just an ordinary gas.

1410
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,400
So for a long time, people figured,

1411
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,720
there must be something wrong with this.

1412
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,240
How can it subvert the second law?

1413
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,800
And it turns out that the answer is it can't

1414
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,040
because of information.

1415
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,000
And in this case, it's the information

1416
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,640
that is recorded in the demon's mind,

1417
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,000
that every, you know, it has to be gathering information

1418
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,920
about those gas particles in order to do what it does.

1419
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,840
And eventually that information, its mind is finite

1420
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,560
and it has to erase that information.

1421
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,080
Otherwise it's just too full and it can't do anymore.

1422
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,720
And erasing that information costs energy.

1423
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,080
And in effect, you get back all the energy

1424
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,120
that you thought you'd got from the operation of a demon.

1425
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,960
So there's, you know, you still don't get anything for free,

1426
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,880
any energy for free.

1427
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,280
So this is about information.

1428
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,680
And people have realized that actually what this means

1429
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,880
is that what looks to be sort of randomness,

1430
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,000
statistical randomness, you know, at one level,

1431
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,160
if you can zero in and get detailed information

1432
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,720
about what is going on, then you can use that information

1433
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,480
to mine the sort of random fluctuations in there

1434
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,440
and get energy out.

1435
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,560
And there have been experiments recently

1436
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,440
that have shown this, that have actually shown

1437
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,640
that you can do work on an object.

1438
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,640
In this case, it was sort of raising up

1439
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,520
a tiny little particle that was sort of floating about

1440
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,680
in a liquid, if I remember rightly,

1441
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,520
by making observations on it,

1442
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,640
gathering information about its movements

1443
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,900
and using that in some clever way,

1444
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,100
you can actually do work and raise it up against gravity.

1445
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,140
So information becomes a resource.

1446
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,140
So, you know, again, there's this fundamental idea

1447
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,580
and then the quantum version of it,

1448
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,100
which I won't go into, you know,

1449
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,620
is just sort of enacting that same idea

1450
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,620
in terms of quantum information.

1451
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:44,020
So it's really interesting how, you know, yet again,

1452
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,820
so many ideas, fundamental ideas in physics,

1453
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:50,460
but we also see it happening, of course, in biology,

1454
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,820
are coming down to this question of what information is,

1455
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:58,060
how it is embodied, how it can be used and manipulated,

1456
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:02,220
and how it can become a resource that we can exploit.

1457
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,980
Thank you, Phil.

1458
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,300
That's wonderful.

1459
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,140
I see that we are, we have a few more questions.

1460
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,660
I won't be able to get to all of them

1461
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,140
since I see we're about 15 minutes over,

1462
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,420
but perhaps let's take one more final question

1463
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,380
from Pranav here.

1464
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:22,940
If, of course, Phil, you would be happy to share with us

1465
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,900
on, you know, how did you decide to go into physics?

1466
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,340
And then if you could tell us a little bit about your transition

1467
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,860
into becoming a science writer and editor,

1468
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,660
I think it seems like there's interest from the audience

1469
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,980
if you'd like to share with us.

1470
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,540
Well, talk about random walks.

1471
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,140
I mean, this was certainly one of them

1472
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,100
because I began my first degree was in chemistry

1473
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,180
and it was at Oxford where the final year

1474
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,980
you have to do a research year, which was fantastic.

1475
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,220
It was by far my favorite part of the course.

1476
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,860
And I did it on, in physical chemistry,

1477
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,380
on the, actually the quantum mechanical behavior

1478
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,460
of molecules absorbed on surfaces,

1479
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,340
which is right at the sort of borderline, really,

1480
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,300
of physics and chemistry.

1481
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,340
And so when I came to do a PhD,

1482
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,020
I just so happened that I ended up in a physics department

1483
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,380
looking at similar stuff, condensed matter

1484
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:19,380
and behavior of objects and fluids at surfaces.

1485
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,300
And so that brought me into physics,

1486
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,260
but I figured at the end of that,

1487
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,180
this was going back a long way, I can tell you,

1488
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,020
that unlike most people, I'd actually enjoyed writing up

1489
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,180
my thesis and I enjoyed writing the papers

1490
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,900
that came out of this, out of the PhD.

1491
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,460
And so I thought, well, you know,

1492
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,500
I'd never thought about this before.

1493
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,780
I'd always enjoyed writing,

1494
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,420
but I'd never thought about combining my enjoyment

1495
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,340
of writing with science, but you can.

1496
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:49,700
And I decided I'd see if I could do that in science editing.

1497
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,380
And I was very lucky that just at the right moment,

1498
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,060
a place came up at nature, which in those days,

1499
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,660
this was the late 1980s, was just a journal.

1500
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,860
It wasn't this big publishing empire.

1501
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,820
It was just a single journal in a little office,

1502
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,540
a crammed office, you know, piled with paper.

1503
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,180
And I got a job there as an editor of physical sciences

1504
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,780
and had stayed there for a long time.

1505
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,540
It was a fantastic place to work.

1506
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,580
It meant I got exposed to all areas of science.

1507
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,740
It was a very, very steep learning curve.

1508
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,980
And it also opened up other opportunities

1509
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,420
to do writing for newspapers and so on.

1510
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,060
And eventually I decided, maybe I'll write a book.

1511
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,900
And I did.

1512
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,380
And it was an awful experience in the sense

1513
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,260
that I was working full-time at nature,

1514
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:32,620
which was already, you know, working,

1515
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,620
it was already an intense job.

1516
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,380
So I figured I don't want to do that again,

1517
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,380
but I want to write more.

1518
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,740
And I gradually became more and more part-time at nature

1519
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,060
until I finally stepped down.

1520
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,020
I forget when it was,

1521
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,740
but it was probably about 20 years ago now.

1522
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,940
I stepped away from nature

1523
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,260
and I'd still write for them regularly as a freelancer,

1524
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,980
but I became completely freelance.

1525
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,140
And now I split my time writing,

1526
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,020
I guess pretty much 50-50 between writing books,

1527
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,740
generally on scientific subjects,

1528
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:03,580
often about how science interacts with the wider culture

1529
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,900
and writing scientific journalism.

1530
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,780
Thank you, Phil.

1531
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,020
That's an inspiring story.

1532
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:17,220
I think with that, I'll take maybe any final words

1533
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,140
you'd like to share with us

1534
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,420
before we thank the audience and yourself

1535
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,820
for joining us here today.

1536
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,020
Well, well, just to thank you again,

1537
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:32,300
Zlacko, for inviting me to give this talk.

1538
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,620
It was a great fun.

1539
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,180
It's always been a lot of fun having any interactions

1540
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,940
with IBM generally

1541
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:43,940
and with the IBM quantum computing efforts in particular.

1542
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,980
So it's very nice to be able to sustain that relationship.

1543
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,980
And I'm always fascinated to see where quantum computing

1544
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,740
and IBM and quantum technologies at IBM

1545
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,220
have advanced to next.

1546
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,460
So keep me in the loop about that.

1547
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,300
Wonderful.

1548
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,620
And I think we all look forward to

1549
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,340
rereading many more books and articles from you, Phil.

1550
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,220
This was an absolute delight.

1551
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,780
Thank you everyone for tuning in today.

1552
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,740
I still see we have over 130 folks tuned in,

1553
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,020
20 minutes over time.

1554
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,900
So I appreciate your time.

1555
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,740
Thank you very much.

1556
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,700
This talk will stay recorded and live

1557
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,900
on the Kisken YouTube channel.

1558
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,700
So feel free to subscribe to hear about future updates.

1559
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,900
Thank you, Phil, for taking our invitation.

1560
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,100
It has been a real privilege and pleasure

1561
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,980
to have you here today.

1562
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,920
And thank you, everyone.

1563
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,420
We will see you next Friday at noon Eastern time.

1564
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:40,900
Thank you.
