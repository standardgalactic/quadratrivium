00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,820
Good day, I'm Norman Wabiger and today is a very exciting video for me because it's

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,020
a combination of quite some years of interrupted thought.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,640
So it's a point of view towards arithmetic and in fact algebra, which is based firmly

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,960
on a data structure point of view.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,240
But it's not sets, it's rather multisets.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,040
So what I'm proposing to do here today is to create a new framework for arithmetic with

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,120
natural numbers, first of all, and then with polynomials, and then we'll see that we'll

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,120
be able to extend this arithmetic beyond to more complicated things.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,400
And so we're going to end up with a vision of arithmetic in algebra, which is perhaps

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,000
somewhat unfamiliar to you and seems to extend in vast new directions.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,600
So it's really interesting and if you're interested in exploring, this is a great topic

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,120
for thinking about and exploring.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,800
It turns out that this point of view that I'm giving you is actually quite parallel

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,520
in many ways to what happened in the early days of set theory, when set theory was being

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,160
used to try to create a structure for the foundations of mathematics.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,680
And the empty set played a very important role then, as it does for us now.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,680
But the critical difference is that we are moving away from sets to a more general approach

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
to data structures.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,560
So I talk a lot about the LOMS system, representing lists, ordered sets, multisets and sets.

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,560
So for me, sets are just one of these four basic types of data structures.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,480
And while a computer scientist is going to be leaning towards lists as fundamental objects

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,960
and that's fine, for us we're going to be thinking about the multisets as an unappreciated

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,200
kind of framework for thinking about mathematics, which has a lot of potential and a lot of

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,160
power.

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,440
And in some ways it's sort of unfortunate that the history of mathematics circumvented multisets

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,400
and focused all the attention on sets.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,080
So in case you haven't watched a lot of my videos, the idea that mathematics is based

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,560
on set theory is, in my view, a complete distortion of what's really happening.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,800
So we need to have a much more broader point of view and along with that we need to be

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
much more solid and we need to be much more explicit.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
We need to focus on what we can actually write down.

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,520
So forget about philosophical pronouncements about what happens when you go to infinity

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,360
or do an infinite number of things which you can't actually do.

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,400
So we're going to be always looking to avoiding that kind of talking, which is essentially

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
a kind of a vacuous talking, not supported by explicit computation.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,960
So real number arithmetic is a fantasy as far as I'm concerned.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Fundamental theorem of algebra is just wishful dreaming, you could evidence it yourself,

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,840
by factoring x to the 7 plus x minus 3 into quadratic and linear factors.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,440
Just do it or admit that you can't do it and you'll see that the fundamental theorem

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,200
of algebra is not really true.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,480
So there's all kinds of really serious problems with the foundations of mathematics, as I of

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,320
course talk about very often in this series.

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,720
But today I want to make a start at another kind of approach, which is in some sense parallel

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,920
to things that I've done already, I've talked a lot about marks, even from the early days

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
of this series, marks and anti-marks and so on.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,560
So this is another point of view that's sort of parallel, sort of competing, has a lot

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,120
of overlap, but is a little bit different.

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,360
I would like to say also, first of all, a big thank you to my Patreon supporters.

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,120
And in particular, I benefited by having some reactions to a previous video that I posted

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
in this direction.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,720
My Patreon supporters, especially Lucas Lufaro, gave some interesting suggestions and encouragement.

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,640
So big shout out to all of my Patreon supporters.

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,760
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to use this data structure point of

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,240
view to get a new framework for arithmetic and then ultimately algebra and everything's

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
based on multisets.

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
And what is a multiset?

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:37,200
It's a way of collecting things in an unordered fashion where repetitions are allowed.

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,760
And I like to think of this as like boxes.

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,280
This is really box theory.

60
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,600
So here is a multiset, okay, it's a container, okay?

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,440
I can open up the container, see what has in it, okay?

62
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Oh, look, there's a few things in it.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,520
There's this plug, there's a couple of markers.

64
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,480
These two markers are pretty well the same, these two red ones.

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,320
So duplicates are allowed, okay?

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,480
And then there's this other thing.

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
What is this?

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,240
Well, actually, this is another container, okay?

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Here's another little container.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
It's a little plastic container that has a sand disk drive inside.

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
So it's actually, this is like a little box inside this bigger box.

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,160
And that's a key point, right, that we can think about boxes or collections or multisets

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,880
of multisets, of multisets, et cetera, okay?

74
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,920
And the containment relations between these boxes or multisets becomes really interesting.

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,880
Okay, so we start off at a very simple level by considering not something complicated like

76
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,520
this, but something rather simpler like this.

77
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
An empty box, okay?

78
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,520
An empty box or an empty multiset has the potential to put lots of stuff in there, but

79
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
currently there's nothing in it.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,160
This is going to be our fundamental mathematical object.

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,440
It's the starting point of our mathematics, okay?

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,720
So we're going to denote it by a pair of brackets with nothing inside.

83
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,960
So that's the empty set, or for us better, the empty M set because it has the potential

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,200
of putting lots of things inside it.

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,960
We'll give it a name, we'll call it zero.

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,440
And sometimes in diagrams, we'll represent it by a box, a square like this or a rectangle

87
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
with the possibility of putting various stuff in there.

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,560
So this object just by itself is already a type.

89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,280
We can say we have a type of object, zero type.

90
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,840
There's only one object that has this type, the empty set or the empty M set or zero.

91
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,440
So this is going to be our starting point.

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,320
And in some sense, we're just going to use this thing over and over again and put boxes

93
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,840
inside other boxes to create arithmetic and algebra.

94
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,200
And we'll be able to go quite far just in this one lecture as you will see.

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,160
So even if you're very used to arithmetic and algebra, you're going to be introduced

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,880
to some exciting new things in this video.

97
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay, so the next step up, natural numbers.

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,040
So a natural number is an M set of zeros.

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,000
The type of natural number denoted NAT, that's the type.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,240
Here's some examples.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
Here's an M set of zeros.

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
Does it have any zeros in it?

103
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,520
Well, it has no zeros in it.

104
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,760
But we still consider an empty set of zeros to be an M set of zeros.

105
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
That's an important point.

106
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
Let me just talk a little bit about that.

107
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,480
Okay, so here is our, as an M set, okay, currently it has some M set of markers, okay, an M set

108
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
of markers.

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,120
If I take one of these markers out, it's still an M set of markers.

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,040
If I take another marker out, well, it's still an M set of markers.

111
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,800
It happens to be the empty M set of markers.

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,360
So the empty M set is actually, or zero, is actually a very flexible object.

113
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,200
But in particular, it is also a natural number for us.

114
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,600
So this new type of object includes the former type zero.

115
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,080
Okay, then we give these things some names, the obvious ones.

116
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:49,160
So the set or M set with just a single zero in it will be called one, the M set consisting

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,600
of zero and zero will be called two, and here is three, and so on and so forth.

118
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,600
And in diagrams, if we wanted to represent this another way, maybe simpler for primary

119
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,200
school kids, we could maybe use some other symbol, maybe like small circles to represent

120
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
zero.

121
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,760
So what we usually call 13 then could be illustrated to a primary school student by a box, or in

122
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,840
this case, a rectangle with 13 little circles.

123
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,960
So these little circles are sort of playing the same role as the marks, the sort of elementary

124
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,040
marks that I've talked about earlier.

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,440
But there is a distinction because now these basic marks are not sort of elemental things.

126
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,800
They are actually empty M sets.

127
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:47,240
So we have a definition of what a natural number is, it's an M set of zeros.

128
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,480
So those of you who have watched a lot of my videos will know that I like to approach

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,640
polynomials and polynomial algebra in terms of what I call poly numbers, which are sort

130
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
of more data theoretic.

131
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,960
And I use these extensively even in the algebraic calculus course, these are workhorses for

132
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
doing algebra.

133
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,800
So here we're going to introduce them in a slightly different way, but it's really

134
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,120
the same thing as we've already been talking about, but just from a slightly different

135
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
point of view.

136
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,760
So what is a poly number in this context?

137
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,080
A poly number is an M set of natural numbers.

138
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:28,600
So we're going one step up further, starting with zero, the natural numbers, now poly numbers.

139
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,120
And the type, poly.

140
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
Okay, so here is a poly number.

141
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
Why?

142
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Well, it's an M set.

143
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
And what does it have in it?

144
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
One, one, two.

145
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,800
Those are all numbers.

146
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,800
So this is a multi-set of natural numbers.

147
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,840
It is therefore a poly number.

148
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,640
Here is another poly number.

149
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,640
And okay, admittedly, there could be a little bit of confusion depending on how much space

150
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
you think there is here.

151
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
This is meant to be 13.

152
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,960
Okay, these are sort of like the adjacent.

153
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:07,720
So this is a multi-set with just a single number in it, but in particular, it's a multi-set

154
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
of natural numbers.

155
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
So it's a poly number.

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,280
Here's another poly number because it's an M set of natural numbers because remember,

157
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,440
zero is a natural number.

158
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,280
The type of natural number included the former type of zero.

159
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,280
So zero is a natural number.

160
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:35,000
And in fact, this thing here is also a poly number because it's an M set of natural numbers.

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,520
How many natural numbers are in here?

162
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,120
Well, there aren't any, but it's still an empty M set of natural numbers.

163
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,400
So in particular, this thing, which is, of course, zero, is also a poly number.

164
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,720
Okay, so we have zero, the type zero contained in the type, not contained in the type of

165
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,600
poly.

166
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:02,760
And now something, one level further, which is a little bit fancier, okay?

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,840
And it will take some getting used to what this actually means, but it's sort of a natural

168
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
thing to do.

169
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,200
We sort of have this natural hierarchy now, we can just sort of keep on going.

170
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:23,080
So a multi-number is, by definition, an M set of poly numbers, an M set of poly numbers.

171
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
And there's the type, multi.

172
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,120
Okay, so look at this thing here, there's an M set.

173
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
What's this comma doing here?

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,040
Oh, no, so here's the M set, okay, here's the M set, yes, brackets here.

175
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
And what's inside this M set?

176
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,680
Well, it has this object.

177
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
What is this thing?

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,120
This is an M set with numbers in it, one, one, so an M set of natural numbers.

179
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,360
So this is a poly number.

180
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,000
Here's another poly number, these two happen to be equal.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,560
So this whole thing is an M set of poly numbers, so this is a multi-number.

182
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Here's another multi-number.

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,440
It's an M set which happens to have one poly number in it, the poly number consisting of

184
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,280
the multi-set 3, 5, and 11.

185
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,200
How about this thing?

186
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,160
Is this an M set of poly numbers?

187
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Well is zero a poly number?

188
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,320
Well, yes, we just said it was, so this thing is zero, and this we said is a poly number.

189
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,720
So this is a poly number, so this is an M set of poly numbers, in particular, it's

190
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,240
a multi-number.

191
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,760
What about the empty set?

192
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Well it's also an M set of poly numbers, the empty M set of poly numbers, so it also

193
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,520
includes, so again, multi includes poly, which includes net, which includes zero.

194
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:55,000
So we have this inclusion, inclusion of types, zero, net, poly, multi, each included in the

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,800
other in the following sense, in the sense that if you have an object of this type, then

196
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,040
it is automatically an object also of this type, therefore also an object of this type,

197
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
therefore also an object of this type.

198
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,000
And I hope that it's sort of obvious that the way we're going from one step here to

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,800
another is directly generalizable, okay, we could easily imagine just keeping on going.

200
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,920
Once we've defined multi numbers, we could define some higher objects, which are M sets

201
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,400
of multi numbers, okay, and later on we're going to be thinking about that kind of thing.

202
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:41,080
But already here we have a very rich framework for arithmetic and algebra, alright, but if

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:49,320
we want to have arithmetic, we need operations as well as numbers or objects.

204
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,160
So there is a fundamental operation in this world of multi sets, which is very very general

205
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,440
and it's addition, okay, so this is the beauty of the multi set framework, which distinguishes

206
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,840
it from the set theory world, in the set theory there is no such thing as addition of sets,

207
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,080
but in the multi set world there is, okay, it's crucial to understand and to appreciate

208
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,440
the importance of this operation, this very general operation.

209
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,800
So how do you add M sets?

210
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,720
You just combine their contents into a single M set.

211
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,440
Let me show you physically, okay, so here are two M sets, they're boxes, it is a little

212
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,920
box that has a sand disk in it, okay, and here, this one here, what does it have in

213
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
it?

214
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,480
Oh, it has two markers in it, okay, shall we add these two M sets?

215
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,120
Add this M set and this M set, I'm going to show you how to do that, okay, we need another

216
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,320
box, okay, hey, here's a box, okay, so what am I going to do?

217
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,760
I'm going to take this box and this box here, these two boxes, and I'm going to combine

218
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,760
their contents, I have to do this one at a time because I only have two hands, okay,

219
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,680
and there's the sand disk, that's also going in there, okay, there are the original boxes,

220
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:26,880
I don't need them, because I've put everything, because I've put everything in this new box,

221
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,840
and so there, I hope you can see, there's our new box, it's got the sand disk in it,

222
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:42,800
there it is there, and it has our two markers, okay, that's how you add M sets.

223
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,720
Let's have a look at some examples with the kinds of objects we've been talking about,

224
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:55,640
okay, so here we have some objects, okay, and notice that in this case I actually have three

225
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,280
things, okay, and what are these things, well these are, these things are what, well this is a,

226
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,320
this is a poly number because it's a multi set of natural numbers, here's another poly number,

227
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,520
so this is here, this thing here is a multi number, here's another multi number, here's

228
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,640
another multi number, but in particular these are M sets, so we don't require that we just

229
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,840
have two M sets, we could do this with more than two M sets, we could have several M sets and add

230
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,320
them at the same time just by dumping all their contents into a box, happily things are unordered

231
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,840
and repetitions are allowed, so there's no need to fuss around and remove duplicates as you would

232
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,880
if you were working with set theory, it's just absolutely simple-minded, you just dump them

233
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,360
on the box and there you go, but in particular it's not intrinsically a binary operation,

234
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,320
so how do you, how do you add these things, well you just get a bigger box represented by those

235
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,080
brackets there and you put the set three in, the M set four, the M set one, one, two, the M set four,

236
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:09,840
zero, okay, that's also a, that's a natural number, okay, so in particular it's a poly

237
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,760
number, so there's the zero and there four is there and the one, two, one is there, so we just

238
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,280
dumping the contents of these three M sets into a single M set, that's how you add them, okay,

239
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,160
the operations name will be the usual addition, so if we have, you know, if this is a, b and c then

240
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:34,040
the sum is denoted a plus b plus c and note again that it's not intrinsically a binary operation,

241
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,800
it applies to all M sets, it's not just that we can add numbers, right, we can have M sets of

242
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,880
anything in principle and we're still able to perform this addition operation, it's really

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:56,040
important that you digest the, the fundamental aspect of this operation, okay, this is something

244
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,640
that is so elementary but maybe has slipped by your consciousness because you're not used to

245
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,680
thinking about M sets as being fundamental, but it's a crucial erythmetical structure that's

246
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:19,480
actually working in the entire world of M sets, okay, so it's now easy observation that the natural

247
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:28,920
numbers are closed under addition, in fact one step below that the zero, the zero type is also

248
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:36,040
closed under addition, let me show you that, okay, so here is now an empty M set, I've dumped everything

249
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:44,360
previously out and here's another empty M set, okay, so suppose I wanted to add these two M sets,

250
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:52,520
well, I'm going to get myself another box, okay, and I'm going to dump the contents of this one

251
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,520
here and also dump the contents of this one here, okay, there I've done it, I've dumped all the

252
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,160
contents of the two boxes and you can see it's still empty, okay, so empty set plus empty set

253
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:13,400
equals empty set, so zero plus zero equals zero, so somewhat less obvious but still pretty obvious

254
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:21,400
is that if you have two natural numbers, so three plus four say, okay, there's a picture of three,

255
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,640
it's an M set which has three zeros in it, zero zero zero represented by these little circles

256
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,360
because it's a picture for primary school students, and here's a box representing four,

257
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,960
you dump them out into another box, well obviously you're going to get there's the first three and

258
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,320
there's the next four and you're going to get what we call seven, in terms of the more familiar

259
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,920
notation that we've been talking about, three is actually officially this thing here, okay,

260
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,400
the M set zero zero zero, four is the M set zero zero zero zero, we put them all in an M set,

261
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,920
so these guys go here and these guys say go here and then we can check that that's actually seven,

262
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:10,840
note that poly is also closed under addition, okay, here's a poly number because it's an M set

263
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,480
of natural numbers, here's another poly number, here's another poly number, here's another poly

264
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,280
number, if we add all four of them, dump the contents, dump the contents, dump the contents,

265
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:29,480
dump the contents, you get three, three, three, four, zero, seven, and this empty set doesn't

266
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:37,480
contribute, and this is another multi set of natural numbers, so it's another poly number,

267
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,480
so if we go up one level to multi numbers, we see that also it's closed under addition,

268
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,080
for example, here's a multi number, it's an M set of poly numbers, that's a poly number,

269
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,360
poly number, here's another M set of poly numbers, that's a poly number, that's a poly number,

270
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,800
that's a poly number, we add them, well obviously we get that one, that one, that one, that one,

271
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,480
that one, we get another M set of poly numbers, in other words, another multi number,

272
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:16,200
okay, so we have addition, now we want to go up a step, okay, and this really important step,

273
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,160
we're going to go from addition to multiplication, okay, and it's really important to watch carefully

274
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,760
what I do, it's like magic, okay, a very simple kind of magic, okay, we're going to create

275
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,440
multiplication out of addition, so how are we going to do that, so multiplication of M sets of M

276
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:42,600
sets, so strictly speaking in the M set world, you need M sets of M sets to make this work, okay,

277
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,720
as it turns out, all the things that we've been talking about are in fact M sets of M sets, so

278
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,160
strictly speaking, this is not really necessary, I just point this out that if you were working with

279
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,760
M sets with other kinds of objects, you really want to restrict yourself to M sets of M sets,

280
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,840
but this is not really a restriction in the world that we set up so far, okay, so to multiply

281
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:13,000
M sets, what you do is you form the M set of sums of elements, one from each M set,

282
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,520
so we're going to use addition to define multiplication, okay, so look carefully,

283
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:28,280
here is an M set, and we're going to assume that the contents A and B are themselves M sets,

284
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,720
and let me remind you that that is a condition that's automatically satisfied for all the

285
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:44,520
objects that we've been considering, here's another M set, all of its elements are also M sets,

286
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,200
so we're assuming that, okay, how are we going to multiply this M set with this M set, we're going

287
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,640
to take pairs in this case, because there's two of them that we're multiplying, pairs of elements

288
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,880
from this one with elements from this one, we're going to take this pair and we're going to add them,

289
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,440
in this case A plus X, we're going to form A plus X, this is an M set, that's an M set,

290
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,000
so A plus X makes sense, that's addition of M sets, this is another M set,

291
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,880
then we're going to take A and Y, we're going to add them, A plus Y, take A and Z, add them,

292
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:27,800
get A plus Z, take B and X, add them, get B plus X, take B and Y, add them, you get B plus Y,

293
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:35,400
take B and Z, add them, you get B plus Z, so we're getting another M set, which has

294
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:44,280
new M sets in it, these new M sets are created from the original two M sets by taking sums of

295
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:53,480
elements, one from each, that's how you multiply M sets, all right, let me illustrate

296
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,960
this multiplication at each of the levels, so at the zero level, zero times zero, what do we get?

297
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,280
Well we have to form an M set, which consists of what? Which consists of the sum of all entries

298
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,040
of this thing with entries of this thing, well there are no entries of this thing, there are no

299
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,560
entries of this thing, so there are no possible sums that we can make, so the result is empty,

300
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:25,720
fine, that's telling us that zero times zero equals zero, now let's go to natural numbers,

301
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,560
okay, which are M sets of zeros, so there's an M set of zeros, there's an M set of zeros,

302
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,240
so how are we going to multiply these two things? Well we're going to take all possible

303
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,440
combinations, entry here, entry here, or element here, element here, okay, and we're going to add

304
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,480
them, we can add them because the guys inside here are M sets, and so they can be added using M

305
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:58,680
set addition, okay so let's do that, so this, zero plus this zero, there it is there, this zero

306
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,160
plus this zero, there it is there, this zero plus this zero, there it is there, this zero plus this

307
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,200
zero. There it is there. This zero plus this zero. There it is there. This zero plus this zero.

308
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,680
There it is there. Have I done all the pairs? Yes, I've done all the pairs. Now we have to

309
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:19,000
evaluate these things. What is zero plus zero? Well, it's zero. So each of these is zero. So we

310
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,440
get zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. And in ordinary Hindu-Arabic notation, we've computed

311
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:39,320
that two times three is six. Okay, let's go to poly. Let's multiply poly numbers. So here's a

312
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,520
poly number. Here's another poly number. These are poly numbers because they're m sets of numbers.

313
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,360
That's a number. That's a number. Natural numbers. Here's another m set of natural numbers. So to

314
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:01,240
multiply them, we have to take pairs, combinations, and add them. So how do you add the number two

315
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,800
and the number one first pair? Well, you get three. And then two plus one is three. Two plus zero is

316
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,080
two. And then three plus one is four. Three plus one is four. Three plus zero is three. So we get

317
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,160
the m set three, three, two, four, four, three. It's another m set of natural numbers. So that's

318
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:27,160
another poly number. Poly number times poly number equals poly number. And let me show you that this

319
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:36,280
is not restricted to having two. We can multiply, in principle, a number of different m sets. So

320
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,720
now I'm going to multiply three m sets together sort of at the same time. So the m set zero, three,

321
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,320
the m set one, four, the m set two, seven. These are all poly numbers because they're m sets of

322
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,840
natural numbers. So what do we need to do? Well, we need to take combinations where we're taking

323
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,600
one element of each one of these. So let's start with the zero, one, and two. What do I have to

324
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,960
do with those things? I have to add them. They're m sets. So the addition of m sets of these three

325
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,160
is well defined. I don't have to specify which order we're doing it in. There's three things,

326
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:19,320
we're just dumping them out. So zero plus one plus two is three. Zero plus one plus seven is eight.

327
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:27,240
Zero plus four plus two is six. Zero plus four plus seven is 11. Okay, I have to keep track. I'm

328
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,480
going to pick all possible combinations. How about three plus one plus two? That's six. Three plus one

329
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,760
plus seven, that's 11. Three plus four plus two is nine, and three plus four plus seven is a 14.

330
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:52,200
So we've multiplied these three poly numbers to get this poly number. Okay, now one more step up to

331
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,760
the multi numbers. So let's do this. Okay, so here's a multi number. Why is this a multi number?

332
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,040
Well, because this thing inside it is a poly number, and here's another poly number.

333
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,960
It's a multi set of natural numbers, therefore a poly number. Here's another m set of natural

334
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,360
numbers, therefore a poly number. So this is an m set of poly numbers. Here's another m set of

335
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:22,280
poly numbers. Note that two is indeed a poly number, because we've seen that natural numbers are

336
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:29,720
included in the type of poly numbers. So what do we have to do? Well, we have to take all possible

337
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,920
pairs, elements here, elements here, and we have to add them. Okay, so let's take this element here,

338
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,040
and this element here. These are m sets. There's an m set. There's an m set. How do you add them?

339
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,200
Well, we just dump the contents into a box. So we get zero, zero, two, one, one. There,

340
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,200
that's the result of adding this m set and this m set. How about this m set with two? Okay, well,

341
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:02,120
we get zero, zero, two. What is this thing as an m set? Well, two is really the m set zero, zero,

342
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,760
if we want it right that way. So we could put another two zeros there. Now we've added two.

343
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,680
How about this thing and this thing? Well, then we're going to get, I better write smaller,

344
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:21,960
zero, zero, two, nine. Okay, and now this one plus this one, that's three, eight, one, one.

345
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:29,000
And we also need down here, okay, three, eight, we're adding two. So we have to add two zeros.

346
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:37,880
And finally, this one here, three, eight, nine. Okay, and that's the end. Oh, so there's the big

347
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:49,080
bracket at the end. So we're getting one, two, three, four, five, six, just to check, okay,

348
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,280
six different constituents or elements, that makes sense because this one has two elements,

349
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,640
this one has three elements, so we should end up getting six elements. So we can do multiplication

350
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,680
in each one of these types. Okay, so a little bit of thought and just doing some calculations

351
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:11,640
along the lines I've showed you reveals that each one of these type domains, zero inside

352
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,520
NAT, inside poly, inside multi, is closed under both addition and multiplication.

353
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,840
And moreover, the usual arithmetic laws that we're familiar with hold.

354
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:34,440
Namely, we have commutative law, A plus B equals B plus A. A times B equals B times A.

355
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,400
A plus B plus C equals A plus B plus C, that's an associate of law for addition,

356
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:52,760
and here's an associate of law for multiplication. And distributive laws, A times B plus C equals A

357
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:01,480
times B plus A times C, where we use the usual convention that the multiplication takes precedence

358
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,680
over the addition. That means you have to do this product first and do this product also

359
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:13,400
before you add them together. And over here, A plus B times C is A times C plus B times C.

360
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,320
Okay, so it's a great exercise to check these and sort of convince yourself that these are

361
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:28,280
valid. And you see that it's a very general kind of arithmetic. It's not just arithmetic with numbers

362
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,480
that we're doing here. We're doing arithmetic in a broader context. All right, so I want to finish

363
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,120
the lecture by clarifying the meaning of poly. And since that's a term that I've already used

364
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,000
quite extensively, I want to connect with the former usage and convince you that these are

365
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,960
pretty well the same things, although there is a slight difference. So we can do that by

366
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,360
concentrating on the sort of simplest object when we're going from natural numbers to poly

367
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,200
numbers, which is not itself a natural number. So if we take the set consisting of zero,

368
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:09,240
that's a poly number, but it's also a natural number, that's one. Okay, so the simplest poly

369
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,760
number, which is not a natural number is this one. It's the M set consisting of a single one.

370
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,720
Let's call it alpha. Okay, let's do a bit of arithmetic with this alpha. Suppose we look

371
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,800
at alpha plus alpha, okay, which we could call two alpha. What is that? Well, you have to take

372
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,280
this thing and you have to add it with itself. So you have to get a box and you dump one one in

373
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,720
and then you dump another one in. Well, you're going to have two ones in the box. So it's going to

374
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:46,040
look like this. Okay, what about three alphas? Well, dump one in, dump another one in, dump

375
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:52,840
another one in, you're going to get this thing here and so on. So multiples of alpha, it's clear

376
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,480
sort of what they correspond to. How about multiplication? Suppose we take alpha times alpha.

377
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,800
So there's alpha, there's alpha. How do you multiply them? Well, you have to take the sums

378
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,320
of corresponding elements, one from each one of these. Well, there's only one element here and

379
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:18,680
one element here. So you have to take one plus one and one plus one addition natural numbers,

380
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:25,320
that's two. So you're going to get the M set consisting of a single two. And if you take alpha

381
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,480
cubed, that means you're going to multiply this thing by another one of these, then you're going

382
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,680
to have to compute one plus two, which is three. So you can get the M set consisting of three.

383
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,320
So powers of alpha are sort of naturally corresponding to those sort of singleton

384
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:48,520
M sets that just contain a single natural number. And so that allows us to interpret

385
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:56,440
some more complicated poly like this. Okay, so here's a more complicated poly number. It's an M set

386
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,240
of natural numbers, 0011123333. So to make sense of this, to organize it a little bit,

387
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:10,440
we can write it as a sum. So this is the sum of the M set 00 and the M set 111 and the M set 2

388
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,640
and the M set 333333. Okay, what is this thing? This is the number two. What is this thing? Well,

389
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,840
this is what we've said is three alpha. What is this thing? That's what we've said is alpha squared.

390
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:30,600
And what is this thing? Well, alpha cubed was three. So two alpha cubed will be this plus itself

391
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:41,560
will be the M set 33. And having four of them, that'll be four alpha cubed. So this is a representation

392
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,760
of what in ordinary algebra, we would write as the polynomial two plus three alpha plus alpha

393
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:53,000
squared plus four alpha cubed. And in my preferred poly number language that I've talked a lot about

394
00:35:53,080 --> 00:36:00,760
in other videos, I would represent this with a list, a vertical list like this, okay,

395
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:09,560
with the coefficients two, three, one, four. So we're seeing that this sort of former definition

396
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:17,240
of a poly agrees with this sort of new definition of a poly. They're really the same. But what's

397
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:25,240
the difference? The difference is that this is a list. Okay, this is a list. And this thing here

398
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:32,360
is of course an M set. And there's a crucial distinction between these two things. That's

399
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:38,520
really useful to appreciate. So remember when we were looking at polynomials or poly numbers like

400
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,680
this, there was a certain amount of ambiguity, because we could add a zero below here and we

401
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,200
agreed that that was going to be the same thing that did not change the poly number, we could add

402
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,160
in fact any number of zeros below, and that's not going to change the poly number, even though

403
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,560
officially as a list, it's kind of changing. There's a little bit of ambiguity there.

404
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,000
It's a general rule that when you have that kind of ambiguity, it's because it's because the list

405
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,280
that you're considering is really more fundamentally to be thought of as a, as a multiplicity list for

406
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,800
an M set. Okay, so this is an M set of zeros, ones, twos, and threes. And since the natural numbers

407
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:29,000
are naturally ordered, zero, one, two, three, we can represent such an M set or maybe make it more

408
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,840
concise by just counting how many each we have. We have two zeros, we have three ones, we have one,

409
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,640
two, and we have four threes. So this is a list that is the multiplicity list of this M set.

410
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:52,920
But I would like to suggest to you that actually, formally, officially, the M set is actually

411
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:03,400
more fundamental. It's at the heart of things. And now we see that this, this list object is really

412
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,720
just a secondary object that sort of makes it easier for us to represent this M set. But,

413
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,920
but a poly really is, is an M set of natural numbers.

414
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,600
Great, so we've accomplished a lot. Of course, a question that will be on your mind is, okay,

415
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,720
but what about these multi numbers? What's their significance? So I'm going to tell you about that

416
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:36,200
in the next video. And we're also moving towards an alternate view of this thing, which is even more

417
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,840
in spirit for computer scientists. So this topic is going to move really, really closely

418
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,480
to alignment with modern computer science, as we'll see.

419
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:55,640
Maybe mathematics will end up being a topic in computer science.

420
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:08,680
I'm Norman Wabaker. Thanks for listening.
