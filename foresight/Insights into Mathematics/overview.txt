1. **Poly vs. Poly Number**: A "poly" in the context of poly numbers is a representation of a polynomial using an ordered list of natural number coefficients, which can be thought of as a multiplicity list for an M set (a set of natural numbers).
   
2. **M Set Representation**: An M set represents a collection of natural numbers, where each number appears with a certain frequency or multiplicity. For example, the M set `{0, 1, 2, 3}` means one occurrence of zero, one occurrence of one, two occurrences of two, and three occurrences of three.

3. **Poly Number Ambiguity**: There is an ambiguity in poly numbers where you can add any number of zeros below without changing the poly number. This is because the list representing a poly number can be seen as a multiplicity list for a more fundamental M set.

4. **Multiplicity List**: The list of coefficients in a poly number is essentially the multiplicity list of an associated M set. For example, `[2, 3, 1, 4]` represents the multiplicities of zeros, ones, twos, and threes respectively in the M set.

5. **M Sets as Fundamental**: The M set is considered more fundamental than the poly number list representation because it directly represents a collection of natural numbers without the ambiguity that comes with the list representation.

6. **Connection to Computer Science**: The discussion on polys and M sets will become even more relevant in the context of computer science, particularly as we delve deeper into the subject. This connection is important for understanding how these concepts can be applied in computational theory and practice.

In summary, poly numbers are a way to represent polynomials using an ordered list of natural number coefficients, which can be interpreted as a multiplicity list for M sets. The concept of an M set is more fundamental than the list representation, and understanding both perspectives is crucial for appreciating the full scope of these mathematical structures, especially in relation to computer science applications.
