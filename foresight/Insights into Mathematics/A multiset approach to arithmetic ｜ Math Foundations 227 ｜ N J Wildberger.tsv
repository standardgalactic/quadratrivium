0	12820	Good day, I'm Norman Wabiger and today is a very exciting video for me because it's
12820	18020	a combination of quite some years of interrupted thought.
18020	24640	So it's a point of view towards arithmetic and in fact algebra, which is based firmly
24640	27960	on a data structure point of view.
27960	32240	But it's not sets, it's rather multisets.
32240	38040	So what I'm proposing to do here today is to create a new framework for arithmetic with
38040	43120	natural numbers, first of all, and then with polynomials, and then we'll see that we'll
43120	49120	be able to extend this arithmetic beyond to more complicated things.
49120	54400	And so we're going to end up with a vision of arithmetic in algebra, which is perhaps
54400	61000	somewhat unfamiliar to you and seems to extend in vast new directions.
61000	65600	So it's really interesting and if you're interested in exploring, this is a great topic
65600	69120	for thinking about and exploring.
69120	74800	It turns out that this point of view that I'm giving you is actually quite parallel
74800	79520	in many ways to what happened in the early days of set theory, when set theory was being
79520	84160	used to try to create a structure for the foundations of mathematics.
84160	89680	And the empty set played a very important role then, as it does for us now.
89680	94680	But the critical difference is that we are moving away from sets to a more general approach
94680	96680	to data structures.
96680	103560	So I talk a lot about the LOMS system, representing lists, ordered sets, multisets and sets.
103560	108560	So for me, sets are just one of these four basic types of data structures.
108600	113480	And while a computer scientist is going to be leaning towards lists as fundamental objects
113480	119960	and that's fine, for us we're going to be thinking about the multisets as an unappreciated
119960	125200	kind of framework for thinking about mathematics, which has a lot of potential and a lot of
125200	127160	power.
127160	132440	And in some ways it's sort of unfortunate that the history of mathematics circumvented multisets
132440	135400	and focused all the attention on sets.
135400	140080	So in case you haven't watched a lot of my videos, the idea that mathematics is based
140080	146560	on set theory is, in my view, a complete distortion of what's really happening.
146560	152800	So we need to have a much more broader point of view and along with that we need to be
152800	156400	much more solid and we need to be much more explicit.
156400	159680	We need to focus on what we can actually write down.
159680	164520	So forget about philosophical pronouncements about what happens when you go to infinity
164880	168360	or do an infinite number of things which you can't actually do.
168360	174400	So we're going to be always looking to avoiding that kind of talking, which is essentially
174400	180000	a kind of a vacuous talking, not supported by explicit computation.
180000	183960	So real number arithmetic is a fantasy as far as I'm concerned.
183960	189400	Fundamental theorem of algebra is just wishful dreaming, you could evidence it yourself,
189560	195840	by factoring x to the 7 plus x minus 3 into quadratic and linear factors.
195840	200440	Just do it or admit that you can't do it and you'll see that the fundamental theorem
200440	203200	of algebra is not really true.
203200	207480	So there's all kinds of really serious problems with the foundations of mathematics, as I of
207480	211320	course talk about very often in this series.
211320	217720	But today I want to make a start at another kind of approach, which is in some sense parallel
217720	221920	to things that I've done already, I've talked a lot about marks, even from the early days
221920	225440	of this series, marks and anti-marks and so on.
225440	230560	So this is another point of view that's sort of parallel, sort of competing, has a lot
230560	234120	of overlap, but is a little bit different.
234120	239360	I would like to say also, first of all, a big thank you to my Patreon supporters.
239360	245120	And in particular, I benefited by having some reactions to a previous video that I posted
245120	247000	in this direction.
247000	254720	My Patreon supporters, especially Lucas Lufaro, gave some interesting suggestions and encouragement.
254720	258640	So big shout out to all of my Patreon supporters.
258640	262760	Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to use this data structure point of
262760	266240	view to get a new framework for arithmetic and then ultimately algebra and everything's
266240	267240	based on multisets.
267240	269240	And what is a multiset?
269240	277200	It's a way of collecting things in an unordered fashion where repetitions are allowed.
277200	279760	And I like to think of this as like boxes.
279760	282280	This is really box theory.
282280	286600	So here is a multiset, okay, it's a container, okay?
286600	290440	I can open up the container, see what has in it, okay?
290440	293120	Oh, look, there's a few things in it.
293120	296520	There's this plug, there's a couple of markers.
296520	299480	These two markers are pretty well the same, these two red ones.
299480	302320	So duplicates are allowed, okay?
302320	303480	And then there's this other thing.
303480	304480	What is this?
304480	307240	Well, actually, this is another container, okay?
307240	308800	Here's another little container.
308800	313600	It's a little plastic container that has a sand disk drive inside.
313600	317840	So it's actually, this is like a little box inside this bigger box.
317840	325160	And that's a key point, right, that we can think about boxes or collections or multisets
325160	327880	of multisets, of multisets, et cetera, okay?
327880	333920	And the containment relations between these boxes or multisets becomes really interesting.
333920	341880	Okay, so we start off at a very simple level by considering not something complicated like
341880	347520	this, but something rather simpler like this.
347520	350080	An empty box, okay?
350080	355520	An empty box or an empty multiset has the potential to put lots of stuff in there, but
355520	357720	currently there's nothing in it.
357720	362160	This is going to be our fundamental mathematical object.
362160	367440	It's the starting point of our mathematics, okay?
367440	371720	So we're going to denote it by a pair of brackets with nothing inside.
371720	377960	So that's the empty set, or for us better, the empty M set because it has the potential
377960	380200	of putting lots of things inside it.
380200	385960	We'll give it a name, we'll call it zero.
385960	393440	And sometimes in diagrams, we'll represent it by a box, a square like this or a rectangle
393440	396800	with the possibility of putting various stuff in there.
396800	402560	So this object just by itself is already a type.
402560	406280	We can say we have a type of object, zero type.
407040	413840	There's only one object that has this type, the empty set or the empty M set or zero.
413840	416440	So this is going to be our starting point.
416440	423320	And in some sense, we're just going to use this thing over and over again and put boxes
423320	427840	inside other boxes to create arithmetic and algebra.
427840	432200	And we'll be able to go quite far just in this one lecture as you will see.
432200	437160	So even if you're very used to arithmetic and algebra, you're going to be introduced
437160	440880	to some exciting new things in this video.
440880	445600	Okay, so the next step up, natural numbers.
445600	453040	So a natural number is an M set of zeros.
453040	457000	The type of natural number denoted NAT, that's the type.
457000	460240	Here's some examples.
460240	461840	Here's an M set of zeros.
461840	464160	Does it have any zeros in it?
464160	466520	Well, it has no zeros in it.
466520	473760	But we still consider an empty set of zeros to be an M set of zeros.
473760	474760	That's an important point.
474760	476080	Let me just talk a little bit about that.
476080	483480	Okay, so here is our, as an M set, okay, currently it has some M set of markers, okay, an M set
483480	484480	of markers.
484480	490120	If I take one of these markers out, it's still an M set of markers.
490120	495040	If I take another marker out, well, it's still an M set of markers.
495040	500800	It happens to be the empty M set of markers.
500800	505360	So the empty M set is actually, or zero, is actually a very flexible object.
505360	511200	But in particular, it is also a natural number for us.
511200	516600	So this new type of object includes the former type zero.
516600	520080	Okay, then we give these things some names, the obvious ones.
520080	529160	So the set or M set with just a single zero in it will be called one, the M set consisting
529160	535600	of zero and zero will be called two, and here is three, and so on and so forth.
535600	540600	And in diagrams, if we wanted to represent this another way, maybe simpler for primary
540600	546200	school kids, we could maybe use some other symbol, maybe like small circles to represent
546200	547440	zero.
547440	553760	So what we usually call 13 then could be illustrated to a primary school student by a box, or in
553760	560840	this case, a rectangle with 13 little circles.
560840	565960	So these little circles are sort of playing the same role as the marks, the sort of elementary
565960	568040	marks that I've talked about earlier.
568040	574440	But there is a distinction because now these basic marks are not sort of elemental things.
574440	579800	They are actually empty M sets.
579800	587240	So we have a definition of what a natural number is, it's an M set of zeros.
587240	591480	So those of you who have watched a lot of my videos will know that I like to approach
591480	596640	polynomials and polynomial algebra in terms of what I call poly numbers, which are sort
596640	598480	of more data theoretic.
598480	602960	And I use these extensively even in the algebraic calculus course, these are workhorses for
602960	604280	doing algebra.
604280	608800	So here we're going to introduce them in a slightly different way, but it's really
608800	613120	the same thing as we've already been talking about, but just from a slightly different
613120	614120	point of view.
614120	616760	So what is a poly number in this context?
616760	621080	A poly number is an M set of natural numbers.
621080	628600	So we're going one step up further, starting with zero, the natural numbers, now poly numbers.
628600	631120	And the type, poly.
631120	634560	Okay, so here is a poly number.
634560	635560	Why?
635560	637120	Well, it's an M set.
637120	639120	And what does it have in it?
639120	640600	One, one, two.
640600	641800	Those are all numbers.
641800	645800	So this is a multi-set of natural numbers.
645800	647840	It is therefore a poly number.
647840	650640	Here is another poly number.
650640	654640	And okay, admittedly, there could be a little bit of confusion depending on how much space
654640	655640	you think there is here.
655640	657640	This is meant to be 13.
657640	659960	Okay, these are sort of like the adjacent.
659960	667720	So this is a multi-set with just a single number in it, but in particular, it's a multi-set
667720	668720	of natural numbers.
668720	670040	So it's a poly number.
670040	676280	Here's another poly number because it's an M set of natural numbers because remember,
676280	680440	zero is a natural number.
680440	684280	The type of natural number included the former type of zero.
684280	687280	So zero is a natural number.
687280	695000	And in fact, this thing here is also a poly number because it's an M set of natural numbers.
695000	696520	How many natural numbers are in here?
696520	701120	Well, there aren't any, but it's still an empty M set of natural numbers.
701120	706400	So in particular, this thing, which is, of course, zero, is also a poly number.
706400	712720	Okay, so we have zero, the type zero contained in the type, not contained in the type of
712720	714600	poly.
714600	722760	And now something, one level further, which is a little bit fancier, okay?
722760	727840	And it will take some getting used to what this actually means, but it's sort of a natural
727840	728840	thing to do.
728840	732200	We sort of have this natural hierarchy now, we can just sort of keep on going.
732200	743080	So a multi-number is, by definition, an M set of poly numbers, an M set of poly numbers.
743080	744680	And there's the type, multi.
744680	749120	Okay, so look at this thing here, there's an M set.
749120	750360	What's this comma doing here?
750360	755040	Oh, no, so here's the M set, okay, here's the M set, yes, brackets here.
755040	757320	And what's inside this M set?
757320	759680	Well, it has this object.
759680	761200	What is this thing?
761200	768120	This is an M set with numbers in it, one, one, so an M set of natural numbers.
768120	771360	So this is a poly number.
771360	775000	Here's another poly number, these two happen to be equal.
775000	782560	So this whole thing is an M set of poly numbers, so this is a multi-number.
782560	784560	Here's another multi-number.
784560	790440	It's an M set which happens to have one poly number in it, the poly number consisting of
790440	794280	the multi-set 3, 5, and 11.
794280	796200	How about this thing?
796200	798160	Is this an M set of poly numbers?
798160	800160	Well is zero a poly number?
800160	805320	Well, yes, we just said it was, so this thing is zero, and this we said is a poly number.
805320	809720	So this is a poly number, so this is an M set of poly numbers, in particular, it's
809720	812240	a multi-number.
812240	813760	What about the empty set?
813760	819760	Well it's also an M set of poly numbers, the empty M set of poly numbers, so it also
819760	826520	includes, so again, multi includes poly, which includes net, which includes zero.
826520	835000	So we have this inclusion, inclusion of types, zero, net, poly, multi, each included in the
835000	838800	other in the following sense, in the sense that if you have an object of this type, then
838800	845040	it is automatically an object also of this type, therefore also an object of this type,
845040	848040	therefore also an object of this type.
848040	853000	And I hope that it's sort of obvious that the way we're going from one step here to
853000	859800	another is directly generalizable, okay, we could easily imagine just keeping on going.
859800	866920	Once we've defined multi numbers, we could define some higher objects, which are M sets
866920	871400	of multi numbers, okay, and later on we're going to be thinking about that kind of thing.
871400	881080	But already here we have a very rich framework for arithmetic and algebra, alright, but if
881080	889320	we want to have arithmetic, we need operations as well as numbers or objects.
889320	896160	So there is a fundamental operation in this world of multi sets, which is very very general
896160	902440	and it's addition, okay, so this is the beauty of the multi set framework, which distinguishes
902440	907840	it from the set theory world, in the set theory there is no such thing as addition of sets,
907840	914080	but in the multi set world there is, okay, it's crucial to understand and to appreciate
914080	918440	the importance of this operation, this very general operation.
918440	921800	So how do you add M sets?
921800	926720	You just combine their contents into a single M set.
926720	933440	Let me show you physically, okay, so here are two M sets, they're boxes, it is a little
933440	940920	box that has a sand disk in it, okay, and here, this one here, what does it have in
940920	941920	it?
941920	949480	Oh, it has two markers in it, okay, shall we add these two M sets?
949480	953120	Add this M set and this M set, I'm going to show you how to do that, okay, we need another
953120	958320	box, okay, hey, here's a box, okay, so what am I going to do?
958320	965760	I'm going to take this box and this box here, these two boxes, and I'm going to combine
965760	971760	their contents, I have to do this one at a time because I only have two hands, okay,
971760	976680	and there's the sand disk, that's also going in there, okay, there are the original boxes,
976680	986880	I don't need them, because I've put everything, because I've put everything in this new box,
986880	991840	and so there, I hope you can see, there's our new box, it's got the sand disk in it,
991840	1002800	there it is there, and it has our two markers, okay, that's how you add M sets.
1002800	1007720	Let's have a look at some examples with the kinds of objects we've been talking about,
1007720	1015640	okay, so here we have some objects, okay, and notice that in this case I actually have three
1015680	1023280	things, okay, and what are these things, well these are, these things are what, well this is a,
1023280	1029320	this is a poly number because it's a multi set of natural numbers, here's another poly number,
1029320	1033520	so this is here, this thing here is a multi number, here's another multi number, here's
1033520	1040640	another multi number, but in particular these are M sets, so we don't require that we just
1040640	1045840	have two M sets, we could do this with more than two M sets, we could have several M sets and add
1045840	1052320	them at the same time just by dumping all their contents into a box, happily things are unordered
1052320	1058840	and repetitions are allowed, so there's no need to fuss around and remove duplicates as you would
1058840	1063880	if you were working with set theory, it's just absolutely simple-minded, you just dump them
1063880	1069360	on the box and there you go, but in particular it's not intrinsically a binary operation,
1069360	1074320	so how do you, how do you add these things, well you just get a bigger box represented by those
1074320	1081080	brackets there and you put the set three in, the M set four, the M set one, one, two, the M set four,
1081080	1089840	zero, okay, that's also a, that's a natural number, okay, so in particular it's a poly
1089840	1094760	number, so there's the zero and there four is there and the one, two, one is there, so we just
1095040	1101280	dumping the contents of these three M sets into a single M set, that's how you add them, okay,
1101280	1107160	the operations name will be the usual addition, so if we have, you know, if this is a, b and c then
1107160	1114040	the sum is denoted a plus b plus c and note again that it's not intrinsically a binary operation,
1114040	1119800	it applies to all M sets, it's not just that we can add numbers, right, we can have M sets of
1119800	1127880	anything in principle and we're still able to perform this addition operation, it's really
1127880	1136040	important that you digest the, the fundamental aspect of this operation, okay, this is something
1136040	1141640	that is so elementary but maybe has slipped by your consciousness because you're not used to
1141640	1148680	thinking about M sets as being fundamental, but it's a crucial erythmetical structure that's
1148760	1159480	actually working in the entire world of M sets, okay, so it's now easy observation that the natural
1159480	1168920	numbers are closed under addition, in fact one step below that the zero, the zero type is also
1168920	1176040	closed under addition, let me show you that, okay, so here is now an empty M set, I've dumped everything
1176040	1184360	previously out and here's another empty M set, okay, so suppose I wanted to add these two M sets,
1185400	1192520	well, I'm going to get myself another box, okay, and I'm going to dump the contents of this one
1192520	1198520	here and also dump the contents of this one here, okay, there I've done it, I've dumped all the
1198520	1205160	contents of the two boxes and you can see it's still empty, okay, so empty set plus empty set
1205160	1213400	equals empty set, so zero plus zero equals zero, so somewhat less obvious but still pretty obvious
1213400	1221400	is that if you have two natural numbers, so three plus four say, okay, there's a picture of three,
1221400	1227640	it's an M set which has three zeros in it, zero zero zero represented by these little circles
1227640	1232360	because it's a picture for primary school students, and here's a box representing four,
1233000	1237960	you dump them out into another box, well obviously you're going to get there's the first three and
1237960	1243320	there's the next four and you're going to get what we call seven, in terms of the more familiar
1243320	1248920	notation that we've been talking about, three is actually officially this thing here, okay,
1248920	1255400	the M set zero zero zero, four is the M set zero zero zero zero, we put them all in an M set,
1255400	1260920	so these guys go here and these guys say go here and then we can check that that's actually seven,
1262680	1270840	note that poly is also closed under addition, okay, here's a poly number because it's an M set
1270840	1275480	of natural numbers, here's another poly number, here's another poly number, here's another poly
1275480	1280280	number, if we add all four of them, dump the contents, dump the contents, dump the contents,
1280280	1289480	dump the contents, you get three, three, three, four, zero, seven, and this empty set doesn't
1289480	1297480	contribute, and this is another multi set of natural numbers, so it's another poly number,
1297480	1303480	so if we go up one level to multi numbers, we see that also it's closed under addition,
1304120	1309080	for example, here's a multi number, it's an M set of poly numbers, that's a poly number,
1309080	1314360	poly number, here's another M set of poly numbers, that's a poly number, that's a poly number,
1314360	1319800	that's a poly number, we add them, well obviously we get that one, that one, that one, that one,
1319800	1325480	that one, we get another M set of poly numbers, in other words, another multi number,
1328840	1336200	okay, so we have addition, now we want to go up a step, okay, and this really important step,
1336200	1343160	we're going to go from addition to multiplication, okay, and it's really important to watch carefully
1343160	1348760	what I do, it's like magic, okay, a very simple kind of magic, okay, we're going to create
1348760	1354440	multiplication out of addition, so how are we going to do that, so multiplication of M sets of M
1354440	1362600	sets, so strictly speaking in the M set world, you need M sets of M sets to make this work, okay,
1362600	1367720	as it turns out, all the things that we've been talking about are in fact M sets of M sets, so
1368360	1373160	strictly speaking, this is not really necessary, I just point this out that if you were working with
1373160	1378760	M sets with other kinds of objects, you really want to restrict yourself to M sets of M sets,
1378760	1384840	but this is not really a restriction in the world that we set up so far, okay, so to multiply
1384920	1393000	M sets, what you do is you form the M set of sums of elements, one from each M set,
1393720	1400520	so we're going to use addition to define multiplication, okay, so look carefully,
1400520	1408280	here is an M set, and we're going to assume that the contents A and B are themselves M sets,
1409240	1415720	and let me remind you that that is a condition that's automatically satisfied for all the
1415720	1424520	objects that we've been considering, here's another M set, all of its elements are also M sets,
1424520	1430200	so we're assuming that, okay, how are we going to multiply this M set with this M set, we're going
1430200	1435640	to take pairs in this case, because there's two of them that we're multiplying, pairs of elements
1435640	1441880	from this one with elements from this one, we're going to take this pair and we're going to add them,
1443240	1448440	in this case A plus X, we're going to form A plus X, this is an M set, that's an M set,
1448440	1453000	so A plus X makes sense, that's addition of M sets, this is another M set,
1454600	1459880	then we're going to take A and Y, we're going to add them, A plus Y, take A and Z, add them,
1459880	1467800	get A plus Z, take B and X, add them, get B plus X, take B and Y, add them, you get B plus Y,
1467800	1475400	take B and Z, add them, you get B plus Z, so we're getting another M set, which has
1476440	1484280	new M sets in it, these new M sets are created from the original two M sets by taking sums of
1484280	1493480	elements, one from each, that's how you multiply M sets, all right, let me illustrate
1493480	1501960	this multiplication at each of the levels, so at the zero level, zero times zero, what do we get?
1501960	1508280	Well we have to form an M set, which consists of what? Which consists of the sum of all entries
1508280	1512040	of this thing with entries of this thing, well there are no entries of this thing, there are no
1512040	1517560	entries of this thing, so there are no possible sums that we can make, so the result is empty,
1518360	1525720	fine, that's telling us that zero times zero equals zero, now let's go to natural numbers,
1526440	1531560	okay, which are M sets of zeros, so there's an M set of zeros, there's an M set of zeros,
1533160	1537240	so how are we going to multiply these two things? Well we're going to take all possible
1537320	1544440	combinations, entry here, entry here, or element here, element here, okay, and we're going to add
1544440	1551480	them, we can add them because the guys inside here are M sets, and so they can be added using M
1551480	1558680	set addition, okay so let's do that, so this, zero plus this zero, there it is there, this zero
1558680	1563160	plus this zero, there it is there, this zero plus this zero, there it is there, this zero plus this
1563160	1568200	zero. There it is there. This zero plus this zero. There it is there. This zero plus this zero.
1568200	1572680	There it is there. Have I done all the pairs? Yes, I've done all the pairs. Now we have to
1572680	1579000	evaluate these things. What is zero plus zero? Well, it's zero. So each of these is zero. So we
1579000	1586440	get zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. And in ordinary Hindu-Arabic notation, we've computed
1586440	1599320	that two times three is six. Okay, let's go to poly. Let's multiply poly numbers. So here's a
1599320	1606520	poly number. Here's another poly number. These are poly numbers because they're m sets of numbers.
1606520	1612360	That's a number. That's a number. Natural numbers. Here's another m set of natural numbers. So to
1612360	1621240	multiply them, we have to take pairs, combinations, and add them. So how do you add the number two
1621240	1627800	and the number one first pair? Well, you get three. And then two plus one is three. Two plus zero is
1627800	1633080	two. And then three plus one is four. Three plus one is four. Three plus zero is three. So we get
1633080	1639160	the m set three, three, two, four, four, three. It's another m set of natural numbers. So that's
1639160	1647160	another poly number. Poly number times poly number equals poly number. And let me show you that this
1647160	1656280	is not restricted to having two. We can multiply, in principle, a number of different m sets. So
1656280	1661720	now I'm going to multiply three m sets together sort of at the same time. So the m set zero, three,
1661720	1667320	the m set one, four, the m set two, seven. These are all poly numbers because they're m sets of
1667400	1672840	natural numbers. So what do we need to do? Well, we need to take combinations where we're taking
1672840	1678600	one element of each one of these. So let's start with the zero, one, and two. What do I have to
1678600	1685960	do with those things? I have to add them. They're m sets. So the addition of m sets of these three
1685960	1691160	is well defined. I don't have to specify which order we're doing it in. There's three things,
1691160	1699320	we're just dumping them out. So zero plus one plus two is three. Zero plus one plus seven is eight.
1699880	1707240	Zero plus four plus two is six. Zero plus four plus seven is 11. Okay, I have to keep track. I'm
1707240	1713480	going to pick all possible combinations. How about three plus one plus two? That's six. Three plus one
1713480	1720760	plus seven, that's 11. Three plus four plus two is nine, and three plus four plus seven is a 14.
1722920	1732200	So we've multiplied these three poly numbers to get this poly number. Okay, now one more step up to
1732200	1738760	the multi numbers. So let's do this. Okay, so here's a multi number. Why is this a multi number?
1738760	1744040	Well, because this thing inside it is a poly number, and here's another poly number.
1745240	1749960	It's a multi set of natural numbers, therefore a poly number. Here's another m set of natural
1749960	1754360	numbers, therefore a poly number. So this is an m set of poly numbers. Here's another m set of
1754360	1762280	poly numbers. Note that two is indeed a poly number, because we've seen that natural numbers are
1762280	1769720	included in the type of poly numbers. So what do we have to do? Well, we have to take all possible
1769720	1774920	pairs, elements here, elements here, and we have to add them. Okay, so let's take this element here,
1775560	1780040	and this element here. These are m sets. There's an m set. There's an m set. How do you add them?
1782520	1788200	Well, we just dump the contents into a box. So we get zero, zero, two, one, one. There,
1788200	1794200	that's the result of adding this m set and this m set. How about this m set with two? Okay, well,
1794200	1802120	we get zero, zero, two. What is this thing as an m set? Well, two is really the m set zero, zero,
1802120	1806760	if we want it right that way. So we could put another two zeros there. Now we've added two.
1808600	1812680	How about this thing and this thing? Well, then we're going to get, I better write smaller,
1812680	1821960	zero, zero, two, nine. Okay, and now this one plus this one, that's three, eight, one, one.
1822680	1829000	And we also need down here, okay, three, eight, we're adding two. So we have to add two zeros.
1829960	1837880	And finally, this one here, three, eight, nine. Okay, and that's the end. Oh, so there's the big
1837880	1849080	bracket at the end. So we're getting one, two, three, four, five, six, just to check, okay,
1849080	1854280	six different constituents or elements, that makes sense because this one has two elements,
1854280	1859640	this one has three elements, so we should end up getting six elements. So we can do multiplication
1859640	1864680	in each one of these types. Okay, so a little bit of thought and just doing some calculations
1864680	1871640	along the lines I've showed you reveals that each one of these type domains, zero inside
1871640	1878520	NAT, inside poly, inside multi, is closed under both addition and multiplication.
1879800	1884840	And moreover, the usual arithmetic laws that we're familiar with hold.
1885560	1894440	Namely, we have commutative law, A plus B equals B plus A. A times B equals B times A.
1899000	1903400	A plus B plus C equals A plus B plus C, that's an associate of law for addition,
1903400	1912760	and here's an associate of law for multiplication. And distributive laws, A times B plus C equals A
1912760	1921480	times B plus A times C, where we use the usual convention that the multiplication takes precedence
1921480	1926680	over the addition. That means you have to do this product first and do this product also
1926680	1933400	before you add them together. And over here, A plus B times C is A times C plus B times C.
1934440	1939320	Okay, so it's a great exercise to check these and sort of convince yourself that these are
1940040	1948280	valid. And you see that it's a very general kind of arithmetic. It's not just arithmetic with numbers
1948280	1953480	that we're doing here. We're doing arithmetic in a broader context. All right, so I want to finish
1953480	1960120	the lecture by clarifying the meaning of poly. And since that's a term that I've already used
1960120	1965000	quite extensively, I want to connect with the former usage and convince you that these are
1965000	1969960	pretty well the same things, although there is a slight difference. So we can do that by
1969960	1976360	concentrating on the sort of simplest object when we're going from natural numbers to poly
1976360	1982200	numbers, which is not itself a natural number. So if we take the set consisting of zero,
1982920	1989240	that's a poly number, but it's also a natural number, that's one. Okay, so the simplest poly
1989240	1994760	number, which is not a natural number is this one. It's the M set consisting of a single one.
1995320	2001720	Let's call it alpha. Okay, let's do a bit of arithmetic with this alpha. Suppose we look
2001720	2007800	at alpha plus alpha, okay, which we could call two alpha. What is that? Well, you have to take
2007800	2014280	this thing and you have to add it with itself. So you have to get a box and you dump one one in
2014280	2017720	and then you dump another one in. Well, you're going to have two ones in the box. So it's going to
2017720	2026040	look like this. Okay, what about three alphas? Well, dump one in, dump another one in, dump
2026040	2032840	another one in, you're going to get this thing here and so on. So multiples of alpha, it's clear
2032840	2039480	sort of what they correspond to. How about multiplication? Suppose we take alpha times alpha.
2039480	2045800	So there's alpha, there's alpha. How do you multiply them? Well, you have to take the sums
2046520	2051320	of corresponding elements, one from each one of these. Well, there's only one element here and
2051320	2058680	one element here. So you have to take one plus one and one plus one addition natural numbers,
2058680	2065320	that's two. So you're going to get the M set consisting of a single two. And if you take alpha
2065320	2069480	cubed, that means you're going to multiply this thing by another one of these, then you're going
2069480	2074680	to have to compute one plus two, which is three. So you can get the M set consisting of three.
2075560	2081320	So powers of alpha are sort of naturally corresponding to those sort of singleton
2082040	2088520	M sets that just contain a single natural number. And so that allows us to interpret
2088520	2096440	some more complicated poly like this. Okay, so here's a more complicated poly number. It's an M set
2096440	2103240	of natural numbers, 0011123333. So to make sense of this, to organize it a little bit,
2103240	2110440	we can write it as a sum. So this is the sum of the M set 00 and the M set 111 and the M set 2
2110440	2117640	and the M set 333333. Okay, what is this thing? This is the number two. What is this thing? Well,
2117640	2122840	this is what we've said is three alpha. What is this thing? That's what we've said is alpha squared.
2122840	2130600	And what is this thing? Well, alpha cubed was three. So two alpha cubed will be this plus itself
2130600	2141560	will be the M set 33. And having four of them, that'll be four alpha cubed. So this is a representation
2141560	2146760	of what in ordinary algebra, we would write as the polynomial two plus three alpha plus alpha
2146760	2153000	squared plus four alpha cubed. And in my preferred poly number language that I've talked a lot about
2153080	2160760	in other videos, I would represent this with a list, a vertical list like this, okay,
2160760	2169560	with the coefficients two, three, one, four. So we're seeing that this sort of former definition
2169560	2177240	of a poly agrees with this sort of new definition of a poly. They're really the same. But what's
2177240	2185240	the difference? The difference is that this is a list. Okay, this is a list. And this thing here
2185240	2192360	is of course an M set. And there's a crucial distinction between these two things. That's
2192360	2198520	really useful to appreciate. So remember when we were looking at polynomials or poly numbers like
2198520	2204680	this, there was a certain amount of ambiguity, because we could add a zero below here and we
2204680	2210200	agreed that that was going to be the same thing that did not change the poly number, we could add
2210200	2215160	in fact any number of zeros below, and that's not going to change the poly number, even though
2215160	2219560	officially as a list, it's kind of changing. There's a little bit of ambiguity there.
2220680	2227000	It's a general rule that when you have that kind of ambiguity, it's because it's because the list
2227000	2234280	that you're considering is really more fundamentally to be thought of as a, as a multiplicity list for
2234280	2241800	an M set. Okay, so this is an M set of zeros, ones, twos, and threes. And since the natural numbers
2241800	2249000	are naturally ordered, zero, one, two, three, we can represent such an M set or maybe make it more
2249000	2254840	concise by just counting how many each we have. We have two zeros, we have three ones, we have one,
2254840	2261640	two, and we have four threes. So this is a list that is the multiplicity list of this M set.
2264600	2272920	But I would like to suggest to you that actually, formally, officially, the M set is actually
2273560	2283400	more fundamental. It's at the heart of things. And now we see that this, this list object is really
2283400	2289720	just a secondary object that sort of makes it easier for us to represent this M set. But,
2289720	2294920	but a poly really is, is an M set of natural numbers.
2297320	2302600	Great, so we've accomplished a lot. Of course, a question that will be on your mind is, okay,
2302600	2307720	but what about these multi numbers? What's their significance? So I'm going to tell you about that
2307720	2316200	in the next video. And we're also moving towards an alternate view of this thing, which is even more
2316200	2322840	in spirit for computer scientists. So this topic is going to move really, really closely
2324360	2327480	to alignment with modern computer science, as we'll see.
2328600	2335640	Maybe mathematics will end up being a topic in computer science.
2335640	2348680	I'm Norman Wabaker. Thanks for listening.
