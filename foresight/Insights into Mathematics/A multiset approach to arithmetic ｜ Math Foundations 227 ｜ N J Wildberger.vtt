00:00.000 --> 00:12.820
Good day, I'm Norman Wabiger and today is a very exciting video for me because it's

00:12.820 --> 00:18.020
a combination of quite some years of interrupted thought.

00:18.020 --> 00:24.640
So it's a point of view towards arithmetic and in fact algebra, which is based firmly

00:24.640 --> 00:27.960
on a data structure point of view.

00:27.960 --> 00:32.240
But it's not sets, it's rather multisets.

00:32.240 --> 00:38.040
So what I'm proposing to do here today is to create a new framework for arithmetic with

00:38.040 --> 00:43.120
natural numbers, first of all, and then with polynomials, and then we'll see that we'll

00:43.120 --> 00:49.120
be able to extend this arithmetic beyond to more complicated things.

00:49.120 --> 00:54.400
And so we're going to end up with a vision of arithmetic in algebra, which is perhaps

00:54.400 --> 01:01.000
somewhat unfamiliar to you and seems to extend in vast new directions.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.600
So it's really interesting and if you're interested in exploring, this is a great topic

01:05.600 --> 01:09.120
for thinking about and exploring.

01:09.120 --> 01:14.800
It turns out that this point of view that I'm giving you is actually quite parallel

01:14.800 --> 01:19.520
in many ways to what happened in the early days of set theory, when set theory was being

01:19.520 --> 01:24.160
used to try to create a structure for the foundations of mathematics.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.680
And the empty set played a very important role then, as it does for us now.

01:29.680 --> 01:34.680
But the critical difference is that we are moving away from sets to a more general approach

01:34.680 --> 01:36.680
to data structures.

01:36.680 --> 01:43.560
So I talk a lot about the LOMS system, representing lists, ordered sets, multisets and sets.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.560
So for me, sets are just one of these four basic types of data structures.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.480
And while a computer scientist is going to be leaning towards lists as fundamental objects

01:53.480 --> 01:59.960
and that's fine, for us we're going to be thinking about the multisets as an unappreciated

01:59.960 --> 02:05.200
kind of framework for thinking about mathematics, which has a lot of potential and a lot of

02:05.200 --> 02:07.160
power.

02:07.160 --> 02:12.440
And in some ways it's sort of unfortunate that the history of mathematics circumvented multisets

02:12.440 --> 02:15.400
and focused all the attention on sets.

02:15.400 --> 02:20.080
So in case you haven't watched a lot of my videos, the idea that mathematics is based

02:20.080 --> 02:26.560
on set theory is, in my view, a complete distortion of what's really happening.

02:26.560 --> 02:32.800
So we need to have a much more broader point of view and along with that we need to be

02:32.800 --> 02:36.400
much more solid and we need to be much more explicit.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.680
We need to focus on what we can actually write down.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.520
So forget about philosophical pronouncements about what happens when you go to infinity

02:44.880 --> 02:48.360
or do an infinite number of things which you can't actually do.

02:48.360 --> 02:54.400
So we're going to be always looking to avoiding that kind of talking, which is essentially

02:54.400 --> 03:00.000
a kind of a vacuous talking, not supported by explicit computation.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.960
So real number arithmetic is a fantasy as far as I'm concerned.

03:03.960 --> 03:09.400
Fundamental theorem of algebra is just wishful dreaming, you could evidence it yourself,

03:09.560 --> 03:15.840
by factoring x to the 7 plus x minus 3 into quadratic and linear factors.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.440
Just do it or admit that you can't do it and you'll see that the fundamental theorem

03:20.440 --> 03:23.200
of algebra is not really true.

03:23.200 --> 03:27.480
So there's all kinds of really serious problems with the foundations of mathematics, as I of

03:27.480 --> 03:31.320
course talk about very often in this series.

03:31.320 --> 03:37.720
But today I want to make a start at another kind of approach, which is in some sense parallel

03:37.720 --> 03:41.920
to things that I've done already, I've talked a lot about marks, even from the early days

03:41.920 --> 03:45.440
of this series, marks and anti-marks and so on.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.560
So this is another point of view that's sort of parallel, sort of competing, has a lot

03:50.560 --> 03:54.120
of overlap, but is a little bit different.

03:54.120 --> 03:59.360
I would like to say also, first of all, a big thank you to my Patreon supporters.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.120
And in particular, I benefited by having some reactions to a previous video that I posted

04:05.120 --> 04:07.000
in this direction.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.720
My Patreon supporters, especially Lucas Lufaro, gave some interesting suggestions and encouragement.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.640
So big shout out to all of my Patreon supporters.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.760
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to use this data structure point of

04:22.760 --> 04:26.240
view to get a new framework for arithmetic and then ultimately algebra and everything's

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
based on multisets.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.240
And what is a multiset?

04:29.240 --> 04:37.200
It's a way of collecting things in an unordered fashion where repetitions are allowed.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.760
And I like to think of this as like boxes.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.280
This is really box theory.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.600
So here is a multiset, okay, it's a container, okay?

04:46.600 --> 04:50.440
I can open up the container, see what has in it, okay?

04:50.440 --> 04:53.120
Oh, look, there's a few things in it.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.520
There's this plug, there's a couple of markers.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.480
These two markers are pretty well the same, these two red ones.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.320
So duplicates are allowed, okay?

05:02.320 --> 05:03.480
And then there's this other thing.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.480
What is this?

05:04.480 --> 05:07.240
Well, actually, this is another container, okay?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.800
Here's another little container.

05:08.800 --> 05:13.600
It's a little plastic container that has a sand disk drive inside.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.840
So it's actually, this is like a little box inside this bigger box.

05:17.840 --> 05:25.160
And that's a key point, right, that we can think about boxes or collections or multisets

05:25.160 --> 05:27.880
of multisets, of multisets, et cetera, okay?

05:27.880 --> 05:33.920
And the containment relations between these boxes or multisets becomes really interesting.

05:33.920 --> 05:41.880
Okay, so we start off at a very simple level by considering not something complicated like

05:41.880 --> 05:47.520
this, but something rather simpler like this.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.080
An empty box, okay?

05:50.080 --> 05:55.520
An empty box or an empty multiset has the potential to put lots of stuff in there, but

05:55.520 --> 05:57.720
currently there's nothing in it.

05:57.720 --> 06:02.160
This is going to be our fundamental mathematical object.

06:02.160 --> 06:07.440
It's the starting point of our mathematics, okay?

06:07.440 --> 06:11.720
So we're going to denote it by a pair of brackets with nothing inside.

06:11.720 --> 06:17.960
So that's the empty set, or for us better, the empty M set because it has the potential

06:17.960 --> 06:20.200
of putting lots of things inside it.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.960
We'll give it a name, we'll call it zero.

06:25.960 --> 06:33.440
And sometimes in diagrams, we'll represent it by a box, a square like this or a rectangle

06:33.440 --> 06:36.800
with the possibility of putting various stuff in there.

06:36.800 --> 06:42.560
So this object just by itself is already a type.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.280
We can say we have a type of object, zero type.

06:47.040 --> 06:53.840
There's only one object that has this type, the empty set or the empty M set or zero.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.440
So this is going to be our starting point.

06:56.440 --> 07:03.320
And in some sense, we're just going to use this thing over and over again and put boxes

07:03.320 --> 07:07.840
inside other boxes to create arithmetic and algebra.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.200
And we'll be able to go quite far just in this one lecture as you will see.

07:12.200 --> 07:17.160
So even if you're very used to arithmetic and algebra, you're going to be introduced

07:17.160 --> 07:20.880
to some exciting new things in this video.

07:20.880 --> 07:25.600
Okay, so the next step up, natural numbers.

07:25.600 --> 07:33.040
So a natural number is an M set of zeros.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.000
The type of natural number denoted NAT, that's the type.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.240
Here's some examples.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.840
Here's an M set of zeros.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.160
Does it have any zeros in it?

07:44.160 --> 07:46.520
Well, it has no zeros in it.

07:46.520 --> 07:53.760
But we still consider an empty set of zeros to be an M set of zeros.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.760
That's an important point.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.080
Let me just talk a little bit about that.

07:56.080 --> 08:03.480
Okay, so here is our, as an M set, okay, currently it has some M set of markers, okay, an M set

08:03.480 --> 08:04.480
of markers.

08:04.480 --> 08:10.120
If I take one of these markers out, it's still an M set of markers.

08:10.120 --> 08:15.040
If I take another marker out, well, it's still an M set of markers.

08:15.040 --> 08:20.800
It happens to be the empty M set of markers.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.360
So the empty M set is actually, or zero, is actually a very flexible object.

08:25.360 --> 08:31.200
But in particular, it is also a natural number for us.

08:31.200 --> 08:36.600
So this new type of object includes the former type zero.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.080
Okay, then we give these things some names, the obvious ones.

08:40.080 --> 08:49.160
So the set or M set with just a single zero in it will be called one, the M set consisting

08:49.160 --> 08:55.600
of zero and zero will be called two, and here is three, and so on and so forth.

08:55.600 --> 09:00.600
And in diagrams, if we wanted to represent this another way, maybe simpler for primary

09:00.600 --> 09:06.200
school kids, we could maybe use some other symbol, maybe like small circles to represent

09:06.200 --> 09:07.440
zero.

09:07.440 --> 09:13.760
So what we usually call 13 then could be illustrated to a primary school student by a box, or in

09:13.760 --> 09:20.840
this case, a rectangle with 13 little circles.

09:20.840 --> 09:25.960
So these little circles are sort of playing the same role as the marks, the sort of elementary

09:25.960 --> 09:28.040
marks that I've talked about earlier.

09:28.040 --> 09:34.440
But there is a distinction because now these basic marks are not sort of elemental things.

09:34.440 --> 09:39.800
They are actually empty M sets.

09:39.800 --> 09:47.240
So we have a definition of what a natural number is, it's an M set of zeros.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.480
So those of you who have watched a lot of my videos will know that I like to approach

09:51.480 --> 09:56.640
polynomials and polynomial algebra in terms of what I call poly numbers, which are sort

09:56.640 --> 09:58.480
of more data theoretic.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.960
And I use these extensively even in the algebraic calculus course, these are workhorses for

10:02.960 --> 10:04.280
doing algebra.

10:04.280 --> 10:08.800
So here we're going to introduce them in a slightly different way, but it's really

10:08.800 --> 10:13.120
the same thing as we've already been talking about, but just from a slightly different

10:13.120 --> 10:14.120
point of view.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.760
So what is a poly number in this context?

10:16.760 --> 10:21.080
A poly number is an M set of natural numbers.

10:21.080 --> 10:28.600
So we're going one step up further, starting with zero, the natural numbers, now poly numbers.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.120
And the type, poly.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.560
Okay, so here is a poly number.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.560
Why?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.120
Well, it's an M set.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.120
And what does it have in it?

10:39.120 --> 10:40.600
One, one, two.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.800
Those are all numbers.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.800
So this is a multi-set of natural numbers.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.840
It is therefore a poly number.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.640
Here is another poly number.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.640
And okay, admittedly, there could be a little bit of confusion depending on how much space

10:54.640 --> 10:55.640
you think there is here.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.640
This is meant to be 13.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.960
Okay, these are sort of like the adjacent.

10:59.960 --> 11:07.720
So this is a multi-set with just a single number in it, but in particular, it's a multi-set

11:07.720 --> 11:08.720
of natural numbers.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.040
So it's a poly number.

11:10.040 --> 11:16.280
Here's another poly number because it's an M set of natural numbers because remember,

11:16.280 --> 11:20.440
zero is a natural number.

11:20.440 --> 11:24.280
The type of natural number included the former type of zero.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.280
So zero is a natural number.

11:27.280 --> 11:35.000
And in fact, this thing here is also a poly number because it's an M set of natural numbers.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.520
How many natural numbers are in here?

11:36.520 --> 11:41.120
Well, there aren't any, but it's still an empty M set of natural numbers.

11:41.120 --> 11:46.400
So in particular, this thing, which is, of course, zero, is also a poly number.

11:46.400 --> 11:52.720
Okay, so we have zero, the type zero contained in the type, not contained in the type of

11:52.720 --> 11:54.600
poly.

11:54.600 --> 12:02.760
And now something, one level further, which is a little bit fancier, okay?

12:02.760 --> 12:07.840
And it will take some getting used to what this actually means, but it's sort of a natural

12:07.840 --> 12:08.840
thing to do.

12:08.840 --> 12:12.200
We sort of have this natural hierarchy now, we can just sort of keep on going.

12:12.200 --> 12:23.080
So a multi-number is, by definition, an M set of poly numbers, an M set of poly numbers.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.680
And there's the type, multi.

12:24.680 --> 12:29.120
Okay, so look at this thing here, there's an M set.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.360
What's this comma doing here?

12:30.360 --> 12:35.040
Oh, no, so here's the M set, okay, here's the M set, yes, brackets here.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.320
And what's inside this M set?

12:37.320 --> 12:39.680
Well, it has this object.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.200
What is this thing?

12:41.200 --> 12:48.120
This is an M set with numbers in it, one, one, so an M set of natural numbers.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.360
So this is a poly number.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.000
Here's another poly number, these two happen to be equal.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.560
So this whole thing is an M set of poly numbers, so this is a multi-number.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.560
Here's another multi-number.

13:04.560 --> 13:10.440
It's an M set which happens to have one poly number in it, the poly number consisting of

13:10.440 --> 13:14.280
the multi-set 3, 5, and 11.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.200
How about this thing?

13:16.200 --> 13:18.160
Is this an M set of poly numbers?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.160
Well is zero a poly number?

13:20.160 --> 13:25.320
Well, yes, we just said it was, so this thing is zero, and this we said is a poly number.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.720
So this is a poly number, so this is an M set of poly numbers, in particular, it's

13:29.720 --> 13:32.240
a multi-number.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.760
What about the empty set?

13:33.760 --> 13:39.760
Well it's also an M set of poly numbers, the empty M set of poly numbers, so it also

13:39.760 --> 13:46.520
includes, so again, multi includes poly, which includes net, which includes zero.

13:46.520 --> 13:55.000
So we have this inclusion, inclusion of types, zero, net, poly, multi, each included in the

13:55.000 --> 13:58.800
other in the following sense, in the sense that if you have an object of this type, then

13:58.800 --> 14:05.040
it is automatically an object also of this type, therefore also an object of this type,

14:05.040 --> 14:08.040
therefore also an object of this type.

14:08.040 --> 14:13.000
And I hope that it's sort of obvious that the way we're going from one step here to

14:13.000 --> 14:19.800
another is directly generalizable, okay, we could easily imagine just keeping on going.

14:19.800 --> 14:26.920
Once we've defined multi numbers, we could define some higher objects, which are M sets

14:26.920 --> 14:31.400
of multi numbers, okay, and later on we're going to be thinking about that kind of thing.

14:31.400 --> 14:41.080
But already here we have a very rich framework for arithmetic and algebra, alright, but if

14:41.080 --> 14:49.320
we want to have arithmetic, we need operations as well as numbers or objects.

14:49.320 --> 14:56.160
So there is a fundamental operation in this world of multi sets, which is very very general

14:56.160 --> 15:02.440
and it's addition, okay, so this is the beauty of the multi set framework, which distinguishes

15:02.440 --> 15:07.840
it from the set theory world, in the set theory there is no such thing as addition of sets,

15:07.840 --> 15:14.080
but in the multi set world there is, okay, it's crucial to understand and to appreciate

15:14.080 --> 15:18.440
the importance of this operation, this very general operation.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.800
So how do you add M sets?

15:21.800 --> 15:26.720
You just combine their contents into a single M set.

15:26.720 --> 15:33.440
Let me show you physically, okay, so here are two M sets, they're boxes, it is a little

15:33.440 --> 15:40.920
box that has a sand disk in it, okay, and here, this one here, what does it have in

15:40.920 --> 15:41.920
it?

15:41.920 --> 15:49.480
Oh, it has two markers in it, okay, shall we add these two M sets?

15:49.480 --> 15:53.120
Add this M set and this M set, I'm going to show you how to do that, okay, we need another

15:53.120 --> 15:58.320
box, okay, hey, here's a box, okay, so what am I going to do?

15:58.320 --> 16:05.760
I'm going to take this box and this box here, these two boxes, and I'm going to combine

16:05.760 --> 16:11.760
their contents, I have to do this one at a time because I only have two hands, okay,

16:11.760 --> 16:16.680
and there's the sand disk, that's also going in there, okay, there are the original boxes,

16:16.680 --> 16:26.880
I don't need them, because I've put everything, because I've put everything in this new box,

16:26.880 --> 16:31.840
and so there, I hope you can see, there's our new box, it's got the sand disk in it,

16:31.840 --> 16:42.800
there it is there, and it has our two markers, okay, that's how you add M sets.

16:42.800 --> 16:47.720
Let's have a look at some examples with the kinds of objects we've been talking about,

16:47.720 --> 16:55.640
okay, so here we have some objects, okay, and notice that in this case I actually have three

16:55.680 --> 17:03.280
things, okay, and what are these things, well these are, these things are what, well this is a,

17:03.280 --> 17:09.320
this is a poly number because it's a multi set of natural numbers, here's another poly number,

17:09.320 --> 17:13.520
so this is here, this thing here is a multi number, here's another multi number, here's

17:13.520 --> 17:20.640
another multi number, but in particular these are M sets, so we don't require that we just

17:20.640 --> 17:25.840
have two M sets, we could do this with more than two M sets, we could have several M sets and add

17:25.840 --> 17:32.320
them at the same time just by dumping all their contents into a box, happily things are unordered

17:32.320 --> 17:38.840
and repetitions are allowed, so there's no need to fuss around and remove duplicates as you would

17:38.840 --> 17:43.880
if you were working with set theory, it's just absolutely simple-minded, you just dump them

17:43.880 --> 17:49.360
on the box and there you go, but in particular it's not intrinsically a binary operation,

17:49.360 --> 17:54.320
so how do you, how do you add these things, well you just get a bigger box represented by those

17:54.320 --> 18:01.080
brackets there and you put the set three in, the M set four, the M set one, one, two, the M set four,

18:01.080 --> 18:09.840
zero, okay, that's also a, that's a natural number, okay, so in particular it's a poly

18:09.840 --> 18:14.760
number, so there's the zero and there four is there and the one, two, one is there, so we just

18:15.040 --> 18:21.280
dumping the contents of these three M sets into a single M set, that's how you add them, okay,

18:21.280 --> 18:27.160
the operations name will be the usual addition, so if we have, you know, if this is a, b and c then

18:27.160 --> 18:34.040
the sum is denoted a plus b plus c and note again that it's not intrinsically a binary operation,

18:34.040 --> 18:39.800
it applies to all M sets, it's not just that we can add numbers, right, we can have M sets of

18:39.800 --> 18:47.880
anything in principle and we're still able to perform this addition operation, it's really

18:47.880 --> 18:56.040
important that you digest the, the fundamental aspect of this operation, okay, this is something

18:56.040 --> 19:01.640
that is so elementary but maybe has slipped by your consciousness because you're not used to

19:01.640 --> 19:08.680
thinking about M sets as being fundamental, but it's a crucial erythmetical structure that's

19:08.760 --> 19:19.480
actually working in the entire world of M sets, okay, so it's now easy observation that the natural

19:19.480 --> 19:28.920
numbers are closed under addition, in fact one step below that the zero, the zero type is also

19:28.920 --> 19:36.040
closed under addition, let me show you that, okay, so here is now an empty M set, I've dumped everything

19:36.040 --> 19:44.360
previously out and here's another empty M set, okay, so suppose I wanted to add these two M sets,

19:45.400 --> 19:52.520
well, I'm going to get myself another box, okay, and I'm going to dump the contents of this one

19:52.520 --> 19:58.520
here and also dump the contents of this one here, okay, there I've done it, I've dumped all the

19:58.520 --> 20:05.160
contents of the two boxes and you can see it's still empty, okay, so empty set plus empty set

20:05.160 --> 20:13.400
equals empty set, so zero plus zero equals zero, so somewhat less obvious but still pretty obvious

20:13.400 --> 20:21.400
is that if you have two natural numbers, so three plus four say, okay, there's a picture of three,

20:21.400 --> 20:27.640
it's an M set which has three zeros in it, zero zero zero represented by these little circles

20:27.640 --> 20:32.360
because it's a picture for primary school students, and here's a box representing four,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.960
you dump them out into another box, well obviously you're going to get there's the first three and

20:37.960 --> 20:43.320
there's the next four and you're going to get what we call seven, in terms of the more familiar

20:43.320 --> 20:48.920
notation that we've been talking about, three is actually officially this thing here, okay,

20:48.920 --> 20:55.400
the M set zero zero zero, four is the M set zero zero zero zero, we put them all in an M set,

20:55.400 --> 21:00.920
so these guys go here and these guys say go here and then we can check that that's actually seven,

21:02.680 --> 21:10.840
note that poly is also closed under addition, okay, here's a poly number because it's an M set

21:10.840 --> 21:15.480
of natural numbers, here's another poly number, here's another poly number, here's another poly

21:15.480 --> 21:20.280
number, if we add all four of them, dump the contents, dump the contents, dump the contents,

21:20.280 --> 21:29.480
dump the contents, you get three, three, three, four, zero, seven, and this empty set doesn't

21:29.480 --> 21:37.480
contribute, and this is another multi set of natural numbers, so it's another poly number,

21:37.480 --> 21:43.480
so if we go up one level to multi numbers, we see that also it's closed under addition,

21:44.120 --> 21:49.080
for example, here's a multi number, it's an M set of poly numbers, that's a poly number,

21:49.080 --> 21:54.360
poly number, here's another M set of poly numbers, that's a poly number, that's a poly number,

21:54.360 --> 21:59.800
that's a poly number, we add them, well obviously we get that one, that one, that one, that one,

21:59.800 --> 22:05.480
that one, we get another M set of poly numbers, in other words, another multi number,

22:08.840 --> 22:16.200
okay, so we have addition, now we want to go up a step, okay, and this really important step,

22:16.200 --> 22:23.160
we're going to go from addition to multiplication, okay, and it's really important to watch carefully

22:23.160 --> 22:28.760
what I do, it's like magic, okay, a very simple kind of magic, okay, we're going to create

22:28.760 --> 22:34.440
multiplication out of addition, so how are we going to do that, so multiplication of M sets of M

22:34.440 --> 22:42.600
sets, so strictly speaking in the M set world, you need M sets of M sets to make this work, okay,

22:42.600 --> 22:47.720
as it turns out, all the things that we've been talking about are in fact M sets of M sets, so

22:48.360 --> 22:53.160
strictly speaking, this is not really necessary, I just point this out that if you were working with

22:53.160 --> 22:58.760
M sets with other kinds of objects, you really want to restrict yourself to M sets of M sets,

22:58.760 --> 23:04.840
but this is not really a restriction in the world that we set up so far, okay, so to multiply

23:04.920 --> 23:13.000
M sets, what you do is you form the M set of sums of elements, one from each M set,

23:13.720 --> 23:20.520
so we're going to use addition to define multiplication, okay, so look carefully,

23:20.520 --> 23:28.280
here is an M set, and we're going to assume that the contents A and B are themselves M sets,

23:29.240 --> 23:35.720
and let me remind you that that is a condition that's automatically satisfied for all the

23:35.720 --> 23:44.520
objects that we've been considering, here's another M set, all of its elements are also M sets,

23:44.520 --> 23:50.200
so we're assuming that, okay, how are we going to multiply this M set with this M set, we're going

23:50.200 --> 23:55.640
to take pairs in this case, because there's two of them that we're multiplying, pairs of elements

23:55.640 --> 24:01.880
from this one with elements from this one, we're going to take this pair and we're going to add them,

24:03.240 --> 24:08.440
in this case A plus X, we're going to form A plus X, this is an M set, that's an M set,

24:08.440 --> 24:13.000
so A plus X makes sense, that's addition of M sets, this is another M set,

24:14.600 --> 24:19.880
then we're going to take A and Y, we're going to add them, A plus Y, take A and Z, add them,

24:19.880 --> 24:27.800
get A plus Z, take B and X, add them, get B plus X, take B and Y, add them, you get B plus Y,

24:27.800 --> 24:35.400
take B and Z, add them, you get B plus Z, so we're getting another M set, which has

24:36.440 --> 24:44.280
new M sets in it, these new M sets are created from the original two M sets by taking sums of

24:44.280 --> 24:53.480
elements, one from each, that's how you multiply M sets, all right, let me illustrate

24:53.480 --> 25:01.960
this multiplication at each of the levels, so at the zero level, zero times zero, what do we get?

25:01.960 --> 25:08.280
Well we have to form an M set, which consists of what? Which consists of the sum of all entries

25:08.280 --> 25:12.040
of this thing with entries of this thing, well there are no entries of this thing, there are no

25:12.040 --> 25:17.560
entries of this thing, so there are no possible sums that we can make, so the result is empty,

25:18.360 --> 25:25.720
fine, that's telling us that zero times zero equals zero, now let's go to natural numbers,

25:26.440 --> 25:31.560
okay, which are M sets of zeros, so there's an M set of zeros, there's an M set of zeros,

25:33.160 --> 25:37.240
so how are we going to multiply these two things? Well we're going to take all possible

25:37.320 --> 25:44.440
combinations, entry here, entry here, or element here, element here, okay, and we're going to add

25:44.440 --> 25:51.480
them, we can add them because the guys inside here are M sets, and so they can be added using M

25:51.480 --> 25:58.680
set addition, okay so let's do that, so this, zero plus this zero, there it is there, this zero

25:58.680 --> 26:03.160
plus this zero, there it is there, this zero plus this zero, there it is there, this zero plus this

26:03.160 --> 26:08.200
zero. There it is there. This zero plus this zero. There it is there. This zero plus this zero.

26:08.200 --> 26:12.680
There it is there. Have I done all the pairs? Yes, I've done all the pairs. Now we have to

26:12.680 --> 26:19.000
evaluate these things. What is zero plus zero? Well, it's zero. So each of these is zero. So we

26:19.000 --> 26:26.440
get zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. And in ordinary Hindu-Arabic notation, we've computed

26:26.440 --> 26:39.320
that two times three is six. Okay, let's go to poly. Let's multiply poly numbers. So here's a

26:39.320 --> 26:46.520
poly number. Here's another poly number. These are poly numbers because they're m sets of numbers.

26:46.520 --> 26:52.360
That's a number. That's a number. Natural numbers. Here's another m set of natural numbers. So to

26:52.360 --> 27:01.240
multiply them, we have to take pairs, combinations, and add them. So how do you add the number two

27:01.240 --> 27:07.800
and the number one first pair? Well, you get three. And then two plus one is three. Two plus zero is

27:07.800 --> 27:13.080
two. And then three plus one is four. Three plus one is four. Three plus zero is three. So we get

27:13.080 --> 27:19.160
the m set three, three, two, four, four, three. It's another m set of natural numbers. So that's

27:19.160 --> 27:27.160
another poly number. Poly number times poly number equals poly number. And let me show you that this

27:27.160 --> 27:36.280
is not restricted to having two. We can multiply, in principle, a number of different m sets. So

27:36.280 --> 27:41.720
now I'm going to multiply three m sets together sort of at the same time. So the m set zero, three,

27:41.720 --> 27:47.320
the m set one, four, the m set two, seven. These are all poly numbers because they're m sets of

27:47.400 --> 27:52.840
natural numbers. So what do we need to do? Well, we need to take combinations where we're taking

27:52.840 --> 27:58.600
one element of each one of these. So let's start with the zero, one, and two. What do I have to

27:58.600 --> 28:05.960
do with those things? I have to add them. They're m sets. So the addition of m sets of these three

28:05.960 --> 28:11.160
is well defined. I don't have to specify which order we're doing it in. There's three things,

28:11.160 --> 28:19.320
we're just dumping them out. So zero plus one plus two is three. Zero plus one plus seven is eight.

28:19.880 --> 28:27.240
Zero plus four plus two is six. Zero plus four plus seven is 11. Okay, I have to keep track. I'm

28:27.240 --> 28:33.480
going to pick all possible combinations. How about three plus one plus two? That's six. Three plus one

28:33.480 --> 28:40.760
plus seven, that's 11. Three plus four plus two is nine, and three plus four plus seven is a 14.

28:42.920 --> 28:52.200
So we've multiplied these three poly numbers to get this poly number. Okay, now one more step up to

28:52.200 --> 28:58.760
the multi numbers. So let's do this. Okay, so here's a multi number. Why is this a multi number?

28:58.760 --> 29:04.040
Well, because this thing inside it is a poly number, and here's another poly number.

29:05.240 --> 29:09.960
It's a multi set of natural numbers, therefore a poly number. Here's another m set of natural

29:09.960 --> 29:14.360
numbers, therefore a poly number. So this is an m set of poly numbers. Here's another m set of

29:14.360 --> 29:22.280
poly numbers. Note that two is indeed a poly number, because we've seen that natural numbers are

29:22.280 --> 29:29.720
included in the type of poly numbers. So what do we have to do? Well, we have to take all possible

29:29.720 --> 29:34.920
pairs, elements here, elements here, and we have to add them. Okay, so let's take this element here,

29:35.560 --> 29:40.040
and this element here. These are m sets. There's an m set. There's an m set. How do you add them?

29:42.520 --> 29:48.200
Well, we just dump the contents into a box. So we get zero, zero, two, one, one. There,

29:48.200 --> 29:54.200
that's the result of adding this m set and this m set. How about this m set with two? Okay, well,

29:54.200 --> 30:02.120
we get zero, zero, two. What is this thing as an m set? Well, two is really the m set zero, zero,

30:02.120 --> 30:06.760
if we want it right that way. So we could put another two zeros there. Now we've added two.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.680
How about this thing and this thing? Well, then we're going to get, I better write smaller,

30:12.680 --> 30:21.960
zero, zero, two, nine. Okay, and now this one plus this one, that's three, eight, one, one.

30:22.680 --> 30:29.000
And we also need down here, okay, three, eight, we're adding two. So we have to add two zeros.

30:29.960 --> 30:37.880
And finally, this one here, three, eight, nine. Okay, and that's the end. Oh, so there's the big

30:37.880 --> 30:49.080
bracket at the end. So we're getting one, two, three, four, five, six, just to check, okay,

30:49.080 --> 30:54.280
six different constituents or elements, that makes sense because this one has two elements,

30:54.280 --> 30:59.640
this one has three elements, so we should end up getting six elements. So we can do multiplication

30:59.640 --> 31:04.680
in each one of these types. Okay, so a little bit of thought and just doing some calculations

31:04.680 --> 31:11.640
along the lines I've showed you reveals that each one of these type domains, zero inside

31:11.640 --> 31:18.520
NAT, inside poly, inside multi, is closed under both addition and multiplication.

31:19.800 --> 31:24.840
And moreover, the usual arithmetic laws that we're familiar with hold.

31:25.560 --> 31:34.440
Namely, we have commutative law, A plus B equals B plus A. A times B equals B times A.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.400
A plus B plus C equals A plus B plus C, that's an associate of law for addition,

31:43.400 --> 31:52.760
and here's an associate of law for multiplication. And distributive laws, A times B plus C equals A

31:52.760 --> 32:01.480
times B plus A times C, where we use the usual convention that the multiplication takes precedence

32:01.480 --> 32:06.680
over the addition. That means you have to do this product first and do this product also

32:06.680 --> 32:13.400
before you add them together. And over here, A plus B times C is A times C plus B times C.

32:14.440 --> 32:19.320
Okay, so it's a great exercise to check these and sort of convince yourself that these are

32:20.040 --> 32:28.280
valid. And you see that it's a very general kind of arithmetic. It's not just arithmetic with numbers

32:28.280 --> 32:33.480
that we're doing here. We're doing arithmetic in a broader context. All right, so I want to finish

32:33.480 --> 32:40.120
the lecture by clarifying the meaning of poly. And since that's a term that I've already used

32:40.120 --> 32:45.000
quite extensively, I want to connect with the former usage and convince you that these are

32:45.000 --> 32:49.960
pretty well the same things, although there is a slight difference. So we can do that by

32:49.960 --> 32:56.360
concentrating on the sort of simplest object when we're going from natural numbers to poly

32:56.360 --> 33:02.200
numbers, which is not itself a natural number. So if we take the set consisting of zero,

33:02.920 --> 33:09.240
that's a poly number, but it's also a natural number, that's one. Okay, so the simplest poly

33:09.240 --> 33:14.760
number, which is not a natural number is this one. It's the M set consisting of a single one.

33:15.320 --> 33:21.720
Let's call it alpha. Okay, let's do a bit of arithmetic with this alpha. Suppose we look

33:21.720 --> 33:27.800
at alpha plus alpha, okay, which we could call two alpha. What is that? Well, you have to take

33:27.800 --> 33:34.280
this thing and you have to add it with itself. So you have to get a box and you dump one one in

33:34.280 --> 33:37.720
and then you dump another one in. Well, you're going to have two ones in the box. So it's going to

33:37.720 --> 33:46.040
look like this. Okay, what about three alphas? Well, dump one in, dump another one in, dump

33:46.040 --> 33:52.840
another one in, you're going to get this thing here and so on. So multiples of alpha, it's clear

33:52.840 --> 33:59.480
sort of what they correspond to. How about multiplication? Suppose we take alpha times alpha.

33:59.480 --> 34:05.800
So there's alpha, there's alpha. How do you multiply them? Well, you have to take the sums

34:06.520 --> 34:11.320
of corresponding elements, one from each one of these. Well, there's only one element here and

34:11.320 --> 34:18.680
one element here. So you have to take one plus one and one plus one addition natural numbers,

34:18.680 --> 34:25.320
that's two. So you're going to get the M set consisting of a single two. And if you take alpha

34:25.320 --> 34:29.480
cubed, that means you're going to multiply this thing by another one of these, then you're going

34:29.480 --> 34:34.680
to have to compute one plus two, which is three. So you can get the M set consisting of three.

34:35.560 --> 34:41.320
So powers of alpha are sort of naturally corresponding to those sort of singleton

34:42.040 --> 34:48.520
M sets that just contain a single natural number. And so that allows us to interpret

34:48.520 --> 34:56.440
some more complicated poly like this. Okay, so here's a more complicated poly number. It's an M set

34:56.440 --> 35:03.240
of natural numbers, 0011123333. So to make sense of this, to organize it a little bit,

35:03.240 --> 35:10.440
we can write it as a sum. So this is the sum of the M set 00 and the M set 111 and the M set 2

35:10.440 --> 35:17.640
and the M set 333333. Okay, what is this thing? This is the number two. What is this thing? Well,

35:17.640 --> 35:22.840
this is what we've said is three alpha. What is this thing? That's what we've said is alpha squared.

35:22.840 --> 35:30.600
And what is this thing? Well, alpha cubed was three. So two alpha cubed will be this plus itself

35:30.600 --> 35:41.560
will be the M set 33. And having four of them, that'll be four alpha cubed. So this is a representation

35:41.560 --> 35:46.760
of what in ordinary algebra, we would write as the polynomial two plus three alpha plus alpha

35:46.760 --> 35:53.000
squared plus four alpha cubed. And in my preferred poly number language that I've talked a lot about

35:53.080 --> 36:00.760
in other videos, I would represent this with a list, a vertical list like this, okay,

36:00.760 --> 36:09.560
with the coefficients two, three, one, four. So we're seeing that this sort of former definition

36:09.560 --> 36:17.240
of a poly agrees with this sort of new definition of a poly. They're really the same. But what's

36:17.240 --> 36:25.240
the difference? The difference is that this is a list. Okay, this is a list. And this thing here

36:25.240 --> 36:32.360
is of course an M set. And there's a crucial distinction between these two things. That's

36:32.360 --> 36:38.520
really useful to appreciate. So remember when we were looking at polynomials or poly numbers like

36:38.520 --> 36:44.680
this, there was a certain amount of ambiguity, because we could add a zero below here and we

36:44.680 --> 36:50.200
agreed that that was going to be the same thing that did not change the poly number, we could add

36:50.200 --> 36:55.160
in fact any number of zeros below, and that's not going to change the poly number, even though

36:55.160 --> 36:59.560
officially as a list, it's kind of changing. There's a little bit of ambiguity there.

37:00.680 --> 37:07.000
It's a general rule that when you have that kind of ambiguity, it's because it's because the list

37:07.000 --> 37:14.280
that you're considering is really more fundamentally to be thought of as a, as a multiplicity list for

37:14.280 --> 37:21.800
an M set. Okay, so this is an M set of zeros, ones, twos, and threes. And since the natural numbers

37:21.800 --> 37:29.000
are naturally ordered, zero, one, two, three, we can represent such an M set or maybe make it more

37:29.000 --> 37:34.840
concise by just counting how many each we have. We have two zeros, we have three ones, we have one,

37:34.840 --> 37:41.640
two, and we have four threes. So this is a list that is the multiplicity list of this M set.

37:44.600 --> 37:52.920
But I would like to suggest to you that actually, formally, officially, the M set is actually

37:53.560 --> 38:03.400
more fundamental. It's at the heart of things. And now we see that this, this list object is really

38:03.400 --> 38:09.720
just a secondary object that sort of makes it easier for us to represent this M set. But,

38:09.720 --> 38:14.920
but a poly really is, is an M set of natural numbers.

38:17.320 --> 38:22.600
Great, so we've accomplished a lot. Of course, a question that will be on your mind is, okay,

38:22.600 --> 38:27.720
but what about these multi numbers? What's their significance? So I'm going to tell you about that

38:27.720 --> 38:36.200
in the next video. And we're also moving towards an alternate view of this thing, which is even more

38:36.200 --> 38:42.840
in spirit for computer scientists. So this topic is going to move really, really closely

38:44.360 --> 38:47.480
to alignment with modern computer science, as we'll see.

38:48.600 --> 38:55.640
Maybe mathematics will end up being a topic in computer science.

38:55.640 --> 39:08.680
I'm Norman Wabaker. Thanks for listening.
