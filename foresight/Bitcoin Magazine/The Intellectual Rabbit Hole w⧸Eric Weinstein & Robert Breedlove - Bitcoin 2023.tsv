0	3600	Hey brother. Hey man, good to see you again. Good to see you again.
3600	7920	I feel like we do this all the time. Yeah. Last time was in Chicago maybe?
7920	12640	Yes, yeah and rooftop in LA and lots of cool places. Love it.
12640	18480	What's your mind today? As we, I guess it was yesterday that we met to talk about what we're
18480	23680	going to talk about and one of the things you brought up that I found to be very interesting was
24640	32800	this idea that there have been three key white papers in the past well I guess since 2008
33680	39600	that have really changed the world. The first one's pretty obvious. It is the Bitcoin white paper.
39600	44320	There you go. But perhaps you have kind of some unique views on the Bitcoin white paper before
44320	49360	we get into the other two. Sure. So I think one of the things that for me is having a background
49440	54000	in mathematics and physics about the Bitcoin white paper is if you think about Bitcoin as digital
54000	62320	gold, what is gold? Gold is actually mathematically a wave in a substrate called a vector bundle.
62960	70720	And the idea that you've solved the double spin problem translates in physics to a conservation
70720	76480	law, right? That the idea is that something is destroyed here to be created over here and you
76480	84000	don't have this ability to in some sense increase it. The issue is, is that all of these conservation
84000	88400	laws come from symmetry principles. So one thing I would challenge the community is that Satoshi
88400	93760	must have created a symmetry principle in order to create a conservation law. And does it stop
93760	100720	there? Is it possible to port all of the features of the physical world into the digital layer as
100720	105840	Satoshi did for this kind of conserved wave? You have a token and you may have a series,
105920	112880	a wave of claims against it from the private keys that are held. And in some sense, try to think
112880	120080	about gold and Bitcoin in a single framework where effectively you've created some substrate and some
120080	124720	wave for it to be digital gold. And I think that there's a lot of unexplored territory here,
124720	130000	but absolutely one of the most brilliant things that's happened in our lifetime. Just forget the
130000	137600	money aspect. It's simply an incredible intellectual innovation in decentralized computing that
137600	142880	happens to work great as money or you guys wouldn't be here all these years later with all the attacks
142880	148960	against you. So, you know, call it a vote. All the honor to you. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, I like
149520	154720	a description you've shared before. It's like a bridge between the logical and the physical
154800	161040	domain. And that's pretty important for a society that's moving into the digital age, clearly.
161040	166240	Yeah, one advertisement, I wrote an essay on Bitcoin when I didn't buy it in 2010 called
167360	172960	Go Virtual Young Man. And we were trying to get prime brokerage and nobody would do prime brokerage
172960	177040	for Bitcoin then, so we gave up on the project. Definitely one of the dumbest things I've ever
177040	183440	done. But you can see the hope that was inspired because that was the hope back in 2010.
184720	194480	Now, the second white paper is one you told me about titled Attention is All You Need from 2017.
194480	200240	I'd never heard of this, but apparently it was instrumental in the AI revolution that we are
200240	204320	perhaps moving into today. Can you tell us a little bit about that white paper? It's hard.
204320	208560	It's hard. But isn't it interesting that you're all talking about chat GPT
209280	216320	and how suddenly computers can seemingly do so much of what we thought was intrinsically human?
217600	223600	And yet, can I have an honest show of hands? How many of you have never heard of Attention
223600	231520	is All You Need? Just be honest. Isn't that remarkable that we're not sharing what caused
231600	239600	that explosion? You're sort of on the retail end of this. And we Jews have a horrible joke.
239600	245280	Why did God create the non-Jews? Well, somebody had to pay retail. We can't be in the...
247920	252800	Can't believe I told that in a mixed audience. The thing is, I don't want any of you
254640	260800	thinking about this from a retail perspective. Come to the wholesaler, which is reading what
260800	265920	changed in the architecture. So this has to do with something called transformers. And there
265920	270080	were certain kinds of neural networks that were pretty inefficient and difficult to train.
270640	274880	And Attention has something to do. If you think about a very long sentence, there are different
274880	280320	regions of the sentence. How do those regions fit together? And how can you sort of parallelize
280320	286880	the training of this artificial mind? The Attention is All You Need paper came up with a
286960	292480	hyper-efficient way of making sure that the different regions got the attention that they
292480	297120	needed so that you didn't have a trailing off of interest. And that new architecture
298080	302640	started to show us something which I think we haven't really digested, which is very disturbing.
302640	307600	We keep talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence. The idea is that we are supposedly
307600	312400	generally intelligent. The computers are not actually intelligent because you can see all
312400	317840	they're doing is some linear algebra followed by a little bit of nonlinear function theory.
318400	322800	So we know what they're doing. We can't figure out why it looks like us exactly. In other words,
322800	326400	we can't go into the neural net and say, oh, well, this part of it is doing this and that
326400	334320	is doing that. Well, what's going on is it turns out that most of what we do is not very intelligent.
335040	340080	So we had a conceit about ourselves that we're thinking all the time, we're being creative all
340080	347760	the time. And in fact, mostly you can finish each other's, right? And so the whole idea is,
347760	352560	thank you guys for that. I really appreciate it. What's going on is that for the most part,
352560	356960	we're just doing the same thing we did yesterday. We have the same conversational patterns. And
356960	362720	when somebody says something new, we tend to call them a grifter. We tell them that they're
362720	368560	an attention hog or they're whoring for clicks, all of these things. And mostly what we want to
368560	375360	do is repetitive activity. And what this is doing is it's eating our lunch. It's correctly figured
375360	379920	out that most of what we do is not generally intelligent. It's just repetitive. And so when
379920	385920	you train your children in school, what you're really doing is putting them in the crosshairs
385920	391680	of artificial intelligence, because a computer program spends its time in two separate sections,
391680	397600	loops, and parts that only happen once. And if you stop a computer program with a debugger,
397600	402000	you'll almost always stop it in a loop. That's where computers spend almost all their time
402000	408480	in repetitive behavior. And so excellence and what we do in school in general trains you to do
408480	412800	something that a computer will do better than you will. And so think very carefully about what you
412800	418480	want to train your children to do. Think about how much of your day is actually spent in non-intelligence.
419040	426400	You know, and I met a guy backstage who had an idea about putting Bitcoin in computer hardware
426400	432480	so that when you needed to recover the machinery at the end, there was something that paid for it
432480	435920	and it gave you an incentive not to just throw it into the world as trash. And I said,
435920	442240	that's genius. And he said, oh, no, no, no, no. And I said, no, every act of creation is a violent
442240	446960	act, which is difficult to do. So think about what portion of your day you're actually doing
446960	451600	something that's never been done, even if it feels minor to you. And take your own genius
451600	455600	seriously, because this thing is going to eat your repetitive behavior that you thought was
455600	461600	your highest end product. But really what this paper did was allowed us to parallelize things,
461600	466640	make it much more efficient so that you didn't have to have these dependencies. And then what we
466640	472160	find is that every sentence that we speak can be tokenized. And then it's just an input output
472160	476960	machine where you say, if this is the input, what has been the output? And you let the thing read
476960	481760	some giant corpus of text. And so it turns out that that's pretty good to fool us into thinking
481840	485280	that we were intelligent all along. And the big discovery is mostly we're not.
489440	495760	While we're on the topic of Bitcoiners are the best. Aren't there any Maxis out here?
496480	503200	Any Maxis? While we're on the topic of artificial intelligence, if we could
504160	510400	speculate on the implications of this a bit, what does it mean when we move into a world that
511120	516160	all of the professional services that many people are providing today, attorneys, accountants,
516160	521760	et cetera, investment bankers, a lot of that appears that will be eaten by this software,
521760	528720	right? I think AIs are already passing the bar exam, for example. What's left for humanity?
528720	537200	And is that a net benefit or is that a negative? This is like the most dangerous, great question.
537680	543120	What's happening is, is that capitalism and communism, you thought were rivals and capitalism
543120	548800	won and communism lost. But it's really like Thelma and Louise going over the cliff. And
548800	555280	you know, the question is, who hit the ground first? It was communism. Whatever's coming next
555280	561280	isn't going to be capitalism or communism. And we have to be thinking, as Adam Smith thought,
561840	569040	as Hayek thought, as Marx thought, about something new. And some of those things are not going to
569040	575920	work. But the key point is, always machinery and technology have chased humans into higher value
575920	582160	activities. Well, the high value activities that may be left might be like human touch. You don't
582160	587600	want to go to a robot therapist. Maybe you do. Maybe you're not there. But my point would be
588400	593680	that this is enough to break labor markets, for sure. And it's enough to break education.
593680	601440	And it's probably enough to break certain parts of capitalism. And so what I challenge you guys to
601440	609040	do is think about, if you weren't hamstrung into these old paradigms, capitalism versus communism
609040	615040	is an old issue. This thing changes labor markets. And you and I have talked, if you have something
615040	620480	technical that you call market failure, that used to be a small slice of the pie, and then it
620480	626080	suddenly expands to become an enormous slice of the pie, you can't tax the stuff that works in
626080	633760	markets to pay for the small stuff that doesn't. So whatever it is, we need your brains coming
633760	639280	up with an entirely new economic system. I don't know its name. But I think that you'll find that
639280	644240	my wife has this beautiful thing. She says, this is the golden age of AI complementarity,
644240	648560	where you engineer a prompt, the machine does something, you realize it's not exactly what
648560	653360	you want, you go re-engineer the prompt, and the two of you converge. This is when humans and
653360	659840	machines played chess together. That's a temporary issue. Take the period of time where you have
659840	666240	that, and try to innovate something so that we don't get crushed, because K versus L, capital
666240	673680	versus labor, is going to get very ambiguous very quickly. Interesting. Okay, the third white
673680	681120	paper. Uh-oh. This one's interesting. I guess I should mention, Bitcoin White Paper published
681120	687440	2008, Attention is All You Need published 2017. The third one is the Project Diffuse
688240	697520	Grant Proposal, and this was published in 2018. What is this third one all about, Mr. Weinstein?
697600	704560	Oh boy. Okay. Raise your hand if you've absolutely never had COVID.
707760	717600	Most of you guys got taken out. I did. I did. Okay. We do not know whether Project Diffuse run by a
718800	723520	hippie charity called the EcoHealth Alliance practicing something called One Health
723520	731440	has something to do with the origin of COVID. Now, I'm not telling you that this white paper
731440	738720	actually caused all of you to get sick. I am telling you that it is an incredible coincidence
739280	747520	that a group active in Wuhan, China talking about furan cleavage sites in spike protein in bat
747520	754880	coronaviruses was proposing something that looks eerily like the coronavirus that was in your
754880	764800	child's lungs. There are 13 letters in my first and last name. Now, there are four amino acids
765520	770480	in the furan cleavage site, each of which requires three nucleotides to code for it in your DNA.
770560	778960	It would be 12 letters to try to imagine that with far less information than is in my name,
778960	786000	we shut down planet Earth. That is the issue of leverage. All three of these white papers, Robert,
786720	796400	are incredibly high leverage discoveries. And most people cannot imagine a short paper
797280	804560	completely transforming planet Earth. But that furan cleavage site is the secret to the virality
806480	809520	of the COVID virus. The spike protein is particularly
811200	819840	important. And this tiny region of nucleic acid coding was enough to make this thing
820800	827200	spread like wildfire. So even if this white paper was not the origin of COVID,
827200	831840	and even if it came from a pangolin or a wet market or a civic cat or whatever,
832800	840320	we now know how little it takes to completely change everything. And if you think about Bitcoin
840320	847440	as programming, this is programming in a different language. Do you speak Haskell? Do you speak
847440	853200	Python? Do you speak nucleic acid? It takes almost no change in nucleic acid. What's more,
853200	859680	we've distributed this platform, this Corona platform worldwide. I'm very focused on a particular
859680	864480	island in the South Atlantic called St. Helena. I don't know if anybody's been to St. Helena,
864480	868960	but if there was ever a gulch, you should check out St. Helena. It makes a perfect gulch.
870080	875120	It was COVID free because it had a very strong perimeter during this pandemic.
875120	881200	But almost nothing escaped. And one of the things that you guys don't understand, people
881200	885040	will say, are you a bit coiner? And I say, well, you guys are a little communistic for me. And
885040	888880	you say, well, what do you mean we're communists? Well, you're willing to share an atmosphere
889520	895360	with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which I'm not. And if you think about all of the way of
895360	902240	privatizing property rights, your land might be defensible, but your atmosphere is shared.
902240	909200	We are all breathing each other's air. And my concern is, is that this last one was not the
909200	915920	Spanish flu. It was not the super deadly pandemic like the plague that we could have had. But it
915920	921920	is a giant warning shot across your bow that you cannot get confirmation as to whether or not
921920	928000	the United States government was in some ways active in a biological weapons convention work
928000	933920	around using the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases. If you took out the word
933920	938880	allergies, it would be the National Institute of Infectious Disease. And it would be much clearer
938880	944240	to you that it probably has something to do with the rules and restrictions we placed on ourselves
944240	948800	through the Geneva Convention and through the Biological Weapons Convention. And you'll notice
948800	953120	that Anthony Fauci was in the same role for approximately the length of time that J. Edgar
953200	958800	Hoover was at FBI. I think one of the things that we're in danger of finding out is the truth.
958800	963600	We have a lot of very old people, and it's typically thought that they're clinging to power
963600	967840	because they're power crazy. And I want to throw out a different possibility.
971440	976400	The different possibility is that there are a lot of secrets that are holed up inside of our
976400	981360	government. And we yell at people as conspiracy theorists and paranoid lunatics like you all.
981600	988560	But not me. And it may be that there are a lot of secrets that are going to change your entire
988560	992880	conception of your country, your planet, your world, your safety, and what threat your family
992880	997040	is under. And one of the reasons that I'm hopeful in talking about these white papers, we came to
997040	1002960	this, I think it was a great call on your part, is that a white paper can also be hope. A white
1002960	1009040	paper can change everything for the better. The ability to stop sharing an atmosphere with Putin
1009040	1013280	and Xi and various other people that I would prefer not to be, because we have three things we
1013280	1019040	have to worry about. Radiation travels in the atmosphere. Pathogens travel in the atmosphere.
1019040	1023520	And climate, even though we lie about climate, we still have climate issues. Don't be fooled just
1023520	1028720	because we're lying about it, that climate is totally safe. In all of these cases,
1030560	1037520	what Yuan says is true. We need to make sure we're diversified. And the communalism of your
1037520	1044000	atmosphere and your oceans is a remnant of your communistic tendencies. If you're willing to accept
1044000	1049520	that, recognize that we may need to spread out and have more spheres, and we have no idea how to do
1049520	1055440	this. Because inside of our solar system, there are three rocks that are sort of possible, the moon,
1055440	1062560	Mars, and this beautiful planet of Earth. Chemical rockets can only reach these. In order to get out
1062560	1068240	of the solar system, you need what? A change in physics. And you're not working on physics, and
1068240	1073120	you're not endowing physics departments. And I came with Avi Loeb last year to talk about this.
1073120	1077840	If you want to stop your communism, you're going to have to come up with a large number of habitable
1078720	1085040	spheres that do not share resources. Because one change in the current cleavage site proves
1085120	1092800	how vulnerable we are. Is there a white paper that changes physical law that stops us believing that
1092800	1097600	we live in space-time, which is merely a map and not the underlying territory? I don't know.
1098480	1103600	But if you guys are the big dogs, and I want to say this very clearly, I'm here this year in part,
1103600	1111520	it's smaller, we got kicked in the teeth, and it's more intense because a lot of the froth got blown
1111520	1117120	off. And we have a very strong underlying core. So first of all, give yourselves a round of applause
1117120	1124560	for appearing here now. If you're going to be the big dogs, it's not enough to think about
1124560	1128240	personal freedom. You're going to have to start endowing things. One thing Robert and I did,
1128240	1134960	we went to the University of Chicago to Milton Friedman's old seminar. And what would it mean
1134960	1142080	for the big coiners to start endowing chairs of economics with some direct ability to direct
1142080	1148240	the field? You guys are giving up certain opportunities which will allow your freedom-based
1148240	1154240	approach to change everything. So what about a white paper, for example, that examines how a
1154240	1161520	small capital outlay could fundamentally shift the entire economics profession towards an
1161520	1168480	understanding that we may need to move away from fiat. And then we were talking about inflation
1168480	1172480	earlier. I think that's another white paper that's probably important that hasn't been written
1172480	1180000	exactly. Yes, yeah. A lot of great points there. First, I'd like to say we're going to need a new
1180000	1187040	word for this Weinstein brand of libertarianism where we all get our own planet. That's taken
1187120	1190400	private property to a whole new level. So I really hope that comes to pass.
1193920	1199440	Sounds crazy, but then again, so does digital gold. Yes, indeed. Before inflation, should we
1199440	1204320	talk about the discovery of the neutron? Because part of what we're talking about here in these
1204320	1211200	white papers, as you said, the novel inventions or discoveries or proposals that radically change
1211200	1218960	the world, very high leverage points in time. And an analogy that you drew upon in our preparations
1218960	1222480	for this was the discovery of the neutron and how that led us into the nuclear age.
1223440	1230000	And now, I mean, I guess we could just look at AI as the most recent discovery or invention
1230640	1237440	leading us into a potentially unimaginable future. So and then feel free to segue into
1237440	1242560	inflation whenever you like. Okay, I like the discovery of the neutron. So we discovered the
1242560	1249200	neutron in 1932, I think it was Chadwick, maybe it had been proposed by Rutherford. And immediately,
1249200	1256320	it sets off an intellectual chain reaction. The neutron leads to a proposal of chain reactions
1256320	1262720	by Lise Meitner, chemist, incredible woman working, I think, in Germany. Enrico Fermi,
1262720	1268560	at Chicago, comes up with Chicago Pile 1, first controlled nuclear reaction. Oppenheimer takes
1268560	1274080	the ball to the Trinity test. We drop two devices on our enemy in World War II, Japan,
1275600	1283840	proving this in the field. And then Teller and Ulam come up with the idea that the bomb that we
1283840	1290320	drop in Japan is only the detonator for the mega bomb, which takes the shockwave and refocuses
1290400	1295840	it and leads not to fission but to fusion. So within 20 years from 1932 to, I think it's
1295840	1302720	November of 52 with Ivy Mike, the first hydrogen bomb, we become gods, whether we like it or not.
1302720	1306800	We have the power and responsibility of gods. Nobody has ever seen fusion on the surface
1306800	1314480	of a planet before. And suddenly, within living memory, we see something that only happens on the
1314480	1323120	sun happened in the Pacific. That's how fast things move when you have a deep insight. And the
1323120	1327280	idea that you're trapped here and that you think that you will never get off this planet and do
1327280	1332320	anything really significant within our lifetimes is because you've grown up inside of a stagnation.
1333040	1339760	Your entire lives have basically been in a stagnation. This is not real life. All your memories
1339840	1348000	are in a bubble. And I don't know how to say this. What WTF happened in 1971 is really what
1348000	1353360	WTF happened in the early 70s. And it's not just the gold standard, it's not just Bretton Woods.
1353920	1359440	It was predicted by Derek DeSola Price. It's a slowdown in the exponential increase in technology
1359440	1366400	and science. And as a result, we don't realize that between 1902 and 1952, that 50-year span is
1366400	1373360	effectively 10,000 years. Things change so much. In this span of 50 years, things have been highly
1373360	1378400	stagnant, except for a tiny number of areas, digital being one of them. So we do see things like
1378400	1384640	Bitcoin. That seems to be coming to an end. I've called this the Great Knapp. And more or less
1384640	1392640	since 1945 or 1952, we haven't seen early 20th century events on those scales except for the
1392640	1398720	disaster of Mao's great leap forward. So we have a wrong idea about war, about our safety,
1398720	1402800	about what's possible, about how fast things can change. I will point out that there were people
1402800	1408640	who saw action in the Civil War, who lived to see Ivy Mike, the first H bomb in the Pacific.
1408640	1413680	So in some sense, the Civil War was almost a nuclear holocaust. Think about it. It's hard to
1413680	1421520	conceive. With respect to inflation and the monetary supply, it's very interesting that at the exact
1421600	1428720	same moment, there was a huge spike in M1, there was also a change in the reporting requirements.
1428720	1433440	So if you say, look at this graph, every academic will pack up, pat themselves in the back and say,
1433440	1438240	oh, you don't realize there was a discontinuity in the time series. That means nothing. Now,
1438240	1443120	think about this. That means any time I want to jack up M1, all I have to do is change a
1443120	1446640	reporting requirement and all the academics will pat themselves in the back saying, oh,
1446640	1452880	you can't use that series because of a discontinuity. What's more, what's going to tell the impact of
1452880	1460960	changing the monetary supply? It's the BLS's computation of CPI. And you guys are incentivized
1460960	1468480	to think about, oh, the number was 7.2, 6.8, which is insane. If I said that the temperature
1468480	1475760	in the United States was 68 degrees or 68.25, you'd say, what are you talking about? I want to see
1475840	1481680	a map. It's a field concept. Every meteor, I say field. I was talking to Saylor last night
1482320	1487120	and he said it's too complicated to say what it really is, which is an element of a group.
1488640	1492240	Inflation is a group element. He says it's too complicated. I say it's a field.
1493440	1499840	Well, that field is a concept that everybody who watches television meteorology knows. They see maps,
1499840	1504960	they see pressure systems, they see temperatures, and we're all sitting around like absolute morons
1504960	1512080	pretending that this number means something. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
1512080	1517360	claims to have moved to a cost of living standard, which is hysterical. That's a very technical
1517360	1523680	concept. It means that you know the tastes of somebody, how much they prefer coffee to tea.
1523680	1528800	And so if they can shift their preferences, you don't need to pay them as much in a cost of
1528800	1533040	living adjustment because they are going to shift what they buy. If you're indifferent between beer
1533040	1537360	and wine and the price of wine goes up because of grape harvest, you just buy beer. We don't have
1537360	1543840	to pay you more money. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not maintain taste data. This is a giant
1543840	1550240	catastrophic lie that is so big within the economics profession. It's like labor shortages.
1550240	1554480	You've probably read about the labor shortages in technology. There are no labor shortages in
1554480	1561040	market economies because supply and demand adjust. I have a Bugatti shortage. Why? Because I don't
1561040	1569520	feel like paying for a Bugatti. So my point to you all is you're living with absolutely
1569520	1574640	transparent institutional lies, but you're participating in the game every time you try to
1574640	1581360	guess the CPI release. And so what you're seeing is you're going to have to take over this conversation.
1581360	1585920	You're going to have to say, look, we don't exactly know what you did because you screwed up the time
1585920	1590160	series, but that was the wrong moment to change the reporting requirements. If you're going to
1590240	1597840	say cost of living, where's the taste data? It's called a Conus Las Pairs Index. Get technical,
1598560	1604480	get informed, endow some chairs, and realize that these white papers have been very frightening
1604480	1610240	in some cases and very liberating. You're here because of a white paper. And the thing is,
1610240	1615760	is that we've got to stop pretending that Bitcoin is perfect. We have to realize that it's up to us
1616400	1621200	to continue to innovate, to build not only on top of it with things like lightning,
1621920	1626480	but to actually think about what is this technology, how do we use the wealth that is
1626480	1632560	generated, not only for personal freedom, but also for societal freedom. And I want to say one
1632560	1640880	thing about this. Oh, thanks. You guys are the best. They don't know how powerful this technology
1640960	1646800	is, or the violence, the threat of violence against you would be much greater. If you want
1646800	1651760	Bitcoin to survive, the problem isn't with Bitcoin. The problem is that you're vulnerable
1651760	1657120	to threats of violence. And so if you're not going to cough up your keys with a gun to your head,
1657120	1662720	that's fine. But very few people are willing to make that trade off. This is the time to figure
1662720	1668080	out how to infect the system in a positive way. Instead of viewing them as the enemy,
1668080	1674400	think about mitochondria inside your cell. If that's a captured bacteria, try to imagine it
1674400	1680720	as an infection. If you tried to pull the mitochondria out of your cells, you'd take away your ability
1680720	1688320	to produce ATP through ATP synthase. In other words, the infection is absolutely essential
1688320	1695280	to life itself. Now is the time to try to infect the system with something positive rather than
1695360	1700400	treating it as the enemy, so that when it comes with violence to try to shut you down for holding
1701200	1706640	this instrument, it finds that it can't because it's actually dependent upon you. So that's my
1706640	1711360	hope for this crypto winter is that when you appear to be weak, when they write articles about how
1711360	1717680	your conference is shrunk, when they try to make fun of you, have fun getting poor, right? Don't
1717680	1724720	listen. Take the winter, take the opportunity, run like mad, and try to infect the system in a
1724720	1729280	positive way rather than viewing them as the enemy, so that they come to thank you later for
1729280	1733920	the infection just the way your cells think it's mitochondria for making life possible.
1738160	1744160	Eric Weinstein, Robert Breedlove, thank you for always inspiring us big corners to hire and
1744160	1748400	greater action. It's not enough just to stack sats and sit and wait. We have to take action,
1748400	1751600	so thank you. Let's try to make it happen. All right. All right, brother.
1758880	1764640	Bitcoiners, welcome back to Bitcoin 2023. This is the Bitcoin Magazine live desk
1764640	1770400	sponsored by Marathon. I am joined by my esteemed co-panelist. At the end, Ben Asgrin,
1770400	1777680	the mixed martial artist, Chris Cyborg, the Grand Slam Champion, and then Kenny
1777760	1784400	Florian, former UFC broadcaster. We just listened to Eric Weinstein and Robert Breedlove give a
1784400	1789360	very big brain gigachad talk. Definitely something I'm going to need to watch a few more times.
1789360	1794160	But in the beginning, Eric was talking about what's going to hit the ground first, capitalism
1794160	1798800	or communism. He said communism obviously hit first, capitalism's almost there, and he's a
1798800	1802320	little worried about what's next to come. Is a Bitcoin standard the next thing to come? I'll
1802320	1808880	kick it over to you, Ben. Well, I don't see why capitalism and a Bitcoin standard can't coexist.
1808880	1812880	And one of the things that we think of capitalism is, you know, I was thinking about this a lot
1812880	1818240	reading Alex Glaston's book about the IMF. Capitalism doesn't really exist in its truest form,
1818240	1824160	right? Because the IMF gives a loan to a poor country in exchange for that country,
1824160	1828560	then hiring some firms, right? Those firms aren't picking the ones they want to pick. They're
1828560	1832720	picking the ones they're forced to pick, right? So it's not true capitalism. So I don't see why
1832720	1836880	a Bitcoin standard and capitalism can't coexist. Yeah, we definitely have crony capitalism right
1836880	1842480	now. So Eric was calling Bitcoiners too communistic for me. He said, because we share the same airs,
1842480	1846720	the CCP, and basically said we all need our own planets. Chris, what are your thoughts? Is Bitcoin
1846720	1850880	a communist thing or is Bitcoin a good thing? I'd love your thoughts, Chris. I believe Bitcoin is
1850880	1856800	a good thing. I believe it's a freedom for the people and I and limitate. I really, I really
1856800	1861920	enjoy having the Bitcoin. Definitely. It's not enough for a person to think of personal freedom,
1861920	1866320	but to endow rulers is something that Eric was saying. He said, but Bitcoin is rules without
1866320	1872560	rulers. Kenny, I'd love your thoughts on basically Eric's ideology, trying to force us to implement
1872560	1878000	rulers. What are your thoughts on that? He wants to implement rulers over Bitcoin or? Yeah, he was
1878000	1882000	saying basically that he was like, it's not enough to just like Bitcoin to be on its own. He's like,
1882000	1887120	this is your opportunity to strike and basically to implement. I think finance minister is kind of
1887120	1892080	what he was saying. When has it ever gone wrong when humans get involved? I think that's brilliant.
1892080	1897600	No, I strongly disagree with that. I mean, listen, we're in the situation we're in because humans
1897600	1903120	have screwed it all up. And I think that's what makes Bitcoin so powerful, right? Is we do not
1903120	1910720	have to rely on the faults of humans to make poor mistakes, to be corrupted by the money itself.
1910720	1918320	It is ruled by math and and it's absolute and truthful. So yeah, I think this is why Bitcoin
1918320	1925200	is what it is. I think to inject humans into the equation, I think only make it more complicated
1925200	1930960	and more screwed up. Yeah, definitely. He also mentioned WTF happened in 1971. That is a great
1930960	1935360	website. I recommend people go checking it out beforehand. But he basically said from 1971 to
1935360	1941200	about 2020 or 2021. He said we've basically seen 10,000 years of growth. But he says he believes
1941200	1944960	the next 50 years are going to be more stagnant. But those of us on a Bitcoin standard have
1944960	1950640	said this 50 years and the next is going to be huge. Yeah, I think that's what he's implying. But
1950640	1954400	basically, do you see being on a Bitcoin standard? We're seeing all this growth. Yeah, maybe the
1954400	1958080	conference has gone down in size, but we've seen a growth in the network. We've seen blocks still
1958080	1963840	keep coming in. Ben, to you. Well, I want to go back to the endowing the chairs at economics
1963920	1969040	universities. I feel like Bitcoin is different and we don't need to play the old game and we can
1969040	1973920	play our own game. And I think a lot about what they're doing in El Salvador. That's a script flip.
1973920	1978320	That was Naib saying, IMF, get lost. We're not playing your game. We're going to play a little
1978320	1983200	bit of a different game. And I don't see why we can't do that. Why do we need old institutions
1983200	1987680	to validate our thoughts that we're having right now? Why can't we do it a little bit of a different
1987680	1993120	way? And that's still be valid. Yeah, definitely. He was basically calling out a lot of the media
1993120	1998160	companies that are publishing that this event has shrunk and calling them have fun getting poor
1998160	2002400	referring to Bitcoiners. But he says, take their criticism and grow the network and propagate.
2002400	2006320	And this is our time to build in the crypto winter, as he called it. Kenny, your thoughts on that?
2007920	2013600	Yeah, I mean, listen, I think what it comes down to is we need to build our own ecosystem, build
2013600	2019600	our own thing and get people to play our game, kind of like what Ben said. And yeah, I think it's
2019600	2024240	a real possibility. I think that not only game theory will indicate that ultimately they will
2024240	2029360	do that, but I think people are throughout time are looking for the best technology and whatever
2029360	2033840	it is. And I think Bitcoin will ultimately prove that it is the best technology. And I think there's
2033840	2038720	still a lot of education to happen on that. Definitely. We're about to go back to the Nakamoto
2038720	2045120	stage. Stick with us after this short break. Thank you, Miami, for the last three years in this
2045120	2051760	amazing city. The whole world shut down. But Miami welcomed us with open arms.
2052720	2059520	We want to show Bitcoin to the whole world. We are taking the conference on the roads
2059520	2062560	to set the stage for Bitcoin in a new city.
2062560	2080800	Bitcoin 2024 is coming to Nashville in Tennessee,
2080800	2088800	a city that is known as a music and freedom city. Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville from July 25th to 27th.
