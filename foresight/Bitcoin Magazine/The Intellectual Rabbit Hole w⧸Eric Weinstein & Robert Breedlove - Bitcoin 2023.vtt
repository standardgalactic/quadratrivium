WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Hey brother. Hey man, good to see you again. Good to see you again.

00:03.600 --> 00:07.920
I feel like we do this all the time. Yeah. Last time was in Chicago maybe?

00:07.920 --> 00:12.640
Yes, yeah and rooftop in LA and lots of cool places. Love it.

00:12.640 --> 00:18.480
What's your mind today? As we, I guess it was yesterday that we met to talk about what we're

00:18.480 --> 00:23.680
going to talk about and one of the things you brought up that I found to be very interesting was

00:24.640 --> 00:32.800
this idea that there have been three key white papers in the past well I guess since 2008

00:33.680 --> 00:39.600
that have really changed the world. The first one's pretty obvious. It is the Bitcoin white paper.

00:39.600 --> 00:44.320
There you go. But perhaps you have kind of some unique views on the Bitcoin white paper before

00:44.320 --> 00:49.360
we get into the other two. Sure. So I think one of the things that for me is having a background

00:49.440 --> 00:54.000
in mathematics and physics about the Bitcoin white paper is if you think about Bitcoin as digital

00:54.000 --> 01:02.320
gold, what is gold? Gold is actually mathematically a wave in a substrate called a vector bundle.

01:02.960 --> 01:10.720
And the idea that you've solved the double spin problem translates in physics to a conservation

01:10.720 --> 01:16.480
law, right? That the idea is that something is destroyed here to be created over here and you

01:16.480 --> 01:24.000
don't have this ability to in some sense increase it. The issue is, is that all of these conservation

01:24.000 --> 01:28.400
laws come from symmetry principles. So one thing I would challenge the community is that Satoshi

01:28.400 --> 01:33.760
must have created a symmetry principle in order to create a conservation law. And does it stop

01:33.760 --> 01:40.720
there? Is it possible to port all of the features of the physical world into the digital layer as

01:40.720 --> 01:45.840
Satoshi did for this kind of conserved wave? You have a token and you may have a series,

01:45.920 --> 01:52.880
a wave of claims against it from the private keys that are held. And in some sense, try to think

01:52.880 --> 02:00.080
about gold and Bitcoin in a single framework where effectively you've created some substrate and some

02:00.080 --> 02:04.720
wave for it to be digital gold. And I think that there's a lot of unexplored territory here,

02:04.720 --> 02:10.000
but absolutely one of the most brilliant things that's happened in our lifetime. Just forget the

02:10.000 --> 02:17.600
money aspect. It's simply an incredible intellectual innovation in decentralized computing that

02:17.600 --> 02:22.880
happens to work great as money or you guys wouldn't be here all these years later with all the attacks

02:22.880 --> 02:28.960
against you. So, you know, call it a vote. All the honor to you. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah, I like

02:29.520 --> 02:34.720
a description you've shared before. It's like a bridge between the logical and the physical

02:34.800 --> 02:41.040
domain. And that's pretty important for a society that's moving into the digital age, clearly.

02:41.040 --> 02:46.240
Yeah, one advertisement, I wrote an essay on Bitcoin when I didn't buy it in 2010 called

02:47.360 --> 02:52.960
Go Virtual Young Man. And we were trying to get prime brokerage and nobody would do prime brokerage

02:52.960 --> 02:57.040
for Bitcoin then, so we gave up on the project. Definitely one of the dumbest things I've ever

02:57.040 --> 03:03.440
done. But you can see the hope that was inspired because that was the hope back in 2010.

03:04.720 --> 03:14.480
Now, the second white paper is one you told me about titled Attention is All You Need from 2017.

03:14.480 --> 03:20.240
I'd never heard of this, but apparently it was instrumental in the AI revolution that we are

03:20.240 --> 03:24.320
perhaps moving into today. Can you tell us a little bit about that white paper? It's hard.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.560
It's hard. But isn't it interesting that you're all talking about chat GPT

03:29.280 --> 03:36.320
and how suddenly computers can seemingly do so much of what we thought was intrinsically human?

03:37.600 --> 03:43.600
And yet, can I have an honest show of hands? How many of you have never heard of Attention

03:43.600 --> 03:51.520
is All You Need? Just be honest. Isn't that remarkable that we're not sharing what caused

03:51.600 --> 03:59.600
that explosion? You're sort of on the retail end of this. And we Jews have a horrible joke.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.280
Why did God create the non-Jews? Well, somebody had to pay retail. We can't be in the...

04:07.920 --> 04:12.800
Can't believe I told that in a mixed audience. The thing is, I don't want any of you

04:14.640 --> 04:20.800
thinking about this from a retail perspective. Come to the wholesaler, which is reading what

04:20.800 --> 04:25.920
changed in the architecture. So this has to do with something called transformers. And there

04:25.920 --> 04:30.080
were certain kinds of neural networks that were pretty inefficient and difficult to train.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.880
And Attention has something to do. If you think about a very long sentence, there are different

04:34.880 --> 04:40.320
regions of the sentence. How do those regions fit together? And how can you sort of parallelize

04:40.320 --> 04:46.880
the training of this artificial mind? The Attention is All You Need paper came up with a

04:46.960 --> 04:52.480
hyper-efficient way of making sure that the different regions got the attention that they

04:52.480 --> 04:57.120
needed so that you didn't have a trailing off of interest. And that new architecture

04:58.080 --> 05:02.640
started to show us something which I think we haven't really digested, which is very disturbing.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.600
We keep talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence. The idea is that we are supposedly

05:07.600 --> 05:12.400
generally intelligent. The computers are not actually intelligent because you can see all

05:12.400 --> 05:17.840
they're doing is some linear algebra followed by a little bit of nonlinear function theory.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.800
So we know what they're doing. We can't figure out why it looks like us exactly. In other words,

05:22.800 --> 05:26.400
we can't go into the neural net and say, oh, well, this part of it is doing this and that

05:26.400 --> 05:34.320
is doing that. Well, what's going on is it turns out that most of what we do is not very intelligent.

05:35.040 --> 05:40.080
So we had a conceit about ourselves that we're thinking all the time, we're being creative all

05:40.080 --> 05:47.760
the time. And in fact, mostly you can finish each other's, right? And so the whole idea is,

05:47.760 --> 05:52.560
thank you guys for that. I really appreciate it. What's going on is that for the most part,

05:52.560 --> 05:56.960
we're just doing the same thing we did yesterday. We have the same conversational patterns. And

05:56.960 --> 06:02.720
when somebody says something new, we tend to call them a grifter. We tell them that they're

06:02.720 --> 06:08.560
an attention hog or they're whoring for clicks, all of these things. And mostly what we want to

06:08.560 --> 06:15.360
do is repetitive activity. And what this is doing is it's eating our lunch. It's correctly figured

06:15.360 --> 06:19.920
out that most of what we do is not generally intelligent. It's just repetitive. And so when

06:19.920 --> 06:25.920
you train your children in school, what you're really doing is putting them in the crosshairs

06:25.920 --> 06:31.680
of artificial intelligence, because a computer program spends its time in two separate sections,

06:31.680 --> 06:37.600
loops, and parts that only happen once. And if you stop a computer program with a debugger,

06:37.600 --> 06:42.000
you'll almost always stop it in a loop. That's where computers spend almost all their time

06:42.000 --> 06:48.480
in repetitive behavior. And so excellence and what we do in school in general trains you to do

06:48.480 --> 06:52.800
something that a computer will do better than you will. And so think very carefully about what you

06:52.800 --> 06:58.480
want to train your children to do. Think about how much of your day is actually spent in non-intelligence.

06:59.040 --> 07:06.400
You know, and I met a guy backstage who had an idea about putting Bitcoin in computer hardware

07:06.400 --> 07:12.480
so that when you needed to recover the machinery at the end, there was something that paid for it

07:12.480 --> 07:15.920
and it gave you an incentive not to just throw it into the world as trash. And I said,

07:15.920 --> 07:22.240
that's genius. And he said, oh, no, no, no, no. And I said, no, every act of creation is a violent

07:22.240 --> 07:26.960
act, which is difficult to do. So think about what portion of your day you're actually doing

07:26.960 --> 07:31.600
something that's never been done, even if it feels minor to you. And take your own genius

07:31.600 --> 07:35.600
seriously, because this thing is going to eat your repetitive behavior that you thought was

07:35.600 --> 07:41.600
your highest end product. But really what this paper did was allowed us to parallelize things,

07:41.600 --> 07:46.640
make it much more efficient so that you didn't have to have these dependencies. And then what we

07:46.640 --> 07:52.160
find is that every sentence that we speak can be tokenized. And then it's just an input output

07:52.160 --> 07:56.960
machine where you say, if this is the input, what has been the output? And you let the thing read

07:56.960 --> 08:01.760
some giant corpus of text. And so it turns out that that's pretty good to fool us into thinking

08:01.840 --> 08:05.280
that we were intelligent all along. And the big discovery is mostly we're not.

08:09.440 --> 08:15.760
While we're on the topic of Bitcoiners are the best. Aren't there any Maxis out here?

08:16.480 --> 08:23.200
Any Maxis? While we're on the topic of artificial intelligence, if we could

08:24.160 --> 08:30.400
speculate on the implications of this a bit, what does it mean when we move into a world that

08:31.120 --> 08:36.160
all of the professional services that many people are providing today, attorneys, accountants,

08:36.160 --> 08:41.760
et cetera, investment bankers, a lot of that appears that will be eaten by this software,

08:41.760 --> 08:48.720
right? I think AIs are already passing the bar exam, for example. What's left for humanity?

08:48.720 --> 08:57.200
And is that a net benefit or is that a negative? This is like the most dangerous, great question.

08:57.680 --> 09:03.120
What's happening is, is that capitalism and communism, you thought were rivals and capitalism

09:03.120 --> 09:08.800
won and communism lost. But it's really like Thelma and Louise going over the cliff. And

09:08.800 --> 09:15.280
you know, the question is, who hit the ground first? It was communism. Whatever's coming next

09:15.280 --> 09:21.280
isn't going to be capitalism or communism. And we have to be thinking, as Adam Smith thought,

09:21.840 --> 09:29.040
as Hayek thought, as Marx thought, about something new. And some of those things are not going to

09:29.040 --> 09:35.920
work. But the key point is, always machinery and technology have chased humans into higher value

09:35.920 --> 09:42.160
activities. Well, the high value activities that may be left might be like human touch. You don't

09:42.160 --> 09:47.600
want to go to a robot therapist. Maybe you do. Maybe you're not there. But my point would be

09:48.400 --> 09:53.680
that this is enough to break labor markets, for sure. And it's enough to break education.

09:53.680 --> 10:01.440
And it's probably enough to break certain parts of capitalism. And so what I challenge you guys to

10:01.440 --> 10:09.040
do is think about, if you weren't hamstrung into these old paradigms, capitalism versus communism

10:09.040 --> 10:15.040
is an old issue. This thing changes labor markets. And you and I have talked, if you have something

10:15.040 --> 10:20.480
technical that you call market failure, that used to be a small slice of the pie, and then it

10:20.480 --> 10:26.080
suddenly expands to become an enormous slice of the pie, you can't tax the stuff that works in

10:26.080 --> 10:33.760
markets to pay for the small stuff that doesn't. So whatever it is, we need your brains coming

10:33.760 --> 10:39.280
up with an entirely new economic system. I don't know its name. But I think that you'll find that

10:39.280 --> 10:44.240
my wife has this beautiful thing. She says, this is the golden age of AI complementarity,

10:44.240 --> 10:48.560
where you engineer a prompt, the machine does something, you realize it's not exactly what

10:48.560 --> 10:53.360
you want, you go re-engineer the prompt, and the two of you converge. This is when humans and

10:53.360 --> 10:59.840
machines played chess together. That's a temporary issue. Take the period of time where you have

10:59.840 --> 11:06.240
that, and try to innovate something so that we don't get crushed, because K versus L, capital

11:06.240 --> 11:13.680
versus labor, is going to get very ambiguous very quickly. Interesting. Okay, the third white

11:13.680 --> 11:21.120
paper. Uh-oh. This one's interesting. I guess I should mention, Bitcoin White Paper published

11:21.120 --> 11:27.440
2008, Attention is All You Need published 2017. The third one is the Project Diffuse

11:28.240 --> 11:37.520
Grant Proposal, and this was published in 2018. What is this third one all about, Mr. Weinstein?

11:37.600 --> 11:44.560
Oh boy. Okay. Raise your hand if you've absolutely never had COVID.

11:47.760 --> 11:57.600
Most of you guys got taken out. I did. I did. Okay. We do not know whether Project Diffuse run by a

11:58.800 --> 12:03.520
hippie charity called the EcoHealth Alliance practicing something called One Health

12:03.520 --> 12:11.440
has something to do with the origin of COVID. Now, I'm not telling you that this white paper

12:11.440 --> 12:18.720
actually caused all of you to get sick. I am telling you that it is an incredible coincidence

12:19.280 --> 12:27.520
that a group active in Wuhan, China talking about furan cleavage sites in spike protein in bat

12:27.520 --> 12:34.880
coronaviruses was proposing something that looks eerily like the coronavirus that was in your

12:34.880 --> 12:44.800
child's lungs. There are 13 letters in my first and last name. Now, there are four amino acids

12:45.520 --> 12:50.480
in the furan cleavage site, each of which requires three nucleotides to code for it in your DNA.

12:50.560 --> 12:58.960
It would be 12 letters to try to imagine that with far less information than is in my name,

12:58.960 --> 13:06.000
we shut down planet Earth. That is the issue of leverage. All three of these white papers, Robert,

13:06.720 --> 13:16.400
are incredibly high leverage discoveries. And most people cannot imagine a short paper

13:17.280 --> 13:24.560
completely transforming planet Earth. But that furan cleavage site is the secret to the virality

13:26.480 --> 13:29.520
of the COVID virus. The spike protein is particularly

13:31.200 --> 13:39.840
important. And this tiny region of nucleic acid coding was enough to make this thing

13:40.800 --> 13:47.200
spread like wildfire. So even if this white paper was not the origin of COVID,

13:47.200 --> 13:51.840
and even if it came from a pangolin or a wet market or a civic cat or whatever,

13:52.800 --> 14:00.320
we now know how little it takes to completely change everything. And if you think about Bitcoin

14:00.320 --> 14:07.440
as programming, this is programming in a different language. Do you speak Haskell? Do you speak

14:07.440 --> 14:13.200
Python? Do you speak nucleic acid? It takes almost no change in nucleic acid. What's more,

14:13.200 --> 14:19.680
we've distributed this platform, this Corona platform worldwide. I'm very focused on a particular

14:19.680 --> 14:24.480
island in the South Atlantic called St. Helena. I don't know if anybody's been to St. Helena,

14:24.480 --> 14:28.960
but if there was ever a gulch, you should check out St. Helena. It makes a perfect gulch.

14:30.080 --> 14:35.120
It was COVID free because it had a very strong perimeter during this pandemic.

14:35.120 --> 14:41.200
But almost nothing escaped. And one of the things that you guys don't understand, people

14:41.200 --> 14:45.040
will say, are you a bit coiner? And I say, well, you guys are a little communistic for me. And

14:45.040 --> 14:48.880
you say, well, what do you mean we're communists? Well, you're willing to share an atmosphere

14:49.520 --> 14:55.360
with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which I'm not. And if you think about all of the way of

14:55.360 --> 15:02.240
privatizing property rights, your land might be defensible, but your atmosphere is shared.

15:02.240 --> 15:09.200
We are all breathing each other's air. And my concern is, is that this last one was not the

15:09.200 --> 15:15.920
Spanish flu. It was not the super deadly pandemic like the plague that we could have had. But it

15:15.920 --> 15:21.920
is a giant warning shot across your bow that you cannot get confirmation as to whether or not

15:21.920 --> 15:28.000
the United States government was in some ways active in a biological weapons convention work

15:28.000 --> 15:33.920
around using the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases. If you took out the word

15:33.920 --> 15:38.880
allergies, it would be the National Institute of Infectious Disease. And it would be much clearer

15:38.880 --> 15:44.240
to you that it probably has something to do with the rules and restrictions we placed on ourselves

15:44.240 --> 15:48.800
through the Geneva Convention and through the Biological Weapons Convention. And you'll notice

15:48.800 --> 15:53.120
that Anthony Fauci was in the same role for approximately the length of time that J. Edgar

15:53.200 --> 15:58.800
Hoover was at FBI. I think one of the things that we're in danger of finding out is the truth.

15:58.800 --> 16:03.600
We have a lot of very old people, and it's typically thought that they're clinging to power

16:03.600 --> 16:07.840
because they're power crazy. And I want to throw out a different possibility.

16:11.440 --> 16:16.400
The different possibility is that there are a lot of secrets that are holed up inside of our

16:16.400 --> 16:21.360
government. And we yell at people as conspiracy theorists and paranoid lunatics like you all.

16:21.600 --> 16:28.560
But not me. And it may be that there are a lot of secrets that are going to change your entire

16:28.560 --> 16:32.880
conception of your country, your planet, your world, your safety, and what threat your family

16:32.880 --> 16:37.040
is under. And one of the reasons that I'm hopeful in talking about these white papers, we came to

16:37.040 --> 16:42.960
this, I think it was a great call on your part, is that a white paper can also be hope. A white

16:42.960 --> 16:49.040
paper can change everything for the better. The ability to stop sharing an atmosphere with Putin

16:49.040 --> 16:53.280
and Xi and various other people that I would prefer not to be, because we have three things we

16:53.280 --> 16:59.040
have to worry about. Radiation travels in the atmosphere. Pathogens travel in the atmosphere.

16:59.040 --> 17:03.520
And climate, even though we lie about climate, we still have climate issues. Don't be fooled just

17:03.520 --> 17:08.720
because we're lying about it, that climate is totally safe. In all of these cases,

17:10.560 --> 17:17.520
what Yuan says is true. We need to make sure we're diversified. And the communalism of your

17:17.520 --> 17:24.000
atmosphere and your oceans is a remnant of your communistic tendencies. If you're willing to accept

17:24.000 --> 17:29.520
that, recognize that we may need to spread out and have more spheres, and we have no idea how to do

17:29.520 --> 17:35.440
this. Because inside of our solar system, there are three rocks that are sort of possible, the moon,

17:35.440 --> 17:42.560
Mars, and this beautiful planet of Earth. Chemical rockets can only reach these. In order to get out

17:42.560 --> 17:48.240
of the solar system, you need what? A change in physics. And you're not working on physics, and

17:48.240 --> 17:53.120
you're not endowing physics departments. And I came with Avi Loeb last year to talk about this.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.840
If you want to stop your communism, you're going to have to come up with a large number of habitable

17:58.720 --> 18:05.040
spheres that do not share resources. Because one change in the current cleavage site proves

18:05.120 --> 18:12.800
how vulnerable we are. Is there a white paper that changes physical law that stops us believing that

18:12.800 --> 18:17.600
we live in space-time, which is merely a map and not the underlying territory? I don't know.

18:18.480 --> 18:23.600
But if you guys are the big dogs, and I want to say this very clearly, I'm here this year in part,

18:23.600 --> 18:31.520
it's smaller, we got kicked in the teeth, and it's more intense because a lot of the froth got blown

18:31.520 --> 18:37.120
off. And we have a very strong underlying core. So first of all, give yourselves a round of applause

18:37.120 --> 18:44.560
for appearing here now. If you're going to be the big dogs, it's not enough to think about

18:44.560 --> 18:48.240
personal freedom. You're going to have to start endowing things. One thing Robert and I did,

18:48.240 --> 18:54.960
we went to the University of Chicago to Milton Friedman's old seminar. And what would it mean

18:54.960 --> 19:02.080
for the big coiners to start endowing chairs of economics with some direct ability to direct

19:02.080 --> 19:08.240
the field? You guys are giving up certain opportunities which will allow your freedom-based

19:08.240 --> 19:14.240
approach to change everything. So what about a white paper, for example, that examines how a

19:14.240 --> 19:21.520
small capital outlay could fundamentally shift the entire economics profession towards an

19:21.520 --> 19:28.480
understanding that we may need to move away from fiat. And then we were talking about inflation

19:28.480 --> 19:32.480
earlier. I think that's another white paper that's probably important that hasn't been written

19:32.480 --> 19:40.000
exactly. Yes, yeah. A lot of great points there. First, I'd like to say we're going to need a new

19:40.000 --> 19:47.040
word for this Weinstein brand of libertarianism where we all get our own planet. That's taken

19:47.120 --> 19:50.400
private property to a whole new level. So I really hope that comes to pass.

19:53.920 --> 19:59.440
Sounds crazy, but then again, so does digital gold. Yes, indeed. Before inflation, should we

19:59.440 --> 20:04.320
talk about the discovery of the neutron? Because part of what we're talking about here in these

20:04.320 --> 20:11.200
white papers, as you said, the novel inventions or discoveries or proposals that radically change

20:11.200 --> 20:18.960
the world, very high leverage points in time. And an analogy that you drew upon in our preparations

20:18.960 --> 20:22.480
for this was the discovery of the neutron and how that led us into the nuclear age.

20:23.440 --> 20:30.000
And now, I mean, I guess we could just look at AI as the most recent discovery or invention

20:30.640 --> 20:37.440
leading us into a potentially unimaginable future. So and then feel free to segue into

20:37.440 --> 20:42.560
inflation whenever you like. Okay, I like the discovery of the neutron. So we discovered the

20:42.560 --> 20:49.200
neutron in 1932, I think it was Chadwick, maybe it had been proposed by Rutherford. And immediately,

20:49.200 --> 20:56.320
it sets off an intellectual chain reaction. The neutron leads to a proposal of chain reactions

20:56.320 --> 21:02.720
by Lise Meitner, chemist, incredible woman working, I think, in Germany. Enrico Fermi,

21:02.720 --> 21:08.560
at Chicago, comes up with Chicago Pile 1, first controlled nuclear reaction. Oppenheimer takes

21:08.560 --> 21:14.080
the ball to the Trinity test. We drop two devices on our enemy in World War II, Japan,

21:15.600 --> 21:23.840
proving this in the field. And then Teller and Ulam come up with the idea that the bomb that we

21:23.840 --> 21:30.320
drop in Japan is only the detonator for the mega bomb, which takes the shockwave and refocuses

21:30.400 --> 21:35.840
it and leads not to fission but to fusion. So within 20 years from 1932 to, I think it's

21:35.840 --> 21:42.720
November of 52 with Ivy Mike, the first hydrogen bomb, we become gods, whether we like it or not.

21:42.720 --> 21:46.800
We have the power and responsibility of gods. Nobody has ever seen fusion on the surface

21:46.800 --> 21:54.480
of a planet before. And suddenly, within living memory, we see something that only happens on the

21:54.480 --> 22:03.120
sun happened in the Pacific. That's how fast things move when you have a deep insight. And the

22:03.120 --> 22:07.280
idea that you're trapped here and that you think that you will never get off this planet and do

22:07.280 --> 22:12.320
anything really significant within our lifetimes is because you've grown up inside of a stagnation.

22:13.040 --> 22:19.760
Your entire lives have basically been in a stagnation. This is not real life. All your memories

22:19.840 --> 22:28.000
are in a bubble. And I don't know how to say this. What WTF happened in 1971 is really what

22:28.000 --> 22:33.360
WTF happened in the early 70s. And it's not just the gold standard, it's not just Bretton Woods.

22:33.920 --> 22:39.440
It was predicted by Derek DeSola Price. It's a slowdown in the exponential increase in technology

22:39.440 --> 22:46.400
and science. And as a result, we don't realize that between 1902 and 1952, that 50-year span is

22:46.400 --> 22:53.360
effectively 10,000 years. Things change so much. In this span of 50 years, things have been highly

22:53.360 --> 22:58.400
stagnant, except for a tiny number of areas, digital being one of them. So we do see things like

22:58.400 --> 23:04.640
Bitcoin. That seems to be coming to an end. I've called this the Great Knapp. And more or less

23:04.640 --> 23:12.640
since 1945 or 1952, we haven't seen early 20th century events on those scales except for the

23:12.640 --> 23:18.720
disaster of Mao's great leap forward. So we have a wrong idea about war, about our safety,

23:18.720 --> 23:22.800
about what's possible, about how fast things can change. I will point out that there were people

23:22.800 --> 23:28.640
who saw action in the Civil War, who lived to see Ivy Mike, the first H bomb in the Pacific.

23:28.640 --> 23:33.680
So in some sense, the Civil War was almost a nuclear holocaust. Think about it. It's hard to

23:33.680 --> 23:41.520
conceive. With respect to inflation and the monetary supply, it's very interesting that at the exact

23:41.600 --> 23:48.720
same moment, there was a huge spike in M1, there was also a change in the reporting requirements.

23:48.720 --> 23:53.440
So if you say, look at this graph, every academic will pack up, pat themselves in the back and say,

23:53.440 --> 23:58.240
oh, you don't realize there was a discontinuity in the time series. That means nothing. Now,

23:58.240 --> 24:03.120
think about this. That means any time I want to jack up M1, all I have to do is change a

24:03.120 --> 24:06.640
reporting requirement and all the academics will pat themselves in the back saying, oh,

24:06.640 --> 24:12.880
you can't use that series because of a discontinuity. What's more, what's going to tell the impact of

24:12.880 --> 24:20.960
changing the monetary supply? It's the BLS's computation of CPI. And you guys are incentivized

24:20.960 --> 24:28.480
to think about, oh, the number was 7.2, 6.8, which is insane. If I said that the temperature

24:28.480 --> 24:35.760
in the United States was 68 degrees or 68.25, you'd say, what are you talking about? I want to see

24:35.840 --> 24:41.680
a map. It's a field concept. Every meteor, I say field. I was talking to Saylor last night

24:42.320 --> 24:47.120
and he said it's too complicated to say what it really is, which is an element of a group.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.240
Inflation is a group element. He says it's too complicated. I say it's a field.

24:53.440 --> 24:59.840
Well, that field is a concept that everybody who watches television meteorology knows. They see maps,

24:59.840 --> 25:04.960
they see pressure systems, they see temperatures, and we're all sitting around like absolute morons

25:04.960 --> 25:12.080
pretending that this number means something. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics

25:12.080 --> 25:17.360
claims to have moved to a cost of living standard, which is hysterical. That's a very technical

25:17.360 --> 25:23.680
concept. It means that you know the tastes of somebody, how much they prefer coffee to tea.

25:23.680 --> 25:28.800
And so if they can shift their preferences, you don't need to pay them as much in a cost of

25:28.800 --> 25:33.040
living adjustment because they are going to shift what they buy. If you're indifferent between beer

25:33.040 --> 25:37.360
and wine and the price of wine goes up because of grape harvest, you just buy beer. We don't have

25:37.360 --> 25:43.840
to pay you more money. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not maintain taste data. This is a giant

25:43.840 --> 25:50.240
catastrophic lie that is so big within the economics profession. It's like labor shortages.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.480
You've probably read about the labor shortages in technology. There are no labor shortages in

25:54.480 --> 26:01.040
market economies because supply and demand adjust. I have a Bugatti shortage. Why? Because I don't

26:01.040 --> 26:09.520
feel like paying for a Bugatti. So my point to you all is you're living with absolutely

26:09.520 --> 26:14.640
transparent institutional lies, but you're participating in the game every time you try to

26:14.640 --> 26:21.360
guess the CPI release. And so what you're seeing is you're going to have to take over this conversation.

26:21.360 --> 26:25.920
You're going to have to say, look, we don't exactly know what you did because you screwed up the time

26:25.920 --> 26:30.160
series, but that was the wrong moment to change the reporting requirements. If you're going to

26:30.240 --> 26:37.840
say cost of living, where's the taste data? It's called a Conus Las Pairs Index. Get technical,

26:38.560 --> 26:44.480
get informed, endow some chairs, and realize that these white papers have been very frightening

26:44.480 --> 26:50.240
in some cases and very liberating. You're here because of a white paper. And the thing is,

26:50.240 --> 26:55.760
is that we've got to stop pretending that Bitcoin is perfect. We have to realize that it's up to us

26:56.400 --> 27:01.200
to continue to innovate, to build not only on top of it with things like lightning,

27:01.920 --> 27:06.480
but to actually think about what is this technology, how do we use the wealth that is

27:06.480 --> 27:12.560
generated, not only for personal freedom, but also for societal freedom. And I want to say one

27:12.560 --> 27:20.880
thing about this. Oh, thanks. You guys are the best. They don't know how powerful this technology

27:20.960 --> 27:26.800
is, or the violence, the threat of violence against you would be much greater. If you want

27:26.800 --> 27:31.760
Bitcoin to survive, the problem isn't with Bitcoin. The problem is that you're vulnerable

27:31.760 --> 27:37.120
to threats of violence. And so if you're not going to cough up your keys with a gun to your head,

27:37.120 --> 27:42.720
that's fine. But very few people are willing to make that trade off. This is the time to figure

27:42.720 --> 27:48.080
out how to infect the system in a positive way. Instead of viewing them as the enemy,

27:48.080 --> 27:54.400
think about mitochondria inside your cell. If that's a captured bacteria, try to imagine it

27:54.400 --> 28:00.720
as an infection. If you tried to pull the mitochondria out of your cells, you'd take away your ability

28:00.720 --> 28:08.320
to produce ATP through ATP synthase. In other words, the infection is absolutely essential

28:08.320 --> 28:15.280
to life itself. Now is the time to try to infect the system with something positive rather than

28:15.360 --> 28:20.400
treating it as the enemy, so that when it comes with violence to try to shut you down for holding

28:21.200 --> 28:26.640
this instrument, it finds that it can't because it's actually dependent upon you. So that's my

28:26.640 --> 28:31.360
hope for this crypto winter is that when you appear to be weak, when they write articles about how

28:31.360 --> 28:37.680
your conference is shrunk, when they try to make fun of you, have fun getting poor, right? Don't

28:37.680 --> 28:44.720
listen. Take the winter, take the opportunity, run like mad, and try to infect the system in a

28:44.720 --> 28:49.280
positive way rather than viewing them as the enemy, so that they come to thank you later for

28:49.280 --> 28:53.920
the infection just the way your cells think it's mitochondria for making life possible.

28:58.160 --> 29:04.160
Eric Weinstein, Robert Breedlove, thank you for always inspiring us big corners to hire and

29:04.160 --> 29:08.400
greater action. It's not enough just to stack sats and sit and wait. We have to take action,

29:08.400 --> 29:11.600
so thank you. Let's try to make it happen. All right. All right, brother.

29:18.880 --> 29:24.640
Bitcoiners, welcome back to Bitcoin 2023. This is the Bitcoin Magazine live desk

29:24.640 --> 29:30.400
sponsored by Marathon. I am joined by my esteemed co-panelist. At the end, Ben Asgrin,

29:30.400 --> 29:37.680
the mixed martial artist, Chris Cyborg, the Grand Slam Champion, and then Kenny

29:37.760 --> 29:44.400
Florian, former UFC broadcaster. We just listened to Eric Weinstein and Robert Breedlove give a

29:44.400 --> 29:49.360
very big brain gigachad talk. Definitely something I'm going to need to watch a few more times.

29:49.360 --> 29:54.160
But in the beginning, Eric was talking about what's going to hit the ground first, capitalism

29:54.160 --> 29:58.800
or communism. He said communism obviously hit first, capitalism's almost there, and he's a

29:58.800 --> 30:02.320
little worried about what's next to come. Is a Bitcoin standard the next thing to come? I'll

30:02.320 --> 30:08.880
kick it over to you, Ben. Well, I don't see why capitalism and a Bitcoin standard can't coexist.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.880
And one of the things that we think of capitalism is, you know, I was thinking about this a lot

30:12.880 --> 30:18.240
reading Alex Glaston's book about the IMF. Capitalism doesn't really exist in its truest form,

30:18.240 --> 30:24.160
right? Because the IMF gives a loan to a poor country in exchange for that country,

30:24.160 --> 30:28.560
then hiring some firms, right? Those firms aren't picking the ones they want to pick. They're

30:28.560 --> 30:32.720
picking the ones they're forced to pick, right? So it's not true capitalism. So I don't see why

30:32.720 --> 30:36.880
a Bitcoin standard and capitalism can't coexist. Yeah, we definitely have crony capitalism right

30:36.880 --> 30:42.480
now. So Eric was calling Bitcoiners too communistic for me. He said, because we share the same airs,

30:42.480 --> 30:46.720
the CCP, and basically said we all need our own planets. Chris, what are your thoughts? Is Bitcoin

30:46.720 --> 30:50.880
a communist thing or is Bitcoin a good thing? I'd love your thoughts, Chris. I believe Bitcoin is

30:50.880 --> 30:56.800
a good thing. I believe it's a freedom for the people and I and limitate. I really, I really

30:56.800 --> 31:01.920
enjoy having the Bitcoin. Definitely. It's not enough for a person to think of personal freedom,

31:01.920 --> 31:06.320
but to endow rulers is something that Eric was saying. He said, but Bitcoin is rules without

31:06.320 --> 31:12.560
rulers. Kenny, I'd love your thoughts on basically Eric's ideology, trying to force us to implement

31:12.560 --> 31:18.000
rulers. What are your thoughts on that? He wants to implement rulers over Bitcoin or? Yeah, he was

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
saying basically that he was like, it's not enough to just like Bitcoin to be on its own. He's like,

31:22.000 --> 31:27.120
this is your opportunity to strike and basically to implement. I think finance minister is kind of

31:27.120 --> 31:32.080
what he was saying. When has it ever gone wrong when humans get involved? I think that's brilliant.

31:32.080 --> 31:37.600
No, I strongly disagree with that. I mean, listen, we're in the situation we're in because humans

31:37.600 --> 31:43.120
have screwed it all up. And I think that's what makes Bitcoin so powerful, right? Is we do not

31:43.120 --> 31:50.720
have to rely on the faults of humans to make poor mistakes, to be corrupted by the money itself.

31:50.720 --> 31:58.320
It is ruled by math and and it's absolute and truthful. So yeah, I think this is why Bitcoin

31:58.320 --> 32:05.200
is what it is. I think to inject humans into the equation, I think only make it more complicated

32:05.200 --> 32:10.960
and more screwed up. Yeah, definitely. He also mentioned WTF happened in 1971. That is a great

32:10.960 --> 32:15.360
website. I recommend people go checking it out beforehand. But he basically said from 1971 to

32:15.360 --> 32:21.200
about 2020 or 2021. He said we've basically seen 10,000 years of growth. But he says he believes

32:21.200 --> 32:24.960
the next 50 years are going to be more stagnant. But those of us on a Bitcoin standard have

32:24.960 --> 32:30.640
said this 50 years and the next is going to be huge. Yeah, I think that's what he's implying. But

32:30.640 --> 32:34.400
basically, do you see being on a Bitcoin standard? We're seeing all this growth. Yeah, maybe the

32:34.400 --> 32:38.080
conference has gone down in size, but we've seen a growth in the network. We've seen blocks still

32:38.080 --> 32:43.840
keep coming in. Ben, to you. Well, I want to go back to the endowing the chairs at economics

32:43.920 --> 32:49.040
universities. I feel like Bitcoin is different and we don't need to play the old game and we can

32:49.040 --> 32:53.920
play our own game. And I think a lot about what they're doing in El Salvador. That's a script flip.

32:53.920 --> 32:58.320
That was Naib saying, IMF, get lost. We're not playing your game. We're going to play a little

32:58.320 --> 33:03.200
bit of a different game. And I don't see why we can't do that. Why do we need old institutions

33:03.200 --> 33:07.680
to validate our thoughts that we're having right now? Why can't we do it a little bit of a different

33:07.680 --> 33:13.120
way? And that's still be valid. Yeah, definitely. He was basically calling out a lot of the media

33:13.120 --> 33:18.160
companies that are publishing that this event has shrunk and calling them have fun getting poor

33:18.160 --> 33:22.400
referring to Bitcoiners. But he says, take their criticism and grow the network and propagate.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.320
And this is our time to build in the crypto winter, as he called it. Kenny, your thoughts on that?

33:27.920 --> 33:33.600
Yeah, I mean, listen, I think what it comes down to is we need to build our own ecosystem, build

33:33.600 --> 33:39.600
our own thing and get people to play our game, kind of like what Ben said. And yeah, I think it's

33:39.600 --> 33:44.240
a real possibility. I think that not only game theory will indicate that ultimately they will

33:44.240 --> 33:49.360
do that, but I think people are throughout time are looking for the best technology and whatever

33:49.360 --> 33:53.840
it is. And I think Bitcoin will ultimately prove that it is the best technology. And I think there's

33:53.840 --> 33:58.720
still a lot of education to happen on that. Definitely. We're about to go back to the Nakamoto

33:58.720 --> 34:05.120
stage. Stick with us after this short break. Thank you, Miami, for the last three years in this

34:05.120 --> 34:11.760
amazing city. The whole world shut down. But Miami welcomed us with open arms.

34:12.720 --> 34:19.520
We want to show Bitcoin to the whole world. We are taking the conference on the roads

34:19.520 --> 34:22.560
to set the stage for Bitcoin in a new city.

34:22.560 --> 34:40.800
Bitcoin 2024 is coming to Nashville in Tennessee,

34:40.800 --> 34:48.800
a city that is known as a music and freedom city. Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville from July 25th to 27th.
