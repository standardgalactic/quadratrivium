0	7520	So, in 1964, Arthur C. Dotto, an American philosopher, walked into the stable gallery
7520	13000	in New York City and saw something that took him about 20 years to process.
13000	18420	But once he had, he declared that what he saw that day was the end of art.
18420	21740	He saw that art had reached its conclusion.
21740	26960	He spent the following years developing this idea in articles and books, and since then,
26960	29720	it's become a very influential theory in the history of art.
29720	33600	To explain it, we're going to have to go deep into the history of art, discuss Plato,
33600	37900	we'll dip into Hegel for a bit, and hopefully by the end of it, you may even find a way
37900	44060	to enjoy contemporary art, even though, according to Dotto, art finished more than a half century
44060	45060	ago.
45060	47260	And if this sounds like it's your kind of thing, you may want to subscribe or visit
47260	52260	my Patreon page, I put out a new video every month, let's just jump right into Dotto's
52260	61480	theory of the end of art.
61480	66320	So let's start with a couple basic ideas from art history, some stories that art tells
66320	68040	about itself.
68040	72720	It's often said that Giorgio Vasari's The Lives of Artists is the first work of intentional
72720	73720	art history.
73720	78680	It provides biographies of painters and generally follows a narrative that each successive painter
78680	82140	is building on the innovations of previous artists.
82140	86940	Giotto builds on Chimabui, Francesca builds on Giotto, and so on.
86940	91540	The implication here is that art is always progressing towards something.
91540	97340	In Vasari's work, it feels like art is progressing towards Michelangelo, but more broadly, it's
97340	101460	progressing towards what Dotto called perceptual equivalency.
101460	106740	The goal of art is to have the images look as realistic as possible.
106800	111640	So that's the first point that I want to establish before we move on.
111640	115760	Early art history had a particular story about itself, that if it moved forward, it moved
115760	118360	towards more accurate representations of reality.
118360	122080	The second concept that I want to establish at the start of this video is that art is
122080	124920	connected to a time and place.
124920	129440	The art historian Michael Baxendahl began his classic book Art and Experience in 15th
129440	136680	Century Italy with a line, a 15th century painting is the deposit of a social relationship.
136680	142740	In other words, it's the product of a system of exchange, patron, artist, audience, and
142740	147740	through that exchange the painting comes to represent the values of its time period.
147740	150020	It's a record of those relationships.
150020	154740	More broadly, what is considered a work of art in a given time and place is the result
154740	159660	of a consensus between members of what Dotto calls the art world.
159660	164560	So in the 15th century, to keep that example going, the art world consists of painters
164560	169240	and sculptors, sure, but also the patrons who commissioned the work, the craftsmen who
169240	173740	work in the studios of the artists, the religious scholars who might comment on the work, the
173740	178260	politicians who might censor the work, and the general community that will engage with
178260	179620	the work when it's produced.
179620	185340	So for example, Botticelli's The Birth of Venus takes a pagan goddess as its subject,
185340	191140	unthinkable just a few years before it was painted, but the Medici patrons and artists
191320	195080	and the intellectuals of the time period kind of agreed that a painting like this could
195080	197720	be art, and therefore it's art.
197720	202680	A hundred years later, Baroque art would be fashionable as part of the counter-reformation.
202680	207480	The standard and quality of art would be judged not by the same standards of the high renaissance,
207480	209480	but with the standards of the Baroque.
209480	214640	So a pagan goddess might be seen as heresy rather than art, and so artists like Michelangelo,
214640	219680	who had no problem creating works of pagan deities in the 15th century, might stop doing
219740	222340	that in the 16th century.
222340	225900	Societies have changing values, and those values are reflected in the art world.
225900	228100	So art is connected to history.
228100	230900	If you study art history, then you study those connections.
230900	233340	Oftentimes, it's done in a way that I just did.
233340	238020	You name a place and a time, Italy in the 15th century, you name the artistic movement,
238020	242940	the high renaissance, and you analyze the work based on that cultural context and using
242940	245700	the standards of that particular movement.
245720	250840	Judging high renaissance art by the standards of say, impressionism would make little sense.
250840	254480	So when we say Botticelli was a painter of the high renaissance, that gives us a way
254480	256000	to understand his paintings.
256000	260240	It gives us a general understanding of his artistic project, and with that understanding,
260240	262200	we're provided the tools to analyze his work.
262200	264280	Okay, so those two points established.
264280	268360	Art has a sense of its own progression through time, and that art history connects art to
268360	270520	time and place of production.
270520	272960	Now let's dig into Danto's argument.
272960	276140	He's a philosopher, so we'll have to begin with philosophy.
278700	282780	Famously, the philosopher Plato adhered to the memetic theory of art.
282780	287620	He believed that a work of art should have perceptual equivalency, that good art looks
287620	289540	like a mirror of the world.
289540	293220	This was influential for Vasari's understanding of art's progress, for example.
293220	299060	But Plato also thought that art is kind of useless, and this is an important starting
299060	300620	place for Danto.
300620	305560	It's the start of what he calls the philosophic disenfranchisement of art.
305560	309920	So according to Plato, the world that we see every day is just a reflection of the higher
309920	311520	realm of ideal forms.
311520	316120	It's like every chair that we see is just a reflection of an ideal chair that lives
316120	320840	in our mind, and this allows us to identify a chair in the physical world.
320840	325000	Like we have an idea of a chair in our heads, and then we see one, and we know what it is
325000	328320	because we have a bucket to put it into in our heads.
328340	331940	It doesn't matter what it's made of, or what color it is, it reflects our understanding
331940	333460	of what a chair should be.
333460	337420	Similarly, every right triangle that we encounter in the physical world is only a reflection
337420	341980	of the ideal right triangle that can be studied with reason and geometry.
341980	346140	By studying that ideal right triangle, using our capacity for deductive reasoning, we can
346140	349100	understand any right triangle in the physical world.
349100	354060	So if we want to understand our physical existence, we should study the truth, we should pursue
354060	359640	the study of ideal forms and mathematics and so on, focusing on our reason rather than
359640	360880	our perception.
360880	367440	Furthermore, in Book 10 of his Republic, Plato has Socrates define artists as an imitator
367440	370120	of that which others make.
370120	375760	So if reality is just a reflection and art is an imitation of that reflection, then artists
375760	381920	are just producing reflections of reflections, and that, for Plato and Socrates, is moving
381920	383400	in the wrong direction.
383400	386540	It takes us further from the truth, not closer.
386540	388980	It's the opposite of truth, it's a lie.
388980	392380	So we can safely ignore art, it's useless.
392380	396820	And we can make the argument that this started a long tradition of philosophers belittling
396820	403500	art, even when they discuss it positively, and like, I get it, what does art actually
403500	404500	do?
404500	410260	Kant, for example, once said that art is purposive without purpose, that its purpose
410260	413060	is only its intention to be made.
413060	416720	It doesn't do anything other than exist as a creation.
416720	421400	Like take Picasso's masterpiece, Guernica, considered by many to be one of the greatest
421400	423320	works of art in the 20th century.
423320	428540	The painting illustrates the terror bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.
428540	430520	Did this painting stop any bombs?
430520	434600	Did Franco's troops see this painting and have a crisis of conscious and lay down their
434600	436200	guns?
436200	438080	I think that you know the answer to that.
438080	443860	Arthardanto says now that the purpose of Guernica is to be a handsome backdrop for pickups at
443860	449900	the Museum of Modern Art, or a place to meet a date like the clock at the Biltmore Hotel,
449900	454580	to ornament the kitchen cupboard in the sophisticated apartments that I saw written up.
454580	458900	So for the philosopher of art, Arthardanto, Guernica, perhaps the most powerful work of
458900	463900	art of the last century, these days serves no greater purpose than an identifiable pickup
463900	466100	spot or decoration.
466100	468120	That's what art ultimately does.
468120	472200	And philosophers aren't the only ones to think art is useless either.
472200	477760	I made a video recently about W.H. Auden's view that poetry makes nothing happen.
477760	482640	The argument here is that art can reflect things that exist but can't actually do anything
482640	483920	about them.
483920	490360	Dotto asks, did jazz in any sense cause or only emblemize the moral transformations of
490360	491800	the jazz age?
491800	497580	Did the Beatles cause or only prefigure the political perturbations of the 60s?
497580	501580	Art is a product of its time, not an influence on its time.
501580	503580	It doesn't actually do anything.
503580	505820	Okay, so art is weak.
505820	510020	It has no power to affect any kind of real change or do anything at all.
510020	512660	Everyone seems to agree, from philosophers to poets.
512660	514220	Fine, I get it.
514220	516940	But then, what's all this censorship about?
516940	520780	Why did Botticelli feel like he needed to throw some of his pagan inspired paintings
520800	523040	into a fire in 1497?
523040	525040	Why do politicians ban books?
525040	529440	Why did Plato and Socrates ban poets from their perfect utopian republic?
529440	534520	If the arts are so impotent, why are they also perceived as being so dangerous?
534520	540520	Well, Dotto's thesis in the philosophic disenfranchisement of art is that it does not come from historical
540520	543800	knowledge but rather from a philosophical belief.
543800	549760	Representing art as something that in its nature can make nothing happen is not so much
549780	553260	a view opposed to the view that art is dangerous.
553260	558900	It is a way of responding to the sensed danger of art by treating it metaphysically as though
558900	561700	there were nothing to be afraid of.
561700	568460	So in other words, the sense that art might be dangerous caused the philosophical position
568460	571260	that art is not dangerous.
571260	575100	Philosophers feared the power of art and so they belittled it and created narratives and
575100	577500	frameworks to keep it at a distance.
577500	581360	If you tell artists that they were useless enough times, maybe they'll even believe
581360	582360	it.
582360	584240	I'm looking at you, Winston Hewauden.
584240	590360	Philosophy disenfranchised art by constructing a narrative of art's uselessness and it worked.
590360	595480	So when philosophy excluded the arts from the realm of reason and utility, the arts
595480	599520	responded by taking up shop in the realm of expression and emotion.
599520	604960	Art could use its memetic properties to imbue people or events with emotionally expressive
604960	606200	resonance.
606200	609020	It can tell you how you should feel about something.
609020	612060	This king, for example, is really cool and strong.
612060	615780	This battle was really important and people acted heroically.
615780	619780	This bombing was really terrible and caused people a lot of pain.
619780	624140	If we accept that this is the purpose that art has been relegated to, then we need to
624140	627980	understand how that changed the idea of progress in the arts.
627980	632180	So let's return to that philosophy of art's progress that I articulated earlier and follow
632180	637960	Danto's argument all the way to the end of art.
637960	642240	So Vasari's account, and many others in the European tradition of art history, tells
642240	645760	the story of increasingly lifelike depictions of reality.
645760	648920	Again, what Danto called perceptual equivalence.
648920	653920	Techniques like geometric perspective or foreshortening are advancements in this progress.
653920	657960	They help art move towards that goal, towards its end.
657980	660660	So Giotto is more realistic than Shimabui.
660660	662700	Botticelli bests them both.
662700	666020	Michelangelo is better at capturing movement and tension.
666020	670580	Caravaggio isn't afraid to paint the dust on feet or use people outside his door as
670580	676380	models and the story goes on, ever closer to perceptual equivalence.
676380	680180	But then, of course, the camera was invented.
680180	684300	Shortly after that, the moving picture was invented, and no one is going to be able to
684300	687940	paint movement better than a moving picture can capture it.
687940	693000	Painting can no longer compete in that game of perceptual equivalence.
693000	698520	So it had to lean even harder into that expressive and emotional realm.
698520	702200	Art became intensely emotional after this.
702200	707040	Expressionism becomes more than just a purpose, it becomes part of the formal qualities of
707040	708040	the painting.
708040	712400	Art becomes intensely emotional after the invention of the camera.
712400	717160	Expression becomes more than just a purpose of art, it becomes part of the formal qualities
717180	718340	of the painting.
718340	723380	Like following Danto's lead, let's take this painting from 1906 by Matisse.
723380	727720	A hundred years earlier, this painting would not be considered worthy of a gallery.
727720	732420	If we hold it to the strictly memetic standards of art, this doesn't look anything like the
732420	734540	reflection of a real person.
734540	739220	So the art world of 1906 must have been holding it to a very different standard.
739220	744500	The formal goal of art must have shifted fully, from representing to expressing.
744520	748000	And according to the standards of expression, this can be categorized as art by the art
748000	749000	world.
749000	750000	There's no problem there.
750000	755080	As Danto says, the green stripe tries to get us to see how Matisse felt about the subject
755080	761540	shown, his own wife, calling for a complex act of interpretation on the part of the viewer.
761540	763840	And in this way, art can still progress.
763840	768520	It can still move forward and continually improve toward a goal or standard.
768520	774120	Painting can become more expressive, it can more accurately communicate or provoke emotions.
774120	778900	From this perspective, Impressionism and the various art forms that Expressionism took
778900	780780	illustrates that progress.
780780	784980	So establishing that the art world can still make progress towards a goal, Danto makes
784980	789220	an interesting move here by looking at the idea of progress in the art world through
789220	795020	the philosophy of an Enlightenment-era thinker named GWF Hegel.
795020	797460	So we're going to need to dip into some Hegel now.
800020	802780	So Hegel had a very particular philosophy of history.
802780	806600	He viewed it as a dialectic, so let's define that term first.
806600	809640	Plato's dialogues are a good example of a dialectic.
809640	814680	In those works, Socrates will pose a question and one of his friends will propose an answer.
814680	816800	They will propose a thesis.
816800	819000	Socrates will then refute that thesis.
819000	822400	He will provide us with an antithesis, an antithesis.
822400	825960	And in the resulting discussion of back and forth, eventually a middle ground will be
825960	828120	reached and he calls that a synthesis.
828120	831840	Hegel viewed history as like a giant dialectic.
831840	835860	He saw that the culture and ideology of a given time and place proposed a system of
835860	840460	values, an aesthetic, a set of trends across diverse fields that includes everything from
840460	843540	political systems to the games that children play.
843540	849140	Those values and trends are then criticized or negated in some way by successive or contemporary
849140	850140	cultures.
850140	853700	There are reactions to the norms of any given system.
853700	858260	That conversation between a cultural system and the reactions to that cultural system
858260	859860	are a dialectic.
859880	863800	At some point a compromise is found between the two and that compromise becomes a new
863800	866280	thesis and the process begins again.
866280	870800	So for a quick example, Catholicism in the 15th century said that there is no salvation
870800	872200	outside of the church.
872200	876600	Then Martin Luther comes along and presents that an antithesis, saying that salvation
876600	879720	can be achieved by individuals through faith alone.
879720	884120	And as a result of this dialectic between thesis and antithesis, Europe eventually finds
884120	889120	a peace in the Treaty of Westphalia, which neuters the question altogether by subordinating
889120	893060	the question of salvation to the judgment of secular governments.
893060	897860	Loyalty to the nation-state replaces loyalty to the church hierarchically and that becomes
897860	898860	the new thesis.
898860	904380	So Hegel's dialectics is a framework for understanding non-linear progress.
904380	906840	But Hegel thought of it as much more than a framework.
906840	910740	For him, this dialectic is a path towards self-discovery.
910740	914060	This path will lead humanity to an understanding of itself.
914060	918460	Like this giant conversation between cultures could theoretically have an ending.
918460	923480	All the disagreements could be reconciled in this ongoing conversation, and history could
923480	926800	have an ending just as Plato's dialogues find conclusions.
926800	930440	Danto uses this framework to view the development of art.
930440	936000	He sees that within this progress of history towards self-knowledge is the story of art.
936000	940960	One artistic movement proposes certain values, like those of the High Renaissance and Botticelli.
940960	945400	Then a counter-argument is proposed by somebody like Savonarola or Martin Luther, and we get
945400	948100	a third proposition in the Baroque.
948100	951040	This becomes the new thesis, and the cycle continues.
951040	954740	So if this is the way that the art world works, if that's like the way that progress actually
954740	960280	works and not in that linear way that Vasari thought, then art can actually have an ending.
960280	962520	That conversation could have a conclusion.
962520	969120	And Danto thought that he witnessed it in 1964.
969120	972760	So what exactly happened in the Stable Gallery in 1964?
972760	976840	Well, he saw Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes.
976860	981900	These boxes were made to look exactly like the boxes delivered to stores that sold Brillo
981900	983220	Pads.
983220	987060	Andy Warhol believed that he could have an aesthetic experience in a warehouse and tried
987060	990060	to recreate that experience in an art gallery.
990060	996500	The boxes asked us to consider that experience worthy of our attention, as full of potential
996500	1000980	meaning, and to consider that experience as part of the ongoing discussion about what
1000980	1005980	art is and what it can be and what it means to be categorized as such.
1006000	1011800	About a half century before these Brillo Boxes inspired Danto, Marcel Duchamp used his position
1011800	1014720	as an artist to ask similar questions.
1014720	1020320	In this work, provocatively entitled In the Advance of a Broken Arm, a snow shovel hangs
1020320	1021320	from the ceiling.
1021320	1025680	That's what it is, a snow shovel that he probably picked up at the hardware store and
1025680	1028080	hung it from a ceiling in an art gallery.
1028080	1030600	He called this type of art ready-made art.
1030600	1034640	The shovel had artistic value because he decided that it had artistic value.
1034660	1039580	And this forces the question of why some objects are considered art and other objects that
1039580	1044580	look similar or literally exactly the same are not considered art.
1044580	1048460	When do we decide that something should be considered meaningful?
1048460	1053980	Like this image of the Mona Lisa on my screen right now is not art, but the Mona Lisa that
1053980	1055980	hangs in the Louvre is.
1055980	1061660	A Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls jersey is commonplace, but the jersey that Michael Jordan wore when
1061680	1063600	he won his first championship?
1063600	1064960	That thing has value.
1064960	1067000	We invest it with meaning.
1067000	1069720	So why and how do we do that?
1069720	1073720	This type of question can be extended into other parts of the human experience.
1073720	1078720	Why and how do I remember some experiences but forget others nearly identical?
1078720	1082120	Duchamp's ready-mades ask philosophic questions.
1082120	1086480	Danto tries to place Duchamp's ready-made art within that greater dialectic of art
1086480	1087640	and history.
1087640	1092740	He says, there is a deep question of what internal evolution in the history of art made
1092740	1099020	Duchamp's question object historically possible, if not historically necessary.
1099020	1104980	My view is that it could only come at a time when it no longer could be clear to anyone
1104980	1110740	what art was while perfectly clear that none of the old answers would serve.
1110740	1116500	The old answers, that art is working towards the goal of perceptual equivalence, or that
1116520	1120200	it communicates emotion, were no longer sufficient.
1120200	1125600	That centuries-old dialectic of art trying to find itself ends with Andy Warhol's Brillo
1125600	1131480	Boxes as the fulfillment of Duchamp's project, because at that point we see that the end
1131480	1136440	of art is the philosophy of art, a philosophy of meaning-making.
1136440	1143000	Or in Danto's words, Hegel's stupendous philosophic vision of history gets, or almost
1143020	1148980	yet, an astounding confirmation in Duchamp's work, which raises the question of the philosophical
1148980	1156820	nature of art from within art, implying that art already is philosophy in a vivid form,
1156820	1162020	and has now discharged its spiritual mission by revealing the philosophical essence at
1162020	1163300	its heart.
1163300	1168660	So what art finally will have achieved as its fulfillment and fruition is the philosophy
1168660	1169740	of art.
1169760	1175000	So art becomes self-actualized like the hero of a coming-of-age story.
1175000	1179920	Early art recognized its role in ritual and meaning-making, and then philosophy issued
1179920	1181560	its challenge.
1181560	1185120	Philosophy worked to construct an identity of art's impotence, and the history of art
1185120	1189120	since then has been a story of its self-rediscovery.
1189120	1194080	Despite philosophy's attempts to belittle it, to disenfranchise it, art reveals itself
1194080	1199000	to have been an investigation into the nature of reality the whole time.
1199000	1205340	It's a way to ask big questions about knowledge, the search for meaning, the process of becoming,
1205340	1208100	the foundation of ethics, and so on.
1208100	1209620	I hope you get the point.
1209620	1213780	Art is, and always has been, a potent form of philosophy.
1213780	1216820	It just becomes aware of that in the 1960s.
1216820	1223100	So now that this conversation is over, now that art ended, what now?
1223880	1230000	Duchamp said that one of his goals was to stop making retinol art.
1230000	1234240	He didn't want to make art interesting to look at, but instead interesting to think
1234240	1235240	about.
1235240	1237840	A lot of contemporary art is like this.
1237840	1239840	It's aware that it's philosophy.
1239840	1244240	When I read art theory books, it usually takes me a longer time than usual because the author
1244240	1247320	will mention a painting or a sculpture or whatever, and then I need to go look that
1247320	1250600	thing up before I return to the article.
1250600	1253380	Not when referencing a work of contemporary art.
1253380	1256660	Typically a simple description is enough, like, I don't need you to show me a picture
1256660	1258540	of Duchamp's artwork, The Fountain.
1258540	1263220	I can just tell you that it's a urinal Duchamp signed and put into a gallery, and that he
1263220	1264700	didn't even sign his own name.
1264700	1267060	The description of the work should be enough, I'm not even going to put it on the screen
1267060	1268060	right now.
1268060	1269820	It's just a urinal turned on its side with a signature.
1269820	1274020	And a couple months ago, I published a video about the work of Anika Yi.
1274020	1278380	Much of her artwork is perishable, like it won't last beyond a few months.
1278380	1283720	The work is not so much about the enduring physical object, but, as I argue in that video,
1283720	1287920	it's wrestling with the same questions that philosophers of eco-feminism wrestle with.
1287920	1292000	It's giving a physical form to those ideas and providing a public point of contact for
1292000	1294640	those ideas outside of academic journals.
1294640	1298800	And Anika Yi is a major contemporary artist who recently had a months-long commission
1298800	1301560	inside the Tate Modern Turbine Hall.
1301560	1306360	This is a prestigious commission given to only the most exciting contemporary artists.
1306360	1312220	The previous artist to hold that same commission in that same space was Kara Walker.
1312220	1317260	These two artists do not share many visual similarities, and yet, they're two of the
1317260	1320060	most important living artists today.
1320060	1324180	That's what's going on in the 2020s art world, a lot of differences.
1324180	1328820	And if we compare that to like a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, there you're
1328820	1332660	going to see a lot of Renaissance art and you will also see all the similarities between
1332660	1333940	those artists.
1333940	1337880	As we go to a gallery like the MoMA, we can categorize a bunch of the paintings as Cubist
1337880	1343040	or Impressionist or Geometric Abstraction, but what exactly is Anika Yi?
1343040	1346400	What exact movement is Kara Walker working within?
1346400	1348320	We don't have a good answer for that.
1348320	1351240	So what does art look like after the end of art?
1351240	1354480	Well, one answer is that it looks like philosophy.
1354480	1357400	Another answer is that it looks like pluralism.
1357400	1362120	We can analyze an Impressionist painting using the standards of Impressionist movements,
1362120	1365460	but we don't have those same rubrics for contemporary art.
1365460	1369260	This might be why so many people struggle with it, but I for one think that it's pretty
1369260	1370260	cool.
1370260	1375220	It's liberating, the gate keeping that artistic movements and manifestos created by artists
1375220	1376900	have been eliminated.
1376900	1380380	Artists can look like themselves rather than looking like a good expression of whatever
1380380	1382780	artistic movement is fashionable at the time.
1382780	1387020	Like, it's pretty cool that Anika Yi can have robots float around in the same exact
1387040	1392880	space that Kara Walker just a few months earlier made the invisible narratives of public monuments
1392880	1395200	visible in a really powerful way.
1395200	1397680	Those two works of art aren't easily categorized.
1397680	1400000	They're doing something original, they're doing something different, they're doing
1400000	1401520	something that's important to them.
1401520	1406600	Okay, so like, an obvious criticism of Danto's philosophy is that the story he tells about
1406600	1411120	art is Eurocentric, but the conclusion of that story that he tells allow us for the
1411120	1415400	world to consider a lot of different approaches often outside of European traditions.
1415400	1420500	The closing paragraph of his essay, The End of Art, includes the following lines.
1420500	1422620	The age of pluralism is upon us.
1422620	1426740	It does not matter anymore what you do, which is what pluralism means.
1426740	1431980	When one direction is as good as another direction, there is no concept of direction any longer
1431980	1433380	to apply.
1433380	1438260	Decoration, self-expression, entertainment are of course abiding human needs.
1438260	1444420	There will always be a service for art to perform if artists are content with that.
1444420	1447600	Time ends in its own fulfillment.
1447600	1450760	Now there are many reasons to question Danto's account of art.
1450760	1455320	It's Eurocentric, it claims to be about all art, but really it seems to just be about
1455320	1458600	painting and possibly sculpture sometimes.
1458600	1463440	And anytime that you invoke Hegel, you're invoking big macro narratives of history that
1463440	1467720	kind of fall apart once you dig into the internal arguments within the cultures that you've
1467720	1470120	used a broad brush to explain.
1470300	1475100	Historians of the early modern period do not view the art of the high renaissance as broadly
1475100	1477900	homogenous as Danto's narrative would imply.
1477900	1483700	There are many more criticisms to discuss, but this video has already gone on too long.
1483700	1488100	That said, I still find Danto's account useful to think about contemporary art.
1488100	1493380	I find it useful to think about contemporary art as asking philosophical questions or possibly
1493380	1498100	offering answers to the ongoing referendums of philosophy, like the nature of reality
1498100	1500960	or the ways that we construct meaning or understanding in the world.
1500960	1504880	And this account actually helps me appreciate contemporary art even more, and I think that
1504880	1506640	that's where I'll end this one.
1506640	1510320	So if you stayed for the whole thing, thank you for watching, I'll see you next month.
