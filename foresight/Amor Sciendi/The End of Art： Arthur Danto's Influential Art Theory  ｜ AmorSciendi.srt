1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
So, in 1964, Arthur C. Dotto, an American philosopher, walked into the stable gallery

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,000
in New York City and saw something that took him about 20 years to process.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,420
But once he had, he declared that what he saw that day was the end of art.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,740
He saw that art had reached its conclusion.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,960
He spent the following years developing this idea in articles and books, and since then,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,720
it's become a very influential theory in the history of art.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,600
To explain it, we're going to have to go deep into the history of art, discuss Plato,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,900
we'll dip into Hegel for a bit, and hopefully by the end of it, you may even find a way

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:44,060
to enjoy contemporary art, even though, according to Dotto, art finished more than a half century

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,060
ago.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,260
And if this sounds like it's your kind of thing, you may want to subscribe or visit

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,260
my Patreon page, I put out a new video every month, let's just jump right into Dotto's

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:01,480
theory of the end of art.

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,320
So let's start with a couple basic ideas from art history, some stories that art tells

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,040
about itself.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,720
It's often said that Giorgio Vasari's The Lives of Artists is the first work of intentional

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
art history.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,680
It provides biographies of painters and generally follows a narrative that each successive painter

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,140
is building on the innovations of previous artists.

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,940
Giotto builds on Chimabui, Francesca builds on Giotto, and so on.

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,540
The implication here is that art is always progressing towards something.

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,340
In Vasari's work, it feels like art is progressing towards Michelangelo, but more broadly, it's

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,460
progressing towards what Dotto called perceptual equivalency.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,740
The goal of art is to have the images look as realistic as possible.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,640
So that's the first point that I want to establish before we move on.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,760
Early art history had a particular story about itself, that if it moved forward, it moved

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,360
towards more accurate representations of reality.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,080
The second concept that I want to establish at the start of this video is that art is

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,920
connected to a time and place.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,440
The art historian Michael Baxendahl began his classic book Art and Experience in 15th

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,680
Century Italy with a line, a 15th century painting is the deposit of a social relationship.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,740
In other words, it's the product of a system of exchange, patron, artist, audience, and

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,740
through that exchange the painting comes to represent the values of its time period.

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,020
It's a record of those relationships.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,740
More broadly, what is considered a work of art in a given time and place is the result

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,660
of a consensus between members of what Dotto calls the art world.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,560
So in the 15th century, to keep that example going, the art world consists of painters

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,240
and sculptors, sure, but also the patrons who commissioned the work, the craftsmen who

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,740
work in the studios of the artists, the religious scholars who might comment on the work, the

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,260
politicians who might censor the work, and the general community that will engage with

41
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,620
the work when it's produced.

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,340
So for example, Botticelli's The Birth of Venus takes a pagan goddess as its subject,

43
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,140
unthinkable just a few years before it was painted, but the Medici patrons and artists

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,080
and the intellectuals of the time period kind of agreed that a painting like this could

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,720
be art, and therefore it's art.

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,680
A hundred years later, Baroque art would be fashionable as part of the counter-reformation.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,480
The standard and quality of art would be judged not by the same standards of the high renaissance,

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
but with the standards of the Baroque.

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,640
So a pagan goddess might be seen as heresy rather than art, and so artists like Michelangelo,

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,680
who had no problem creating works of pagan deities in the 15th century, might stop doing

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,340
that in the 16th century.

52
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,900
Societies have changing values, and those values are reflected in the art world.

53
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,100
So art is connected to history.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,900
If you study art history, then you study those connections.

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,340
Oftentimes, it's done in a way that I just did.

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,020
You name a place and a time, Italy in the 15th century, you name the artistic movement,

57
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,940
the high renaissance, and you analyze the work based on that cultural context and using

58
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,700
the standards of that particular movement.

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,840
Judging high renaissance art by the standards of say, impressionism would make little sense.

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,480
So when we say Botticelli was a painter of the high renaissance, that gives us a way

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
to understand his paintings.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,240
It gives us a general understanding of his artistic project, and with that understanding,

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,200
we're provided the tools to analyze his work.

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,280
Okay, so those two points established.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,360
Art has a sense of its own progression through time, and that art history connects art to

66
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,520
time and place of production.

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,960
Now let's dig into Danto's argument.

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,140
He's a philosopher, so we'll have to begin with philosophy.

69
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,780
Famously, the philosopher Plato adhered to the memetic theory of art.

70
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,620
He believed that a work of art should have perceptual equivalency, that good art looks

71
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,540
like a mirror of the world.

72
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,220
This was influential for Vasari's understanding of art's progress, for example.

73
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,060
But Plato also thought that art is kind of useless, and this is an important starting

74
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,620
place for Danto.

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,560
It's the start of what he calls the philosophic disenfranchisement of art.

76
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,920
So according to Plato, the world that we see every day is just a reflection of the higher

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
realm of ideal forms.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,120
It's like every chair that we see is just a reflection of an ideal chair that lives

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,840
in our mind, and this allows us to identify a chair in the physical world.

80
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,000
Like we have an idea of a chair in our heads, and then we see one, and we know what it is

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,320
because we have a bucket to put it into in our heads.

82
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,940
It doesn't matter what it's made of, or what color it is, it reflects our understanding

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,460
of what a chair should be.

84
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,420
Similarly, every right triangle that we encounter in the physical world is only a reflection

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,980
of the ideal right triangle that can be studied with reason and geometry.

86
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,140
By studying that ideal right triangle, using our capacity for deductive reasoning, we can

87
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,100
understand any right triangle in the physical world.

88
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,060
So if we want to understand our physical existence, we should study the truth, we should pursue

89
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,640
the study of ideal forms and mathematics and so on, focusing on our reason rather than

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,880
our perception.

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,440
Furthermore, in Book 10 of his Republic, Plato has Socrates define artists as an imitator

92
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,120
of that which others make.

93
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,760
So if reality is just a reflection and art is an imitation of that reflection, then artists

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,920
are just producing reflections of reflections, and that, for Plato and Socrates, is moving

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,400
in the wrong direction.

96
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,540
It takes us further from the truth, not closer.

97
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,980
It's the opposite of truth, it's a lie.

98
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,380
So we can safely ignore art, it's useless.

99
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,820
And we can make the argument that this started a long tradition of philosophers belittling

100
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:43,500
art, even when they discuss it positively, and like, I get it, what does art actually

101
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
do?

102
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,260
Kant, for example, once said that art is purposive without purpose, that its purpose

103
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,060
is only its intention to be made.

104
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,720
It doesn't do anything other than exist as a creation.

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,400
Like take Picasso's masterpiece, Guernica, considered by many to be one of the greatest

106
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,320
works of art in the 20th century.

107
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,540
The painting illustrates the terror bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.

108
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,520
Did this painting stop any bombs?

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,600
Did Franco's troops see this painting and have a crisis of conscious and lay down their

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
guns?

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,080
I think that you know the answer to that.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,860
Arthardanto says now that the purpose of Guernica is to be a handsome backdrop for pickups at

113
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,900
the Museum of Modern Art, or a place to meet a date like the clock at the Biltmore Hotel,

114
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,580
to ornament the kitchen cupboard in the sophisticated apartments that I saw written up.

115
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,900
So for the philosopher of art, Arthardanto, Guernica, perhaps the most powerful work of

116
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,900
art of the last century, these days serves no greater purpose than an identifiable pickup

117
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
spot or decoration.

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,120
That's what art ultimately does.

119
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,200
And philosophers aren't the only ones to think art is useless either.

120
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,760
I made a video recently about W.H. Auden's view that poetry makes nothing happen.

121
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,640
The argument here is that art can reflect things that exist but can't actually do anything

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
about them.

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,360
Dotto asks, did jazz in any sense cause or only emblemize the moral transformations of

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
the jazz age?

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,580
Did the Beatles cause or only prefigure the political perturbations of the 60s?

126
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,580
Art is a product of its time, not an influence on its time.

127
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,580
It doesn't actually do anything.

128
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,820
Okay, so art is weak.

129
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,020
It has no power to affect any kind of real change or do anything at all.

130
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,660
Everyone seems to agree, from philosophers to poets.

131
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,220
Fine, I get it.

132
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,940
But then, what's all this censorship about?

133
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,780
Why did Botticelli feel like he needed to throw some of his pagan inspired paintings

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,040
into a fire in 1497?

135
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Why do politicians ban books?

136
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,440
Why did Plato and Socrates ban poets from their perfect utopian republic?

137
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,520
If the arts are so impotent, why are they also perceived as being so dangerous?

138
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Well, Dotto's thesis in the philosophic disenfranchisement of art is that it does not come from historical

139
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,800
knowledge but rather from a philosophical belief.

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Representing art as something that in its nature can make nothing happen is not so much

141
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,260
a view opposed to the view that art is dangerous.

142
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,900
It is a way of responding to the sensed danger of art by treating it metaphysically as though

143
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,700
there were nothing to be afraid of.

144
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,460
So in other words, the sense that art might be dangerous caused the philosophical position

145
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,260
that art is not dangerous.

146
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,100
Philosophers feared the power of art and so they belittled it and created narratives and

147
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,500
frameworks to keep it at a distance.

148
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,360
If you tell artists that they were useless enough times, maybe they'll even believe

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
it.

150
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,240
I'm looking at you, Winston Hewauden.

151
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,360
Philosophy disenfranchised art by constructing a narrative of art's uselessness and it worked.

152
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,480
So when philosophy excluded the arts from the realm of reason and utility, the arts

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,520
responded by taking up shop in the realm of expression and emotion.

154
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,960
Art could use its memetic properties to imbue people or events with emotionally expressive

155
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,200
resonance.

156
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,020
It can tell you how you should feel about something.

157
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,060
This king, for example, is really cool and strong.

158
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,780
This battle was really important and people acted heroically.

159
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,780
This bombing was really terrible and caused people a lot of pain.

160
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,140
If we accept that this is the purpose that art has been relegated to, then we need to

161
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,980
understand how that changed the idea of progress in the arts.

162
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,180
So let's return to that philosophy of art's progress that I articulated earlier and follow

163
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,960
Danto's argument all the way to the end of art.

164
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,240
So Vasari's account, and many others in the European tradition of art history, tells

165
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,760
the story of increasingly lifelike depictions of reality.

166
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Again, what Danto called perceptual equivalence.

167
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Techniques like geometric perspective or foreshortening are advancements in this progress.

168
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,960
They help art move towards that goal, towards its end.

169
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,660
So Giotto is more realistic than Shimabui.

170
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,700
Botticelli bests them both.

171
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,020
Michelangelo is better at capturing movement and tension.

172
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,580
Caravaggio isn't afraid to paint the dust on feet or use people outside his door as

173
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,380
models and the story goes on, ever closer to perceptual equivalence.

174
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,180
But then, of course, the camera was invented.

175
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,300
Shortly after that, the moving picture was invented, and no one is going to be able to

176
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,940
paint movement better than a moving picture can capture it.

177
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,000
Painting can no longer compete in that game of perceptual equivalence.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,520
So it had to lean even harder into that expressive and emotional realm.

179
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,200
Art became intensely emotional after this.

180
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,040
Expressionism becomes more than just a purpose, it becomes part of the formal qualities of

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
the painting.

182
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,400
Art becomes intensely emotional after the invention of the camera.

183
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,160
Expression becomes more than just a purpose of art, it becomes part of the formal qualities

184
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,340
of the painting.

185
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,380
Like following Danto's lead, let's take this painting from 1906 by Matisse.

186
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,720
A hundred years earlier, this painting would not be considered worthy of a gallery.

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,420
If we hold it to the strictly memetic standards of art, this doesn't look anything like the

188
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,540
reflection of a real person.

189
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,220
So the art world of 1906 must have been holding it to a very different standard.

190
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,500
The formal goal of art must have shifted fully, from representing to expressing.

191
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,000
And according to the standards of expression, this can be categorized as art by the art

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
world.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's no problem there.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,080
As Danto says, the green stripe tries to get us to see how Matisse felt about the subject

195
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,540
shown, his own wife, calling for a complex act of interpretation on the part of the viewer.

196
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,840
And in this way, art can still progress.

197
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,520
It can still move forward and continually improve toward a goal or standard.

198
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,120
Painting can become more expressive, it can more accurately communicate or provoke emotions.

199
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,900
From this perspective, Impressionism and the various art forms that Expressionism took

200
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,780
illustrates that progress.

201
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,980
So establishing that the art world can still make progress towards a goal, Danto makes

202
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,220
an interesting move here by looking at the idea of progress in the art world through

203
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,020
the philosophy of an Enlightenment-era thinker named GWF Hegel.

204
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,460
So we're going to need to dip into some Hegel now.

205
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,780
So Hegel had a very particular philosophy of history.

206
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,600
He viewed it as a dialectic, so let's define that term first.

207
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,640
Plato's dialogues are a good example of a dialectic.

208
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,680
In those works, Socrates will pose a question and one of his friends will propose an answer.

209
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,800
They will propose a thesis.

210
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Socrates will then refute that thesis.

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,400
He will provide us with an antithesis, an antithesis.

212
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,960
And in the resulting discussion of back and forth, eventually a middle ground will be

213
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,120
reached and he calls that a synthesis.

214
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,840
Hegel viewed history as like a giant dialectic.

215
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,860
He saw that the culture and ideology of a given time and place proposed a system of

216
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,460
values, an aesthetic, a set of trends across diverse fields that includes everything from

217
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,540
political systems to the games that children play.

218
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,140
Those values and trends are then criticized or negated in some way by successive or contemporary

219
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
cultures.

220
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,700
There are reactions to the norms of any given system.

221
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,260
That conversation between a cultural system and the reactions to that cultural system

222
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
are a dialectic.

223
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,800
At some point a compromise is found between the two and that compromise becomes a new

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,280
thesis and the process begins again.

225
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,800
So for a quick example, Catholicism in the 15th century said that there is no salvation

226
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
outside of the church.

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,600
Then Martin Luther comes along and presents that an antithesis, saying that salvation

228
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,720
can be achieved by individuals through faith alone.

229
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,120
And as a result of this dialectic between thesis and antithesis, Europe eventually finds

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,120
a peace in the Treaty of Westphalia, which neuters the question altogether by subordinating

231
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,060
the question of salvation to the judgment of secular governments.

232
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,860
Loyalty to the nation-state replaces loyalty to the church hierarchically and that becomes

233
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
the new thesis.

234
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,380
So Hegel's dialectics is a framework for understanding non-linear progress.

235
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,840
But Hegel thought of it as much more than a framework.

236
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,740
For him, this dialectic is a path towards self-discovery.

237
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,060
This path will lead humanity to an understanding of itself.

238
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,460
Like this giant conversation between cultures could theoretically have an ending.

239
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,480
All the disagreements could be reconciled in this ongoing conversation, and history could

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,800
have an ending just as Plato's dialogues find conclusions.

241
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,440
Danto uses this framework to view the development of art.

242
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,000
He sees that within this progress of history towards self-knowledge is the story of art.

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,960
One artistic movement proposes certain values, like those of the High Renaissance and Botticelli.

244
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,400
Then a counter-argument is proposed by somebody like Savonarola or Martin Luther, and we get

245
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,100
a third proposition in the Baroque.

246
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,040
This becomes the new thesis, and the cycle continues.

247
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,740
So if this is the way that the art world works, if that's like the way that progress actually

248
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,280
works and not in that linear way that Vasari thought, then art can actually have an ending.

249
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,520
That conversation could have a conclusion.

250
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,120
And Danto thought that he witnessed it in 1964.

251
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,760
So what exactly happened in the Stable Gallery in 1964?

252
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,840
Well, he saw Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes.

253
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,900
These boxes were made to look exactly like the boxes delivered to stores that sold Brillo

254
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,220
Pads.

255
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,060
Andy Warhol believed that he could have an aesthetic experience in a warehouse and tried

256
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,060
to recreate that experience in an art gallery.

257
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,500
The boxes asked us to consider that experience worthy of our attention, as full of potential

258
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,980
meaning, and to consider that experience as part of the ongoing discussion about what

259
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,980
art is and what it can be and what it means to be categorized as such.

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,800
About a half century before these Brillo Boxes inspired Danto, Marcel Duchamp used his position

261
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,720
as an artist to ask similar questions.

262
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,320
In this work, provocatively entitled In the Advance of a Broken Arm, a snow shovel hangs

263
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
from the ceiling.

264
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,680
That's what it is, a snow shovel that he probably picked up at the hardware store and

265
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,080
hung it from a ceiling in an art gallery.

266
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,600
He called this type of art ready-made art.

267
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,640
The shovel had artistic value because he decided that it had artistic value.

268
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,580
And this forces the question of why some objects are considered art and other objects that

269
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,580
look similar or literally exactly the same are not considered art.

270
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,460
When do we decide that something should be considered meaningful?

271
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,980
Like this image of the Mona Lisa on my screen right now is not art, but the Mona Lisa that

272
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
hangs in the Louvre is.

273
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,660
A Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls jersey is commonplace, but the jersey that Michael Jordan wore when

274
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,600
he won his first championship?

275
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
That thing has value.

276
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,000
We invest it with meaning.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,720
So why and how do we do that?

278
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,720
This type of question can be extended into other parts of the human experience.

279
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Why and how do I remember some experiences but forget others nearly identical?

280
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,120
Duchamp's ready-mades ask philosophic questions.

281
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,480
Danto tries to place Duchamp's ready-made art within that greater dialectic of art

282
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
and history.

283
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,740
He says, there is a deep question of what internal evolution in the history of art made

284
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:19,020
Duchamp's question object historically possible, if not historically necessary.

285
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,980
My view is that it could only come at a time when it no longer could be clear to anyone

286
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,740
what art was while perfectly clear that none of the old answers would serve.

287
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:36,500
The old answers, that art is working towards the goal of perceptual equivalence, or that

288
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,200
it communicates emotion, were no longer sufficient.

289
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,600
That centuries-old dialectic of art trying to find itself ends with Andy Warhol's Brillo

290
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,480
Boxes as the fulfillment of Duchamp's project, because at that point we see that the end

291
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,440
of art is the philosophy of art, a philosophy of meaning-making.

292
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,000
Or in Danto's words, Hegel's stupendous philosophic vision of history gets, or almost

293
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,980
yet, an astounding confirmation in Duchamp's work, which raises the question of the philosophical

294
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:16,820
nature of art from within art, implying that art already is philosophy in a vivid form,

295
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,020
and has now discharged its spiritual mission by revealing the philosophical essence at

296
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,300
its heart.

297
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,660
So what art finally will have achieved as its fulfillment and fruition is the philosophy

298
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,740
of art.

299
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,000
So art becomes self-actualized like the hero of a coming-of-age story.

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,920
Early art recognized its role in ritual and meaning-making, and then philosophy issued

301
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,560
its challenge.

302
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,120
Philosophy worked to construct an identity of art's impotence, and the history of art

303
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
since then has been a story of its self-rediscovery.

304
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,080
Despite philosophy's attempts to belittle it, to disenfranchise it, art reveals itself

305
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,000
to have been an investigation into the nature of reality the whole time.

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,340
It's a way to ask big questions about knowledge, the search for meaning, the process of becoming,

307
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,100
the foundation of ethics, and so on.

308
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,620
I hope you get the point.

309
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,780
Art is, and always has been, a potent form of philosophy.

310
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,820
It just becomes aware of that in the 1960s.

311
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,100
So now that this conversation is over, now that art ended, what now?

312
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Duchamp said that one of his goals was to stop making retinol art.

313
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
He didn't want to make art interesting to look at, but instead interesting to think

314
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
about.

315
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,840
A lot of contemporary art is like this.

316
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
It's aware that it's philosophy.

317
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,240
When I read art theory books, it usually takes me a longer time than usual because the author

318
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,320
will mention a painting or a sculpture or whatever, and then I need to go look that

319
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,600
thing up before I return to the article.

320
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,380
Not when referencing a work of contemporary art.

321
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,660
Typically a simple description is enough, like, I don't need you to show me a picture

322
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,540
of Duchamp's artwork, The Fountain.

323
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,220
I can just tell you that it's a urinal Duchamp signed and put into a gallery, and that he

324
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,700
didn't even sign his own name.

325
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,060
The description of the work should be enough, I'm not even going to put it on the screen

326
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
right now.

327
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,820
It's just a urinal turned on its side with a signature.

328
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,020
And a couple months ago, I published a video about the work of Anika Yi.

329
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,380
Much of her artwork is perishable, like it won't last beyond a few months.

330
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,720
The work is not so much about the enduring physical object, but, as I argue in that video,

331
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,920
it's wrestling with the same questions that philosophers of eco-feminism wrestle with.

332
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,000
It's giving a physical form to those ideas and providing a public point of contact for

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,640
those ideas outside of academic journals.

334
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,800
And Anika Yi is a major contemporary artist who recently had a months-long commission

335
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,560
inside the Tate Modern Turbine Hall.

336
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,360
This is a prestigious commission given to only the most exciting contemporary artists.

337
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,220
The previous artist to hold that same commission in that same space was Kara Walker.

338
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,260
These two artists do not share many visual similarities, and yet, they're two of the

339
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,060
most important living artists today.

340
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,180
That's what's going on in the 2020s art world, a lot of differences.

341
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,820
And if we compare that to like a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, there you're

342
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,660
going to see a lot of Renaissance art and you will also see all the similarities between

343
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,940
those artists.

344
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,880
As we go to a gallery like the MoMA, we can categorize a bunch of the paintings as Cubist

345
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,040
or Impressionist or Geometric Abstraction, but what exactly is Anika Yi?

346
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,400
What exact movement is Kara Walker working within?

347
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
We don't have a good answer for that.

348
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,240
So what does art look like after the end of art?

349
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,480
Well, one answer is that it looks like philosophy.

350
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,400
Another answer is that it looks like pluralism.

351
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,120
We can analyze an Impressionist painting using the standards of Impressionist movements,

352
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,460
but we don't have those same rubrics for contemporary art.

353
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,260
This might be why so many people struggle with it, but I for one think that it's pretty

354
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
cool.

355
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,220
It's liberating, the gate keeping that artistic movements and manifestos created by artists

356
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,900
have been eliminated.

357
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,380
Artists can look like themselves rather than looking like a good expression of whatever

358
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,780
artistic movement is fashionable at the time.

359
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,020
Like, it's pretty cool that Anika Yi can have robots float around in the same exact

360
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,880
space that Kara Walker just a few months earlier made the invisible narratives of public monuments

361
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
visible in a really powerful way.

362
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,680
Those two works of art aren't easily categorized.

363
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,000
They're doing something original, they're doing something different, they're doing

364
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
something that's important to them.

365
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,600
Okay, so like, an obvious criticism of Danto's philosophy is that the story he tells about

366
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,120
art is Eurocentric, but the conclusion of that story that he tells allow us for the

367
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,400
world to consider a lot of different approaches often outside of European traditions.

368
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,500
The closing paragraph of his essay, The End of Art, includes the following lines.

369
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,620
The age of pluralism is upon us.

370
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,740
It does not matter anymore what you do, which is what pluralism means.

371
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,980
When one direction is as good as another direction, there is no concept of direction any longer

372
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,380
to apply.

373
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,260
Decoration, self-expression, entertainment are of course abiding human needs.

374
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:04,420
There will always be a service for art to perform if artists are content with that.

375
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,600
Time ends in its own fulfillment.

376
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,760
Now there are many reasons to question Danto's account of art.

377
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,320
It's Eurocentric, it claims to be about all art, but really it seems to just be about

378
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,600
painting and possibly sculpture sometimes.

379
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,440
And anytime that you invoke Hegel, you're invoking big macro narratives of history that

380
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,720
kind of fall apart once you dig into the internal arguments within the cultures that you've

381
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
used a broad brush to explain.

382
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,100
Historians of the early modern period do not view the art of the high renaissance as broadly

383
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,900
homogenous as Danto's narrative would imply.

384
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,700
There are many more criticisms to discuss, but this video has already gone on too long.

385
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,100
That said, I still find Danto's account useful to think about contemporary art.

386
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,380
I find it useful to think about contemporary art as asking philosophical questions or possibly

387
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,100
offering answers to the ongoing referendums of philosophy, like the nature of reality

388
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,960
or the ways that we construct meaning or understanding in the world.

389
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,880
And this account actually helps me appreciate contemporary art even more, and I think that

390
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
that's where I'll end this one.

391
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,320
So if you stayed for the whole thing, thank you for watching, I'll see you next month.
