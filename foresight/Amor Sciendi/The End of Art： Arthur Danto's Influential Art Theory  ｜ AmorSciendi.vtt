00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
So, in 1964, Arthur C. Dotto, an American philosopher, walked into the stable gallery

00:07.520 --> 00:13.000
in New York City and saw something that took him about 20 years to process.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.420
But once he had, he declared that what he saw that day was the end of art.

00:18.420 --> 00:21.740
He saw that art had reached its conclusion.

00:21.740 --> 00:26.960
He spent the following years developing this idea in articles and books, and since then,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.720
it's become a very influential theory in the history of art.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.600
To explain it, we're going to have to go deep into the history of art, discuss Plato,

00:33.600 --> 00:37.900
we'll dip into Hegel for a bit, and hopefully by the end of it, you may even find a way

00:37.900 --> 00:44.060
to enjoy contemporary art, even though, according to Dotto, art finished more than a half century

00:44.060 --> 00:45.060
ago.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.260
And if this sounds like it's your kind of thing, you may want to subscribe or visit

00:47.260 --> 00:52.260
my Patreon page, I put out a new video every month, let's just jump right into Dotto's

00:52.260 --> 01:01.480
theory of the end of art.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.320
So let's start with a couple basic ideas from art history, some stories that art tells

01:06.320 --> 01:08.040
about itself.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.720
It's often said that Giorgio Vasari's The Lives of Artists is the first work of intentional

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
art history.

01:13.720 --> 01:18.680
It provides biographies of painters and generally follows a narrative that each successive painter

01:18.680 --> 01:22.140
is building on the innovations of previous artists.

01:22.140 --> 01:26.940
Giotto builds on Chimabui, Francesca builds on Giotto, and so on.

01:26.940 --> 01:31.540
The implication here is that art is always progressing towards something.

01:31.540 --> 01:37.340
In Vasari's work, it feels like art is progressing towards Michelangelo, but more broadly, it's

01:37.340 --> 01:41.460
progressing towards what Dotto called perceptual equivalency.

01:41.460 --> 01:46.740
The goal of art is to have the images look as realistic as possible.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.640
So that's the first point that I want to establish before we move on.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.760
Early art history had a particular story about itself, that if it moved forward, it moved

01:55.760 --> 01:58.360
towards more accurate representations of reality.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.080
The second concept that I want to establish at the start of this video is that art is

02:02.080 --> 02:04.920
connected to a time and place.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.440
The art historian Michael Baxendahl began his classic book Art and Experience in 15th

02:09.440 --> 02:16.680
Century Italy with a line, a 15th century painting is the deposit of a social relationship.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.740
In other words, it's the product of a system of exchange, patron, artist, audience, and

02:22.740 --> 02:27.740
through that exchange the painting comes to represent the values of its time period.

02:27.740 --> 02:30.020
It's a record of those relationships.

02:30.020 --> 02:34.740
More broadly, what is considered a work of art in a given time and place is the result

02:34.740 --> 02:39.660
of a consensus between members of what Dotto calls the art world.

02:39.660 --> 02:44.560
So in the 15th century, to keep that example going, the art world consists of painters

02:44.560 --> 02:49.240
and sculptors, sure, but also the patrons who commissioned the work, the craftsmen who

02:49.240 --> 02:53.740
work in the studios of the artists, the religious scholars who might comment on the work, the

02:53.740 --> 02:58.260
politicians who might censor the work, and the general community that will engage with

02:58.260 --> 02:59.620
the work when it's produced.

02:59.620 --> 03:05.340
So for example, Botticelli's The Birth of Venus takes a pagan goddess as its subject,

03:05.340 --> 03:11.140
unthinkable just a few years before it was painted, but the Medici patrons and artists

03:11.320 --> 03:15.080
and the intellectuals of the time period kind of agreed that a painting like this could

03:15.080 --> 03:17.720
be art, and therefore it's art.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.680
A hundred years later, Baroque art would be fashionable as part of the counter-reformation.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.480
The standard and quality of art would be judged not by the same standards of the high renaissance,

03:27.480 --> 03:29.480
but with the standards of the Baroque.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.640
So a pagan goddess might be seen as heresy rather than art, and so artists like Michelangelo,

03:34.640 --> 03:39.680
who had no problem creating works of pagan deities in the 15th century, might stop doing

03:39.740 --> 03:42.340
that in the 16th century.

03:42.340 --> 03:45.900
Societies have changing values, and those values are reflected in the art world.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.100
So art is connected to history.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.900
If you study art history, then you study those connections.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.340
Oftentimes, it's done in a way that I just did.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.020
You name a place and a time, Italy in the 15th century, you name the artistic movement,

03:58.020 --> 04:02.940
the high renaissance, and you analyze the work based on that cultural context and using

04:02.940 --> 04:05.700
the standards of that particular movement.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.840
Judging high renaissance art by the standards of say, impressionism would make little sense.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.480
So when we say Botticelli was a painter of the high renaissance, that gives us a way

04:14.480 --> 04:16.000
to understand his paintings.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.240
It gives us a general understanding of his artistic project, and with that understanding,

04:20.240 --> 04:22.200
we're provided the tools to analyze his work.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.280
Okay, so those two points established.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.360
Art has a sense of its own progression through time, and that art history connects art to

04:28.360 --> 04:30.520
time and place of production.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.960
Now let's dig into Danto's argument.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.140
He's a philosopher, so we'll have to begin with philosophy.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.780
Famously, the philosopher Plato adhered to the memetic theory of art.

04:42.780 --> 04:47.620
He believed that a work of art should have perceptual equivalency, that good art looks

04:47.620 --> 04:49.540
like a mirror of the world.

04:49.540 --> 04:53.220
This was influential for Vasari's understanding of art's progress, for example.

04:53.220 --> 04:59.060
But Plato also thought that art is kind of useless, and this is an important starting

04:59.060 --> 05:00.620
place for Danto.

05:00.620 --> 05:05.560
It's the start of what he calls the philosophic disenfranchisement of art.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.920
So according to Plato, the world that we see every day is just a reflection of the higher

05:09.920 --> 05:11.520
realm of ideal forms.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.120
It's like every chair that we see is just a reflection of an ideal chair that lives

05:16.120 --> 05:20.840
in our mind, and this allows us to identify a chair in the physical world.

05:20.840 --> 05:25.000
Like we have an idea of a chair in our heads, and then we see one, and we know what it is

05:25.000 --> 05:28.320
because we have a bucket to put it into in our heads.

05:28.340 --> 05:31.940
It doesn't matter what it's made of, or what color it is, it reflects our understanding

05:31.940 --> 05:33.460
of what a chair should be.

05:33.460 --> 05:37.420
Similarly, every right triangle that we encounter in the physical world is only a reflection

05:37.420 --> 05:41.980
of the ideal right triangle that can be studied with reason and geometry.

05:41.980 --> 05:46.140
By studying that ideal right triangle, using our capacity for deductive reasoning, we can

05:46.140 --> 05:49.100
understand any right triangle in the physical world.

05:49.100 --> 05:54.060
So if we want to understand our physical existence, we should study the truth, we should pursue

05:54.060 --> 05:59.640
the study of ideal forms and mathematics and so on, focusing on our reason rather than

05:59.640 --> 06:00.880
our perception.

06:00.880 --> 06:07.440
Furthermore, in Book 10 of his Republic, Plato has Socrates define artists as an imitator

06:07.440 --> 06:10.120
of that which others make.

06:10.120 --> 06:15.760
So if reality is just a reflection and art is an imitation of that reflection, then artists

06:15.760 --> 06:21.920
are just producing reflections of reflections, and that, for Plato and Socrates, is moving

06:21.920 --> 06:23.400
in the wrong direction.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.540
It takes us further from the truth, not closer.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.980
It's the opposite of truth, it's a lie.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.380
So we can safely ignore art, it's useless.

06:32.380 --> 06:36.820
And we can make the argument that this started a long tradition of philosophers belittling

06:36.820 --> 06:43.500
art, even when they discuss it positively, and like, I get it, what does art actually

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
do?

06:44.500 --> 06:50.260
Kant, for example, once said that art is purposive without purpose, that its purpose

06:50.260 --> 06:53.060
is only its intention to be made.

06:53.060 --> 06:56.720
It doesn't do anything other than exist as a creation.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.400
Like take Picasso's masterpiece, Guernica, considered by many to be one of the greatest

07:01.400 --> 07:03.320
works of art in the 20th century.

07:03.320 --> 07:08.540
The painting illustrates the terror bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.520
Did this painting stop any bombs?

07:10.520 --> 07:14.600
Did Franco's troops see this painting and have a crisis of conscious and lay down their

07:14.600 --> 07:16.200
guns?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.080
I think that you know the answer to that.

07:18.080 --> 07:23.860
Arthardanto says now that the purpose of Guernica is to be a handsome backdrop for pickups at

07:23.860 --> 07:29.900
the Museum of Modern Art, or a place to meet a date like the clock at the Biltmore Hotel,

07:29.900 --> 07:34.580
to ornament the kitchen cupboard in the sophisticated apartments that I saw written up.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.900
So for the philosopher of art, Arthardanto, Guernica, perhaps the most powerful work of

07:38.900 --> 07:43.900
art of the last century, these days serves no greater purpose than an identifiable pickup

07:43.900 --> 07:46.100
spot or decoration.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.120
That's what art ultimately does.

07:48.120 --> 07:52.200
And philosophers aren't the only ones to think art is useless either.

07:52.200 --> 07:57.760
I made a video recently about W.H. Auden's view that poetry makes nothing happen.

07:57.760 --> 08:02.640
The argument here is that art can reflect things that exist but can't actually do anything

08:02.640 --> 08:03.920
about them.

08:03.920 --> 08:10.360
Dotto asks, did jazz in any sense cause or only emblemize the moral transformations of

08:10.360 --> 08:11.800
the jazz age?

08:11.800 --> 08:17.580
Did the Beatles cause or only prefigure the political perturbations of the 60s?

08:17.580 --> 08:21.580
Art is a product of its time, not an influence on its time.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.580
It doesn't actually do anything.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.820
Okay, so art is weak.

08:25.820 --> 08:30.020
It has no power to affect any kind of real change or do anything at all.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.660
Everyone seems to agree, from philosophers to poets.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.220
Fine, I get it.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.940
But then, what's all this censorship about?

08:36.940 --> 08:40.780
Why did Botticelli feel like he needed to throw some of his pagan inspired paintings

08:40.800 --> 08:43.040
into a fire in 1497?

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
Why do politicians ban books?

08:45.040 --> 08:49.440
Why did Plato and Socrates ban poets from their perfect utopian republic?

08:49.440 --> 08:54.520
If the arts are so impotent, why are they also perceived as being so dangerous?

08:54.520 --> 09:00.520
Well, Dotto's thesis in the philosophic disenfranchisement of art is that it does not come from historical

09:00.520 --> 09:03.800
knowledge but rather from a philosophical belief.

09:03.800 --> 09:09.760
Representing art as something that in its nature can make nothing happen is not so much

09:09.780 --> 09:13.260
a view opposed to the view that art is dangerous.

09:13.260 --> 09:18.900
It is a way of responding to the sensed danger of art by treating it metaphysically as though

09:18.900 --> 09:21.700
there were nothing to be afraid of.

09:21.700 --> 09:28.460
So in other words, the sense that art might be dangerous caused the philosophical position

09:28.460 --> 09:31.260
that art is not dangerous.

09:31.260 --> 09:35.100
Philosophers feared the power of art and so they belittled it and created narratives and

09:35.100 --> 09:37.500
frameworks to keep it at a distance.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.360
If you tell artists that they were useless enough times, maybe they'll even believe

09:41.360 --> 09:42.360
it.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.240
I'm looking at you, Winston Hewauden.

09:44.240 --> 09:50.360
Philosophy disenfranchised art by constructing a narrative of art's uselessness and it worked.

09:50.360 --> 09:55.480
So when philosophy excluded the arts from the realm of reason and utility, the arts

09:55.480 --> 09:59.520
responded by taking up shop in the realm of expression and emotion.

09:59.520 --> 10:04.960
Art could use its memetic properties to imbue people or events with emotionally expressive

10:04.960 --> 10:06.200
resonance.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.020
It can tell you how you should feel about something.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.060
This king, for example, is really cool and strong.

10:12.060 --> 10:15.780
This battle was really important and people acted heroically.

10:15.780 --> 10:19.780
This bombing was really terrible and caused people a lot of pain.

10:19.780 --> 10:24.140
If we accept that this is the purpose that art has been relegated to, then we need to

10:24.140 --> 10:27.980
understand how that changed the idea of progress in the arts.

10:27.980 --> 10:32.180
So let's return to that philosophy of art's progress that I articulated earlier and follow

10:32.180 --> 10:37.960
Danto's argument all the way to the end of art.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.240
So Vasari's account, and many others in the European tradition of art history, tells

10:42.240 --> 10:45.760
the story of increasingly lifelike depictions of reality.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.920
Again, what Danto called perceptual equivalence.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.920
Techniques like geometric perspective or foreshortening are advancements in this progress.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.960
They help art move towards that goal, towards its end.

10:57.980 --> 11:00.660
So Giotto is more realistic than Shimabui.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.700
Botticelli bests them both.

11:02.700 --> 11:06.020
Michelangelo is better at capturing movement and tension.

11:06.020 --> 11:10.580
Caravaggio isn't afraid to paint the dust on feet or use people outside his door as

11:10.580 --> 11:16.380
models and the story goes on, ever closer to perceptual equivalence.

11:16.380 --> 11:20.180
But then, of course, the camera was invented.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.300
Shortly after that, the moving picture was invented, and no one is going to be able to

11:24.300 --> 11:27.940
paint movement better than a moving picture can capture it.

11:27.940 --> 11:33.000
Painting can no longer compete in that game of perceptual equivalence.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.520
So it had to lean even harder into that expressive and emotional realm.

11:38.520 --> 11:42.200
Art became intensely emotional after this.

11:42.200 --> 11:47.040
Expressionism becomes more than just a purpose, it becomes part of the formal qualities of

11:47.040 --> 11:48.040
the painting.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.400
Art becomes intensely emotional after the invention of the camera.

11:52.400 --> 11:57.160
Expression becomes more than just a purpose of art, it becomes part of the formal qualities

11:57.180 --> 11:58.340
of the painting.

11:58.340 --> 12:03.380
Like following Danto's lead, let's take this painting from 1906 by Matisse.

12:03.380 --> 12:07.720
A hundred years earlier, this painting would not be considered worthy of a gallery.

12:07.720 --> 12:12.420
If we hold it to the strictly memetic standards of art, this doesn't look anything like the

12:12.420 --> 12:14.540
reflection of a real person.

12:14.540 --> 12:19.220
So the art world of 1906 must have been holding it to a very different standard.

12:19.220 --> 12:24.500
The formal goal of art must have shifted fully, from representing to expressing.

12:24.520 --> 12:28.000
And according to the standards of expression, this can be categorized as art by the art

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
world.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
There's no problem there.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.080
As Danto says, the green stripe tries to get us to see how Matisse felt about the subject

12:35.080 --> 12:41.540
shown, his own wife, calling for a complex act of interpretation on the part of the viewer.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.840
And in this way, art can still progress.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.520
It can still move forward and continually improve toward a goal or standard.

12:48.520 --> 12:54.120
Painting can become more expressive, it can more accurately communicate or provoke emotions.

12:54.120 --> 12:58.900
From this perspective, Impressionism and the various art forms that Expressionism took

12:58.900 --> 13:00.780
illustrates that progress.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.980
So establishing that the art world can still make progress towards a goal, Danto makes

13:04.980 --> 13:09.220
an interesting move here by looking at the idea of progress in the art world through

13:09.220 --> 13:15.020
the philosophy of an Enlightenment-era thinker named GWF Hegel.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.460
So we're going to need to dip into some Hegel now.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.780
So Hegel had a very particular philosophy of history.

13:22.780 --> 13:26.600
He viewed it as a dialectic, so let's define that term first.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.640
Plato's dialogues are a good example of a dialectic.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.680
In those works, Socrates will pose a question and one of his friends will propose an answer.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.800
They will propose a thesis.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.000
Socrates will then refute that thesis.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.400
He will provide us with an antithesis, an antithesis.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.960
And in the resulting discussion of back and forth, eventually a middle ground will be

13:45.960 --> 13:48.120
reached and he calls that a synthesis.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.840
Hegel viewed history as like a giant dialectic.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.860
He saw that the culture and ideology of a given time and place proposed a system of

13:55.860 --> 14:00.460
values, an aesthetic, a set of trends across diverse fields that includes everything from

14:00.460 --> 14:03.540
political systems to the games that children play.

14:03.540 --> 14:09.140
Those values and trends are then criticized or negated in some way by successive or contemporary

14:09.140 --> 14:10.140
cultures.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.700
There are reactions to the norms of any given system.

14:13.700 --> 14:18.260
That conversation between a cultural system and the reactions to that cultural system

14:18.260 --> 14:19.860
are a dialectic.

14:19.880 --> 14:23.800
At some point a compromise is found between the two and that compromise becomes a new

14:23.800 --> 14:26.280
thesis and the process begins again.

14:26.280 --> 14:30.800
So for a quick example, Catholicism in the 15th century said that there is no salvation

14:30.800 --> 14:32.200
outside of the church.

14:32.200 --> 14:36.600
Then Martin Luther comes along and presents that an antithesis, saying that salvation

14:36.600 --> 14:39.720
can be achieved by individuals through faith alone.

14:39.720 --> 14:44.120
And as a result of this dialectic between thesis and antithesis, Europe eventually finds

14:44.120 --> 14:49.120
a peace in the Treaty of Westphalia, which neuters the question altogether by subordinating

14:49.120 --> 14:53.060
the question of salvation to the judgment of secular governments.

14:53.060 --> 14:57.860
Loyalty to the nation-state replaces loyalty to the church hierarchically and that becomes

14:57.860 --> 14:58.860
the new thesis.

14:58.860 --> 15:04.380
So Hegel's dialectics is a framework for understanding non-linear progress.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.840
But Hegel thought of it as much more than a framework.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.740
For him, this dialectic is a path towards self-discovery.

15:10.740 --> 15:14.060
This path will lead humanity to an understanding of itself.

15:14.060 --> 15:18.460
Like this giant conversation between cultures could theoretically have an ending.

15:18.460 --> 15:23.480
All the disagreements could be reconciled in this ongoing conversation, and history could

15:23.480 --> 15:26.800
have an ending just as Plato's dialogues find conclusions.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.440
Danto uses this framework to view the development of art.

15:30.440 --> 15:36.000
He sees that within this progress of history towards self-knowledge is the story of art.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.960
One artistic movement proposes certain values, like those of the High Renaissance and Botticelli.

15:40.960 --> 15:45.400
Then a counter-argument is proposed by somebody like Savonarola or Martin Luther, and we get

15:45.400 --> 15:48.100
a third proposition in the Baroque.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.040
This becomes the new thesis, and the cycle continues.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.740
So if this is the way that the art world works, if that's like the way that progress actually

15:54.740 --> 16:00.280
works and not in that linear way that Vasari thought, then art can actually have an ending.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.520
That conversation could have a conclusion.

16:02.520 --> 16:09.120
And Danto thought that he witnessed it in 1964.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.760
So what exactly happened in the Stable Gallery in 1964?

16:12.760 --> 16:16.840
Well, he saw Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes.

16:16.860 --> 16:21.900
These boxes were made to look exactly like the boxes delivered to stores that sold Brillo

16:21.900 --> 16:23.220
Pads.

16:23.220 --> 16:27.060
Andy Warhol believed that he could have an aesthetic experience in a warehouse and tried

16:27.060 --> 16:30.060
to recreate that experience in an art gallery.

16:30.060 --> 16:36.500
The boxes asked us to consider that experience worthy of our attention, as full of potential

16:36.500 --> 16:40.980
meaning, and to consider that experience as part of the ongoing discussion about what

16:40.980 --> 16:45.980
art is and what it can be and what it means to be categorized as such.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.800
About a half century before these Brillo Boxes inspired Danto, Marcel Duchamp used his position

16:51.800 --> 16:54.720
as an artist to ask similar questions.

16:54.720 --> 17:00.320
In this work, provocatively entitled In the Advance of a Broken Arm, a snow shovel hangs

17:00.320 --> 17:01.320
from the ceiling.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.680
That's what it is, a snow shovel that he probably picked up at the hardware store and

17:05.680 --> 17:08.080
hung it from a ceiling in an art gallery.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.600
He called this type of art ready-made art.

17:10.600 --> 17:14.640
The shovel had artistic value because he decided that it had artistic value.

17:14.660 --> 17:19.580
And this forces the question of why some objects are considered art and other objects that

17:19.580 --> 17:24.580
look similar or literally exactly the same are not considered art.

17:24.580 --> 17:28.460
When do we decide that something should be considered meaningful?

17:28.460 --> 17:33.980
Like this image of the Mona Lisa on my screen right now is not art, but the Mona Lisa that

17:33.980 --> 17:35.980
hangs in the Louvre is.

17:35.980 --> 17:41.660
A Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls jersey is commonplace, but the jersey that Michael Jordan wore when

17:41.680 --> 17:43.600
he won his first championship?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.960
That thing has value.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.000
We invest it with meaning.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.720
So why and how do we do that?

17:49.720 --> 17:53.720
This type of question can be extended into other parts of the human experience.

17:53.720 --> 17:58.720
Why and how do I remember some experiences but forget others nearly identical?

17:58.720 --> 18:02.120
Duchamp's ready-mades ask philosophic questions.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.480
Danto tries to place Duchamp's ready-made art within that greater dialectic of art

18:06.480 --> 18:07.640
and history.

18:07.640 --> 18:12.740
He says, there is a deep question of what internal evolution in the history of art made

18:12.740 --> 18:19.020
Duchamp's question object historically possible, if not historically necessary.

18:19.020 --> 18:24.980
My view is that it could only come at a time when it no longer could be clear to anyone

18:24.980 --> 18:30.740
what art was while perfectly clear that none of the old answers would serve.

18:30.740 --> 18:36.500
The old answers, that art is working towards the goal of perceptual equivalence, or that

18:36.520 --> 18:40.200
it communicates emotion, were no longer sufficient.

18:40.200 --> 18:45.600
That centuries-old dialectic of art trying to find itself ends with Andy Warhol's Brillo

18:45.600 --> 18:51.480
Boxes as the fulfillment of Duchamp's project, because at that point we see that the end

18:51.480 --> 18:56.440
of art is the philosophy of art, a philosophy of meaning-making.

18:56.440 --> 19:03.000
Or in Danto's words, Hegel's stupendous philosophic vision of history gets, or almost

19:03.020 --> 19:08.980
yet, an astounding confirmation in Duchamp's work, which raises the question of the philosophical

19:08.980 --> 19:16.820
nature of art from within art, implying that art already is philosophy in a vivid form,

19:16.820 --> 19:22.020
and has now discharged its spiritual mission by revealing the philosophical essence at

19:22.020 --> 19:23.300
its heart.

19:23.300 --> 19:28.660
So what art finally will have achieved as its fulfillment and fruition is the philosophy

19:28.660 --> 19:29.740
of art.

19:29.760 --> 19:35.000
So art becomes self-actualized like the hero of a coming-of-age story.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.920
Early art recognized its role in ritual and meaning-making, and then philosophy issued

19:39.920 --> 19:41.560
its challenge.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.120
Philosophy worked to construct an identity of art's impotence, and the history of art

19:45.120 --> 19:49.120
since then has been a story of its self-rediscovery.

19:49.120 --> 19:54.080
Despite philosophy's attempts to belittle it, to disenfranchise it, art reveals itself

19:54.080 --> 19:59.000
to have been an investigation into the nature of reality the whole time.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.340
It's a way to ask big questions about knowledge, the search for meaning, the process of becoming,

20:05.340 --> 20:08.100
the foundation of ethics, and so on.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.620
I hope you get the point.

20:09.620 --> 20:13.780
Art is, and always has been, a potent form of philosophy.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.820
It just becomes aware of that in the 1960s.

20:16.820 --> 20:23.100
So now that this conversation is over, now that art ended, what now?

20:23.880 --> 20:30.000
Duchamp said that one of his goals was to stop making retinol art.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.240
He didn't want to make art interesting to look at, but instead interesting to think

20:34.240 --> 20:35.240
about.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.840
A lot of contemporary art is like this.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.840
It's aware that it's philosophy.

20:39.840 --> 20:44.240
When I read art theory books, it usually takes me a longer time than usual because the author

20:44.240 --> 20:47.320
will mention a painting or a sculpture or whatever, and then I need to go look that

20:47.320 --> 20:50.600
thing up before I return to the article.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.380
Not when referencing a work of contemporary art.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.660
Typically a simple description is enough, like, I don't need you to show me a picture

20:56.660 --> 20:58.540
of Duchamp's artwork, The Fountain.

20:58.540 --> 21:03.220
I can just tell you that it's a urinal Duchamp signed and put into a gallery, and that he

21:03.220 --> 21:04.700
didn't even sign his own name.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.060
The description of the work should be enough, I'm not even going to put it on the screen

21:07.060 --> 21:08.060
right now.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.820
It's just a urinal turned on its side with a signature.

21:09.820 --> 21:14.020
And a couple months ago, I published a video about the work of Anika Yi.

21:14.020 --> 21:18.380
Much of her artwork is perishable, like it won't last beyond a few months.

21:18.380 --> 21:23.720
The work is not so much about the enduring physical object, but, as I argue in that video,

21:23.720 --> 21:27.920
it's wrestling with the same questions that philosophers of eco-feminism wrestle with.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.000
It's giving a physical form to those ideas and providing a public point of contact for

21:32.000 --> 21:34.640
those ideas outside of academic journals.

21:34.640 --> 21:38.800
And Anika Yi is a major contemporary artist who recently had a months-long commission

21:38.800 --> 21:41.560
inside the Tate Modern Turbine Hall.

21:41.560 --> 21:46.360
This is a prestigious commission given to only the most exciting contemporary artists.

21:46.360 --> 21:52.220
The previous artist to hold that same commission in that same space was Kara Walker.

21:52.220 --> 21:57.260
These two artists do not share many visual similarities, and yet, they're two of the

21:57.260 --> 22:00.060
most important living artists today.

22:00.060 --> 22:04.180
That's what's going on in the 2020s art world, a lot of differences.

22:04.180 --> 22:08.820
And if we compare that to like a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, there you're

22:08.820 --> 22:12.660
going to see a lot of Renaissance art and you will also see all the similarities between

22:12.660 --> 22:13.940
those artists.

22:13.940 --> 22:17.880
As we go to a gallery like the MoMA, we can categorize a bunch of the paintings as Cubist

22:17.880 --> 22:23.040
or Impressionist or Geometric Abstraction, but what exactly is Anika Yi?

22:23.040 --> 22:26.400
What exact movement is Kara Walker working within?

22:26.400 --> 22:28.320
We don't have a good answer for that.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.240
So what does art look like after the end of art?

22:31.240 --> 22:34.480
Well, one answer is that it looks like philosophy.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.400
Another answer is that it looks like pluralism.

22:37.400 --> 22:42.120
We can analyze an Impressionist painting using the standards of Impressionist movements,

22:42.120 --> 22:45.460
but we don't have those same rubrics for contemporary art.

22:45.460 --> 22:49.260
This might be why so many people struggle with it, but I for one think that it's pretty

22:49.260 --> 22:50.260
cool.

22:50.260 --> 22:55.220
It's liberating, the gate keeping that artistic movements and manifestos created by artists

22:55.220 --> 22:56.900
have been eliminated.

22:56.900 --> 23:00.380
Artists can look like themselves rather than looking like a good expression of whatever

23:00.380 --> 23:02.780
artistic movement is fashionable at the time.

23:02.780 --> 23:07.020
Like, it's pretty cool that Anika Yi can have robots float around in the same exact

23:07.040 --> 23:12.880
space that Kara Walker just a few months earlier made the invisible narratives of public monuments

23:12.880 --> 23:15.200
visible in a really powerful way.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.680
Those two works of art aren't easily categorized.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.000
They're doing something original, they're doing something different, they're doing

23:20.000 --> 23:21.520
something that's important to them.

23:21.520 --> 23:26.600
Okay, so like, an obvious criticism of Danto's philosophy is that the story he tells about

23:26.600 --> 23:31.120
art is Eurocentric, but the conclusion of that story that he tells allow us for the

23:31.120 --> 23:35.400
world to consider a lot of different approaches often outside of European traditions.

23:35.400 --> 23:40.500
The closing paragraph of his essay, The End of Art, includes the following lines.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.620
The age of pluralism is upon us.

23:42.620 --> 23:46.740
It does not matter anymore what you do, which is what pluralism means.

23:46.740 --> 23:51.980
When one direction is as good as another direction, there is no concept of direction any longer

23:51.980 --> 23:53.380
to apply.

23:53.380 --> 23:58.260
Decoration, self-expression, entertainment are of course abiding human needs.

23:58.260 --> 24:04.420
There will always be a service for art to perform if artists are content with that.

24:04.420 --> 24:07.600
Time ends in its own fulfillment.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.760
Now there are many reasons to question Danto's account of art.

24:10.760 --> 24:15.320
It's Eurocentric, it claims to be about all art, but really it seems to just be about

24:15.320 --> 24:18.600
painting and possibly sculpture sometimes.

24:18.600 --> 24:23.440
And anytime that you invoke Hegel, you're invoking big macro narratives of history that

24:23.440 --> 24:27.720
kind of fall apart once you dig into the internal arguments within the cultures that you've

24:27.720 --> 24:30.120
used a broad brush to explain.

24:30.300 --> 24:35.100
Historians of the early modern period do not view the art of the high renaissance as broadly

24:35.100 --> 24:37.900
homogenous as Danto's narrative would imply.

24:37.900 --> 24:43.700
There are many more criticisms to discuss, but this video has already gone on too long.

24:43.700 --> 24:48.100
That said, I still find Danto's account useful to think about contemporary art.

24:48.100 --> 24:53.380
I find it useful to think about contemporary art as asking philosophical questions or possibly

24:53.380 --> 24:58.100
offering answers to the ongoing referendums of philosophy, like the nature of reality

24:58.100 --> 25:00.960
or the ways that we construct meaning or understanding in the world.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.880
And this account actually helps me appreciate contemporary art even more, and I think that

25:04.880 --> 25:06.640
that's where I'll end this one.

25:06.640 --> 25:10.320
So if you stayed for the whole thing, thank you for watching, I'll see you next month.
