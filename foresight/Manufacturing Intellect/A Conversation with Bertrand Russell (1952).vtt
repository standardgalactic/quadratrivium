00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
How do you do?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
How do you do, Lord Russell?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Won't you sit down?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Thank you.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Now, what are we going to talk about?

00:38.000 --> 00:54.000
Well, Lord Russell, as you approach your 80th birthday, I think we'd like you to tell us

00:54.000 --> 00:58.240
what you think you have learned and what you think you will never learn in your career

00:58.240 --> 01:00.240
as a philosopher.

01:00.240 --> 01:08.240
Well, there are some things that I don't think I shall ever learn, and indeed I hope I shall

01:08.240 --> 01:09.920
never learn.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.240
I don't wish to learn to change my hopes for the world.

01:14.240 --> 01:20.000
I'm prepared to change my beliefs about the state of the world, about what happens, but

01:20.000 --> 01:21.480
not about what I hope.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.720
About that I hope to remain constant.

01:24.720 --> 01:32.880
I think we might call the subject of our talk 80 years of changing beliefs and unchanging

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
hopes.

01:33.880 --> 01:43.800
It's very difficult for anybody born since 1914 to realize how profoundly different the

01:43.800 --> 01:48.480
world is now from what it was when I was a child.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.520
The change has been almost unbelievable.

01:52.520 --> 02:01.800
I try as best I can in spite of my years to get used to living in a world of atom bombs,

02:01.800 --> 02:11.080
a world where ancient empires vanished like morning mist, where we have to accustom ourselves

02:11.080 --> 02:17.200
to Asiatic self-assertion to communist menace.

02:18.200 --> 02:25.040
The world is altogether so different from what it was when I was young that it's an

02:25.040 --> 02:31.600
extraordinarily difficult thing for an old man to live in such a world.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.600
I was born in 1872.

02:36.600 --> 02:43.360
My parents died when I was still an infant, and so I was brought up by my grandparent.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.920
Can you tell us something about your grandfather?

02:46.640 --> 02:49.680
Yes, I can tell you something about my grandfather.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.920
He was born in the early years of the French Revolution.

02:54.920 --> 03:00.920
He was a member of parliament while Napoleon was still on the throne.

03:00.920 --> 03:07.800
In common with all the Whig followers of fucks, he thought English hostility to Napoleon

03:07.800 --> 03:14.040
was excessive, and he visited Napoleon in Helba.

03:14.040 --> 03:22.200
It was he who introduced the reform bill in 1832, which started England on the road

03:22.200 --> 03:24.720
towards democracy.

03:24.720 --> 03:31.640
He was prime minister during our Mexican War, during the revolutions of 1848.

03:31.640 --> 03:37.840
I remember him quite well, but as you can see he belonged to an age that now seems rather

03:37.840 --> 03:41.280
removed.

03:41.280 --> 03:53.560
And the world where I was young was a solid world, a world where all kinds of things that

03:53.560 --> 03:57.120
have now disappeared were thought to be going to last forever.

03:57.120 --> 04:02.080
It didn't dawn on people the things.

04:02.080 --> 04:06.440
English people certainly regarded English naval supremacy as a sort of law of nature.

04:06.640 --> 04:12.000
Britannia ruled the way it didn't occur to us that that might stop.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.640
Even with Bismarck?

04:14.640 --> 04:23.280
Bismarck was regarded as a rascal and was thought of as an uneducated farmer.

04:23.280 --> 04:28.000
But it was assumed that the influence of Goethe and Schiller would gradually bring Germany

04:28.000 --> 04:31.040
back to a more civilized point of view.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.720
And moreover, we thought of Germany as only a land power.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.800
Germany had at that time no navy.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.280
We went all afraid of Germany.

04:40.280 --> 04:47.760
In fact, liberal opinion was more favorable to Germany than to France at that time.

04:47.760 --> 04:56.120
Bismarck himself compared Germany and England to an elephant and a whale, each formidable

04:56.120 --> 04:59.120
in its own element, but no danger to each other.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.120
And that was how we felt.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.400
We were not afraid of Bismarck at all.

05:04.400 --> 05:09.120
It was thought that there was going to be ordered progress throughout the world.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.040
Gradually every country was going to take to parliaments.

05:12.040 --> 05:17.600
There was going to be a bicameral legislature and two parties and it was all going to be

05:17.600 --> 05:21.600
exactly like England everywhere, all over the world.

05:21.600 --> 05:27.120
My grandmother used to laugh because one time she said to the Russian ambassador, perhaps

05:27.120 --> 05:35.640
someday you will have a parliament in Russia, and he said, God forbid, my dear Lady Russell.

05:35.640 --> 05:41.640
Except for the first word, the Russian ambassador at the present day might give the same answer.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.640
But that was the assumption.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.520
It was all going to be orderly, all quite nice.

05:48.520 --> 05:58.560
The atmosphere, apart from politics, was one of a puritan piety, very great piety, very

05:58.560 --> 06:02.040
great austerity.

06:02.040 --> 06:07.320
We always had family prayers at eight, and before family prayers I had to do half an

06:07.320 --> 06:12.520
hour's practice at the piano, which I hated.

06:12.520 --> 06:19.280
Although there were eight servants in the house, the food was always at most simplicity,

06:19.280 --> 06:24.600
and even if there was anything at all nice, I wasn't allowed to have it because it wasn't

06:24.600 --> 06:26.640
good for children to eat nice things.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.520
For instance, there would be rice pudding and apple tart.

06:30.520 --> 06:36.360
Lornapp said the apple tart, and I had the rice pudding, and there was extreme austerity

06:36.360 --> 06:38.920
in all those ways.

06:38.920 --> 06:46.440
My grandmother, until she was over 70, would never sit in an armchair until after dinner,

06:46.440 --> 06:47.840
ever.

06:47.840 --> 06:54.360
It's almost gone out that sort of austere living by well-to-do people, which in those

06:54.360 --> 06:56.360
days was fairly common.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.840
When did you get to Cambridge?

06:57.840 --> 07:06.240
Oh, I got to Cambridge when I was 18, and that, of course, was a new world to me completely.

07:06.240 --> 07:15.040
For the first time I met people who, when I said anything that I really thought, I didn't

07:15.040 --> 07:22.560
think it absurd, I'd learnt at home to say almost nothing about what I really thought.

07:22.560 --> 07:29.320
People had a horror of philosophy which interested me, and they would say every time philosophy

07:29.320 --> 07:32.080
was mentioned.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.960
Everybody is summed up completely in these two questions.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.960
What is matter?

07:38.960 --> 07:40.360
Never mind.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.640
What is mind?

07:41.640 --> 07:42.640
No matter.

07:42.640 --> 07:47.560
And at about the sixtieth repetition of this remark, I ceased to be amused by it.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.680
When I got to Cambridge, it was a great comfort to me to find people who didn't regard philosophy

07:52.680 --> 07:53.680
as absurd.

07:53.680 --> 07:59.160
So that I was very, very happy when I first got to Cambridge.

07:59.160 --> 08:04.880
I quickly got to know a great many people who became my lifelong friends.

08:04.880 --> 08:09.560
Most of them, I'm sorry to say, are dead now, but those who are still alive are still my

08:09.560 --> 08:11.200
friends.

08:11.200 --> 08:16.200
You started with mathematics, didn't you, and then moved to philosophy?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.200
That is so, yes.

08:17.200 --> 08:23.520
I did three years of mathematics and one year of philosophy at Cambridge.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.560
I had done only mathematics before going to Cambridge.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.280
What caused your interest in philosophy?

08:32.280 --> 08:39.920
Well, two things, two very different things, it caused my interest in philosophy.

08:39.920 --> 08:47.920
On the one hand, I wanted to understand the principles of mathematics.

08:47.920 --> 08:54.680
I observed that all the proofs of mathematical propositions that were taught me were obviously

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
fallacious.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.480
They didn't really prove what they said they did.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.520
And I wanted to know whether there is any truth in the world that is known, and I thought

09:03.520 --> 09:08.000
if there is any, it's probably in mathematics, but it's not in mathematics as I was taught

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
it.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.880
And so I tried to find out some truth there.

09:11.880 --> 09:19.200
The other thing that made me interested in philosophy was the hope that I might find

09:19.200 --> 09:23.600
some basis for religious belief.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.120
Did you find it?

09:25.120 --> 09:31.280
No, in the mathematical part of my hopes I was fairly satisfied, but in the other part

09:31.280 --> 09:33.280
no, not at all.

09:33.280 --> 09:40.720
For a time I found a certain satisfaction in the Platonic, eternal world of ideas, which

09:40.720 --> 09:45.320
has a sort of religious favour and gave me a certain satisfaction.

09:45.320 --> 09:50.040
But then I came to the conclusion that there was nonsense, and I was left without any

09:50.040 --> 09:58.440
satisfaction to it, to say to my desires, and to remain so.

09:58.440 --> 10:05.160
So as far as that goes, philosophy proved to wash out to me, but not on the side of

10:05.160 --> 10:07.560
the technical basis of mathematics.

10:07.560 --> 10:12.880
Wasn't it about here that you entered into what you called a life of disagreements?

10:12.880 --> 10:13.880
Yes.

10:13.880 --> 10:20.880
I disagreed first with my people about both about mathematics and about philosophy.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.560
They cared only about virtue.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.080
They thought virtue was the only thing of importance in the world.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.760
Mathematics therefore was unimportant because it has no ethical content, and philosophy

10:31.760 --> 10:37.120
was positively pernicious because they thought it undermined virtue.

10:37.120 --> 10:44.880
So on that point I had a strong disagreement with my people, but as regards that, of course,

10:44.880 --> 10:51.920
that disagreement was, as far as my personal life was concerned, resolved by my living

10:51.920 --> 10:57.560
among academic people who didn't take that view, so that I got again into a circle of

10:57.560 --> 11:00.480
people whom I was quite at home.

11:00.480 --> 11:08.440
But that was brought to an end by the First War, where I took a pacifist line, I was

11:08.440 --> 11:10.680
against the First War.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.760
I was not against the Second.

11:12.760 --> 11:18.200
Some people think that this is an inconsistency, but it isn't.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.960
I never, during the First War, said that I was against all war.

11:22.960 --> 11:29.840
I said I was against that war, and I still hold that view, I think, that the First

11:29.840 --> 11:34.720
War was a mistake, and I think England's participation in it was a mistake.

11:34.720 --> 11:41.160
I think if that hadn't happened, you would not have had the Communists, you would not

11:41.160 --> 11:45.920
have had the Nazis, you would have not had the Second World War, you would not have had

11:45.920 --> 11:47.200
the threat of a Third.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.920
The world would have been a very much better place, I think.

11:50.920 --> 11:56.280
Germany, in the time of the Kaiser, was not uncivilized.

11:56.280 --> 12:03.280
There was a certain amount of suppression of opinion, but less than there now is everywhere

12:03.280 --> 12:07.280
except in England and Scandinavia.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.000
So it really wasn't really bad.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.600
If you propaganda purposes, the Kaiser's government was represented as truthful, but

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
they presented talk.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.480
It wasn't really true.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.400
Your opinions today in regard to Russia are not altogether friendly.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.600
Did you always feel that way about the Bolsheviks?

12:24.600 --> 12:29.600
Yes, and that caused another violent disagreement.

12:29.600 --> 12:39.520
Going to my pacifism during the First War, I'd become estranged from what you might call

12:39.520 --> 12:50.200
conventional people, and then I went to Russia in 1920, and found that I dominated the Soviet

12:50.200 --> 12:51.200
government.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.720
They were dreadful people, dreadful people already, and becoming more so, sure to go

12:55.720 --> 12:57.720
on becoming more so.

12:57.720 --> 13:03.680
And so then I had to break with all the people who endured my pacifism, who all liked Russia

13:03.680 --> 13:10.120
or thought they did, so that I was left in a very great isolation at that time.

13:10.120 --> 13:17.080
However, I escaped some of the pain of it by going to China, where I spent a very happy

13:17.080 --> 13:18.080
year.

13:18.480 --> 13:28.200
I liked the Chinese very much, and there I found people that I could agree with that

13:28.200 --> 13:29.600
I could like.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.600
Any conclusions about China?

13:31.600 --> 13:34.800
Oh, I don't know about conclusions.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.040
I don't think I came to any particular conclusions.

13:39.040 --> 13:47.040
I continued to think as I had thought before that democracy is the best form of government

13:47.120 --> 13:49.000
where it will work.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.760
It didn't work very well in China.

13:50.760 --> 13:56.200
It wasn't working at all, and I could see that it wouldn't work there.

13:56.200 --> 14:05.160
They hadn't the political experience, but I thought it would work there in time, and

14:05.160 --> 14:10.680
I'd say it would have done if circumstances had been a little more propitious.

14:10.680 --> 14:15.760
On your return, the focus of your interests changed, didn't it?

14:15.760 --> 14:23.800
Yes, going to the birth of my two elder children, I became very much interested in education,

14:23.800 --> 14:33.960
and at first, especially in education in the very early years, I didn't like the old-fashioned

14:33.960 --> 14:38.360
schools for a number of reasons.

14:38.360 --> 14:42.760
I didn't altogether like the progressive schools, though in some respects I thought

14:42.760 --> 14:47.920
much better than the older ones, but there were some things about progressive schools,

14:47.920 --> 14:53.840
at least about most progressive schools, that I didn't feel right.

14:53.840 --> 14:58.400
I thought they didn't pay enough attention to instruction.

14:58.400 --> 15:05.840
It seems to me that in our technically complex world, you can't play any important part unless

15:05.840 --> 15:12.680
you have a very considerable amount of actual knowledge, and I don't think that most children

15:13.600 --> 15:20.120
will acquire much knowledge unless there is a certain amount of discipline in school.

15:20.120 --> 15:26.520
I think the degree of discipline required for acquiring knowledge ought to be insisted

15:26.520 --> 15:31.880
upon and isn't sufficiently insisted upon in the good many modern schools that I know.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.520
Did you change any of your opinions in that regard?

15:35.960 --> 15:43.600
Well, I suppose to some degree I tried running a school of my own because I wasn't satisfied

15:43.600 --> 15:46.600
with other schools.

15:46.600 --> 15:51.320
I haven't the talents of an administrator, and I wasn't satisfied with the school that

15:51.320 --> 15:52.720
I tried to run.

15:52.720 --> 16:00.880
Fortunately, at just about that time, a certain modern school that I was interested in became,

16:00.880 --> 16:05.720
I thought, quite good enough, and I was satisfied with that.

16:05.720 --> 16:13.560
I have, I suppose, changed my opinions not only about education, but about a good many

16:13.560 --> 16:15.480
things.

16:15.480 --> 16:25.800
As a result of seeing the kind of nefarious things that people do, I think that freedom

16:25.800 --> 16:29.120
is not a panacea for all things.

16:29.240 --> 16:34.960
I think there are good many matters in which freedom should be restrained, some of them

16:34.960 --> 16:38.480
things in which it's not sufficiently restrained at present.

16:38.480 --> 16:44.000
In the relations between nations there ought to be less freedom than there is, I think.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.480
And to some degree this applies in modern education too.

16:48.480 --> 16:55.160
I think that some progressive schools certainly have more freedom than you ought to have.

16:55.200 --> 16:59.400
There are some freedoms that I think are desirable in education.

16:59.400 --> 17:06.120
Now, in the old-fashioned school, if a child uses a swear word, it's thought worse than

17:06.120 --> 17:12.000
if he commits an unkind action, and that seems to be observed, and clearly the unkind action

17:12.000 --> 17:16.560
matters more, and in that sort of way I don't like the old-fashioned way.

17:16.560 --> 17:22.240
I also think that children should be free to explore the facts of life to a degree that

17:22.320 --> 17:26.760
they are not brought up in an old-fashioned way.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.160
I think there should be free speech.

17:28.160 --> 17:35.280
There are a number of things that I like very much about modern education, but both in education

17:35.280 --> 17:44.040
and in other matters, I think freedom must have very definite limitations where you come

17:44.040 --> 17:49.480
to things that are definitely harmful to other people or things that prevent you yourself

17:49.600 --> 17:54.400
from being useful, such as lack of knowledge.

17:54.400 --> 18:00.640
So there are those respects in which, I suppose, I should lay less stress on freedom than in

18:00.640 --> 18:02.120
former times.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.040
Do you still believe in the importance of abstract philosophy?

18:06.040 --> 18:09.480
Well, now that's a very difficult question.

18:09.480 --> 18:18.000
I have myself a passion for clarity and exactness and sharp outlines for some reason that I've

18:18.040 --> 18:23.600
never understood, which makes people think that I have no passions, that I'm a cold

18:23.600 --> 18:24.600
fish.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.600
I don't know why, but it does cause people to think that.

18:27.600 --> 18:33.680
I don't myself think that's altogether just, so that's neither here nor there.

18:33.680 --> 18:40.360
But I do like clarity and exact thinking, and I believe that very important to mankind,

18:40.360 --> 18:47.360
because when you allow yourself to think inexactly, your prejudices, your bias, your self-interest,

18:48.640 --> 18:54.640
comes in in ways you don't notice, and you do bad things without knowing that you're

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
doing them.

18:55.640 --> 19:01.080
Self-reception is very easy, so that I do think clear thinking, immensely important.

19:01.080 --> 19:07.880
But I don't think philosophy, in the old-fashioned sense, is quite the thing the world needs

19:07.880 --> 19:08.880
nowadays.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.880
I think it needs the world a different from there.

19:14.160 --> 19:19.160
Well, just what you feel today's needs are.

19:19.160 --> 19:26.160
Well, of course, the needs depend on what a person's capacities are.

19:26.160 --> 19:35.640
But if I were now, at this moment, a young man, whether in England or in America, I

19:35.640 --> 19:42.400
should not take to philosophy, I should think there were other things better to take to.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.920
If I had the necessary capacity, I think I would be a physicist.

19:46.920 --> 19:57.120
If my capacities didn't run in that direction, I should think that history, psychology, mass

19:57.120 --> 20:03.480
psychology especially, theory of politics, things of that sort are much better worth

20:03.480 --> 20:06.760
working at than pure philosophy.

20:06.760 --> 20:11.120
And it's that sort of thing that I should take to if I were now young.

20:11.200 --> 20:16.320
Lord Russell, what do you think the world needs to reach a happier state?

20:16.320 --> 20:20.640
Well, I think there are three things that are needed.

20:20.640 --> 20:28.120
If the world is to adapt itself to the industrial revolution, the troubles we are suffering now

20:28.120 --> 20:35.840
are essentially troubles due to adapting ourselves to a new phase of human life, namely the industrial

20:35.840 --> 20:37.960
phase.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.720
And I think three things are necessary if people are to live happily in the industrial phase.

20:44.720 --> 20:49.560
One of these is world government.

20:49.560 --> 20:57.800
The second is an approximate economic equality between different parts of the world.

20:57.800 --> 21:04.320
And the third is a nearly stationary population.

21:04.320 --> 21:09.360
And I'd say a little about each of those.

21:09.360 --> 21:15.960
As to world government, the world government should be, of course, a federal government

21:15.960 --> 21:23.120
leaving a very great deal of freedom to the individual national governments.

21:23.120 --> 21:28.960
And only those things controlled by the world government, which are absolutely necessary

21:28.960 --> 21:32.520
for the avoidance of war.

21:32.520 --> 21:38.400
The most important and the most difficult of these is armed forces.

21:38.400 --> 21:44.880
All the important weapons of war will have to be in the hands of the international government

21:44.880 --> 21:46.960
and the way to load them.

21:46.960 --> 21:51.960
When that happens, war will become practically impossible.

21:51.960 --> 21:55.280
And if war were impossible, mankind could go ahead.

21:55.280 --> 22:01.880
If war is not impossible, every advance in scientific technique means an advance in

22:01.960 --> 22:05.560
mass murder and is therefore undesirable.

22:05.560 --> 22:11.440
But if one's world peace were achieved, it would be just the opposite.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.120
That's the first point.

22:13.120 --> 22:19.600
Now I come on to the question of approximate economic equality.

22:19.600 --> 22:30.240
As things stand present, Western Europe and still more the United States of America have

22:30.360 --> 22:32.600
a high standard of life.

22:32.600 --> 22:38.280
On the whole, the great majority of mankind live fairly comfortably from a material point

22:38.280 --> 22:39.480
of view.

22:39.480 --> 22:47.480
Asia, on the other hand, lives in very, very great poverty, so does most of Africa.

22:47.480 --> 22:56.240
And the moment people are sufficiently educated to be aware of these facts, the inevitable

22:56.240 --> 23:01.920
result is a great development of envy in the poorer parts of the world.

23:01.920 --> 23:09.920
That envy is a cause of unrest and inevitably makes world peace precarious.

23:09.920 --> 23:16.920
There's only one way of dealing with it, which is to produce approximate economic equality,

23:16.920 --> 23:21.240
which of course is a long story, but it can be done.

23:21.240 --> 23:26.240
The third point about population is very vital indeed.

23:26.240 --> 23:34.240
The food supply of the world tends at present to diminish through the denuration of the

23:34.240 --> 23:35.240
soil.

23:35.240 --> 23:40.920
It tends of course also to increase through various technical advances, but those two

23:40.920 --> 23:47.640
are about balance, so that on the whole food produce of the world does not increase appreciably.

23:47.640 --> 23:53.360
Now that means that unless everybody is to be very poor, especially if you have economic

23:53.360 --> 24:02.120
equality, unless everybody is to be very poor, there must be not more people to be fed, not

24:02.120 --> 24:08.280
many more than there are now, and therefore you've got to get approximate economic equality

24:08.280 --> 24:14.120
of population and approximately stationary population, otherwise those parts of the world

24:14.120 --> 24:18.760
where the population increases fast, we want to go to war with those where it increases

24:18.760 --> 24:22.160
slowly.

24:22.160 --> 24:27.840
That brings us precisely to the problem of Asia and what part Asia will play in the immediate

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
future.

24:28.840 --> 24:41.880
Well, Asia first of all has risen to the point of education, some nations have, where it is

24:41.880 --> 24:48.720
not prepared any longer to be subservient to the white man.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.480
It hasn't noticed the Russians are white.

24:52.480 --> 24:58.760
If it had, it would take a different line, but it seems to think the Russians are yellow

24:58.760 --> 25:01.040
or black or some other color.

25:01.040 --> 25:07.200
And I think our propaganda ought to be mainly devoted to saying only Russians also are white.

25:07.200 --> 25:13.040
I believe that would be the effective propaganda to use in Asia, but I pass that point by.

25:13.040 --> 25:20.160
Asia clearly is going to claim equality with the white man, and it's perfectly futile,

25:20.160 --> 25:24.960
absolutely futile, for the white man to resist that claim.

25:24.960 --> 25:31.120
It will infallibly win, infallibly, and we ought therefore to concede it graciously once

25:31.120 --> 25:32.480
before we're driven to it.

25:32.600 --> 25:42.200
You can see complete equality to Asia, but if Asia is not to overwhelm the rest of the

25:42.200 --> 25:50.640
world with a vast land population and poverty, Asia must live up to its responsibilities

25:50.640 --> 25:56.960
and must learn the sort of things we have learned in the West, which is how to maintain

25:56.960 --> 25:59.560
a roughly stationary population.

25:59.560 --> 26:03.880
And if they can't learn that, which I fully believe they can learn and learn quickly,

26:03.880 --> 26:08.320
much more quickly than most people think, if they can't learn that, they will not have

26:08.320 --> 26:11.160
won their claim to equality.

26:11.160 --> 26:18.240
Lord Russell, speaking as of today, can you see the influence of any one philosopher more

26:18.240 --> 26:19.720
than any other one?

26:19.720 --> 26:26.080
Well, I suppose in recent years the most important influence has been Marx.

26:26.080 --> 26:31.560
If you can dignify him with the name of philosopher, I should hardly like to dignify himself myself,

26:31.560 --> 26:37.440
but I suppose he must count in the list, and he certainly has had more influence than anybody

26:37.440 --> 26:38.440
else.

26:38.440 --> 26:43.560
For those of us who reject Marx, can you offer any positive philosophy to help us toward

26:43.560 --> 26:45.640
a more hopeful future?

26:45.640 --> 26:55.800
Well, as to that, you see, I think one of the troubles of the world has been the habit

26:56.520 --> 27:00.360
of dogmatically believing something or other.

27:00.360 --> 27:05.280
And I think all these methods are full of doubt, and the rational man will not be too

27:05.280 --> 27:08.200
sure that he's right.

27:08.200 --> 27:15.720
I think that we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt.

27:15.720 --> 27:20.400
I shouldn't wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.400
Not even mine.

27:21.880 --> 27:26.560
No, I think we should accept our philosophies as a measure of doubt.

27:26.560 --> 27:32.960
What I do think is this, that if a philosophy is to bring happiness, it should be inspired

27:32.960 --> 27:35.080
by kindly feeling.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.920
Now Marx is not inspired by kindly feeling.

27:38.920 --> 27:44.720
Marx pretended that he wanted the happiness of the proletariat, but he really wanted

27:44.720 --> 27:48.120
the unhappiness of the bourgeoisie.

27:48.120 --> 27:54.120
And it was because of that negative element, because of that hate element that his philosophy

27:54.120 --> 27:55.120
produced disaster.

27:55.120 --> 28:01.920
A philosophy which is to do good must be one inspired by kindly feeling, not by unkindly

28:01.920 --> 28:02.920
feeling.

28:02.920 --> 28:08.080
Coming up, Lord Russell, do you feel that there is hope for the world today?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.480
Well, I do.

28:09.480 --> 28:15.160
I feel it very strongly, but how far that is really a rational conviction, how far

28:15.160 --> 28:17.800
it's temperamental, I can't say.

28:17.800 --> 28:22.560
But I do most strongly feel that there is hope.

28:22.560 --> 28:30.920
There may be very dreadful times ahead of us, I dare say there are, but I still believe,

28:30.920 --> 28:39.560
I believe most firmly that through whatever pain, suffering, mankind will emerge from these

28:39.560 --> 28:44.960
dreadful things and will emerge into some world that will be happier than any world

28:44.960 --> 28:47.080
that has existed in the past.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.920
I'm firmly persuaded of that.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.760
What I don't know is how long it will take.

29:00.920 --> 29:01.920
Thank you.

29:01.920 --> 29:02.920
