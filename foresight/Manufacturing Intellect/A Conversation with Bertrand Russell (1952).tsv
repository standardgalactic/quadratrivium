30000	31000	How do you do?
31000	32000	How do you do, Lord Russell?
32000	33000	Won't you sit down?
33000	34000	Thank you.
34000	38000	Now, what are we going to talk about?
38000	54000	Well, Lord Russell, as you approach your 80th birthday, I think we'd like you to tell us
54000	58240	what you think you have learned and what you think you will never learn in your career
58240	60240	as a philosopher.
60240	68240	Well, there are some things that I don't think I shall ever learn, and indeed I hope I shall
68240	69920	never learn.
69920	74240	I don't wish to learn to change my hopes for the world.
74240	80000	I'm prepared to change my beliefs about the state of the world, about what happens, but
80000	81480	not about what I hope.
81480	84720	About that I hope to remain constant.
84720	92880	I think we might call the subject of our talk 80 years of changing beliefs and unchanging
92880	93880	hopes.
93880	103800	It's very difficult for anybody born since 1914 to realize how profoundly different the
103800	108480	world is now from what it was when I was a child.
108480	112520	The change has been almost unbelievable.
112520	121800	I try as best I can in spite of my years to get used to living in a world of atom bombs,
121800	131080	a world where ancient empires vanished like morning mist, where we have to accustom ourselves
131080	137200	to Asiatic self-assertion to communist menace.
138200	145040	The world is altogether so different from what it was when I was young that it's an
145040	151600	extraordinarily difficult thing for an old man to live in such a world.
151600	156600	I was born in 1872.
156600	163360	My parents died when I was still an infant, and so I was brought up by my grandparent.
163360	165920	Can you tell us something about your grandfather?
166640	169680	Yes, I can tell you something about my grandfather.
169680	174920	He was born in the early years of the French Revolution.
174920	180920	He was a member of parliament while Napoleon was still on the throne.
180920	187800	In common with all the Whig followers of fucks, he thought English hostility to Napoleon
187800	194040	was excessive, and he visited Napoleon in Helba.
194040	202200	It was he who introduced the reform bill in 1832, which started England on the road
202200	204720	towards democracy.
204720	211640	He was prime minister during our Mexican War, during the revolutions of 1848.
211640	217840	I remember him quite well, but as you can see he belonged to an age that now seems rather
217840	221280	removed.
221280	233560	And the world where I was young was a solid world, a world where all kinds of things that
233560	237120	have now disappeared were thought to be going to last forever.
237120	242080	It didn't dawn on people the things.
242080	246440	English people certainly regarded English naval supremacy as a sort of law of nature.
246640	252000	Britannia ruled the way it didn't occur to us that that might stop.
252000	254640	Even with Bismarck?
254640	263280	Bismarck was regarded as a rascal and was thought of as an uneducated farmer.
263280	268000	But it was assumed that the influence of Goethe and Schiller would gradually bring Germany
268000	271040	back to a more civilized point of view.
271280	275720	And moreover, we thought of Germany as only a land power.
275720	278800	Germany had at that time no navy.
278800	280280	We went all afraid of Germany.
280280	287760	In fact, liberal opinion was more favorable to Germany than to France at that time.
287760	296120	Bismarck himself compared Germany and England to an elephant and a whale, each formidable
296120	299120	in its own element, but no danger to each other.
299120	300120	And that was how we felt.
300200	304400	We were not afraid of Bismarck at all.
304400	309120	It was thought that there was going to be ordered progress throughout the world.
309120	312040	Gradually every country was going to take to parliaments.
312040	317600	There was going to be a bicameral legislature and two parties and it was all going to be
317600	321600	exactly like England everywhere, all over the world.
321600	327120	My grandmother used to laugh because one time she said to the Russian ambassador, perhaps
327120	335640	someday you will have a parliament in Russia, and he said, God forbid, my dear Lady Russell.
335640	341640	Except for the first word, the Russian ambassador at the present day might give the same answer.
341640	343640	But that was the assumption.
343640	348520	It was all going to be orderly, all quite nice.
348520	358560	The atmosphere, apart from politics, was one of a puritan piety, very great piety, very
358560	362040	great austerity.
362040	367320	We always had family prayers at eight, and before family prayers I had to do half an
367320	372520	hour's practice at the piano, which I hated.
372520	379280	Although there were eight servants in the house, the food was always at most simplicity,
379280	384600	and even if there was anything at all nice, I wasn't allowed to have it because it wasn't
384600	386640	good for children to eat nice things.
386640	390520	For instance, there would be rice pudding and apple tart.
390520	396360	Lornapp said the apple tart, and I had the rice pudding, and there was extreme austerity
396360	398920	in all those ways.
398920	406440	My grandmother, until she was over 70, would never sit in an armchair until after dinner,
406440	407840	ever.
407840	414360	It's almost gone out that sort of austere living by well-to-do people, which in those
414360	416360	days was fairly common.
416360	417840	When did you get to Cambridge?
417840	426240	Oh, I got to Cambridge when I was 18, and that, of course, was a new world to me completely.
426240	435040	For the first time I met people who, when I said anything that I really thought, I didn't
435040	442560	think it absurd, I'd learnt at home to say almost nothing about what I really thought.
442560	449320	People had a horror of philosophy which interested me, and they would say every time philosophy
449320	452080	was mentioned.
452080	456960	Everybody is summed up completely in these two questions.
456960	458960	What is matter?
458960	460360	Never mind.
460360	461640	What is mind?
461640	462640	No matter.
462640	467560	And at about the sixtieth repetition of this remark, I ceased to be amused by it.
467560	472680	When I got to Cambridge, it was a great comfort to me to find people who didn't regard philosophy
472680	473680	as absurd.
473680	479160	So that I was very, very happy when I first got to Cambridge.
479160	484880	I quickly got to know a great many people who became my lifelong friends.
484880	489560	Most of them, I'm sorry to say, are dead now, but those who are still alive are still my
489560	491200	friends.
491200	496200	You started with mathematics, didn't you, and then moved to philosophy?
496200	497200	That is so, yes.
497200	503520	I did three years of mathematics and one year of philosophy at Cambridge.
503520	508560	I had done only mathematics before going to Cambridge.
508560	512280	What caused your interest in philosophy?
512280	519920	Well, two things, two very different things, it caused my interest in philosophy.
519920	527920	On the one hand, I wanted to understand the principles of mathematics.
527920	534680	I observed that all the proofs of mathematical propositions that were taught me were obviously
534680	535680	fallacious.
535680	538480	They didn't really prove what they said they did.
538480	543520	And I wanted to know whether there is any truth in the world that is known, and I thought
543520	548000	if there is any, it's probably in mathematics, but it's not in mathematics as I was taught
548000	549000	it.
549000	551880	And so I tried to find out some truth there.
551880	559200	The other thing that made me interested in philosophy was the hope that I might find
559200	563600	some basis for religious belief.
564120	565120	Did you find it?
565120	571280	No, in the mathematical part of my hopes I was fairly satisfied, but in the other part
571280	573280	no, not at all.
573280	580720	For a time I found a certain satisfaction in the Platonic, eternal world of ideas, which
580720	585320	has a sort of religious favour and gave me a certain satisfaction.
585320	590040	But then I came to the conclusion that there was nonsense, and I was left without any
590040	598440	satisfaction to it, to say to my desires, and to remain so.
598440	605160	So as far as that goes, philosophy proved to wash out to me, but not on the side of
605160	607560	the technical basis of mathematics.
607560	612880	Wasn't it about here that you entered into what you called a life of disagreements?
612880	613880	Yes.
613880	620880	I disagreed first with my people about both about mathematics and about philosophy.
620880	622560	They cared only about virtue.
622560	627080	They thought virtue was the only thing of importance in the world.
627080	631760	Mathematics therefore was unimportant because it has no ethical content, and philosophy
631760	637120	was positively pernicious because they thought it undermined virtue.
637120	644880	So on that point I had a strong disagreement with my people, but as regards that, of course,
644880	651920	that disagreement was, as far as my personal life was concerned, resolved by my living
651920	657560	among academic people who didn't take that view, so that I got again into a circle of
657560	660480	people whom I was quite at home.
660480	668440	But that was brought to an end by the First War, where I took a pacifist line, I was
668440	670680	against the First War.
670680	672760	I was not against the Second.
672760	678200	Some people think that this is an inconsistency, but it isn't.
678200	682960	I never, during the First War, said that I was against all war.
682960	689840	I said I was against that war, and I still hold that view, I think, that the First
689840	694720	War was a mistake, and I think England's participation in it was a mistake.
694720	701160	I think if that hadn't happened, you would not have had the Communists, you would not
701160	705920	have had the Nazis, you would have not had the Second World War, you would not have had
705920	707200	the threat of a Third.
707200	710920	The world would have been a very much better place, I think.
710920	716280	Germany, in the time of the Kaiser, was not uncivilized.
716280	723280	There was a certain amount of suppression of opinion, but less than there now is everywhere
723280	727280	except in England and Scandinavia.
727280	730000	So it really wasn't really bad.
730000	734600	If you propaganda purposes, the Kaiser's government was represented as truthful, but
734600	735600	they presented talk.
735600	737480	It wasn't really true.
737480	741400	Your opinions today in regard to Russia are not altogether friendly.
741400	744600	Did you always feel that way about the Bolsheviks?
744600	749600	Yes, and that caused another violent disagreement.
749600	759520	Going to my pacifism during the First War, I'd become estranged from what you might call
759520	770200	conventional people, and then I went to Russia in 1920, and found that I dominated the Soviet
770200	771200	government.
771200	775720	They were dreadful people, dreadful people already, and becoming more so, sure to go
775720	777720	on becoming more so.
777720	783680	And so then I had to break with all the people who endured my pacifism, who all liked Russia
783680	790120	or thought they did, so that I was left in a very great isolation at that time.
790120	797080	However, I escaped some of the pain of it by going to China, where I spent a very happy
797080	798080	year.
798480	808200	I liked the Chinese very much, and there I found people that I could agree with that
808200	809600	I could like.
809600	811600	Any conclusions about China?
811600	814800	Oh, I don't know about conclusions.
814800	819040	I don't think I came to any particular conclusions.
819040	827040	I continued to think as I had thought before that democracy is the best form of government
827120	829000	where it will work.
829000	830760	It didn't work very well in China.
830760	836200	It wasn't working at all, and I could see that it wouldn't work there.
836200	845160	They hadn't the political experience, but I thought it would work there in time, and
845160	850680	I'd say it would have done if circumstances had been a little more propitious.
850680	855760	On your return, the focus of your interests changed, didn't it?
855760	863800	Yes, going to the birth of my two elder children, I became very much interested in education,
863800	873960	and at first, especially in education in the very early years, I didn't like the old-fashioned
873960	878360	schools for a number of reasons.
878360	882760	I didn't altogether like the progressive schools, though in some respects I thought
882760	887920	much better than the older ones, but there were some things about progressive schools,
887920	893840	at least about most progressive schools, that I didn't feel right.
893840	898400	I thought they didn't pay enough attention to instruction.
898400	905840	It seems to me that in our technically complex world, you can't play any important part unless
905840	912680	you have a very considerable amount of actual knowledge, and I don't think that most children
913600	920120	will acquire much knowledge unless there is a certain amount of discipline in school.
920120	926520	I think the degree of discipline required for acquiring knowledge ought to be insisted
926520	931880	upon and isn't sufficiently insisted upon in the good many modern schools that I know.
931880	935520	Did you change any of your opinions in that regard?
935960	943600	Well, I suppose to some degree I tried running a school of my own because I wasn't satisfied
943600	946600	with other schools.
946600	951320	I haven't the talents of an administrator, and I wasn't satisfied with the school that
951320	952720	I tried to run.
952720	960880	Fortunately, at just about that time, a certain modern school that I was interested in became,
960880	965720	I thought, quite good enough, and I was satisfied with that.
965720	973560	I have, I suppose, changed my opinions not only about education, but about a good many
973560	975480	things.
975480	985800	As a result of seeing the kind of nefarious things that people do, I think that freedom
985800	989120	is not a panacea for all things.
989240	994960	I think there are good many matters in which freedom should be restrained, some of them
994960	998480	things in which it's not sufficiently restrained at present.
998480	1004000	In the relations between nations there ought to be less freedom than there is, I think.
1004000	1008480	And to some degree this applies in modern education too.
1008480	1015160	I think that some progressive schools certainly have more freedom than you ought to have.
1015200	1019400	There are some freedoms that I think are desirable in education.
1019400	1026120	Now, in the old-fashioned school, if a child uses a swear word, it's thought worse than
1026120	1032000	if he commits an unkind action, and that seems to be observed, and clearly the unkind action
1032000	1036560	matters more, and in that sort of way I don't like the old-fashioned way.
1036560	1042240	I also think that children should be free to explore the facts of life to a degree that
1042320	1046760	they are not brought up in an old-fashioned way.
1046760	1048160	I think there should be free speech.
1048160	1055280	There are a number of things that I like very much about modern education, but both in education
1055280	1064040	and in other matters, I think freedom must have very definite limitations where you come
1064040	1069480	to things that are definitely harmful to other people or things that prevent you yourself
1069600	1074400	from being useful, such as lack of knowledge.
1074400	1080640	So there are those respects in which, I suppose, I should lay less stress on freedom than in
1080640	1082120	former times.
1082120	1086040	Do you still believe in the importance of abstract philosophy?
1086040	1089480	Well, now that's a very difficult question.
1089480	1098000	I have myself a passion for clarity and exactness and sharp outlines for some reason that I've
1098040	1103600	never understood, which makes people think that I have no passions, that I'm a cold
1103600	1104600	fish.
1104600	1107600	I don't know why, but it does cause people to think that.
1107600	1113680	I don't myself think that's altogether just, so that's neither here nor there.
1113680	1120360	But I do like clarity and exact thinking, and I believe that very important to mankind,
1120360	1127360	because when you allow yourself to think inexactly, your prejudices, your bias, your self-interest,
1128640	1134640	comes in in ways you don't notice, and you do bad things without knowing that you're
1134640	1135640	doing them.
1135640	1141080	Self-reception is very easy, so that I do think clear thinking, immensely important.
1141080	1147880	But I don't think philosophy, in the old-fashioned sense, is quite the thing the world needs
1147880	1148880	nowadays.
1148880	1153880	I think it needs the world a different from there.
1154160	1159160	Well, just what you feel today's needs are.
1159160	1166160	Well, of course, the needs depend on what a person's capacities are.
1166160	1175640	But if I were now, at this moment, a young man, whether in England or in America, I
1175640	1182400	should not take to philosophy, I should think there were other things better to take to.
1182400	1186920	If I had the necessary capacity, I think I would be a physicist.
1186920	1197120	If my capacities didn't run in that direction, I should think that history, psychology, mass
1197120	1203480	psychology especially, theory of politics, things of that sort are much better worth
1203480	1206760	working at than pure philosophy.
1206760	1211120	And it's that sort of thing that I should take to if I were now young.
1211200	1216320	Lord Russell, what do you think the world needs to reach a happier state?
1216320	1220640	Well, I think there are three things that are needed.
1220640	1228120	If the world is to adapt itself to the industrial revolution, the troubles we are suffering now
1228120	1235840	are essentially troubles due to adapting ourselves to a new phase of human life, namely the industrial
1235840	1237960	phase.
1238000	1244720	And I think three things are necessary if people are to live happily in the industrial phase.
1244720	1249560	One of these is world government.
1249560	1257800	The second is an approximate economic equality between different parts of the world.
1257800	1264320	And the third is a nearly stationary population.
1264320	1269360	And I'd say a little about each of those.
1269360	1275960	As to world government, the world government should be, of course, a federal government
1275960	1283120	leaving a very great deal of freedom to the individual national governments.
1283120	1288960	And only those things controlled by the world government, which are absolutely necessary
1288960	1292520	for the avoidance of war.
1292520	1298400	The most important and the most difficult of these is armed forces.
1298400	1304880	All the important weapons of war will have to be in the hands of the international government
1304880	1306960	and the way to load them.
1306960	1311960	When that happens, war will become practically impossible.
1311960	1315280	And if war were impossible, mankind could go ahead.
1315280	1321880	If war is not impossible, every advance in scientific technique means an advance in
1321960	1325560	mass murder and is therefore undesirable.
1325560	1331440	But if one's world peace were achieved, it would be just the opposite.
1331440	1333120	That's the first point.
1333120	1339600	Now I come on to the question of approximate economic equality.
1339600	1350240	As things stand present, Western Europe and still more the United States of America have
1350360	1352600	a high standard of life.
1352600	1358280	On the whole, the great majority of mankind live fairly comfortably from a material point
1358280	1359480	of view.
1359480	1367480	Asia, on the other hand, lives in very, very great poverty, so does most of Africa.
1367480	1376240	And the moment people are sufficiently educated to be aware of these facts, the inevitable
1376240	1381920	result is a great development of envy in the poorer parts of the world.
1381920	1389920	That envy is a cause of unrest and inevitably makes world peace precarious.
1389920	1396920	There's only one way of dealing with it, which is to produce approximate economic equality,
1396920	1401240	which of course is a long story, but it can be done.
1401240	1406240	The third point about population is very vital indeed.
1406240	1414240	The food supply of the world tends at present to diminish through the denuration of the
1414240	1415240	soil.
1415240	1420920	It tends of course also to increase through various technical advances, but those two
1420920	1427640	are about balance, so that on the whole food produce of the world does not increase appreciably.
1427640	1433360	Now that means that unless everybody is to be very poor, especially if you have economic
1433360	1442120	equality, unless everybody is to be very poor, there must be not more people to be fed, not
1442120	1448280	many more than there are now, and therefore you've got to get approximate economic equality
1448280	1454120	of population and approximately stationary population, otherwise those parts of the world
1454120	1458760	where the population increases fast, we want to go to war with those where it increases
1458760	1462160	slowly.
1462160	1467840	That brings us precisely to the problem of Asia and what part Asia will play in the immediate
1467840	1468840	future.
1468840	1481880	Well, Asia first of all has risen to the point of education, some nations have, where it is
1481880	1488720	not prepared any longer to be subservient to the white man.
1488720	1492480	It hasn't noticed the Russians are white.
1492480	1498760	If it had, it would take a different line, but it seems to think the Russians are yellow
1498760	1501040	or black or some other color.
1501040	1507200	And I think our propaganda ought to be mainly devoted to saying only Russians also are white.
1507200	1513040	I believe that would be the effective propaganda to use in Asia, but I pass that point by.
1513040	1520160	Asia clearly is going to claim equality with the white man, and it's perfectly futile,
1520160	1524960	absolutely futile, for the white man to resist that claim.
1524960	1531120	It will infallibly win, infallibly, and we ought therefore to concede it graciously once
1531120	1532480	before we're driven to it.
1532600	1542200	You can see complete equality to Asia, but if Asia is not to overwhelm the rest of the
1542200	1550640	world with a vast land population and poverty, Asia must live up to its responsibilities
1550640	1556960	and must learn the sort of things we have learned in the West, which is how to maintain
1556960	1559560	a roughly stationary population.
1559560	1563880	And if they can't learn that, which I fully believe they can learn and learn quickly,
1563880	1568320	much more quickly than most people think, if they can't learn that, they will not have
1568320	1571160	won their claim to equality.
1571160	1578240	Lord Russell, speaking as of today, can you see the influence of any one philosopher more
1578240	1579720	than any other one?
1579720	1586080	Well, I suppose in recent years the most important influence has been Marx.
1586080	1591560	If you can dignify him with the name of philosopher, I should hardly like to dignify himself myself,
1591560	1597440	but I suppose he must count in the list, and he certainly has had more influence than anybody
1597440	1598440	else.
1598440	1603560	For those of us who reject Marx, can you offer any positive philosophy to help us toward
1603560	1605640	a more hopeful future?
1605640	1615800	Well, as to that, you see, I think one of the troubles of the world has been the habit
1616520	1620360	of dogmatically believing something or other.
1620360	1625280	And I think all these methods are full of doubt, and the rational man will not be too
1625280	1628200	sure that he's right.
1628200	1635720	I think that we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt.
1635720	1640400	I shouldn't wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine.
1640400	1641400	Not even mine.
1641880	1646560	No, I think we should accept our philosophies as a measure of doubt.
1646560	1652960	What I do think is this, that if a philosophy is to bring happiness, it should be inspired
1652960	1655080	by kindly feeling.
1655080	1658920	Now Marx is not inspired by kindly feeling.
1658920	1664720	Marx pretended that he wanted the happiness of the proletariat, but he really wanted
1664720	1668120	the unhappiness of the bourgeoisie.
1668120	1674120	And it was because of that negative element, because of that hate element that his philosophy
1674120	1675120	produced disaster.
1675120	1681920	A philosophy which is to do good must be one inspired by kindly feeling, not by unkindly
1681920	1682920	feeling.
1682920	1688080	Coming up, Lord Russell, do you feel that there is hope for the world today?
1688080	1689480	Well, I do.
1689480	1695160	I feel it very strongly, but how far that is really a rational conviction, how far
1695160	1697800	it's temperamental, I can't say.
1697800	1702560	But I do most strongly feel that there is hope.
1702560	1710920	There may be very dreadful times ahead of us, I dare say there are, but I still believe,
1710920	1719560	I believe most firmly that through whatever pain, suffering, mankind will emerge from these
1719560	1724960	dreadful things and will emerge into some world that will be happier than any world
1724960	1727080	that has existed in the past.
1727080	1729920	I'm firmly persuaded of that.
1729920	1731760	What I don't know is how long it will take.
1740920	1741920	Thank you.
1741920	1742920	Thank you.
