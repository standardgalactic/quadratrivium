1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How do you do?

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How do you do, Lord Russell?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Won't you sit down?

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, what are we going to talk about?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, Lord Russell, as you approach your 80th birthday, I think we'd like you to tell us

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,240
what you think you have learned and what you think you will never learn in your career

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,240
as a philosopher.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Well, there are some things that I don't think I shall ever learn, and indeed I hope I shall

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
never learn.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
I don't wish to learn to change my hopes for the world.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm prepared to change my beliefs about the state of the world, about what happens, but

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,480
not about what I hope.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,720
About that I hope to remain constant.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,880
I think we might call the subject of our talk 80 years of changing beliefs and unchanging

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
hopes.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:43,800
It's very difficult for anybody born since 1914 to realize how profoundly different the

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,480
world is now from what it was when I was a child.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,520
The change has been almost unbelievable.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:01,800
I try as best I can in spite of my years to get used to living in a world of atom bombs,

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:11,080
a world where ancient empires vanished like morning mist, where we have to accustom ourselves

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,200
to Asiatic self-assertion to communist menace.

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,040
The world is altogether so different from what it was when I was young that it's an

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,600
extraordinarily difficult thing for an old man to live in such a world.

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I was born in 1872.

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,360
My parents died when I was still an infant, and so I was brought up by my grandparent.

27
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
Can you tell us something about your grandfather?

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
Yes, I can tell you something about my grandfather.

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,920
He was born in the early years of the French Revolution.

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,920
He was a member of parliament while Napoleon was still on the throne.

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,800
In common with all the Whig followers of fucks, he thought English hostility to Napoleon

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,040
was excessive, and he visited Napoleon in Helba.

33
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,200
It was he who introduced the reform bill in 1832, which started England on the road

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,720
towards democracy.

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,640
He was prime minister during our Mexican War, during the revolutions of 1848.

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,840
I remember him quite well, but as you can see he belonged to an age that now seems rather

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
removed.

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:53,560
And the world where I was young was a solid world, a world where all kinds of things that

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,120
have now disappeared were thought to be going to last forever.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
It didn't dawn on people the things.

41
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,440
English people certainly regarded English naval supremacy as a sort of law of nature.

42
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,000
Britannia ruled the way it didn't occur to us that that might stop.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
Even with Bismarck?

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,280
Bismarck was regarded as a rascal and was thought of as an uneducated farmer.

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,000
But it was assumed that the influence of Goethe and Schiller would gradually bring Germany

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
back to a more civilized point of view.

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,720
And moreover, we thought of Germany as only a land power.

48
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,800
Germany had at that time no navy.

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,280
We went all afraid of Germany.

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,760
In fact, liberal opinion was more favorable to Germany than to France at that time.

51
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:56,120
Bismarck himself compared Germany and England to an elephant and a whale, each formidable

52
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,120
in its own element, but no danger to each other.

53
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
And that was how we felt.

54
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,400
We were not afraid of Bismarck at all.

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,120
It was thought that there was going to be ordered progress throughout the world.

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,040
Gradually every country was going to take to parliaments.

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,600
There was going to be a bicameral legislature and two parties and it was all going to be

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
exactly like England everywhere, all over the world.

59
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,120
My grandmother used to laugh because one time she said to the Russian ambassador, perhaps

60
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,640
someday you will have a parliament in Russia, and he said, God forbid, my dear Lady Russell.

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Except for the first word, the Russian ambassador at the present day might give the same answer.

62
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
But that was the assumption.

63
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,520
It was all going to be orderly, all quite nice.

64
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:58,560
The atmosphere, apart from politics, was one of a puritan piety, very great piety, very

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,040
great austerity.

66
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,320
We always had family prayers at eight, and before family prayers I had to do half an

67
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,520
hour's practice at the piano, which I hated.

68
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,280
Although there were eight servants in the house, the food was always at most simplicity,

69
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,600
and even if there was anything at all nice, I wasn't allowed to have it because it wasn't

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,640
good for children to eat nice things.

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,520
For instance, there would be rice pudding and apple tart.

72
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,360
Lornapp said the apple tart, and I had the rice pudding, and there was extreme austerity

73
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,920
in all those ways.

74
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:46,440
My grandmother, until she was over 70, would never sit in an armchair until after dinner,

75
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,840
ever.

76
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,360
It's almost gone out that sort of austere living by well-to-do people, which in those

77
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
days was fairly common.

78
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
When did you get to Cambridge?

79
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:06,240
Oh, I got to Cambridge when I was 18, and that, of course, was a new world to me completely.

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:15,040
For the first time I met people who, when I said anything that I really thought, I didn't

81
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:22,560
think it absurd, I'd learnt at home to say almost nothing about what I really thought.

82
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,320
People had a horror of philosophy which interested me, and they would say every time philosophy

83
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,080
was mentioned.

84
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,960
Everybody is summed up completely in these two questions.

85
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
What is matter?

86
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
Never mind.

87
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,640
What is mind?

88
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
No matter.

89
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,560
And at about the sixtieth repetition of this remark, I ceased to be amused by it.

90
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,680
When I got to Cambridge, it was a great comfort to me to find people who didn't regard philosophy

91
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
as absurd.

92
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,160
So that I was very, very happy when I first got to Cambridge.

93
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,880
I quickly got to know a great many people who became my lifelong friends.

94
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,560
Most of them, I'm sorry to say, are dead now, but those who are still alive are still my

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,200
friends.

96
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,200
You started with mathematics, didn't you, and then moved to philosophy?

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
That is so, yes.

98
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,520
I did three years of mathematics and one year of philosophy at Cambridge.

99
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
I had done only mathematics before going to Cambridge.

100
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,280
What caused your interest in philosophy?

101
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,920
Well, two things, two very different things, it caused my interest in philosophy.

102
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,920
On the one hand, I wanted to understand the principles of mathematics.

103
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,680
I observed that all the proofs of mathematical propositions that were taught me were obviously

104
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
fallacious.

105
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,480
They didn't really prove what they said they did.

106
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,520
And I wanted to know whether there is any truth in the world that is known, and I thought

107
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,000
if there is any, it's probably in mathematics, but it's not in mathematics as I was taught

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
it.

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,880
And so I tried to find out some truth there.

110
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,200
The other thing that made me interested in philosophy was the hope that I might find

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,600
some basis for religious belief.

112
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Did you find it?

113
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,280
No, in the mathematical part of my hopes I was fairly satisfied, but in the other part

114
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
no, not at all.

115
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,720
For a time I found a certain satisfaction in the Platonic, eternal world of ideas, which

116
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,320
has a sort of religious favour and gave me a certain satisfaction.

117
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,040
But then I came to the conclusion that there was nonsense, and I was left without any

118
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:58,440
satisfaction to it, to say to my desires, and to remain so.

119
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,160
So as far as that goes, philosophy proved to wash out to me, but not on the side of

120
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
the technical basis of mathematics.

121
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,880
Wasn't it about here that you entered into what you called a life of disagreements?

122
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes.

123
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I disagreed first with my people about both about mathematics and about philosophy.

124
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
They cared only about virtue.

125
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,080
They thought virtue was the only thing of importance in the world.

126
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,760
Mathematics therefore was unimportant because it has no ethical content, and philosophy

127
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,120
was positively pernicious because they thought it undermined virtue.

128
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,880
So on that point I had a strong disagreement with my people, but as regards that, of course,

129
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,920
that disagreement was, as far as my personal life was concerned, resolved by my living

130
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,560
among academic people who didn't take that view, so that I got again into a circle of

131
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,480
people whom I was quite at home.

132
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,440
But that was brought to an end by the First War, where I took a pacifist line, I was

133
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,680
against the First War.

134
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,760
I was not against the Second.

135
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,200
Some people think that this is an inconsistency, but it isn't.

136
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,960
I never, during the First War, said that I was against all war.

137
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,840
I said I was against that war, and I still hold that view, I think, that the First

138
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,720
War was a mistake, and I think England's participation in it was a mistake.

139
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,160
I think if that hadn't happened, you would not have had the Communists, you would not

140
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,920
have had the Nazis, you would have not had the Second World War, you would not have had

141
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
the threat of a Third.

142
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,920
The world would have been a very much better place, I think.

143
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,280
Germany, in the time of the Kaiser, was not uncivilized.

144
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:03,280
There was a certain amount of suppression of opinion, but less than there now is everywhere

145
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,280
except in England and Scandinavia.

146
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,000
So it really wasn't really bad.

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,600
If you propaganda purposes, the Kaiser's government was represented as truthful, but

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
they presented talk.

149
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
It wasn't really true.

150
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,400
Your opinions today in regard to Russia are not altogether friendly.

151
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,600
Did you always feel that way about the Bolsheviks?

152
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Yes, and that caused another violent disagreement.

153
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:39,520
Going to my pacifism during the First War, I'd become estranged from what you might call

154
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:50,200
conventional people, and then I went to Russia in 1920, and found that I dominated the Soviet

155
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
government.

156
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,720
They were dreadful people, dreadful people already, and becoming more so, sure to go

157
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
on becoming more so.

158
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,680
And so then I had to break with all the people who endured my pacifism, who all liked Russia

159
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,120
or thought they did, so that I was left in a very great isolation at that time.

160
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,080
However, I escaped some of the pain of it by going to China, where I spent a very happy

161
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
year.

162
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:28,200
I liked the Chinese very much, and there I found people that I could agree with that

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
I could like.

164
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Any conclusions about China?

165
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Oh, I don't know about conclusions.

166
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,040
I don't think I came to any particular conclusions.

167
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,040
I continued to think as I had thought before that democracy is the best form of government

168
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,000
where it will work.

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,760
It didn't work very well in China.

170
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,200
It wasn't working at all, and I could see that it wouldn't work there.

171
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:05,160
They hadn't the political experience, but I thought it would work there in time, and

172
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,680
I'd say it would have done if circumstances had been a little more propitious.

173
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,760
On your return, the focus of your interests changed, didn't it?

174
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:23,800
Yes, going to the birth of my two elder children, I became very much interested in education,

175
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:33,960
and at first, especially in education in the very early years, I didn't like the old-fashioned

176
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,360
schools for a number of reasons.

177
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,760
I didn't altogether like the progressive schools, though in some respects I thought

178
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,920
much better than the older ones, but there were some things about progressive schools,

179
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,840
at least about most progressive schools, that I didn't feel right.

180
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,400
I thought they didn't pay enough attention to instruction.

181
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,840
It seems to me that in our technically complex world, you can't play any important part unless

182
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,680
you have a very considerable amount of actual knowledge, and I don't think that most children

183
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,120
will acquire much knowledge unless there is a certain amount of discipline in school.

184
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,520
I think the degree of discipline required for acquiring knowledge ought to be insisted

185
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,880
upon and isn't sufficiently insisted upon in the good many modern schools that I know.

186
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,520
Did you change any of your opinions in that regard?

187
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:43,600
Well, I suppose to some degree I tried running a school of my own because I wasn't satisfied

188
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
with other schools.

189
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,320
I haven't the talents of an administrator, and I wasn't satisfied with the school that

190
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
I tried to run.

191
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,880
Fortunately, at just about that time, a certain modern school that I was interested in became,

192
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,720
I thought, quite good enough, and I was satisfied with that.

193
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,560
I have, I suppose, changed my opinions not only about education, but about a good many

194
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,480
things.

195
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:25,800
As a result of seeing the kind of nefarious things that people do, I think that freedom

196
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,120
is not a panacea for all things.

197
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,960
I think there are good many matters in which freedom should be restrained, some of them

198
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,480
things in which it's not sufficiently restrained at present.

199
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,000
In the relations between nations there ought to be less freedom than there is, I think.

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,480
And to some degree this applies in modern education too.

201
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,160
I think that some progressive schools certainly have more freedom than you ought to have.

202
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,400
There are some freedoms that I think are desirable in education.

203
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:06,120
Now, in the old-fashioned school, if a child uses a swear word, it's thought worse than

204
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,000
if he commits an unkind action, and that seems to be observed, and clearly the unkind action

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,560
matters more, and in that sort of way I don't like the old-fashioned way.

206
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,240
I also think that children should be free to explore the facts of life to a degree that

207
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,760
they are not brought up in an old-fashioned way.

208
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,160
I think there should be free speech.

209
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,280
There are a number of things that I like very much about modern education, but both in education

210
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:44,040
and in other matters, I think freedom must have very definite limitations where you come

211
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,480
to things that are definitely harmful to other people or things that prevent you yourself

212
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,400
from being useful, such as lack of knowledge.

213
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,640
So there are those respects in which, I suppose, I should lay less stress on freedom than in

214
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,120
former times.

215
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,040
Do you still believe in the importance of abstract philosophy?

216
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,480
Well, now that's a very difficult question.

217
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:18,000
I have myself a passion for clarity and exactness and sharp outlines for some reason that I've

218
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,600
never understood, which makes people think that I have no passions, that I'm a cold

219
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
fish.

220
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I don't know why, but it does cause people to think that.

221
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,680
I don't myself think that's altogether just, so that's neither here nor there.

222
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,360
But I do like clarity and exact thinking, and I believe that very important to mankind,

223
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,360
because when you allow yourself to think inexactly, your prejudices, your bias, your self-interest,

224
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,640
comes in in ways you don't notice, and you do bad things without knowing that you're

225
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
doing them.

226
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,080
Self-reception is very easy, so that I do think clear thinking, immensely important.

227
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,880
But I don't think philosophy, in the old-fashioned sense, is quite the thing the world needs

228
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
nowadays.

229
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I think it needs the world a different from there.

230
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Well, just what you feel today's needs are.

231
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Well, of course, the needs depend on what a person's capacities are.

232
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:35,640
But if I were now, at this moment, a young man, whether in England or in America, I

233
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,400
should not take to philosophy, I should think there were other things better to take to.

234
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,920
If I had the necessary capacity, I think I would be a physicist.

235
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:57,120
If my capacities didn't run in that direction, I should think that history, psychology, mass

236
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,480
psychology especially, theory of politics, things of that sort are much better worth

237
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,760
working at than pure philosophy.

238
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,120
And it's that sort of thing that I should take to if I were now young.

239
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,320
Lord Russell, what do you think the world needs to reach a happier state?

240
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,640
Well, I think there are three things that are needed.

241
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:28,120
If the world is to adapt itself to the industrial revolution, the troubles we are suffering now

242
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:35,840
are essentially troubles due to adapting ourselves to a new phase of human life, namely the industrial

243
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,960
phase.

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,720
And I think three things are necessary if people are to live happily in the industrial phase.

245
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,560
One of these is world government.

246
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:57,800
The second is an approximate economic equality between different parts of the world.

247
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:04,320
And the third is a nearly stationary population.

248
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,360
And I'd say a little about each of those.

249
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,960
As to world government, the world government should be, of course, a federal government

250
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,120
leaving a very great deal of freedom to the individual national governments.

251
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,960
And only those things controlled by the world government, which are absolutely necessary

252
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,520
for the avoidance of war.

253
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,400
The most important and the most difficult of these is armed forces.

254
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,880
All the important weapons of war will have to be in the hands of the international government

255
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,960
and the way to load them.

256
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,960
When that happens, war will become practically impossible.

257
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,280
And if war were impossible, mankind could go ahead.

258
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,880
If war is not impossible, every advance in scientific technique means an advance in

259
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,560
mass murder and is therefore undesirable.

260
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,440
But if one's world peace were achieved, it would be just the opposite.

261
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
That's the first point.

262
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,600
Now I come on to the question of approximate economic equality.

263
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:30,240
As things stand present, Western Europe and still more the United States of America have

264
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,600
a high standard of life.

265
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,280
On the whole, the great majority of mankind live fairly comfortably from a material point

266
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,480
of view.

267
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Asia, on the other hand, lives in very, very great poverty, so does most of Africa.

268
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:56,240
And the moment people are sufficiently educated to be aware of these facts, the inevitable

269
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,920
result is a great development of envy in the poorer parts of the world.

270
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:09,920
That envy is a cause of unrest and inevitably makes world peace precarious.

271
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,920
There's only one way of dealing with it, which is to produce approximate economic equality,

272
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,240
which of course is a long story, but it can be done.

273
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,240
The third point about population is very vital indeed.

274
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:34,240
The food supply of the world tends at present to diminish through the denuration of the

275
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
soil.

276
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,920
It tends of course also to increase through various technical advances, but those two

277
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,640
are about balance, so that on the whole food produce of the world does not increase appreciably.

278
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Now that means that unless everybody is to be very poor, especially if you have economic

279
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:02,120
equality, unless everybody is to be very poor, there must be not more people to be fed, not

280
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,280
many more than there are now, and therefore you've got to get approximate economic equality

281
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,120
of population and approximately stationary population, otherwise those parts of the world

282
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,760
where the population increases fast, we want to go to war with those where it increases

283
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,160
slowly.

284
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,840
That brings us precisely to the problem of Asia and what part Asia will play in the immediate

285
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
future.

286
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:41,880
Well, Asia first of all has risen to the point of education, some nations have, where it is

287
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,720
not prepared any longer to be subservient to the white man.

288
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,480
It hasn't noticed the Russians are white.

289
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,760
If it had, it would take a different line, but it seems to think the Russians are yellow

290
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,040
or black or some other color.

291
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,200
And I think our propaganda ought to be mainly devoted to saying only Russians also are white.

292
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,040
I believe that would be the effective propaganda to use in Asia, but I pass that point by.

293
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:20,160
Asia clearly is going to claim equality with the white man, and it's perfectly futile,

294
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,960
absolutely futile, for the white man to resist that claim.

295
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,120
It will infallibly win, infallibly, and we ought therefore to concede it graciously once

296
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,480
before we're driven to it.

297
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:42,200
You can see complete equality to Asia, but if Asia is not to overwhelm the rest of the

298
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:50,640
world with a vast land population and poverty, Asia must live up to its responsibilities

299
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,960
and must learn the sort of things we have learned in the West, which is how to maintain

300
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,560
a roughly stationary population.

301
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,880
And if they can't learn that, which I fully believe they can learn and learn quickly,

302
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,320
much more quickly than most people think, if they can't learn that, they will not have

303
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,160
won their claim to equality.

304
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,240
Lord Russell, speaking as of today, can you see the influence of any one philosopher more

305
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,720
than any other one?

306
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,080
Well, I suppose in recent years the most important influence has been Marx.

307
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,560
If you can dignify him with the name of philosopher, I should hardly like to dignify himself myself,

308
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,440
but I suppose he must count in the list, and he certainly has had more influence than anybody

309
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
else.

310
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,560
For those of us who reject Marx, can you offer any positive philosophy to help us toward

311
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,640
a more hopeful future?

312
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:55,800
Well, as to that, you see, I think one of the troubles of the world has been the habit

313
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,360
of dogmatically believing something or other.

314
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,280
And I think all these methods are full of doubt, and the rational man will not be too

315
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,200
sure that he's right.

316
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:15,720
I think that we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt.

317
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,400
I shouldn't wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine.

318
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Not even mine.

319
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,560
No, I think we should accept our philosophies as a measure of doubt.

320
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,960
What I do think is this, that if a philosophy is to bring happiness, it should be inspired

321
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,080
by kindly feeling.

322
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,920
Now Marx is not inspired by kindly feeling.

323
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,720
Marx pretended that he wanted the happiness of the proletariat, but he really wanted

324
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,120
the unhappiness of the bourgeoisie.

325
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,120
And it was because of that negative element, because of that hate element that his philosophy

326
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
produced disaster.

327
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,920
A philosophy which is to do good must be one inspired by kindly feeling, not by unkindly

328
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
feeling.

329
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,080
Coming up, Lord Russell, do you feel that there is hope for the world today?

330
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,480
Well, I do.

331
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,160
I feel it very strongly, but how far that is really a rational conviction, how far

332
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,800
it's temperamental, I can't say.

333
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,560
But I do most strongly feel that there is hope.

334
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:30,920
There may be very dreadful times ahead of us, I dare say there are, but I still believe,

335
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:39,560
I believe most firmly that through whatever pain, suffering, mankind will emerge from these

336
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,960
dreadful things and will emerge into some world that will be happier than any world

337
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,080
that has existed in the past.

338
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm firmly persuaded of that.

339
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,760
What I don't know is how long it will take.

340
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Thank you.

341
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Thank you.

349

360

361
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Bye.

362
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Bye.

363
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
