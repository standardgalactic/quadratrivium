0	4720	Yo, what is up, YouTube? Welcome back to my channel, Book Reviews with Moises.
4720	10480	So, for the book that we are going to be reviewing today, we are going to be reviewing The Mind is Flat,
10480	16480	a book in psychology and science. Usually, every book that I get, I love to go to my local Barnes & Noble
16480	22080	and browse and, you know, just see what book catches my eye and my attention.
22080	28720	What is this book about? And one of the biggest main ideas of this book kind of says it in the name,
28800	34720	The Mind is Flat. This book provides a sense of how shallow the mind can be, how
36480	42800	the mind is capable of creating fiction on the spot. I could be in this very spot creating
42800	49440	imaginative stories, fiction, something that isn't true, a prediction, an assumption, judgment.
49440	55600	The mind is more than capable of creating fiction through story. So, guys, let's take a look at
55600	61600	what's inside the book. So, there's actually part one and part two. Part one is more on a
61600	67440	scientific level and part two is more on the psychological level. Part one, the illusion of
67440	75280	mental depth. One, the power of invention. Two, the feeling of reality. Three, anatomy of a hoax.
75280	82720	Four, the inconstant imagination. Five, inventing feelings. Six, manufacturing choice.
82720	89040	Part two, the improvised mind. The cycle of thought. Eight, the narrow channel of consciousness.
89040	94080	Nine, the myth of unconscious thought. Ten, the boundary of consciousness.
94080	100480	Eleven, precedence, not principles. Twelve, the secret of intelligence and an epilogue,
100480	104400	reinventing ourselves. All right, guys. So, what do I like the most about this book?
104400	108320	My favorite part about this book is the main idea that I had referred to earlier. And that
108320	114240	main idea was basically how the mind is more than capable of creating stories that are essentially
114240	121920	fiction. It's almost not real. And I've heard this time and time again. The subconscious doesn't know
121920	128720	the difference between reality and imagination. Just think of the general human. How many stories
128720	134480	of fiction is the general human creating on a daily basis? How many of those stories are true?
134480	139440	This book really provided me a sense of psychological framework that I applied to my
140400	146880	sense of mindfulness. I'm able to acknowledge the voice and what the voice creates inside the mind.
146880	154240	And most of the time, the voice creates fiction. Whether it's an assumption, a prediction, judgment,
154880	161680	the mind is flat. The mind is more than capable of creating feelings, thought processes,
161680	167920	moods, emotions, moment by moment. Thoughts are created moment by moment. These thoughts,
167920	172640	all these thoughts come and go. Which one of these thoughts are true? Which one of these thoughts
172640	179360	are fiction? All right, guys. So, my favorite chapters, inventing feelings. Like we said earlier,
180000	187040	the mind is more than capable of creating thought process, fiction, stories, moment by moment.
187040	192080	Moment by moment. We're creating new thoughts. We're creating new stories. We're creating new
192080	199280	judgment, assumptions, predictions. We're more than capable of inventing feelings. I'm more than
199280	206800	convinced that each individual on this planet is more than capable of creating their reality.
206800	213840	I'm almost convinced that we're more than capable of inventing, inventing feelings. But I want to
213920	220160	say that most of the time, I'm the one creating those emotions through thought process, through
220800	227520	stimulus. That chapter really showcases the idea of how we really invent our emotions. We really,
227520	232800	I can't speak for everybody, but for me as the individual, I'm more than capable of creating
232800	240400	feelings. I can create emotion. For my next favorite chapter, manufacturing choice. This whole idea
240480	247440	of manufacturing choice, guys, is very not only important, but significant, how we have the power
247440	253760	to manufacture choice. We have the power to choose whether we want to choose to be happy
253760	260720	or whether we want to choose to be sad. Whether we want to choose to think a specific way or
260720	267360	whether we choose to act a specific way. Each individual has the power to manufacture choice.
267360	272000	And in this chapter, it explains how we can do that. But yeah, guys, those are definitely my
272000	277600	two favorite chapters. It really kind of opened up perspective on a psychological level for me.
277600	283760	For the rest of the book, it's a lot of science. So who should read this book? I recommend this
283760	288880	book to any kind of academic researcher, anybody who's studying psychology. I don't really recommend
288880	294720	this to anyone who is just like likes to read. I feel like this is more of like a research
294720	301280	book, almost in a sense of theory, which makes sense to my perception. Anybody that likes psychology,
301280	308080	I highly recommend this book. The mind is very improvised. Whether it's thought process, behavior,
308720	315120	emotions, mood, we create all of that moment by moment. Are you interested in reading this book?
