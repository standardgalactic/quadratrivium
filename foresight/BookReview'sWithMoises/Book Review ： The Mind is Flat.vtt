Yo, what is up, YouTube? Welcome back to my channel, Book Reviews with Moises.

00:04.720 --> 00:10.480
So, for the book that we are going to be reviewing today, we are going to be reviewing The Mind is Flat,

00:10.480 --> 00:16.480
a book in psychology and science. Usually, every book that I get, I love to go to my local Barnes & Noble

00:16.480 --> 00:22.080
and browse and, you know, just see what book catches my eye and my attention.

00:22.080 --> 00:28.720
What is this book about? And one of the biggest main ideas of this book kind of says it in the name,

00:28.800 --> 00:34.720
The Mind is Flat. This book provides a sense of how shallow the mind can be, how

00:36.480 --> 00:42.800
the mind is capable of creating fiction on the spot. I could be in this very spot creating

00:42.800 --> 00:49.440
imaginative stories, fiction, something that isn't true, a prediction, an assumption, judgment.

00:49.440 --> 00:55.600
The mind is more than capable of creating fiction through story. So, guys, let's take a look at

00:55.600 --> 01:01.600
what's inside the book. So, there's actually part one and part two. Part one is more on a

01:01.600 --> 01:07.440
scientific level and part two is more on the psychological level. Part one, the illusion of

01:07.440 --> 01:15.280
mental depth. One, the power of invention. Two, the feeling of reality. Three, anatomy of a hoax.

01:15.280 --> 01:22.720
Four, the inconstant imagination. Five, inventing feelings. Six, manufacturing choice.

01:22.720 --> 01:29.040
Part two, the improvised mind. The cycle of thought. Eight, the narrow channel of consciousness.

01:29.040 --> 01:34.080
Nine, the myth of unconscious thought. Ten, the boundary of consciousness.

01:34.080 --> 01:40.480
Eleven, precedence, not principles. Twelve, the secret of intelligence and an epilogue,

01:40.480 --> 01:44.400
reinventing ourselves. All right, guys. So, what do I like the most about this book?

01:44.400 --> 01:48.320
My favorite part about this book is the main idea that I had referred to earlier. And that

01:48.320 --> 01:54.240
main idea was basically how the mind is more than capable of creating stories that are essentially

01:54.240 --> 02:01.920
fiction. It's almost not real. And I've heard this time and time again. The subconscious doesn't know

02:01.920 --> 02:08.720
the difference between reality and imagination. Just think of the general human. How many stories

02:08.720 --> 02:14.480
of fiction is the general human creating on a daily basis? How many of those stories are true?

02:14.480 --> 02:19.440
This book really provided me a sense of psychological framework that I applied to my

02:20.400 --> 02:26.880
sense of mindfulness. I'm able to acknowledge the voice and what the voice creates inside the mind.

02:26.880 --> 02:34.240
And most of the time, the voice creates fiction. Whether it's an assumption, a prediction, judgment,

02:34.880 --> 02:41.680
the mind is flat. The mind is more than capable of creating feelings, thought processes,

02:41.680 --> 02:47.920
moods, emotions, moment by moment. Thoughts are created moment by moment. These thoughts,

02:47.920 --> 02:52.640
all these thoughts come and go. Which one of these thoughts are true? Which one of these thoughts

02:52.640 --> 02:59.360
are fiction? All right, guys. So, my favorite chapters, inventing feelings. Like we said earlier,

03:00.000 --> 03:07.040
the mind is more than capable of creating thought process, fiction, stories, moment by moment.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.080
Moment by moment. We're creating new thoughts. We're creating new stories. We're creating new

03:12.080 --> 03:19.280
judgment, assumptions, predictions. We're more than capable of inventing feelings. I'm more than

03:19.280 --> 03:26.800
convinced that each individual on this planet is more than capable of creating their reality.

03:26.800 --> 03:33.840
I'm almost convinced that we're more than capable of inventing, inventing feelings. But I want to

03:33.920 --> 03:40.160
say that most of the time, I'm the one creating those emotions through thought process, through

03:40.800 --> 03:47.520
stimulus. That chapter really showcases the idea of how we really invent our emotions. We really,

03:47.520 --> 03:52.800
I can't speak for everybody, but for me as the individual, I'm more than capable of creating

03:52.800 --> 04:00.400
feelings. I can create emotion. For my next favorite chapter, manufacturing choice. This whole idea

04:00.480 --> 04:07.440
of manufacturing choice, guys, is very not only important, but significant, how we have the power

04:07.440 --> 04:13.760
to manufacture choice. We have the power to choose whether we want to choose to be happy

04:13.760 --> 04:20.720
or whether we want to choose to be sad. Whether we want to choose to think a specific way or

04:20.720 --> 04:27.360
whether we choose to act a specific way. Each individual has the power to manufacture choice.

04:27.360 --> 04:32.000
And in this chapter, it explains how we can do that. But yeah, guys, those are definitely my

04:32.000 --> 04:37.600
two favorite chapters. It really kind of opened up perspective on a psychological level for me.

04:37.600 --> 04:43.760
For the rest of the book, it's a lot of science. So who should read this book? I recommend this

04:43.760 --> 04:48.880
book to any kind of academic researcher, anybody who's studying psychology. I don't really recommend

04:48.880 --> 04:54.720
this to anyone who is just like likes to read. I feel like this is more of like a research

04:54.720 --> 05:01.280
book, almost in a sense of theory, which makes sense to my perception. Anybody that likes psychology,

05:01.280 --> 05:08.080
I highly recommend this book. The mind is very improvised. Whether it's thought process, behavior,

05:08.720 --> 05:15.120
emotions, mood, we create all of that moment by moment. Are you interested in reading this book?

05:15.120 --> 05:20.400
