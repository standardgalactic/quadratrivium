1. **Identifying Data Issues**: If your model isn't performing well despite multiple iterations with different parameters, it might be a data issue rather than a model problem. To diagnose this, you can:
   - Validate a subset of the data to ensure high accuracy and then compare performance with the full dataset.
   - Use similar datasets where the model performs well but underperforms on your dataset, indicating potential data quality issues.
   - Manually inspect a sample of your data to identify any anomalies or inconsistencies that could affect model performance.

2. **Data Quality Checks**: It's important to regularly check the quality of your data, especially if you encounter unexpected results. Data quality issues can significantly impact model performance.

3. **Automated Data Ranking**: To efficiently identify problematic data points, it can be helpful to rank your dataset by quality before manual inspection, saving time and focusing on the most impactful data first.

4. **Next Steps**: The upcoming lectures will delve into label errors, how to find them, and training better models. These topics will be more technical but are expected to be exciting and valuable for course participants.

5. **Course Continuity**: Office hours continue to be available after each class, offering additional support and discussion opportunities. The course is designed to be engaging and beneficial, with a focus on practical application and problem-solving.
